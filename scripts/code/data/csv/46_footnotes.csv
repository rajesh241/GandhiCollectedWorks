libtech_284_footnote,"1Mahadev Desai explains here: “The 'bondage of action' in Gandhiji's note is the bondage of sansara, the cycle of death and birth. All action will have its consequences the consequences in one case, as we shall see, will be the bondage of sansara, in the other case it will be freedom from it.”"
libtech_285_footnote,"2Mahadev Desai explains: “Puraka practice consists in drawing the breath in and stopping all exhalation, i.e. in the language of shloka 29 'sacrificing the outward (called prana) in the inward (callled apana)'; rechaka practice consists in throwing the breath outward and stopping all inhalation, i.e. in the language of shloka 29, 'sacrificing the inward (apana) in the outward (prana)'; kumbhaka practice consists in checking the flow both ways and holding it in suspense either after an exhalation or inhalation.”"

libtech_297_footnote,"1Mahadev Desai explains: “We have had in the discourse a comparison of the jnanayogi or the philosophic mystic and the karmayogi or the active mystic. The shlokas v. 27-29 start a new comparison now…quite a parallel dichotomy as it evidences itself in the life of the devotee. Shloka 27-28 introduce to us the contemplative or meditative mystic…dhyanayogi…to be described in discourses VI, VII and VIII while shloka 29 describes the devotinal mystic, the bhaktiyogi who worships the Supreme in His one or many manifestations to  be  described  in discourses XI-XII. To him God appears or reveals Himself as the Accepter of all sacrifices and the Friend of all creation.”"
libtech_298_footnote,"1Mahadev Desai explains: “I have in my translation distinguished 'atman', the higher self, from the lower self, though it is not quite clear whether Gandhiji does so in his trnaslation. Atman is, really speaking, neither friend nor foe, but the lower self makes Him friend or foe, according as it strives to lift itself up to Him or drag itself down from Him. In order that the moral end of perfection may be fulfilled, the self has to look to Him as “the Goal, the Witness, the Refuge, the Friend” (XI. 18); but it often makes Him his enemy as mortal men know to their cost.”"
libtech_299_footnote,"1Mahadev Desai explains: “Gandhiji has summed up in his brief note the gist of this quatrain for those who will not bother about technical terms. A deeply spiritual friend has obliged me with an interpretation which lights up the apparent abracadabras with a deal of meaning: The shlokas describe the whole process in which the Absolute becomes conditioned and from the conditioned state becomes Absolute again. (1) We have form the Impersonal, Unmanifest, Unconditioned Absolute; (2) It chose to reveal one of Its aspects…that aspect was primordial unmanifest prakriti…here called adhyatma; (3) Prakriti next became active - this disturbance in the equilibrium of its gunas was karma work, action; (4) the next steps in the process were the countless manifestations of matter, with name and form…that is adhibhuta; (5) then the Absolute informed these with its Ego, i.e., became conditioned; that is adhidaiva; (6) but the conditioned had the potentiality to recover its pristine unconditioned state by means of giving of itself a pure sacrifice. The culmination of this self-sacrifice comes with the dissolution of the body and the merging or identification of the conditioned in the Unconditioned."

libtech_301_footnote,
libtech_302_footnote,"1Mahadev Desai explains: “This shloka should make it abundantly clear that all through in his exhortation to Arjuna to fight, it was not only the actual warfare in front of them that was meant, but the fight…moral and spiritual…that is man’s lot on earth. Cf. Jesus’ words: ‘Whosoever would come after me, let him renounce himself and take up his cross daily and follow me.’ It is the taking up one’s cross daily, at every moment, that is meant here. See also shloka 14. ‘Life is a perpetual striving. There is always a tempest raging in us, and struggle against temptation is a perpetual duty. The Gita says this in several places.’ “…Harijan, 8-7-'33"
