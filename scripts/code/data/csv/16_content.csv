1,,INDIAN COLONIAL EMIGRATION,"
       	I have carefully read the resolution issued at Simla by the 	Government of India on the 1st instant, embodying the report of the 	Inter-Departmental Conference recently held in London.libtech_1_footnotelibtech_2_footnoteIt 	will be remembered that this was the conference referred to in  the 	Viceregal speech of last year at the opening of the Sessions of the 	Viceregal Legislative Council. It will be remembered, too, that this 	was the conference which Sir James Meston and Sir S. P. Sinha were 	to have attended but were unable to attend owing to their having 	returned to India before the date of the meeting of the conference.libtech_3_footnoteIt is stated in the report under discussion that 	these gentlemen were to discuss the question of emigration to 	certain English colonies informally with the two Secretaries of 	State, i.e., the Secretary of State for India and the Secretary of 	State for the Colonies. Lord Islingtonlibtech_4_footnotelibtech_5_footnote, Sir   A.   Steel   Maitlandlibtech_6_footnotelibtech_7_footnoteand 	  Messrs   Setonlibtech_8_footnotelibtech_9_footnote,   Crindlelibtech_10_footnotelibtech_11_footnote,   Greenlibtech_12_footnoteand Macnaughtonlibtech_13_footnotelibtech_14_footnoteconstituted 	the Conference. To take the wording of the Resolution, this 	Conference sat “to consider the proposals for a new assisted 	system of emigration to British Guiana, Trinidad, Jamaica and Fiji”. 	The public should therefore note that this assisted emigration is to 	be confined only to the four Crown Colonies mentioned and not to the 	self-governing Colonies of South Africa, Canada or Australia, or the 	  Crown   Colony   of   Mauritius.libtech_15_footnotelibtech_16_footnoteWhat 	  follows   will   show   the importance of this distinction. It is 	something to be thankful for, that “the Government of India have 	not yet considered the report and reserved judgement on all the 	points raised in it”. This is as it should be on a matter so 	serious as this and one which only last year fairly              
 convulsed the whole of India and which has in one shape or another agitated the country since 1895.
 The declaration too that “His Majesty’s Government in agreement with the Government of India have decided that indentured emigration shall not be re-opened” is welcome as is also the one that “no free emigrantslibtech_17_footnotelibtech_18_footnotecan   be  introduced  into  any  colony  until  all Indian emigrants already there have been released from existing indentures”.
 In spite however of so much in the report that fills one with gladness, the substantive part of it which sets forth the scheme which is to replace indentured emigration is so far as one can judge, to say the least of it, disappointing. Stripped of all the phraseology under which the scheme has been veiled, it is nothing less than a system of indentured emigration no doubt on a more humane basis and safeguarded with some conditions beneficial to the emigrants taking advantage of it.
 The main point that should be borne in mind is that the conference sat designedly to consider a scheme of emigration not in the interests of the Indian labourer but in those of the Colonial employer. The new system therefore is devised to help the colonies concerned. India needs no outlet at any rate for the present moment for emigration outside the country. It is debatable whether in any event the four colonies will be the most suitable for Indian  colonisation. The best thing therefore that can happen from an Indian stand-point is that there should be no assisted emigration from India of any type whatsoever. In the absence of any such assistance, emigration will have to be entirely free and at the risk and expense of the emigrant himself. Past experience shows that, in that event, there will be very little voluntary emigration to distant colonies. In  the report, assisted emigration means, to use a mild expression, stimulated emigration; and surely with the industries of India crying out for labour and with her legitimate resources yet undeveloped, it  is  madness to think of providing a stimulus for the stay-at-home Indian to go out of India. Neither the Government nor any voluntary agency has been found capable of protecting from ill-usage the Indian who emigrates either to Burma or Ceylon, much less can any  such protection avail in far-off Fiji or then three other colonies. I hope that
 
 leaders of public opinion in India will therefore take their stand on the one impregnable rock of not wanting any emigration whatsoever to the colonies. It might be argued that we, as a component part of the Empire, are bound to consider the wants of our partners, but this would not be a fair plea to advance so long as India stands in need of all the labour she can produce. If, therefore, India does not assist the colonies, it is not because of want of will, but it is due to want of ability. An additional reason a politician would be justified in using is that, so long as India does not in reality occupy the position of an equal partner with the colonies and so long as her sons continue to be regarded by Englishmen in the colonies and English employers even nearer home to be fit only as hewers of wood and drawers of water, no scheme of emigration to the colonies can be morally advantageous to Indian emigrants. If the badge of inferiority is always to be worn by them, they can never rise to their full status  and  any  material advantage they will gain by emigrating can therefore be of no consideration.
But let us for the moment consider the new system.
 The system to be followed in future will be one of aided emigrationlibtech_19_footnoteand its object will be to encourage the settlement of Indians in certain colonies after a probationary period of employment in those colonies to train and fit them for life and work there and at the same time to acquirelibtech_20_footnotea supply of the labour essential to the well-being of the colonistslibtech_21_footnotethemselves.
 So the re-settlement is to be conditional on  previous employment under contract and it will be seen in the course of our examination that this contract is to be just as binding as the contracts used to be under indenture. The report has the following humorous passage in it:
 He will be in no way restricted to service under any particular employer except that for his own protection a selected employer will be chosen for him for the first six months.
This has a flavour of the old indentured system. One of the evils
 complained of about that system was that the labourer was assigned to an employer. He was not free to choose one himself. Under the new system,  the  employer  is  to  be  selected   for   the   protection   of  the
 
 labourer. It is hardly necessary for me to point out that the would-be labourer will never be able to feel the protection devised for him.
The labourer is further
 to be encouraged to work for his first three years in agricultural industries by the offer, should he do so, of numerous and important benefits subsequently as a colonist.
This is another inducement to indenture and I know enough of
 such schemes to be able to assure both the Government and the public that these so-called inducements in the hands of clever manipulators become nothing short of methods of compulsion in respect of innocent and ignorant Indian labourers. It is due to the framers of the scheme that I should draw attention to the fact that they have avoided all criminal penalties for breach of contract. In India itself if the scheme is adopted, we are promised a revival of the much-dreaded depots and emigration agents, all no doubt on a more respectable basis, but still of the same type and capable of untold mischief.
 The rest of the report is not likely to interest the public, but those who wish to study it will, I doubt not, come to the conclusion to which I have been driven, that the framers have done their best to strip the old system of many of the abuses which had crept into it, but they have not succeeded in placing before the Indian public an acceptable scheme. I hold that it was an impossible task. The system of indenture was one of temporary slavery; it was incapable of being amended, it should only be ended and it is to be hoped that India will never consent to its revival in any shape or form.

3,"September 2, 1917",SPEECH AT BOMBAY PROVINCIAL CONGRESS COMMITTEE MEETING,"
  
 September 2, 1917
 A heated discussion took place.   M. K. Gandhi, on being asked, stated that   the campaign of passive resistance could not be carried on by an institution like the Congress. Passive resistance could be described merely as a matter of conscience or force of soul, when it was useless to go to lawyers.
 
 After Gandhi had delivered his opinion, it was suggested that B. G. Tilak should, after consultation with Gandhi, suggest to the meeting some acceptable amendment. On this Gandhi himself suggested an amendment but Tilak insisted on making his own alterations in it before placing it before the meeting. The
 President, after some discussion with Tilak and his party, declared that a certain amendment had been drawn up in agreement with Tilak and his party. The amendment was as follows:
 ‘Though the Bombay Provincial Congress Committee is of opinion that there is a strong feeling among the people to support the campaign of passive resistance on account of the coercive measures recently taken by the Government, it advises that, taking into consideration the fact that Mr. Montagulibtech_26_footnoteis coming on a visit to this country and that the reasons of his coming are well known, the work of the consideration of and giving opinion on the principles underlying passive resistance and the measures necessary to put them into effect, which has been entrusted to this committee by the All-India Congress Committee and the Council of the All-India Muslim League, be for the present held in abeyance, and the meeting expresses the hope that the Government will take the necessary steps to allay the bitter feeling aroused among the people by action of internments and coercive measures taken by the authorities. This course will enable the Secretary of state to fulfil the work entrusted to him under normal conditions.’
 . . . it was unanimously passed amidst cheers. . . .

4,"September 2, 1917",LETTER TO SHANKARLAL ON ‘IDEAS ABOUT SATYAGRAHA’,"
  
     BHAISHRI 	SHANKARLAL,  [September 2, 1917]libtech_27_footnote 
   brief: You 	want to know my ideas about satyagraha. Here they are in   The English phrase 	“passive resistance” does not suggest the 
  	power I wish to write about; “satyagraha”  is the right word. 	Satyagraha is soul-force, as opposed to armed strength. Since it is 	essentially an ethical weapon, only men inclined to the ethical way 	of life can use it wisely. Prahlad, Mirabai, and others were 	satyagrahis. At     
 the time of the Morocco fighting, the Arabs were under fire from French guns. The Arabs were fighting, as they believed, solely for their religion. Reckless of their lives, they advanced running towards the French guns with cries of “Ya Allah”libtech_28_footnotelibtech_29_footnote. Here, there was no scope at all for fighting back to kill. The French gunners refused to fire on these Arabs and, throwing up their caps, ran to embrace these brave Arabs with shouts of joy. This is an example of satyagraha and the success it can achieve. The Arabs were not satyagrahis by deliberate choice. They got ready to face death under pressure of a strong impulse, and had no love in their hearts. A satyagrahi bears no ill-will, does not lay down his life in anger, but refuses rather to submit to his “enemy” or oppressor because he has the strength himself to suffer. He should, therefore, have a courageous spirit and a forgiving and compassionate nature. Imam Hassanlibtech_30_footnoteand Hussainlibtech_31_footnotelibtech_32_footnotewere merely two boys. They felt that an injustice had been done to them. When called upon to surrender, they refused. They knew at the time that this would mean death for them. If, however, they were to submit to injustices they would disgrace their manhood and betray their religion. In these circumstances, they yielded to the embrace of death. The heads of these fine young men rolled on the battlefield. In my view, Islam did not attain its greatness by the power of the sword but entirely through the self-immolation of its fakirs. It is soldierlike to allow oneself to be cut down by a sword, not to use the sword on another. When he comes to realize that he is guilty of murder, the killer, if he has been in the wrong, will feel sorry forever afterwards. The victim, however, will have gained nothing but victory even if he had acted wrongly in courting death. Satyagraha is the way of non-violence. It is, therefore, justified, indeed it is the right course, at all times and all places. The power of arms is violence and condemned as such in all religions. Even those who advocate the use of arms put various limits on it. There are no limits on satyagraha, or rather, none except those placed by the satyagrahi’s capacity for tapascharya, for voluntary suffering.
 Obviously, it is irrelevant to raise issues about the legality of such satyagraha. It is for the satyagrahi to decide. Observers may
 
 judge satyagraha after the event. The world’s displeasure will  not  deter a satyagrahi. Whether or not satyagraha should be started is not decided by any mathematical rule. A man who believes  that satyagraha may be started only after weighing the chances of defeat and victory and assuring oneself of the certainty of victory, may be a shrewd enough politician or an intelligent man, but he is no satyagrahi. A satyagrahi acts spontaneously.
 Satyagraha and arms have both been in use from time im- memorial. We find them praised in the extant scriptures. They are the expressions, one of the daivi sampadlibtech_33_footnoteand the other of the asuri sampadlibtech_34_footnote.  We believe that in former times in India the  daivi sampad was much the stronger of the two. Even today that is the ideal we cherish. Europe provides the most striking example of the predominance of the asuri sampad.
 Both these forms of strength are preferable to weakness, to what we know by the rather plain but much apter word ‘cowardice’. Without either, swaraj or genuine popular awakening is impossible. Swaraj achieved otherwise than through resort to one or the other will not be true swaraj. Such swaraj can have no effect on the people. Popular awakening cannot be brought about without strength, without manliness. Let the leaders say what they like and the Government strive its utmost, unless they and we, all of us, strengthen the forces of satyagraha, the methods of violence are bound automatically to gain ascendancy. They are like weeds which grow wild in any soil. The crop of satyagraha requires willingness to exert oneself or a venturesome spirit by way of manure. Just as, moreover, the seedlings are likely to be lost among the weeds if the latter are not plucked out, so also will weeds of violence keep growing unless we keep the land free of them by tapascharya and, with compassion, pluck out those which have already grown. We can, with the help of satyagraha, win over those young men who have been driven to desperation and anger by what they think to be the tyranny of the Government and utilize their courage and their mettlesome spirit, their capacity for suffering, to strengthen the daivi sampad of satyagraha. It is therefore very much to be desired that satyagraha is propagated as quickly as can be. This is in the interest both of the rulers and the ruled. The satyagrahi desires to harass neither the Government nor anyone else. He takes no step without the fullest deliberation. He is never arrogant.
 
 Consequently, he will keep away from ‘boycott’ but be always firm in the vow of swadeshi as a matter of duty. He fears God alone, so that no other power can intimidate him. He will never, out of fear of punishment, leave a duty undone.
 I need hardly say now that it is our duty to resort to satyagraha to secure the release of the learned Annie Bai and her co-workers. Whether we approve of every or any action of hers is another question. I, for one, certainly do not approve of some of them; all the same, her incarceration by the Government is a great mistake and an act of injustice. I know, of course, that the Government does not think it a mistake. Maybe the people are wrong in desiring her release. The Government has acted according to its lights. What can the people do to express their outraged feelings? Petitions, etc., are good enough when one’s suffering is bearable. When it is unbearable, there is no remedy but satyagraha. Only when people find it unbearable will they, and only those who find it unbearable will, devote their all, body, mind and possessions, to securing the release of Annie Bai. This will be a powerful expression of popular feeling. It is my unshakable faith that before so great a self-sacrifice even the power of an emperor will give way. People may certainly restrain their feelings in view of the forthcoming visit of Mr. Montagu. That will be an expression of faith in his sense of justice. If she is not released, however, before  his arrival, it will be our duty to resort to satyagraha. We do not want to provoke the Government or put difficulties in its way. By resorting to satyagraha, we reveal the intensity of our injured feelings and thereby serve the Government.

5,"September 2, 1917","SATYAGRAHA—NOT PASSIVE
RESISTANCElibtech_35_footnote","
  
 [About September 2, 1917]libtech_36_footnote
 The force denoted by the term ‘passive resistance’  and translated into Hindi as nishkriya pratirodha is not very accurately described either by the original English phrase or by its Hindi rendering. Its correct description is ‘satyagraha’. Satyagraha was born in South Africa in 1908. There was no word in any Indian language
 
 denoting the power which our countrymen in South Africa invoked for the redress of their grievances. There was an English equivalent, namely, ‘passive resistance’, and we carried on with it. However, the need for a word to describe this unique power came to be increasingly felt, and it was decided to award a prize to anyone who could think of an appropriate term. A Gujarati-speakinglibtech_37_footnotegentleman  submitted  the word ‘satyagraha’, and it was adjudged the best.
 ‘Passive resistance’ conveyed the idea of the Suffragette Movement in England. Burning of houses by these women was called ‘passive resistance’ and so also their fasting in prison. All such acts might very well be ‘passive resistance’ but  they were  not ‘satyagraha’. It is said of ‘passive resistance’ that it is the weapon of the weak, but the power which is the subject of this article can be used only by the strong. This power is not ‘passive’ resistance; indeed it calls for intense activity. The movement in South Africa was  not passive but active. The Indians of South Africa believed that Truth was their object, that Truth ever triumphs, and with this definiteness of purpose they persistently held on to Truth. They put up with all the suffering that this persistence implied. With the conviction that Truth is not to be renounced even unto death, they shed the fear of death. In the cause of Truth, the prison was a palace to them and its doors the gateway to freedom.
 WHAT IS SATYAGRAHA?
 Satyagraha is not physical force. A satyagrahi does not inflict pain on the adversary; he does not seek his destruction. A satyagrahi never resorts to firearms. In the use of satyagraha, there is no ill-will whatever.
 Satyagraha is pure soul-force. Truth is the very substance of the soul. That is why this force is called satyagraha. The soul is informed with knowledge. In it burns the flame of love. If someone gives us pain through ignorance, we shall win him through love. “Nonviolence is  the   supreme   dharma”libtech_38_footnoteis   the   proof   of   this   power   of   love. Non-violence is a dormant state. In the waking state, it is love. Ruled by love, the world goes on. In English there is a saying, “Might is Right”. Then there is the doctrine of the survival of the fittest. Both these ideas are contradictory to the above principle. Neither is wholly
 
 true. If ill-will were the chief motive-force, the world would have been destroyed long ago; and neither would I have had the opportunity to write this article nor would the hopes of the readers be fulfilled. We are alive solely because of love. We are all ourselves the proof of this. Deluded by modern western civilization, we have  forgotten  our ancient civilization and worship the might of arms.
 WORSHIP OF ARMED MIGHT
 We forget the principle of non-violence, which is the essence of all religions. The doctrine of arms stands for irreligion. It is due to the sway of that doctrine that a sanguinary war is raging in Europe.
 In India also we find worship of arms. We see it even in that great work of Tulsidas. But it is seen in all the books that soul-force is the supreme power.
 RAMA AND RAVANA
 Rama stands for the soul and Ravana for the non-soul. The immense physical might of Ravana is as nothing compared to the soul-force of Rama. Ravana’s ten heads are as straw to Rama. Rama is  a yogi, he has conquered self and pride. He is “placid equally in affluence and adversity”, he has “neither attachment, nor greed nor the intoxication of status”. This represents the ultimate in satyagraha. The banner of saytagraha can again fly in the Indian sky and it is our duty to raise it. If we take recourse to satyagraha, we can conquer our conquerors the English, make them bow before our tremendous soul-force, and the issue will be of benefit to the whole world.
 It is certain that India cannot rival Britain or Europe in force of arms. The British worship the war-god and they can all of them become, as they are becoming, bearers of arms. The hundreds of millions in India can never carry arms. They have made the religion of non-violence their own. It is impossible for the varnashram system to disappear from India.
 WAY OF VARNASHRAM
 The way of varnashram is a necessary law of nature. India, by making a judicious use of it, derives much benefit. Even the Muslims and the English in India observe this system to some extent. Outside of India, too, people follow it without being aware of it. So long as this institution of varnashram exists in India, everyone cannot bear arms here. The highest place in India is assigned to the brahmana dharma—which is soul-force. Even the armed warrior does obeisance to the brahmin. So long as this custom prevails, it is vain for us to aspire for equality with the West in force of arms.
 PANACEA FOR ALL ILLS
 It is our kamadhenulibtech_39_footnotelibtech_40_footnote. It brings good both to the satyagrahi and his adversary. It is ever victorious. For instance, Harishchandra was  a satyagrahi, Prahlad was a satyagrahi, Mirabai was a satyagrahi. Daniel, Socrates and those Arabs who hurled themselves on the fire of the French artillery were all satyagrahis. We see from these examples that a satyagrahi does not fear for his body, he does not give up what he thinks is Truth; the word ‘defeat’ is not to be found in his dictionary, he does not wish for the destruction of his antagonist, he does not vent anger on him; but has only compassion for him.
 A satyagrahi does not wait for others, but throws himself into the fray, relying entirely on his own resources. He trusts that when the time comes, others will do likewise. His practice is his precept. Like air, satyagraha is all-pervading. It is infectious, which means that all people—big and small, men and women—can become satyagrahis. No one is kept out from the army of satyagrahis. A satyagrahi cannot perpetrate tyranny on anyone; he is not subdued through application of physical force; he does not strike at anyone. Just as anyone can resort to satyagraha, it can be resorted to in almost any situation.
 HISTORICAL EVIDENCE
 People demand historical evidence in support of satyagraha. History is for the most part a record of armed activities. Natural activities find very little mention in it. Only uncommon activities strike us with wonder. Satyagraha has been used always and in all situations. The father and the son, the man and the wife are perpetually resorting to satyagraha, one towards the other. When a father gets angry and punishes the son, the son does not hit back with a weapon, he conquers his father’s anger by submitting to him. The son refuses to be subdued by the unjust rule of his father but he puts up with the punishment that he may incur through disobeying the unjust father. We can similarly free ourselves of the unjust rule of the Government by defying the unjust rule and accepting the punishments that go with it. We do not bear malice towards the Government. When we set its fears at rest, when we do not desire to make armed assaults on the administrators, nor to unseat them from power, but only to get rid of their injustice, they will at once be subdued to our will.
 
 
 The question is asked why we should call any rule unjust. In saying so, we ourselves assume the function of a judge. It is true. But in this world, we always have to act as judges for ourselves. That is why the satyagrahi does not strike his adversary with arms. If he has Truth on his side, he will win, and if his thought is faulty, he will suffer the consequences of his fault.
 What is the good, they ask, of only one person opposing injustice; for he will be punished and destroyed, he will languish in prison or meet an untimely end through hanging. The objection is not valid. History shows that all reforms have begun with one person. Fruit is hard to come by without tapasya. The suffering that has to be undergone in satyagraha is tapasya in its purest form. Only when the tapasya is capable of bearing fruit, do we have the fruit. This establishes the fact that when there is insufficient tapasya, the fruit is delayed. The tapasya of Jesus Christ, boundless though it was, was not sufficient for Europe’s need. Europe  has  disapproved  Christ. Through ignorance, it has disregarded Christ’s pure way of life. Many Christs will have to offer themselves as sacrifice at the terrible altar of Europe, and only then will realization dawn on that continent. But Jesus will always be the first among these. He has been the sower of the seed and his will therefore be the credit for raising the harvest.
 EDUCATING IGNORANT PEASANTS IN SATYAGRAHA
 It is said that it is a very difficult, if not an altogether impossible, task to educate ignorant peasants in satyagraha and that it is full of perils, for it is a very arduous business to  transform  unlettered ignorant people from one condition into another. Both the arguments are just silly. The people of India are perfectly fit to receive the training of satyagraha. India has knowledge of dharma, and where there is knowledge of dharma, satyagraha is a very simple matter. The people of India have drunk of the nectar of devotion. This great people overflows with faith. It is no difficult matter to lead such a people on to the right path of satyagraha. Some have a fear that once people get involved in satyagraha, they may at a later stage take to arms. This fear is illusory. From the path of satyagraha [clinging to Truth], a transition to the path of a-satyagraha [clinging to untruth] is impossible. It is possible of course that some people who believe in armed activity may mislead the satyagrahis by infiltrating into their ranks and later making them take to arms. This is possible in all enterprises. But as compared to other activities, it is less likely to
 happen in satyagraha, for their motives soon get exposed and when the people are not ready to take up arms, it  becomes  almost impossible to lead them on to that terrible path. The might of arms is directly opposed to the might of satyagraha. Just as darkness does not abide in light, soulless armed activity cannot enter the sunlike radiance of soul-force. Many Pathans took part in satyagraha in South Africa abiding by all the rules of satyagraha.
 Then it is said that much suffering is involved in being a sat- yagrahi and that the entire people will not be willing to put upwith this suffering. The objection is not valid. People in general always follow in the footsteps of the noble. There is no doubt that it is difficult to produce a satyagrahi leader. Our experience is that a satyagrahi needs many more virtues like self-control, fearlessness, etc.,  than  are requisite for one who believes in armed action. The greatness of the man bearing arms does not lie in the superiority of the arms, nor does it lie in his physical prowess. It lies in his determination and fearlessness in face of death. General Gordon was a mighty warrior of the British Empire. In the statue that has been erected in his memory he has only a small baton in his hand. It goes to show that the strength of a warrior is not measured by reference to his weapons but by his firmness of mind. A satyagrahi needs millions of times more of such firmness than does a bearer of arms. The birth of such a man can bring about the salvation of India in no time. Not only India but the whole world awaits the advent of such a man. We may in the  meanwhile prepare the ground as much as we can through satyagraha.
 USE OF SATYAGRAHA
 
 How can we make use of satyagraha in the present conditions? Why should we take to satyagraha in the fight for freedom? We are all guilty of killing manliness. So long as our learned Annie Besant is in detention, it is an insult to our manhood. How can we secure her release through satyagraha? It may be that the Government has acted in good faith, that it has sufficient grounds for keeping her under detention. But, at any rate, the people are unhappy at her being deprived of her freedom. Annie Besant cannot be freed  through armed action. No Indian will approve of such an action. We cannot secure her freedom by submitting petitions and the like. Much time has passed. We can all humbly inform the Government that if Mrs. Annie Besant is not released within the time limit prescribed by us, we
 will all be compelled to follow her path. It is possible that all of us do not like all her actions; but we find nothing in her actions which threatens   the   “established   Government”libtech_41_footnoteor   the   vested   interests. Therefore we too by participating in her activities will ask for her lot, that is, we shall all court imprisonment. The members of our Legislative Assembly also can petition the Government and when the petition is not accepted, they can resign their membership.For swaraj also, sat-yagraha is the unfailing weapon. Satyagraha means that what we want is truth, that we deserve it and that we will work for it even untodeath.
 Nothing more need be said. Truth alone triumphs. There is no dharma higher than Truth. Truth always wins. We pray to God that in this sacred land we may bring about the reign of dharma by following satyagraha and that this our country may become an example for all to follow.

6,"September 	5, 1917",LETTER TO ESTHER FAERING,"

     MY 	DEAR ESTHER,  September 	6, 1917 
  	I was delighted to receive your note. I hope to be in Madras for  a 	day only on the 14th instant. I shall have to leave on the 15th 	instant in the evening.  	Ever since my arrival here, I have been on the move trying to spread 	the gospel of satyagraha in the place of methods of violence. It is 	an uphill task. You will see from the enclosed what I mean by 	satyagraha. It 	was not my intention that your remarks upon dress     
 should be published. I forgot to warn Dr. M. about it. He liked your views so much that he could not restrain himself. I do hope you  don’t mind my sending to Dr. M. such of your letters as may appear to be helpful.
 ‘To be free from desire’ is a technical expression and means desire to be or possess something short of the highest. Thus, love of God is not ‘a desire’. It is the natural longing. But to possess a  fortune so that I may do good is a desire and therefore to be curbed. Our good acts must be as natural to us as the twinkling of our eyes. Without our desiring, they act automatically. The doing of good  should be just as natural to us."

 [Before September 13, 1917]
 Mr. Gandhi also devised the following rules for the Volunteers to obtain signatures:
 In taking signatures to the petition, first it must be ascertained 
 whether    the    person   signing  correctly   understands	the	scheme described in the petition or not.
  In 	order to 	make people 	understand the scheme, 	it should 	be read 	out to the inhabitants 	of the 	place, called together by  a 	notification prepared by 	the Sabha. 	If in such 	reading the 	people raise 	any new question, 	which cannot be 	answered out 	of the 	Foreword, then the 	Volunteer should 	not decide 	the point 	himself but should 	refer it to the 	Chief of 	his own Circle; 	and the questioner 	should not 	be allowed to sign so long as he has not been satisfied.  It 	should be 	clearly kept in 	mind that no 	kind of 	pressure is 	to be used 	on any 	inhabitant of 	any place. Care 	should be taken 	that Government servants, as 	also people 
 
 who are unable to understand, do not sign by oversight.
  Signatures 	should not 	be taken 	from young 	people, who appear 	to be under 	the age of eighteen.  Signatures 	should not 	be taken 	from school-going 	students, whatever 	their age may be.  There 	is no objection 	in taking 	signatures from 	any man or woman 	if the 	Volunteer is 	convinced that he 	or she can understand 	the matter.  A 	man or 	woman, who 	is unable 	to read 	or write, 	should be made to 	put his or 	her cross 	and an 	authentication of 	it by a well- known person of the place should be placed opposite the cross.  It 	should be 	kept in 	mind that each signature 	is to be taken 	on two forms.  The 	papers should be 	preserved without 	being soiled 	or crumpled.  The 	papers which are 	not signed should at 	once be 	sent to 	the Head 	Office; and 	a report 	should at once 	be sent 	to the Head Office 	from the place 	where a meeting 	has been held or 	some attempt 	made.  The 	Volunteer has 	no authority 	to make 	any speech 	on any 	subject outside the 	scope of petition 	or on any 	subject relating to 	but not 	included in 	the Foreword.  First 	the inhabitants 	of a place 	should be called 	together and the 	Foreword read out 	to them 	and their 	signatures taken. After that as 	many houses 	as can as be practicable 	should be 	visited and the 	signatures of 	the rest 	of the 	men and women taken. But 	these should be 	taken only after the 	Foreword has 	been explained.  If 	while visiting places or 	calling together people, 	the police 	or any 	other officials object, 	the Volunteer 	should politely reply 	that so 	long as 	the Head 	Office does not direct 	the cessation 	of work, 	he would 	have to continue 	his work. 	If in doing 	this, he is arrested 	by the 	police, he 	should allow himself to 	be arrested, but 	he should 	not resist 	the police. 	And if 	such a 	thing happens, 	he should 	at once 	send a detailed 	report to 	the Head 	Office. If people 	themselves hesitate to 	gather together 	through the fear 	of the 	police or 	for any other 	cause, the 	Volunteer should give 	up that 	place and 	should at once 	give information 	of such 	an occurrence 	to the 	Head Office.

 [Before September 16, 1917]
 
DEAR SATYANAND BABU,
 Mr. Polak had sent me your letter of inquiry about Passive Resistance. I have time only to give you the briefest reply to your questions. P. R., as conceived by me, is soul force, and essentially a religious principle. Its scope, therefore, takes in every  variety  of wrong. It is a force as old as the world itself. Consider the conduct of Prahlad, Daniel, Jesus, Mirabai and others whose guiding principle in life has been religion. Indians in South Africa made use, more or less, of this force, and they were successful only to the extent that they used it to the exclusion of every other force.
 From whom did the idea first originate, is your second question. In view of the meaning I have given to the expression, no reply seems to be necessary. But it may be stated that so far as its use on the political platform is concerned, the idea may be  said  to  have originated with me. I knew nothing of it, but Tolstoy drew my attention to it.
 At the time of the Controversy on the  Education Bill passed by the House of Commons and the so-called Passive Resistance      offered      by   Dr.   Cliffordlibtech_51_footnotelibtech_52_footnoteand   others,   Mr.   Winston
 
 Churchilllibtech_53_footnotesaid that P. R. was perfectly constitutional under the British Constitution. A similar pronouncement was made by Gen. Smuts, with regard to our Passive Resistance when demand was made by Senator Whiteside for my deportation side by side with that of the nine Englishmen who were deported in connection with the European Railway strike that had just then ended.
 I am unable, offhand, to give any reference from a constitu- tional lawyer.libtech_54_footnote
 Your fifth question requires historical precedents. This is answered in para. 2.
 Your sixth question, whether it comes within constitutional methods needs no answer. I am sorry for the delay that has taken place in replying. I am in Ahmedabad up to the 16th September, then prepare to leave for Bihar.

15,,THE MORAL BASIS OF CO-OPERATIONlibtech_55_footnote,"
    
 The only claim I have on your indulgence is that some months ago I attended with Mr. Ewbank a meeting of mill-hands to whom he  wanted  to  explain  the   principles   of   co-operation.   The   chawllibtech_56_footnotein which they were living was as filthy as it well could be. Recent rains had made matters worse. And I must frankly confess that had not it been for Mr. Ewbank’s great zeal for the cause he has made his own, I should have shirked the task. But there we were, seated on a fairly worn out  charpailibtech_57_footnotelibtech_58_footnote,  surrounded by men, women and children. Mr. Ewbank opened fire on a man who had put himself forward and who wore not a particularly innocent countenance. After he had engaged him and the other people about him in Gujarati conversation,
 
 “4. Did any constitutional lawyer deal with the subject? (Quote references) “5. Quote instances of passive resistance from history. . .”
 he wanted me to speak to the people. Owing to the suspicious looks of the man who was first spoken to, I naturally pressed home the moralities of co-operation. I fancy that Mr. Ewbank rather liked the manner in which I handled the subject. Hence, I believe, his kind invitation to me to tax your patience for a few moments upon a consideration of co-operation from a moral standpoint.
 My knowledge of the technicality of co-operation is next to nothing. My brother Devdhar has made the subject his own. Whatever he does naturally attracts me and predisposes me to think that there must be something good in it and the handling of it must be fairly difficult. Mr. Ewbank very kindly placed at my disposal some literature too on the subject. And I have had a unique opportunity of watching the effect of some co-operative effort in Champaran. I have gone through Mr. Ewbank’s ten main points which are like the commandments, and I have gone through the twelve points of Mr. Collins of Behar, which remind me of the law of the twelve tables. There are so-called agricultural banks in Champaran. They were to me disappointing efforts, if they were meant to be demonstrations of the success of co-operation. On the other hand, there is quiet work in the same direction being done by Mr. Hodge, a missionary whose efforts are leaving their impression on those who come in contact with him. Mr. Hodge is a co-operative enthusiast and probably considers that the results which he sees flowing from his efforts are due to the working of co-operation. I who was able to watch the two efforts had no hesitation in inferring that the personal equation counted  for success in the one and failure in the other instance.
 I am an enthusiast myself, but twenty-five years  of experimenting and experience have made me a cautious and discriminating enthusiast. Workers in a cause necessarily, though quite unconsciously, exaggerate its merits and often succeed in turning its very defects into advantages. In spite of my caution I consider the little institutionlibtech_59_footnotelibtech_60_footnoteI am conducting in Ahmedabad as the finest thing in the world. It alone gives me sufficient inspiration. Critics tell me that it represents a soulless soul-force and that its severe discipline has made it merely mechanical. I suppose both—the critics and I—are wrong. It is, at best, a humble attempt to place at the disposal of the nation a home where men and women may have scope for free and unfettered development of character, in keeping with the national genius, and if
 
 its controllers do not take care, the discipline that is the foundation of character, may frustrate the very end in view. I would venture,  therefore, to warn enthusiasts in co-operation against entertaining false hopes.
 With Sir Daniel Hamilton, it has become a religion. On the 13th January last, he addressed the students of the Scottish Churches College, and in order to point a moral he instanced Scotland’s poverty of two hundred years ago and showed how that great country was raised from a condition of poverty to plenty. He said:
 There were two powers which raised her—the Scottish Church and the Scottish banks. The Church manufactured the men and the banks manufactured the money to give the men a start in life. The Church disciplined the nation in the fear of God
 which is the beginning of wisdom and in the parish schools of the Church, the children learned that the chief end of man’s life was to glorify God and to enjoy Him for ever. Men were trained to believe in God and in themselves,  and  on  the trustworthy character so created, the Scottish banking system was built.
Sir Daniel then shows that it was possible to build up the
 marvellous Scottish banking system only on the character so built. So far there can only be perfect agreement with Sir Daniel, for ‘Without character there is no co-operation’ is a sound maxim. But he would have us go much further. He thus waxes eloquent on co-operation:
 Whatever may be your day-dreams of India’s future, never forget this that it is to weld India into one, and so enable her to take her rightful place in the world, that the British Government is here; and the welding hammer in the hand of  the Government is the co-operative movement.
In his opinion, it is the panacea of all the evils that afflict India
 at the present moment. In its extended sense it can justify the claim on one condition which need not be mentioned here; in the limited sense in which Sir Daniel has used it, I venture to think, it is an enthusiast’s exaggeration. Mark his peroration:
 Credit which is only Trust and Faith, is becoming more and more the money power of the world, and in the parchment bullet into which is impressed the faith which removes mountains, India will find victory and peace.
Here there is evident confusion of thought. The credit which is
 becoming the money power of the world has little moral basis and is not a synonym for Trust or Faith, which are purely moral qualities. After twenty years’ experience of hundreds of men, who had dealings with banks in South Africa, the opinion I had so  often  heard expressed has become firmly rooted in me, that the greater the rascal,
 the greater the credit he enjoys with his banks. The banks do not pry into his moral character; they are satisfied that he meets his over-drafts and promissory notes punctually. The credit system has encircled this beautiful globe of ours like a serpent’s coil, and if we do not mind, it bids fair to crush us out of breath. I have witnessed the ruin of many a home through the system, and it has made no difference whether the credit was labelled co-operative or otherwise. The deadly coil  has made possible the devastating spectacle in Europe, which we are helplessly looking on. It was perhaps never so true as it is to-day that as in law so in war the longest purse finally wins. I have ventured to give prominence to the current belief about credit system in order to emphasise the point that the co-operative movement will be a blessing to India only to the extent that it is a moral movement strictly directed by men fired with religious fervour. It follows, therefore, that co- operation should be confined to men wishing to be morally right, but failing to do so, because of grinding poverty or of the grip of the mahajanlibtech_61_footnotelibtech_62_footnote.  Facility  for  obtaining  loans  at  fair  rates  will  not  make immoral or unmoral men moral. But the wisdom of the State or philanthropists demands that they should help, on the onward path, men struggling to be good.
 Too often do we believe that material prosperity means moral growth. It is necessary that a movement which is fraught with so much good to India should not degenerate into one for merely advancing cheap loans. I was therefore delighted to read the recommendation in the Report of the Committee on Co-operation in India, that
 they wish clearly to express their opinion that it is to true co-operation alone, that is, to a co-operation which recognises the moral aspect of the question that Government must look for the amelioration of the masses and not to a pseudo co-operative edifice, however imposing, which is built in ignorance of co-operative, principles.
 With this standard before us, we will not measure the success of the movement by the number of co-operative societies formed, but by the  moral  condition  of the  co-operators.  The Registrars  will  in that event ensure the moral growth of existing societies before multiplying them. And the Government will make their promotion conditional, not upon the number of societies they have registered, but the moral success of the existing institutions. This will mean tracing the course of every pice lent to the members. Those responsible for
 
 the proper conduct of co-operative societies will see to it that the money advanced does not find its way into the toddy-sellers’ till or into the pockets of the keepers of gambling dens. I would excuse the rapacity of the mahajan if it has succeeded in keeping the gambling die or toddy from the ryot’s home.
 A word perhaps about the mahajan will not be out of place. Co-operation is not a new device. The ryots co-operate to drum out monkeys or birds that destroy their crops. They co-operate to use a common thrashing floor. I have found them co-operate to protect their cattle to the extent of their devoting their best land for  the grazing of their cattle. And they have been found  co-operating  against a particularly rapacious mahajan. Doubt has been-expressed as to the success of co-operation because of the tightness of the mahajan’s hold on the ryots. I do not share the fears. The mightiest mahajan must, if he represents an evil force, bend before  co- operation, conceived as an essentially moral movement. But  my  limited experience of the mahajan of Champaran has made me revise the accepted opinion about his ‘blighting influence’. I have found him to be not always relentless, not always exacting of the last pie. He sometimes serves his clients in many ways or even comes to their rescue in the hour of their distress. My observation is so limited that I dare not draw any conclusions from it, but I respectfully enquire whether it is not possible to make a serious effort to draw out the good in the mahajan and help him or induce him to throw out the evil in him. May he not be induced to join the army of co-operation, or has experience proved that he is past praying for?
 I note that the movement takes note of all indigenous industries. I beg publicly to express my gratitude to Government for helping me in my humble effort to improve the lot of the weaver. The experiment I am conducting shows that there is a vast field for work in this direction. No well-wisher of India, no patriot dare look upon the impending destruction of the handloom weaver with equanimity. As Dr. Mann has stated, this industry used to supply the peasant with an additional source of livelihood and an  insurance  against  famine. Every Registrar who will nurse back to life this important and graceful industry will earn the gratitude of India. My humble effort consists of, firstly, in making researches as to the possibilities of simple reforms in the orthodox handlooms, secondly, in weaning the educated youth from the craving for Government or other service and the feeling that
 education renders him unfit for independent occupation and inducing him to take to weaving as a calling as honourable as that of a barrister or a doctor, and, thirdly, by helping those who have abandoned their occupation to revert to it. I will not weary the audience with any statement on the first two parts of the experiment. The third may be allowed a few sentences as it has a direct bearing upon the subject before us. I was able to enter upon it only six months ago. Five families that had left off the calling have reverted to it and they are doing a prosperous business. The Ashram supplies them at their door with the yarn they need; it volunteers to take delivery of the cloth woven, paying them cash at the market rate. The Ashram merely loses interest on the loan advanced for the yarn. It has as yet suffered no loss and is able to restrict its loss to a minimum by limiting the loan to a particular figure. All future transactions are strictly cash. We are able to command a ready sale for the cloth received. The loss of interest, therefore, on the transaction is negligible. I would like the audience to note its purely moral character from start to finish. The Ashram depends for its existence on such help as friends render it.  We, therefore, can have no warrant for charging interest.  The  weavers could not be saddled with it. Whole families that were breaking to pieces are put together again. The use of the loan is predetermined. And we the middlemen being volunteers obtain the privilege of entering into the lives of these families 1 hope for their and our betterment. We cannot lift them without being lifted ourselves. This last relationship has not yet been developed, but we hope at an early date to take in hand the education too of these families and not rest satisfied till we have touched them at every point. This is not too ambitious a dream. God willing, it will be a reality some day. I have ventured to dilate upon the small experiment to illustrate what I mean by co-operation to present it to others for imitation. Let us be sure of our ideal. We shall ever fail to realise it, but we should never cease to strive for it. Then there need be no fear of “co-operation of scoundrels” that Ruskin so rightly dreaded.

17,"September 24, 1917","EXTRACTS FROM MINUTES OF
CHAMPARAN COMMITTEE MEETING","
    
 RANCHI,
 September 24, 1917
 The President said that he understood that Mr. Gandhi had some remarks to make about the draft report which had been circulated. Mr. Gandhi said that he had an interview with His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor and understood from him that arbitration on the conflicting claims as to sharahbeshi was possible. The President said that during the time he had been in Ranchi he had discussed this matter with the local Government and had pointed out that there were three possible courses:
 for 	the local Government to arbitrate, for the Bettiah estate to meet the difference of 25 per cent, or for the question to be left to a special tribunal. 
 He understood that the local Government was not prepared to arbitrate but was prepared to consider the second suggestion after consulting the local officers. The latter were, however, opposed to the idea and when he himself had put it to the planters principally concerned, viz., Messrs Norman, Hill and Irwin, he gathered that they also were not in favour of it. He, therefore, understood that the local Government had abandoned all idea of the first and second alternatives and the report was consequently drafted on the assumption that the third alternative would be adopted. Mr. Gandhi said that he thought that Sir Edward Gait would be prepared to arbitrate and suggested that the matter might be referred to him. Mr. Rainy pointed out that it would he necessary to ascertain first whether the parties were willing. The President said that it was necessary, before the matter was referred to His Honour, to decide one or two points. The first was as to Turkaulia. Mr. Hill had not agreed to a reduction in sharahbeshi larger than 20 per cent and Mr. Gandhi had said that he was prepared to consider special cases. The President asked, therefore, whether he would agree in the case of Turkaulia for the arbitration to be between the limits of 20 per cent and 40 per cent. Mr. Gandhi agreed to this. The President said that the second point was, supposing some of the planters agreed and some did not, was the arbitration to be recommended in the case of those who agreed? Mr. Gandhi said that he thought if any concerns preferred to fight out their case in the ordinary courts, he would have no objection to their doing so. Mr. Reid agreed to this. The President then asked whether Mr. Gandhi intended the arbitration to be done by His Honour personally or by the local Government. Mr. Gandhi said that he thought it should be done by His Honour personally and the Committee agreed. Mr. Reid enquired whether His Honour would fix a separate figure for each factory. Mr. Gandhi said he thought it was not necessary
 to go into details and that this could be left to His Honour. The President then pointed out that, supposing the arbitration was undertaken, it was necessary to give the planters some assurance that the award would be made binding on the raiyats. Mr. Adami said that this would require legislation. Mr. Gandhi, however, thought that it
 would be simpler and just as binding as legislation, if he got a power of attorney from the raiyats to act on their behalf. This would not cause so much delay and probably be less troublesome on the whole than special legislation. The President asked what was
 to be done in the case of those raiyats who were not paying  sharahbeshi  and  against
 whom the indigo obligation was recorded. Mr. Gandhi said that they should have the option of commuting the obligation at whatever rate might eventually be awarded. The President pointed out that the Committee had already agreed that the  tinkathia
 system was so bad that it ought to be abolished. Mr. Gandhi said that in spite of that he could not see why raiyats should be compelled to pay enhanced rents if they did not wish to. He was prepared to try and get a power of attorney from such raiyats but the raiyats should not be compelled to agree to the arbitration. Mr. Reid said he thought that there would be  great delay in  getting the power of  attorney and  the
 President asked what would happen if  the  raiyats  repudiated it subsequently.   Mr.
 Gandhi said that in that case the raiyats would have to fight, but that was not likely. He would agree to the following being put in the report, “In order to protect the planters in the matter of acceptance by the raiyats of the Lieutenant-Governor’s award, Mr. Gandhi would undertake to obtain a power of attorney from the raiyats concerned.” He added that it   might  be   simpler  if   the   raiyats  simply  signed   an
 agreement that they would accept the figure fixed by the Lieutenant-Governor. The President enquired whether if arbitration was to take place before this agreement was obtained, it would be right to go to the raiyats and ask them to sign it subsequent to the arbitration. Mr. Gandhi said that in that case it would not be a power of attorney
 but would be a legal acceptance. Mr. Rainy said that what was required was something which the raiyat could not question if the planter had to bring a suit for arrears of rent. Mr. Reid pointed out that if the attested rent had to be revised in the record, legislation would be necessary and a separate agreement would be required from each
 raiyat specifying the terms which had been settled   in   each   particular   case.  The
 President said that the difficulty was that while with the planters the Committee were dealing with principals, with raiyats they were dealing with the representatives. The two methods which had been proposed to get over this were
  to 	get a 	power of 	attorney from 	the raiyats before 	arbitration which 	would be a lengthy 	process, and that 	Mr. Gandhi 	should obtain a legal acceptance after 	arbitration. 
 Mr. Adami said that if the second suggestion was adopted, an agreement would have to be taken from every raiyats and registered, The President pointed out that in
 that case the expense would be considerable and it would have to be decided who was to bear it. Mr. Gandhi said that to get the power of attorney, it would take at least a month. Mr. Reid thought that legislation would be preferable. Mr. Rainy pointed out that it would be difficult to have the arbitration before the power of attorney was obtained and asked whether Mr. Gandhi would not agree to recommend that the settlement should be made binding by legislation, if necessary. Mr. Gandhi agreed to that. Mr. Reid said that he understood that in any case legislation was necessary to abolish the tinkathia system and he saw no reason therefore why provisions as to sharahbeshi should not also be included. The President said he thought that the proposal for special legislation was to some extent gambling on the Legislative Council but the members generally thought there would be no difficulty about this. It was finally agreed that the President should go to His Honour with the unanimous request that he should arbitrate on the following basis:
 (l)	In the case of Turkaulia between the limits of 20 per cent and 40 per cent reduction in sharahbeshi.
 (2)	In Pipra, Motihari, Jallaha and Sirni between the limits of 25 per cent and 40 per cent reduction.
 The arbitration was only to take place where the concerns agreed. Any concern which did not agree would be left to the agency of the ordinary courts. The award might vary for different concerns and although Mr. Gandhi would prefer to omit this qualification, he would prefer to retain it rather than that the arbitration should fail. Where the indigo obligation was recorded, the raiyat was to have the option of continuing under the obligation or of commuting it at the rates fixed by  the  arbitration. Effect was to be given to the award by emergency legislation.
 The President then said that in case His Honour agreed to arbitrate, the report would presumably simply state this fact. Mr. Gandhi said that he would prefer the arbitration to take place first of all and the figure arrived at to be incorporated in the report as their recommendation with the additional recommendation that legislation should be undertaken to enforce it. The Committee agreed to this.
 The President then said that they had now to consider the report and he asked Mr. Gandhi to put his general views before the meeting. Mr. Gandhi said that he thought that for their purpose, the report was too heavy and that the Committee were not warranted in giving such a lengthy history after a summary enquiry. He pointed out that the materials were all in the Government record and on the terms of reference they had merely to report conclusions without giving the reasons. His experience was that arbitrators who did not give reasons always did well. The President agreed, provided that the report was unanimous.
 The  President  said  that one  point   which   had   not   been   dealt   with   in the report was the case of tawan in mukarrari villages. The report dealt with the case
 of tawan in thika villages only. He referred specially to the case of Rajpur. Mr. Gandhi said he thought that Mr. Hudson ought to repay part of the tawan, as he had lost nothing by replacing tinkathia indigo by khuski indigo. If necessary, the payment could be enforced by special legislation. . . .
 The President then brought forward a note of dissent put in by the Hon’ble Raja Kirtyanand Sinha as to the recommendation made in regard to sections 75 and 58 of the Bengal Tenancy Act. As to the amendment in section 75, Mr. Adami pointed out that the principle of having two alternative procedures for dealing with an infringement had already been accepted by the Legislature in section 58, so that the objection on this ground was not valid. Mr. Gandhi said that the objection on the ground that a legal point might arise seemed more valid but this would be provided for because there would be an appeal to the Commissioner. The President pointed out that the recommendation was practically to make the section the same as in the Chhota Nagpur Tenancy Act and asked the Raja if he would not agree to the recommendation if it was restricted to the Champaran district. Raja Kirtyanand Sinha said that on this condition he was willing to agree.

18,"September 25, 1917",MINUTES OF CHAMPARAN COMMITTEE MEETING,"
    
 RANCHI,
 September 25, 1917
 The President said he had seen the Lieutenant-Governor who had said that he was not prepared to give a definite reply to the proposal that he should arbitrate and pointed out that it would be a somewhat difficult position for him since, as the head of the Government, he would have to deal with the report. The Lieutenant-Governor had, therefore, suggested that it might be preferable if a High Court Judge was appointed to arbitrate. Mr. Gandhi said that he did not contemplate such a stiff and formal arbitration. It was not a legal mind that was required for this arbitration but a business mind. Mr. Reid said that he was doubtful whether Messers Irwin and Hill would agree to arbitration and he was certain that they would not agree to arbitration by a High Court Judge. The President said that in that case it was hardly worthwhile to go on with the proposal to arbitrate. Mr. Gandhi agreed but said he still had hopes of bringing about an arbitration.
 Turning to the discussion of the report, the President said that, in considering whether the introductory historical portion should be cut down, it had to be remembered that it was desirable to make the report as a whole intelligent to the
 public and not to make it appear as if the Committee had shirked their tasks. Mr. Rainy said he had no objection to cutting down Chapter II. Mr. Adami was inclined to keep Chapter II as it was. Raja Kirtyanand Sinha suggested that the paragraph about the thikadari system might be shortened. Mr. Reid said that he saw no objection to Chapter II standing. It was necessary to enable anyone to grasp the problem as it stood at present. Mr. Gandhi said that if the report was not to be unanimous, he could understand and would not resist the desire of the majority to state their argument fully. The President said that Mr. Gandhi should indicate precisely the points to which he objected and the report could then be altered, if possible, to meet the views of everybody. Mr. Rainy pointed out that if there was anything in Chapter II which was contentious, it could be transferred to the contentious part of the report. He added that if the report was to recommend   the   tribunal,   it   was  unnecessary   to   discuss the
 sharahbeshi question at length, because that was the very point which the tribunal
 would have to decide, but if Government was going to decide the question itself, then it would be necessary to give the arguments at some length. Mr. Gandhi thought that Government would have to decide between the views of the majority and his own views, as what he wanted was for Government to decide on the equities of the case and legislate at once. If Government held sharahbeshi to be illegal and that tinkathia, though legal, was accompanied by so much abuse that it should be abolished, they
 would legislate against it without the necessity of appointing a tribunal. If he had come on the scene earlier, he would have advised the raiyats against compensation, but as it was, compensation had been paid and he had to recognise that Mr. Reid said
 that he had only agreed to recommend that tinkathia should be abolished if there was
 compensation for it. The President said that the Committee could not  bind Government, but he could indicate the view that he thought Government took; if there was a decision by arbitration on the consent of both parties, Government could legislate to give effect to that agreement without any difficulty. If there was no agreement, there were two alternatives:
   for Government to decide for itself and legislate accordingly or  for 			the matter to 			be referred to 			a special tribunal or 			left to 			the ordinary 			courts.   
 As to the first alternative, questions affecting important claims to property were involved which it would be rather arbitrary and high-handed for Government to decide executively. The second alternative would, therefore, be the one probably adopted if no agreements were reached. The President added that until the Committee had before them Mr. Gandhi’s specific suggestions as to what he wished to alter in the report, it was impossible to go on. What he wanted was a unanimous report as far as possible, that is to say, that any contentious matter should be confined to the one portion regarding sharahbeshi. Mr. Gandhi said that there was one master idea
 running through the report recognising the legality in certain cases of the tinkathia obligation and the justification for sharahbeshi. The President said that if Mr. Gandhi would go through the report in detail, each portion of it could be  dealt  with  separately.
 Discussing the possibility of arbitration, Mr. Gandhi said that he thought if the planters believed they had a good case, it was unbusinesslike for them to refuse arbitration. The President asked whether if only Mr. Norman agreed to arbitration, it was worthwhile taking up his case alone. Mr. Rainy thought that might make one or other of the parties regard the local Government as being incapacitated from dealing with the other cases impartially. He suggested that if a special tribunal was set up, it might be left open to the planters to agree to arbitration by the tribunal instead of detailed trial in each case. The President said he did not think there would be any advantage in that.
 The President then suggested that the constitution ant duties of the tribunal should be discussed. Mr. Adami said that it should consist of three members to provide for a difference of opinion and thought that there should be an appeal to the High Court on any legal point but not on the question of what was the fair amount for the commutation of the obligation. The Committee accepted three as the number of members of the tribunal and the personnel was then discussed. The President suggested that the tribunal should consist of:
 a Judicial Officer not below the rank of District Judge, a Revenue Officer not below the rank of Collector, and another 	Judge or another Revenue Officer. 
 As to (1), Mr. Rainy proposed that the Judicial Officer should be a High Court Judge and that there should be no appeal. Mr. Gandhi, however, thought that there should be a right of appeal, as tribunals sometimes went wrong. His view was the same whether the Judicial Officer in the tribunal was a High Court Judge or a District Judge. He agreed that the right of appeal should be confined to legal points. Mr. Adami said that if a High Court Judge was on the tribunal, he would allow no appeal, but there was no technical objection to an appeal being allowed from such a tribunal. Mr. Reid agreed with Mr. Rainy. Raja Kirtyanand Singh said that he would prefer that Mr. Gandhi should agree to a 25 per cent reduction in sharahbeshi, which would obviate the appointment of a tribunal, the working of which would obviously give a good deal of trouble. The Committee agreed that the second member of the tribunal should be a Revenue Officer not below the grade of Collector. As to the third member of the tribunal, Mr. Rainy said he would prefer to leave it to the local Government, who might wish to appoint neither a Judge nor a Revenue Officer. Mr. Adami said that  he would prefer the third member to be a Judicial Officer. Mr. Gandhi also preferred a
 Judicial Officer. He said that the case here was not the same as in arbitration and, for a formal judicial tribunal, he would prefer a majority of Judicial Officers. The President asked if it was possible for a High Court Judge and a District Judge to sit together. Mr. Adami said he thought there was no objection, Mr. Rainy said that Government might wish to put in a barrister or a pleader, and might also desire that one at least of the tribunal should be an Indian. He thought if they made their recommendation as to the personnel in too much detail, it would tie the hands of Government. The President then raised a question of the duties of tribunal. He suggested that the necessary legislation should lay down their duties somewhat as follows:
 That on the application of either party within a certain period, the tribunal was to decide
 If 	the obligation 	to grow 	indigo existed or not.  If 	so, what compensation 	in the 	form of enhanced 	rent, if any, 	should be 	allowed. If 	the tribunal 	decided that compensation was 	to be given, 	it should 	have regard in 	fixing that 	compensation to 	the following points: 
 in no case was the rent to be greater than fair and equitable rent; the existing rent and the period for which it had remained unenhanced; and  the 	actual rate of sharahbeshi 	which had 	been taken in 	the concern 	or in 	neighbouring concerns. 
 Mr. Adami said that if the tribunal had to fix a commutation rate, this was probably the best way. It had been suggested that a fair and equitable rent should be fixed by the tribunal, irrespective of any conditions. Mr. Rainy said that in his view the tribunal should be left entirely free to decide what points to consider. There were limits to their discretion because they could not fix the rent lower than the original rent nor one higher than the existing rent including sharahbeshi. The President said that as Revenue Officer, he would hesitate to carry out the rent settlement without some such guidance as he had proposed. Mr. Reid pointed out that the survey record was available and would assist the tribunal. The President said that the survey record was not designed for what in northern India was understood by the settlement of rent;  and in his view the proposal would lengthen the proceedings considerably. Mr. Rainy did not press his view but he thought that the decision as to what points should be considered should be left to the tribunal. The President said this might be met if it was laid down that, amongst other considerations, the tribunal should take into account the three points mentioned. Mr. Gandhi pointed out that any recommendation restricting the provisions of the Bengal Tenancy Act would be fought in the Legislative Council, and that as far as possible the Committee’s suggestion should aim    at    liberalising    the    Act    and    not    restricting    it.    Mr.     Reid     said   he thought it would be simpler if the tribunal was simply given power to consider
 the rent rendered at the settlement and revise it, if necessary. The President pointed out that the special tribunal would only have to consider cases where the obligation had been recorded or where sharahbeshi had been taken. It was agreed that the period of time within which applications to the tribunal should be made should be fixed at three months from the date of notification, and that if application was not made within that period, the entry in the settlement record should be final. Mr. Adami was asked to draft a paragraph embodying these decisions to go at the end of paragraph 24 of the report.
 Mr. Gandhi wanted provisions to be made that the tribunal should consider cases of coercion and undue influence and other illegal practices, that is to say, that it should go into the past history of the working of the tinkathia system. Mr. Adami said that this would take a long time. Mr. Gandhi pointed out that there would be a test case which other cases would follow. The President said he thought that the clause,
 that the tribunal could decide what compensation, if any, was payable, implied that the raiyat in his plea would be able to plead that no compensation was due, because in the past the planter had already got sufficient compensation. He thought that Mr. Gandhi by this request was going back to his original case that there should be no tribunal. Whether there was to be a tribunal or not, there was a point that Government would have to decide. Mr. Rainy said that if the tribunal was to consider all these matters, it might be simpler to leave the whole thing to the operation of the ordinary law and merely appoint a Special Judge to try the cases. Mr. Gandhi said that even if Government found that the equities were in favour of the case, they would appoint a tribunal because as the President had said before, they could not take on themselves the responsibility of passing an arbitrary executive order. Mr. Adami said that he thought the widest discretion should be given to the tribunal. Mr. Rainy pointed out that the Turkaulia case had been fought largely on the point of coercion and that this
 might be raised in sharahbeshi  cases that came before the tribunal. The tribunal,
 however, was also to deal with cases where sharahbeshi had not been taken, but where applications had been made for the obligation to be commuted. If the tribunal allowed an enhancement of rent in the latter case, why should they not do so in the former case even when the agreement was void on account of coercion? He did not consider, therefore, that the question of coercion came in to any great extent. It was to provide for cases of this sort that he proposed that the tribunal should consider anything that they thought relevant. Mr. Reid enquired as to who would pay the cost of the tribunal. The President said presumably Government would pay the cost and enquired of Mr. Gandhi if he could say how long the tribunal would take. Mr. Gandhi said he thought it would take at least a month in the most favourable circumstances. Mr. Adami thought it would take much longer.
 As regards the printed evidence, Mr. Gandhi said that he wanted the enclosures
 to the written evidence of the three raiyats who had been examined publicly to be printed. The President said that these could be printed as an appendix. Mr. Gandhi also wanted statements of other raiyats that he had filed to be printed. Mr. Reid
 objected to this. The President said that it would be sufficient for Mr. Gandhi’s purpose if statements of witnesses who were examined informally were printed. Mr. Gandhi said that he would examine the statements and consider the point. He also wanted copies of judgements that he had filed to be printed. The President said that that would make a very bulky record. The judgements were all public documents and he did not think it more necessary to print them than it was to print Government records that had been placed before them. Mr. Gandhi said he thought that Mr. Gourlay’s report should be printed. The President said that was a matter for the Government to decide. Mr. Gandhi said his idea in wanting these documents printed was that he could refer to them in his report. The President pointed out that Mr. Gandhi could refer to them, although they were not printed.
 The meeting then adjourned.

19,"September 	25, 1917","LETTER TO THE PRESS ON THIRD CLASS TRAVELLING ON INDIAN
		RAILWAYSlibtech_66_footnote","
    
       TO  THE 	EDITOR  THE LEADER  SIR,  RANCHI,  September 	25, 1917 
  	I have now been in India for over two years and a half after my 	return from South Africa. Over one quarter of that time I have 	passed on the Indian trains travelling 3rd class by choice. I have 	travelled north as far as Lahore, down south up to Tranquebar, and  	from Karachi to Calcutta. Having resorted to third class travelling 	among other reasons for the purpose of studying the conditions under 	which this class of passengers travel, I have naturally made as 	critical observations as I could. I have fairly covered the majority 	of railway systems during this period. Now and then I have entered 	into    
 correspondence with the management of the different railways about defects that have come under my notice. But I think that the time has come when I should invite the Press and the public to join in a crusade against a grievance which has too long remained unredressed, though much of it is capable of redress without great difficulty.
 On the 12th instant I booked at Bombay for Madras by the mail train and paid Rs. 13-9. It was labelled to carry 22 passengers. These could only have seating accommodation. There were no bunks in this carriage whereon passengers could lie with any degree of safety or comfort. There were two nights to be passed in this train before reaching Madras. If not more than 22 passengers found their way into my carriage before we reached Poona, it was because the bolder ones kept the others at bay. With the exception of two or three insistent passengers, all had to find their sleep, being seated all the time. After reaching Raichur the pressure became unbearable. The rush of passengers could not be stayed. The fighters among us found the task almost beyond them. The guards or other railway servants came in only to push in more passengers.
 A defiant Memon merchant protested against this packing of passengers like sardines. In vain did he say that this was his fifth night on the train. The guard insulted him and referred him to the management at the terminus. There were during this night as many as 35 passengers in the carriage during the greater part of it. Some lay on the floor in the midst of dirt and some had to keep standing. A free fight was at one time avoided only by the intervention of some of the older passengers who did not want to add to the discomfort by an exhibition of temper.
 On the way, passengers got for tea tannin-water with filthy sugar and a whitish-looking liquid miscalled milk which gave this water a muddy appearance. I can vouch for the appearance, but I cite the testimony of the passengers as to the taste.
 Not during the whole of the journey was the compartment once swept or cleaned. The result was every time you walked on the floor or rather cut your way through the passengers seated on the floor, you waded through dirt.
 The closet was also not cleaned during the journey and there was no water in the water tank.
 Refreshments sold to the passengers were dirty-looking, handed by dirtier hands, coming out of filthy receptacles and weighed in
 equally unattractive scales. These were previously sampled by millions of flies. I asked some of the passengers who went in for these dainties to give their opinion. Many of them used choice expressions as to the quality but were satisfied to state that they were helpless in the matter; they had to take things as they came.
 On reaching the station, I found that the  ghariwalalibtech_67_footnotewould not take me unless I paid the fare he wanted. I mildly protested and told him I would pay him the authorized fare. I had to turn passive resister before I could be taken. I simply told him he would have to pull me out of the ghari or call the policeman.
 The return journey was performed in no better manner. The carriage was packed already and but for a friend’s intervention, I could not have been able to secure even a seat. My admission was certainly beyond the authorized number. This compartment was constructed to carry 9 passengers but it had constantly 12 in it. At one place, an important railway servant swore at a protestant, threatened to strike him and locked the door over the passengers whom he had with difficulty squeezed in. To this compartment there was a closet falsely so called. It was designed as a European closet but could hardly be used as such. There was a pipe in it but no water, and I say without fear of challenge that it was pestilentially dirty.
 The compartment itself was evil-looking. Dirt was lying thick upon the wood work and I do not know that it had ever seen soap or water.
 The compartment had an exceptional assortment of passengers. There were stalwart Punjabi Mahommedans, two refined  Tamilians and two Mahommedan merchants who joined us later. The merchants related [about] the bribes they had to give to procure comfort. One of the Punjabis had already travelled three nights and was weary and fatigued. But he could not stretch himself. He said he had sat the whole day at the Central Station, watching passengers giving bribes to procure their tickets. Another said he had himself to pay Rs. 5 before he could get his ticket and his seat. These three men were bound for Ludhiana and had still more nights of travel in store for them.
 What I have described is not exceptional but normal. I have got down at Raichur, Dhond, Sonepur, Chakardharpur, Purulia, Asansol
 
 and other junction stations and been at the Mosafirkhanalibtech_68_footnotelibtech_69_footnoteattached to these stations. They are discreditable-looking places where there is no order, no cleanliness but utter confusion and horrible din and noise. Passengers have no benches or not enough to sit on. They squat on dirty floors and eat dirty food. They are permitted to throw  the leavings of their food and spit where they like, sit how they like, and smoke everywhere. The closets attached to these places defy description. I have not the power to adequately describe them without committing a breach of the laws of decent speech. Disinfecting powder, ashes or disinfecting fluids are unknown. The army of flies buzzing about them warns you against their use. But a third class traveller is dumb and helpless. He does not want to complain even though to go to these places may be to court death. I know passengers who fast while they are travelling just in order to lessen the misery of their life in the trains. At Sonepur flies having failed, wasps have come forth to warn the public and the authorities, but yet to no purpose. At the Imperial Capital a certain 3rd class booking office is a Black Hole fit only to be destroyed.
 Is it any wonder that plague has become endemic in India? Any other result is impossible where passengers always leave some dirt where they go and take more on leaving.
 On Indian trains alone passengers smoke with impunity in all carriages irrespective of the presence of the fair sex and irrespective of the protest of non-smokers. And this notwithstanding a bye-law which prevents a passenger from smoking without the permission of his fellows in a compartment which is not allotted to smokers.
 The existence of the awful war cannot be allowed to stand in the way of removal of this gigantic evil. War can be no warrant for tolerating dirt and overcrowding. One could understand an entire stoppage of passenger traffic in a crisis like this, but never a continuation or accentuation of insanitation and conditions that must undermine health and morality. Compare the lot of the 1st class passengers with that of the 3rd class. In the Madras case, the 1st class fare is over five times as much as the 3rd class fare. Does the third class passenger get one-fifth, even one-tenth, of the comforts of his first class fellow? It is but simple justice to claim that some relative proportion be observed between the cost and comfort.
 
 It is a known fact that the 3rd class traffic pays for the ever increasing luxuries of 1st and 2nd class travelling. Surely a third class passenger is entitled at least to the bare necessities of life.
 In neglecting the 3rd class passengers, opportunity of giving a splendid education to millions in orderliness, sanitation, decent composite life, and cultivation of simple and clean tastes is being lost. Instead of receiving an object lesson in these matters, 3rd class passengers have their sense of decency and cleanliness blunted during their travelling experience.
 Among the many suggestions that can be made for dealing with the evil here described, I would respectfully include this:  Let  the people in high places, the Viceroy, the Commander-in-chief, the Rajas, Maharajas,   the   Imperial   Councillors   and   others,   who   gene- rally travel in superior classes, without previous warning, go through the experiences now and then of 3rd class travelling. We would then soon see a remarkable change in the conditions of the 3rd class travelling and the uncomplaining millions will get some return for the fares they pay under the expectation of being carried from place to place with the ordinary creature comforts.
 I am, Yours, etc.,

22,"September 26, 1917",MINUTES OF CHAMPARAN COMMITTEE MEETING,"
    
 RANCHI,
 September 26, 1917
 The President said he had a talk with Mr. Hill on the previous day but found him obdurate. Mr. Hill told him that he was certain that Mr. Irwin would not accept arbitration but probably Mr. Norman would. Mr. Hill also said that he was sorry he had made any offer of reduction and would prefer to have the matter settled by a court.   It was not only a matter of money but of reputation. The President thought that, in these circumstances, any idea of arbitration must be dropped, but the question arose as   to whether it was worthwhile going on with arbitration in Mr. Norman’s case. The difficulty was that two methods of settlement would be going on at the same time and two kinds of legislation would be necessary. Mr. Rainy pointed out that it was open to Mr. Norman to have his case arbitrated separately apart from any recommendation of the Committee and he might be contented to do so without binding legislation. Mr. Gandhi said that in Mr. Norman’s case, there would be no difficulty in giving effect to a settlement in his concern by consent. The agreements could be registered village by village. The President observed that it would be difficult to legislate for one concern only. Mr. Adami said that this would not be necessary. The legislation could be on the lines that either the parties could apply to the tribunal for settlement of rent or could go to arbitration, in which case it could be provided that the award should be given effect to by the tribunal. There would be no need in this case to specify any particular concern in the legislation. Mr. Gandhi said that it was doubtful
 whether anything could be generally done by consent. Treating the matter now as a difference between himself and the rest of the Committee, he asked whether the difference could be split and adopted as a recommendation of the Committee. The President said that when this matter was discussed before, his view was that there was no case for the planters to give up sharahbeshi at all. They had, however, volunteered  to give up a certain percentage for the sake of a settlement by goodwill and he was not prepared to recommend Government to go any further without the consent of the planters. Mr. Reid also said that he could not agree to anything beyond the limits already indicated. The President said that there was no chance of settlement by consent unless Mr. Gandhi could bring h imself to agree to these limits. Mr. Reid asked if there was any chance of agreement on a proposal to start at a  reduction of 40  per cent and after a period of years to work up to a reduction of 25 per cent. The President said that he thought the planters would not accept that. He added that he gathered that although Mr. Irwin would abide by his promise, he would be glad if he saw any way out of it. He asked Mr. Gandhi whether it was more in the interests of
 raiyats to accept the planters’ limits or to leave them to fight it out. He thought that
 the risks of failure, if they were left to fight, were so great, that it was not worth it. Mr. Gandhi said that he did not see the risk because he had every confidence that he would prove his case. The President asked what that confidence was based on, because Mr. Gandhi had been able to put his case before four members of the Committee and had failed to convince them. Two of the Government witnesses, Mr. Sweeney and Mr. Heycock, were certainly not unsympathetic to the raiyats and they were convinced that Mr. Gandhi’s view of the case was wrong. The legal view, so far as it had been
 expressed, was also contrary to Mr. Gandhi’s. Mr. Gandhi said that this was not the case. He held that the Turkaulia judgement was in his favour because kabuliyatslibtech_75_footnotelibtech_76_footnotecould
 not be produced except in a few of the cases. The President said that Mr. Hill had told him that, as far as Turkaulia was concerned, he was risking nothing, as registered kabuliyats existed in the large majority of cases. Mr. Hill had also told him that he
 had taken the very best legal advice which was to the effect that he was almost certain to win his case. Mr. Gandhi said that on the raiyats’ side, there was great confidence also but he did not base his view entirely on that. He based his confidence on the equities of the case. He thought that Mr. Sweeney’s views were unfortunately wrong and that his subsequent views were affected by the fact that he had to adhere to his decision. The President said that Mr. Hill held that public discussion had impugned his reputation and for this reason he would welcome the tribunal so as to be given an opportunity for clearing himself. Mr. Gandhi said that in that case, it would probably be necessary to have the tribunal, and an additional reason for this was supplied by the fact that Mr. Irwin felt sorry  for   his  promise,  because   even   if   there   was   a
 
 settlement on the basis of this promise, there would be a certain amount of dissatisfaction and this was what he wanted to avoid. The President said he did not think that the position in respect of Mr. Irwin’s promise had been quite understood. The planters had agreed to a reduction not because they thought that their full claim was wrong but because they were willing to give up something in order to get a settlement by consent, and in deference to the wishes of the Committee. There was, therefore, no reason to suppose that any settlement on these terms would be regarded with dissatisfaction. Mr. Gandhi then suggested that he should go and see Mr. Hill, so that he could make his position clear and find out what was in Mr. Hill’s mind. The President said that he understood that if Mr. Gandhi was satisfied with the justness of Mr. Hill’s attitude, he would agree to his terms. Mr. Gandhi said that this was not what he meant. What he intended was to try and persuade Mr. Hill to agree to arbitration. If he failed and he saw that Mr. Hill had good reasons, he should have to reconsider his position regarding the previous non-acceptance of the planters’ offer. The President said that Mr. Hill had told him that he could not agree either to the arbitrator proposed by the Committee or to the arbitration being between the limits of 20 and 40 per cent, but that he would accept as an arbitrator a European Judge of the Patna or the Calcutta High Court acquainted with the Tenancy Act or a commercial man. Mr. Gandhi said that it had given him hope that an arbitration might be possible after all. He asked whether Mr. Hill would disagree to have an arbitrator from Champaran, as it would be an advantage to have someone who knew the question. He had previouslylibtech_77_footnotesuggested a tribunal composed of Mr. Apperley and Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya with Mr. Heycock as President; and he would be inclined to accept Mr. Heycock as an arbitrator, if the other side agreed. Mr. Reid said he thought the planters would accept Mr. Heycock but the President was inclined to doubt if they would. Mr. Gandhi said that if they accepted Mr. Heycock as an arbitrator, it would be understood that the arbitration should be between the figures already suggested. Mr. Reid said he did not think that Mr. Hill would accept on that basis. The President said that Mr. Hill’s view was that he, either right or wrong, was willing to give up of his own free will 20 per cent, but would not take the risk of being made to give up more by arbitration. If it was put to him that if without prejudice he was prepared to offer more, it would be accepted and he might be inclined to agree to it. He (Mr. Hill) was not prepared to accept what he regarded as a censure on his conduct except by a legally constituted tribunal. It was not a matter of business but of conscience. It was decided that the President and Mr. Reid should see Mr. Hill at once and that Mr. Reid and Mr. Gandhi should see him in the afternoon. The President said he thought that if the interview was successful, that Managers of the other concerns, namely, Messrs
 
 
 Norman, Irwin, Jameson and Bionlibtech_78_footnoteshould be sent for. He thought that if two concerns could be got to agree, the arbitration was worth doing, but if there was one only, it was not worthwhile to go on. He asked whether, assuming Turkaulia and Pipra agreed to a settlement, the Committee were prepared to recommend that a similar settlement should be enforced by legislation on the other three concerns, although the proprietors did not agree. The Committee agreed that this would be done.
 Mr. Reid raised the question as to whether the abolition of tinkathia should not be made compulsory. Mr. Gandhi said he thought the Legislative Council would not accept this, but in  all probability the  raiyats  would  apply   for   commutation
 voluntarily. Mr. Reid said he doubted if all of them would apply and it would be inconvenient to have one or two raiyats with the tinkathia obligation still attached. The President said that he understood that His Honour was in favour of having it abolished. Mr. Gandhi said he saw legal difficulties but would be willing to accept the view   that  it   should   be   abolished  as   a  recommendation  of   the   Committee. The
 President pointed out that, on the one side, the raiyat was not to be allowed to enter
 into contract and it was reasonable, on the other side, that the raiyat should not be allowed to it even if he wanted it. The raiyat was fully safeguarded because the tribunal could not fix more than a fair rent. He added that in Turkaulia, five per cent of the raiyats was still doing tinkathia which was one of the points on which Mr. Hill relied to prove his case. Mr. Gandhi said that, when khushki indigo was grown on a large scale, as he hoped it would be, the  raiyats, under the  tinkathia  obligation,   would
 soon find it to their advantage to commute. Mr. Rainy pointed out that if the old system survived in any case, it might affect prejudicially the working of the new khushki system. Mr. Gandhi said he would accept the recommendation as part of the
 whole compromise but not if a tribunal was appointed. In that case, the legislation would abolish the tinkathia obligation and leave the landlord the option of applying for the settlement of additional rent as compensation if he wished.
 The Committee then adjourned.

     DEAR 	MR. NATESAN,  September 	27 [1917] 
  	I have read your bookletlibtech_82_footnotewith the greatest pleasure. It is a fine vade-mecum for 	the busy politician and worker. You have provided him with a 	connected narrative of the movement of self-government in a very 	attractive and acceptable form.

 allowed them to speak for themselves. The book is in my opinion a great help to the controversialist and the student of our present day politics who does not care to study musty blue books or has no access to them.
 So much for the public eye. Your decision to leave out ‘an appeal to the British Democracy’ is wise. You will be sorry to learn that I have been laid up with fever since my arrival in Ranchi. It comes on alternate days. Yesterday was the fourth day. It comes only in the afternoon. It has therefore not interfered with the work in hand. But it has weakened me very considerably. The fear I have expressed in my letterlibtech_83_footnoteto the Press on the Railways has been realized in my own case. I had no notion of it when I drafted the letter.
 With regard to my speeches & writingslibtech_84_footnoteI wish you would not have the time limit. I could then give you translations of some of my recent writings in Gujarati. In my opinion they have considerable merit. I would not have the required leisure before November when perhaps I would tackle the writing.
 My fever need not cause you any worry. It must take its time and go.
 Yours sincerely,

25,"September 28, 1917","EXTRACTS FROM MINUTES OF
CHAMPARAN COMMITTEE MEETING","
    
 RANCHI,
 September 28, 1917
 The discussion on Chapter IV of the report was taken up.	Mr. Gandhi said he
 did not like the arrangement of the Chapter. He wanted to omit the  first  two paragraphs merely stating what abwab had been found to be collected, condemning the practice and giving the Committee’s recommendations.
 The arrangement for meeting Messrs Irwin and Norman was discussed. It was settled that Mr. Reid should see them on Saturday and, if necessary, Mr. Gandhi
 
 A. Natesan & Co., Madras, in 1917.
 should see them on Sunday. The next meeting was fixed for Monday morning.
 Referring to the possibility of getting the goodwill of the planters in this settlement, the President asked Mr. Gandhi as to his future plans for Champaran. Mr. Gandhi explained this to the Committee. In the course of the discussion, Mr. Reid raised the question as to what would happen to the indigo crop in the coming year. Mr. Gandhi said he would certainly advise the raiyats to grow indigo, provided a fair price was paid for it. Mr. Reid pointed out that the question of price was now raised for the first time. The former decision of the Committee to which Mr. Gandhi had agreed was that indigo in the year 1917-18 should be grown on the old basis to allow the planters time to change the system.
 Mr. Gandhi said that his view was that he was quite ready to advise the raiyats to go on growing indigo but not on the old terms which were disadvantageous to the raiyat. He would use his influence to get the raiyats to grow at a reasonable rate. The
 President asked whether it was possible to tide over this year, by the planters agreeing to pay a certain percentage above the Association rate. Mr. Gandhi said he thought an agreement could be arrived at on those lines. Mr. Reid said he could not accept the proposal until he had an opportunity of consulting the planters.
 The Committee then adjourned.

      DEAR 	MR. SHASTRIAR,  September 	30 [1917] 
  	How are the mighty fallen! I thought I could never fall ill. Well I 	am laid up with malarial fever which comes on alternate days and in 	the afternoon. This has not interfered with the work in hand. I 	never knew, when I was penning my remarks on catching illness in 	that letterlibtech_85_footnoteof 	mine on the railway passengers (if you have read it at all) that I 	would be myself the illustration and that too immediately after the 	dispatch of that letter. I am applying my own treatment. You need 	not be anxious. Possibly we shall meet in Allahabad. I say possibly 	because I nay not have finished the Committee work here. After 	protracted negotiations, we have settled all the points and there 	will be    
 a unanimous report.
 Yes, the Gujarat Sabha has selected workers. The Sabha’s ambition is to secure 1,00,000 signatures. The Home Rule League is working in Bombay. And I have just received a letter  from  Mrs. Besant that her workers are doing likewise in Madras. Elaborate instructionslibtech_86_footnotelibtech_87_footnotehave been drafted for the volunteers and the scheme has been fully translated for presentation to the villagers and others whose signatures are asked for. The idea is that the whole of India should take up the petition which should be translated in the vernaculars. The original draft was in Gujarati! The English you have read is a translation. For me the value of it lies in the education that the masses will receive and the opportunity that the educated men and women will have of coming in close touch with the people.
I do hope you are keeping well.
 Yours sincerely,

BETTIAHlibtech_108_footnote","
  From 	a photostat of the Gujarati original in Gandhiji’s hand: G.N. 3613         [About October 9, 1917]libtech_109_footnote  	I am thankful to the Gaurakshini Sabha and to you all for inviting 	me to lay the foundation-stone of the  gaushalalibtech_110_footnotein this town. For the Hindus, this is sacred work. 	Protection of the cow is a primary duty for every Indian. It has 	been my experience, however, that the way we set about this 	important work leaves much to be desired. I have given some thought 	to this serious problem and wish to place before you the conclusions 	I have formed.  	These days cow protection has come to mean only two things: first, 	to save cows from the hands of our Muslim brethren on occasions like 	the  Bakr-i-Idlibtech_111_footnoteand, secondly, to put up  gaushalas  for 	decrepit cows.  	We do not go the right way to work for protecting the cows against 	our Muslim brethren. The result has been that these two great 	communities of India are always at odds with each other and cherish 	mutual distrust. Occasionally, they even fight. The riot at Shahabad 	a few days ago bears out my statement. The problem calls for some 	serious thinking on the part of both the communities. Hundreds of 	Hindu friends indulged in rioting and looted the property of 	innocent Muslims. What virtue could there be in this ? In fact, it 	was a very sinful thing to do.  	The activities  of the  Gaurakshini Sabha result  in  a  far   	larger number of cows being killed than are saved. Hinduism      a 	small town in the Champaran district of Bihar, about 25 miles from 	Motihari.    
 attaches special importance to non-violence. It is the very oppositeof religious conduct to kill a Muslim in order to save a cow. If we wish the Muslims not to kill cows, we should bring about a change of heart in them. We shall not succeed by  force.  We  should  reach  their  hearts with prayer and entreaty and achieve our  purpose  by awakening their sense of compassion. In adopting this course, we should take a pledge that, while seeking to protect the cows, weshall bear no ill-will or malice towards Muslims or be angry with them or fight with them. It is when we have taken up such a reassuring attitude that we shall be qualified to raise the matter with them. It should be remembered that what we regard as sin is not seen in the same light by our Muslim brethren. On the contrary, for them it is a meritorious act to kill cows on certain occasions. Every person should follow his own religion. If it were true that killing of cows was enjoined by Islam, India would have had no genuine peace any time; as I understand the matter, however, killing of cows on occasions like Bakr-i-Id is not obligatory, but Muslim friends imagine it their duty to do so when we seek to prevent them by force. Be this as it may, I have no doubt in my mind that this problem can be solved only by  tapascharyalibtech_112_footnotelibtech_113_footnote. The height of tapascharya on such occasions is to lay down one’s life for the sake of cows.
 However, all Hindus are not qualified for such supreme tapascharya. Those who want to stop others from sinning must be free from sin themselves. Hindu society has been inflicting terrible cruelty on the cow and her progeny. The present condition of our cows is a direct proof of this. My heart bleeds when I see thousands of bullocks with no blood and flesh on them, their bones plainly visible beneath their skin, ill-nourished and made to carry excessive burdens, while the driver twists their tails and goads them on. I shudder when I see all this and ask myself how we can say anything to our Muslim friends so long as we do not refrain from such terrible violence. We are so intensely selfish that we feel no shame in milking the cow to the last drop. If you go to dairies in Calcutta, you will find that the calves there are forced to go without the mother’s milk and that all the milk is extracted with the help of a process known as blowing. The proprietors and managers of these dairies are none other than Hindus and most of those who consume the milk are also Hindus. So long as such dairies flourish and we consume the milk supplied by them, what
 
 right have we to argue with our Muslim brethren? It should be borne in mind, besides, that there are slaughter-houses. in all the big cities of India. Thousands of cows and bullocks are slaughtered in these. It is mostly from them that beef is supplied to the British. Hindu society keeps silent about this slaughter, thinking that it is helpless in the matter.
 As long as we do not get this terrible slaughter stopped, I think it is impossible that we can produce any effect on the hearts of Muslims or protect the cows against them. Our second task, therefore, is to carry on agitation among our British friends. We are in no position to use brute strength against them. They also should be won over by tapascharya and gentleness. For them eating of beef is no religious act. It should be easier to that extent to persuade them. It is only after we have rid ourselves of the taint of violence which I mentioned  earlier and have succeeded in persuading our British friends not to eat beef and kill cows and bullocks, it is only then that we shall be entitled to say something to our Muslim friends. I can assure you that, when we have won over the British, our Muslim brethren will also have more sympathy for us and perform their religious rites with some other kind of offering. Once we admit that we are also guilty of violence, the working of our gaushalas will change. We shall not reserve them merely for decrepit cows but maintain there well-nourished cows and bullocks as well. We shall endeavour to improve the breed of cattle and will also be able to produce pure milk, ghee, etc. This is not merely a religious issue. It is an issue on which hinges the economic progress of India. Economists have furnished irrefutable figures to prove that the quality of cattle in India is so poor that the income from their milk is much less than the cost of their maintenance. We can turn our gaushalas into centres for the study of economics and for the solution of this big problem. Gaushalas cost a great deal and at present we have to provide the expenses. The gaushalas of my conception will become self-supporting in future. They will not be located in the midst of cities. We may buy land in the neighbourhood of a city to the tune of hundreds of acres and locate these gaushalas there. We can raise on this land crops to serve as fodder for the cows and every variety of grass. We shall find good use for the valuable manure they yield by way of excrement and urine. I hope you will all give the utmost thought to what I have said. The Gaurakshini Sabha in Motihari has accepted this suggestion. It is my request, in the end, that both these institutions come together and undertake this big task.

Courtesy: 	Chhaganlal Gandhi         BHAGALPUR,  October 	15, 1917]  	You have as it were chained me to you by inviting me to preside over 	this session of the Students’ Conference. For twentyfive years, I 	have been in close contact with students. It was in South Africa 	that I first  came  to  know   some.  While  in  England,  I  always 	 maintained       London; 	financed many of Gandhiji’s schemes   
 contact with other students. After returning to India, I have been meeting students all over the country. They show me unbounded love. By inviting me to preside over this meeting today and permitting me to speak in Hindi and conduct the proceedings, too, in Hindi, you, students, have given me evidence of your love. I shall think myself fortunate indeed if I can prove myself worthy of this love and be of some service to you. You have shown great wisdom in deciding to carry on the proceedings of this Conference in the regional language of the province—which also happens to be our national language. I congratulate you, and hope that you will continue this practice.
 We have been guilty of disrespect to our mother tongue. I am sure we shall have to pay heavily for this act of sin. It has raised a wall of separation between us and our families. All those who are present at this Conference will bear witness to this fact. We do not and cannot explain to our mothers anything of what we learn. We do not and cannot give the benefit of our knowledge to others in our families. One will never find this sad state of affairs in an English family. In England and in other countries where education is imparted through the mother tongue, students, when they return home, discuss with their parents what they learn at school; the servants in the home, and others too, become familiar with it. Thus, the other members of the family also benefit from what the children learn at school. We, on the other hand, leave behind in the school what we learn there. Knowledge, like air, can circulate in no time. But, as a miser keeps his wealth buried in the ground, so we keep our learning to ourselves and others, therefore, do not share in its benefits. Disrespect to the mother tongue is as reprehensible as disrespect to one’s mother. No one who is guilty of it deserves to be called a patriot. We hear many people saying that our languages are not rich enough in words to express our highest thinking. Gentlemen, this is no fault of the language. It is for us to develop and enrich our language. There was a time when English was in the same condition [as our languages]. It progressed because the British made progress and strove to develop their language. If we fail to develop our languages, holding that English alone can help us to cultivate and express higher thoughts, there is not the least doubt that we shall continue to be slaves for ever. So long as our languages do not acquire the power to express all our thinking  and  remain incapable of serving as the medium of communication for the various sciences, the nation will not get modern knowledge. It is self-evident:
  that 	the entire 	body of our 	people need this knowledge;  that 	it will 	never be possible 	for all 	our people to 	understand English;  that, 	if only an 	English-educated 	individual can acquire 	new knowledge, it is impossible for all the people to have it. 
 This means that, if the first two propositions are correct, there is no hope for the masses. For this position, however, the blame does not lie with the languages. Tulsidas was able to express his divine ideas just in Hindi. There are not many books in the world to equal his Ramayana. A great patriot Like Bharat Bhushan Pandit  Madan  Mohan Malaviya, who, though a house holder, has sacrificed his all for the country, has no difficulty in expressing himself in Hindi. He commands silvery English, but his speeches in Hindi have  the brilliance of gold, like the current of the Ganga blazing like gold in sunshine as it pours down from lake Manasa. I have heard some Maulavis delivering their sermons. They find it easy enough  to  express their most profound ideas in their mother tongue. The language of Tulsidas is perfect, immortal. If we cannot express our thoughts in the speech which was his, surely the fault is ours.
 The reason why we cannot do so is clear: the medium of education is English. All of us can help in getting this  serious anomaly removed. I feel students can petition the Governments, respectfully, on this matter. There is another remedy which they can simultaneously adopt, and that is, to translate what they learn at school into Hindi, share their knowledge with others in their homes, and pledge themselves to use only their mother tongue in their intercourse with one another. I cannot bear to see one Bihari corresponding with another Bihari in English. I have heard thousands of Englishmen talking to one another. Some of them know other languages, but I have never heard two Englishmen talking in any foreign language among themselves. The inordinate folly that we are guilty of in India has no parallel in the history of the world.
 A Vedantist poet has said that learning without thinking is useless. But owing to the reasons mentioned above, students’ lives seem to be almost bankrupt of thought. They have lost all spirit and energy, are devoid of originality and most of them appear listless and apathetic.
 I do not dislike English; its riches are infinite. It is the language of administration and is rich with the wealth of know-ledge. All this notwithstanding, I hold that it is not necessary for every Indian to
 learn it. But of this, I do not wish to speak more here. Students have been learning English and they have no option but to do so till some other system is devised and the present schools undergo a revolution. I shall, therefore, end this all-important subject of the mother tongue here, merely saying in conclusion that in their dealings with one another, and whenever possible, people should use only their mother tongue and that others, besides students, who are present here should strive their utmost to make the mother tongue the medium of education.
 As I have earlier pointed out, most of the students look listless and devoid of energy. Many of them have asked me what they should do, how they could serve the country and what they had best do to earn their living. I have the impression that they are most anxious about this last. Before answering these questions, it is necessary to consider what the true aim of education is. Huxley has said that education should aim at building character. Our seers aver that, if a man, though well-versed in the Vedas and the shastras, fails to realize the Self and to make himself worthy of liberation from all bonds, all his learning will have been in vain. They have also said: “He who has known the Self knows all.” Selfrealization is possible even without knowledge of letters. Prophet Mahomed was illiterate. Jesus Christ never went to school. But it would be foolhardy to assert, therefore, that these great souls had not attained self-realization. Though they never went to our schools and colleges to take any examination, we revere them. They had all that learning and knowledge could bring. They were mahatmas. If, following their example in blind imitation of one another, we leave off attending school, we shall get nowhere, to be sure. But we, too, can attain knowledge of the Self only by cultivating good character. What is character, however ? What are the hall-marks of a virtuous life ? A virtuous man is one who strives to practise truth, non-violence, brahmacharya, non-possession, non-stealing fearless- ness and such other rules of conduct. He will give up his life rather than truth. He will choose to die rather than kill. He will rather suffer himself than make others suffer. He will be as a friend even to his wife and entertain no carnal thoughts towards her. Thus the man of virtue practises brahmacharya and tries to conserve, as well as he can, the ultimate source of energy in the body. He does not steal, nor take bribes. He does not waste his time nor that of others. He does not accumulate wealth needlessly. He does not seek ease and comfort and does not use things he does not really need but is quite content to live
 a simple life. Firm in the belief that ‘‘I am the immortal spirit and not this perishable body and that none in this world can ever kill the spirit”, he casts out all fear of suffering of mind and body and of worldly misfortunes and refusing to be held down  even  by  an emperor, goes on doing his duty fearlessly.
 If our schools never succeed in producing this result, the students, the system of education and the teachers—all three must share the blame. It is, however, in the students’ own hands to make good the want of character. If they are not anxious to develop character, neither teachers nor books will avail them. Thus, as I have said earlier, we must first understand the aim of education. A student who desires to cultivate and build character will learn how to do so from any good book on the subject. As Tulsidas has said:
 The Lord of Creation has made all things in this world, animate and inanimate, an admixture of good and evil. But a good man selects the good and rejects the evil even as the fabled swan is said to help himself to milk leaving out water.libtech_120_footnote
 Being devoted to Rama, Tulsidas beheld him even in the image of Krishna. Some of our students attend  Bible  classes  as  required by rules but they  remain  innocent  of  the  teaching of the  Bible. One who reads the Gita with the intention of discovering errors in  it may well succeed in doing so. But to him who desires liberation, the Gita shows  the  surest  way  thereto.  Some people  see  nothing but imperfection in the Koran-e-Sharif, others, by meditating over it, fit themselves to cross the ocean of this earthly life. But I am afraid that most of the students never think as to the real aim of education. They attend school merely because that is the normal thing to do. Some do so in order to be able to obtain employment later on. In my humble opinion, to think of education as a means of earning a living betrays an unworthy disposition of mind. The body is the means of earning a living, while the school is a place for building character. To regard the latter as the means of fulfilling one’s bodily needs is like killing a buffalo for a small piece of hide. The body should be maintained through bodily work. How can the atman, the spirit, be employed for this purpose? “Thou shalt earn the bread by the sweat of thy brow”—this is a mahavakya of Jesus Christ. The Gita also seems to say the same. About 99 per cent of the people in this world follow this law and live without fear. “He who has given the teeth will
 
 also give the feed” is indeed a true saying. But it is not for the lazy and indolent. Students had better know from the very start that they will have to earn their living through bodily labour and not be ashamed of manual work to that end. I do not mean that all of us should always be plying the hoe. But it is necessary to understand that there is nothing wrong in plying the hoe to earn one’s living even though one may be engaged in some other avocation, and that labourers are in no way inferior to us. One who has accepted this as a principle and an ideal, will reveal himself as a man of pure and exceptional character in the way he does his work, no matter what profession he follows. Such a man will not be the slave of wealth; rather, wealth will be his slave. If I am right in this, students will have to acquire the habit of doing physical labour. I have said this for the benefit of those who look upon education as the means of earning their living.
 Students who attend school without taking thought as to the true aim of education, should first make sure what it should be. Such a student may resolve this very day that, henceforth, he will regard school as a place for building character. I am sure that he will effect a change for the better in his character in the course of a month and that his companions will also bear witness to his having done so. The shastras assert that we become what we think.
 Many students feel that it is not necessary to make any special effort for health. However, regular exercise is absolutely necessary for the body. What can be expected of a student who is not well equipped in health? Just as milk cannot be held in a paper container, so also education is not likely to remain for long in the paper-like bodies of our students. The body is the abode of the spirit and, therefore, holy like a place of pilgrimage. We must see that it is well protected. Walking regularly and energetically for an hour and a half in the morning and for the same period in the evening in open air keeps it healthy and the mind fresh. The time thus spent is not wasted. Such exercise, coupled with rest, will invigorate both the body and the intellect, enabling one to learn things more quickly. I think games like cricket have no place in a poor country like India. We have a number of inexpensive games of our own which afford innocent joy.
 The daily life of the student should be above reproach. He alone can experience true delight whose mind is pure. Indeed, to ask such a man to seek delight in worldly pleasures is to deprive him of the real delight which is his. He who has resolved to rise does indeed rise.
 Ramachandra, in his innocence, wished for the moon and he got it.
 From one point of view, the world seems to be an illusion; from another, it seems real enough. For students, the world does indeed exist, for it is they who have to strive for great achievement in it. He who declares the world to be illusory without knowing what that really means, indulges in pleasures as the fancy takes him and then claims to have renounced the world, is welcome to call himself a sannyasi but in reality he is a deluded man.
 This brings me to the subject of dharma. Where there is no dharma, there can be neither knowledge nor wealth, nor health, nor anything else. Where there is no dharma, life is devoid of all joy, is mere emptiness. We have had to go without instruction in dharma; we are in much the same position as the bridegroom’s party at a wedding without the bridegroom. Students cannot have innocent joy without a knowledge of dharma. That they may have such joy, it is necessary for them to study the shastras, to reflect over their teaching and bring their conduct in conformity with their ideals. Smoking a cigarette the first thing in the morning or idle gossip does good to nobody. Nazir has said that, even the sparrows as they twitter, sing the name of the Lord morning and evening, when we are still lying in our beds full- length. It is the duty of every student to acquire the knowledge of dharma in any manner he can. Whether or not dharma is taught in schools, it is my prayer to students who have assembled here that they introduce its essential principles in their life. What exactly is dharma? In what manner can instruction in religion be imparted? This is not the place for a discussion of this subject. But I shall give you this practical advice, based on my own experience, that you should take to the Ramacharitamanasa [of Tulsidas] and the Bhagavad Gita in love and reverence. You have a real jewel in the latter; seize it. But see that you study these two books in order to learn the secret of dharma. The seerswho wrote these works did not set out to write history but only to teach dharma and morals. Millions of people read these books and lead pure lives. They read them with a guileless heart and live in this world full of innocent joy. It never occurs to them even in a dream to ask whether or not Ravana was a historical figure or whether they might not kill their enemies as Rama killed Ravana. Even when face to face with enemies, they pray for Ramachandra’s protection and remain unafraid. Tulsidas, the author of the Ramayana, had nothing but compassion by way of a weapon. He desired to kill none. He who
 creates, destroys. Rama was God; He had created Ravana and so had the right to kill him. When any of us becomes God, he may consider whether he is fit to have the power to destroy. I have ventured to say this by way of introduction to these great books. I was, myself, a sceptic once and lived in fear of being destroyed. I have grown out of that stage and become a believer. I have thought it fit here to describe the influence which these books have had on me. For  Muslim  students, the Koran is the best book in this respect. I would counsel them as well that they study this book in a spirit of devotion. They should understand its true message. I feel, too, that both Hindus and Muslims should study each other’s religious scriptures with due  respect and try to understand them.
 From this most absorbing subject, I shall pass on to a topic of more worldly interest. It is often asked whether it is proper  for  students to take part in politics. I will let you know my opinion about it without going into the reasons. Politics has two aspects, theoretical study and practical activity. It is essential that students be introduced to the former, but it is harmful for them to concern themselves with the latter. They may attend political meetings or the sessions of the Congress in order to learn the science of politics. Such gatherings are useful as object-lessons. Students should have complete freedom to attend them and every effort should be made to get the recent ban on them removed. Students may not speak or vote at such meetings but may serve as volunteers if that does not interfere with their studies. No student can afford to miss an opportunity of serving Malaviyaji if one comes his way. Students should keep away from party politics. They should remain detached and cultivate respect for the leaders of the nation. It is not for them to judge the latter. Students easily respond to excellences of character, they adore them. They say it is the duty of students to look upon elders with reverence and respect their words. This is well said. He who has not learnt to respect others cannot hope for respect for himself. An attitude of insolence ill becomes students. In this respect, an unusual situation has come about in India. Older folk are careless how they behave, or fail to maintain their dignity. What are the students to do in these circumstances? As I imagine, a student should have regard for dharma. Such a student, when faced with a moral dilemma, should recall the instance of Prahlad. Placed in circumstances in which this boy respectfully disobeyed the commands of his father, we can act in like manner towards elders resembling the
 latter. But any disrespect shown to them beyond this will be wrong. It will ruin the community. An elder is so not merely by virtue of his age, but by virtue of the knowledge, experience and wisdom which age brings. Where these are absent, the elder’s position  depends  simply on his age. Nobody, however, worships age as such.
 Another question is: How can students serve the country ? The simple answer is that a student should study well, safeguarding his health meanwhile and cherishing the aim of using the fruits of his study in the service of the country. I am quite sure he will thereby serve his country. By living a purposeful life and taking care to be unmindful of our own interests and to work for others, we can achieve much with little effort. I want to tell you of one task of this kind. You must have seen my letter in the newspapers about the difficulties of third-class passengers. I suppose most of you travel third. These passengers spit in the compartment; they also spit out the remains of betel leaves and tobacco which they chew right in the carriage, and likewise throw the skins of bananas, etc., and other leavings on the floor of the carriage; they are careless in the use of the latrine and foul it. They smoke bidis and cigarettes without any regard for the convenience of fellow-passengers. We can explain to the other passengers in our compartment the harm that results from  their  dirtying the place. Most passengers respect students  and  listen  to them. They should not then miss these excellent opportunities of explaining the rules of hygiene to the masses. The eatables sold at stations are dirty. It is the duty of students, when they find the things dirty, to draw the attention of the traffic manager to the fact, whether he replies or no. And take care that you write to him in Hindi. When he receives many such letters, he will be forced to heed them. This is easy work to do but it will yield important results.
 I have spoken about the habits of chewing betel leaves and tobacco.  In my humble  opinion,  these  habits  are  both  harmful and unclean. Most of us, men and women, have become their slaves. We must be free of this slavery. A stranger visiting India will surely think that we are always eating some thing or the other. That the betel leaf, possibly, helps to digest food may be conceded, but food eaten in the proper quantity and manner is digested without any help from things like the betel leaf. Moreover, it does not have even an agreeable taste. And tobacco chewing must be given up as well. Students should always practise self-control. It is also necessary to consider the habit
 of smoking. Our rulers have set a bad example in this respect. They smoke cigarettes anywhere and everywhere. This has led  us  to consider smoking a fashion, and to turn our mouths into chimneys. Many books have been written to show that smoking is harmful. We call this age Kaliyuga. Christians believe that Jesus Christ will come again when selfishness, immorality, addiction to drugs and drink, etc., become rife. I shall not consider to what extent we may accept this as true. But I do feel that the world has been suffering a great deal from evils such as drinking, smoking, addiction to opium, ganja, hemp and so on. All of us are caught in this snare and so we cannot truly measure the magnitude of its unhappy consequences. It is my prayer that you, the students, keep away from them.
 This Conference has entered its seventeenth year. The speeches of the Presidents in previous years were sent to me I have  gone  through them. What is the object behind arranging these speeches? If it is that you may learn something from them, ask yourselves what you have learnt. If it is just to hear a beautiful flow of English words and enhance the prestige of the Conference, I feel sorry for you. I take it that these speeches are arranged with the idea that you may learn something from them and put it into practice. How many of you followed Smt. Besant’s advice and adopted the Indian mode of dress, simplified your food habits and gave up unclean talk or acted on Prof. Jadunath Sarkar’s advice and spent your vacations in teaching the poor, free of charge? I can put many questions. I do not ask for a reply. You may answer these questions to your own conscience. The worth of your learning will be judged by your actions. Stuffing your brains with the contents of hundreds of books may bring its reward but action is of much greater value by far. One’s stock of learning is of no more value than the action it leads to. The rest is an unnecessary burden. I would, therefore, always request you and urge you to  practise what you learn and what appears to you to be right. That is the only way to progress.

36,"October 19, 1917","SPEECH AT RECEPTION
BY MERCHANTS, BROACHlibtech_126_footnote","
    
 [After October 19, 1917]
 Merchants always have the spirit of adventure, intellect and wealth, as without these qualities their business cannot go on. But, now, they must have the fervour of patriotism in them. Patriotism is necessary even for religion. If the spirit of patriotism is awakened through religious fervour, then, that patriotism will shine out brilliantly. So it is necessary that patriotism should be roused in the mercantile community.
 The merchants take more part in public affairs now-a-days than before. When merchants take to politics through patriotism, swaraj is as   good  as   obtained.   Some   of   you   might   be    wondering how we can get swaraj. I lay my hand on my heart and say that, when the merchant class understands the spirit of patriotism, then only can we get swaraj quickly. Swaraj then will be quite a natural thing.
 Amongst the various keys which will unlock swaraj to us, the swadeshilibtech_127_footnotevow is the golden one. It is in the hands of the merchants to compel the observance of the swadeshi vow in the country, and this is an adventure which can be popularized by the merchants. I humbly request you to undertake this adventure and then you will see what wonders you can do.
 This being so, I have to say with regret that it is the merchant class which has brought ruin to the swadeshi practice and the swadeshi movement in this country. Complaints have lately risen in Bengal about the increase of rates, and one of them is against Gujarat. It is complained there that the prices of dhotis have been abnormally increased and dhotis go from Gujarat. No one wants you not to earn money, but it must be earned righteously and not be ill-gotten. Merchants must earn money by fair means. Unfair means must never be used.
 India’s strength lies with the merchant class. So much does not lie even with the army. Trade is the cause of war, and the merchant
 
 class has the key of war in their hands. Merchants raise the money and the army is raised on the strength of it. The power of England and Germany rests on their trading class. A country’s prosperity depends upon its mercantile community. I consider it as a sign of good luck that I should receive an address from the merchant class. Whenever I remember Broach, I will enquire if the merchants who have given me an address this day have righteous faith and patriotism. If I receive a disappointing reply, I will think that merely a wave of giving addresses had come over India and that I had a share in it.
 Speeches and Writings of Mahatma Gandhi
 "
37,,SPEECH AT SECOND GUJARAT EDUCATIONAL CONFERENCE,"
    
 BROACH,
 October 20, I917
 Gandhiji prefaced the speech with an apology to the audience:
 As it is already late, reading my speech will proceed beyond the time-limit fixed for it. I read it because I am under pressure from friends here to do so. When preparing the speech, I took the utmost care to see that it briefly expressed all that I wished to say, but it has become longer than I expected. I hope to be excused, therefore, if in reading it I exceed my time.
 Gandhiji then read the speech from a printed text.libtech_128_footnote
 DEAR SISTERS AND BROTHERS,
 You have done me a great honour in selecting me to be the President of this Conference. I know that I do not have the necessary learning for this office. I know, too, that my work in other spheres in the service of our country does not, and cannot, qualify me for the honour you have conferred on me today. I have but one qualification for it, that I would not, I am perfectly sure, be content with anything but the first place in a contest for demonstrating one’s love for Gujarati. Indeed, it is because I am confident of this that I have accepted this onerous responsibility. I hope that the generosity which has prompted you to give me this honour will also prompt you to forgive all my shortcomings, and help me in this work—which is as
 
 much yours as mine.
 This Conference is but a year old. Just as, in the case of a great man, we often find indications of his future greatness even in his infancy,  so  it  is  with  this  Conference.  I  have  read the  report  of its work for the last year. It is a report which would do credit to any institution. The Secretaries are to be congratulated on  having prepared and published this valuable report in time. It is our good fortune that we have such able secretaries. To those who have not yet read this report, I suggest that they do so and ponder over it.	The death of Shri Ranjitram Vavabhailibtech_129_footnotelibtech_130_footnotelast year has been a great loss to us. It is a matter of deep regret that a man of letters like him was snatched away from our midst in the prime of life; this should make us pause and think. May God grant peace to the departed soul. I would request the members of his family to take strength in the thought that we all share their grief.
 The organizationlibtech_131_footnotewhich has called this Conference has set three aims before itself:
  To 	create and 	give expression to 	public opinion on 	questions of education.  To 	carry on 	propaganda in 	regard to 	educational questions 	in Gujarat. To 	undertake  concrete 	 activities  for 	 promoting  education 	in Gujarat. 
 I shall endeavour to place before you the results of my thinking, such as it has been, on these three aims.
 It should be obvious to everyone that the first thing to do in this connection is to come to a definite decision about the medium of instruction. Unless that is done, all other efforts, I fear, are likely to prove fruitless. To impart education without first considering the question of the medium of instruction will be like raising a building without a foundation.
 On this point, two views prevail among educationists. Some hold that education should be imparted through the mother tongue; that is, through Gujarati. Others contend that it should be imparted through
 
 English. Both parties are honest in their views, for both have the welfare of the country at heart. But mere good intentions are not enough to gain the end we desire. It is the experience of the world that good intentions do occasionally take us to unworthy places We must, therefore, critically examine both these views and, if possible, come to a unanimous decision on this great and important question. There is no doubt whatsoever that the issue is of the utmost importance and we cannot consider it too carefully.
 This question concerns the whole of India. But each Presidency or Province may decide this matter for itself. It is erroneous to think that, until unanimity has been reached about it, Gujarat cannot go ahead by itself.
 We can, however, solve some of our difficulties by considering what they have done about it in other Provinces. At the time of the Bengal partitionlibtech_132_footnote, when the spirit of  swadeshi  was  at  its  height,  an effort was made there to impart education through Bengali. A national schoollibtech_133_footnotewas  also  started.  Money  poured   forth   in   plenty.   But   the experiment failed. In my humble opinion, the sponsors of the movement had no faith in their experiment. The teachers were in the same pitiable condition. In Bengal, the educated classes are blindly in love with English. It has been suggested that the progress made by Bengali literature in recent times is mainly due to the profound knowledge of English language and literature among the Bengalis. But the facts are against this assumption. The bewitching style of our beloved poet—Rabindranath Tagorelibtech_134_footnote—does not owe its excellence to his knowledge of English. Its source lies rather in his love for his own language. Gitanjali was originally written in Bengali. This great poet always uses his mother tongue when in Bengal. The great speech he recently made at Calcutta on present-day conditions in India was in Bengali. Among those who went to hear him were some of the most prominent men and women from his part of the country. And I have been told by those who heard him on the occasion that he kept the audience literally spell-bound for an hour-and-a-half with the flow of
 
 nectar-like stream of words. He has not borrowed his ideas from English literature. He says, he has acquired them from the atmosphere of this country. He has culled them from the  Upanishadslibtech_135_footnotelibtech_136_footnote.  It  is  our glorious Indian sky which has inspired him. I believe it is the same with other Bengali authors.
 When   Mahatma   Munshiramlibtech_137_footnotelibtech_138_footnote,   serene   and   sublime   like   the Himalayas, speaks in Hindi, men, women and children alike enjoy listening to him and follow him.  He  has  reserved  his  English  for his English friends. He does not make his [Hindi] speeches with English phrases in his mind.
 It is said that the English of the revered Madan Mohan Malaviyalibtech_139_footnotelibtech_140_footnote, who, though a householder, has dedicated  his  all  to  the country, shines like silver. Even the Viceroy has to take note of anything that Malaviyaji says. But, if his English is like shining silver, his Hindi, the flow of the Ganga that it is, shines like gold even as the latter does when flowing down from Manasarovar.
 These three great speakers have acquired this power  of eloquence not from their knowledge of English but from the love of their own language. Swami Dayanandlibtech_141_footnotelibtech_142_footnotedid great service to Hindi not because he knew English but because he loved the Hindi language. English had nothing to do with  Tukaramlibtech_143_footnotelibtech_144_footnoteand  Ramadaslibtech_145_footnotelibtech_146_footnoteshedding lustre  on  Marathi.  Premanandalibtech_147_footnoteand   Shamal   Bhattlibtech_148_footnoteand,   recently,
 
 Hadwar, a residential school for imparting education in the traditional Indian style through close communion with a guru
 Dalpatramlibtech_149_footnote, have greatly enriched Gujarati  literature;  their  glorious success is not to be attributed to their knowledge of English.
 The above examples prove beyond doubt that, for the enrichment of the mother tongue, what is needed is not knowledge of English but love for one’s own language and faith in it.
 We shall arrive at the same conclusion by examining the growth and development of various languages. A language mirrors the character of the people who use it. We acquire information about the manners and customs of the Negroes of South Africa by studying their native tongue. A language takes its form from the character and life of those who speak it. We can say without hesit-ation that the people whose language does not reflect the qualities of courage, truthfulness and compassion are deficient in those virtues. Importing of words expressive of courage or compassion from other tongues will not enrich or widen the content of a language nor make its speakers brave and kind. Courage is not to be had as a gift; if it is there within, covered with rust though it be, it will shine forth when that covering disappears. In our own mother tongue, we find a large number of words denoting an excess of meekness, because we have lived under subjection for many years. Similarly, no other language in the world has as many nautical terms as English. Supposing that an enterprising Gujarati writer were to render books on the subject from English into Gujarati, it would not add one whit to the range and power of our language, nor would it in any way increase our knowledge of ships. But as soon as we start building ships and raise a navy, the necessary technical phraseology will automatically establish itself. The late Rev. Taylor has expressed this same view in his book on Gujarati grammar. He says:
 One frequently hears people arguing whether the Gujarati language is perfect or imperfect. There is a proverb saying: “As the King, so the people”, and another “As the teacher, so the disciple”. In the same way, we might say, “As the speaker, so the language”. It does not appear that poets like Shamal Bhatt and others ever felt handicapped in expressing the innumerable thoughts in their minds because of any sense of deficiency in Gujarati. Indeed, they displayed such fine discrimination in the disposing of new and old words that whatever they said or wrote passed into currency and was incorporated in the speech of the people.
 
 In some respects, all the languages of the world are imperfect. When speaking of things beyond man’s limited intellect, of God and Eternity, we shall find every language imperfect. Language is but a function of man’s intellect. Hence, when the intellect fails to reach out to or fully comprehend a subject, the language [expressing the thought] will be imperfect. The general principle concerning a language is that the ideas which find expression in it reflect the minds of the people who speak it. If the people are courteous, so is their language; if the people are foolish, the language is equally so. All English proverb says: “A bad carpenter quarrels with his tools.” Those who complain of the imperfection of their language often do much the same. A student with a smattering of the English language and English learning may feel tempted to think that Gujarati is imperfect, for an accurate translation from English into one’s own mother tongue is difficult. The fault does not lie with the language but with the people who use it. Inasmuch as the people do not practise exercising their judgment to follow new  expressions,  new subjects and new styles, the writer hesitates to use them. Who  will  be foolhardy enough to sing in front of a deaf man? As long as the people are not ready to discriminate between good and bad, or new and old and evaluate things aright, how can we expect a writer’s genius to blossom forth ?
 Some of those who translate from English seem to labour under the impression that they have imbibed Gujarati with their mother’s milk and learnt English through study and are, therefore, perfect bilinguists. Why, they ask, should they study Gujarati? But surely acquisition of proficiency in one’s own language is more important than the effort spent over mastering a foreign one. Look up the works of poets like Shamal and others. Every verse bears evidence of study and labour. Gujarati may seem imperfect before one has struggled with it, but afterwards one will find it mature enough. He whose effort is half-hearted will wield the language but imperfectly; the writer or speaker whose effort is unsparing will likewise command Gujarati that is perfect; nay, it may even be polished. Gujarati, of the Aryan family, a daughter of Sanskrit, related to some of the best languages—who dare call her undeveloped?
 May God bless her! May she speak, till the end of ages, of wisdom and learning   ever   the   best   and   of   true    religion.    May    God,    the  Creator, grant us that we hear her praises from the mother and the student, for ever and for ever.
 Thus, we see that the failure of the movement to impart education through the medium of Bengali in Bengal does not show any inherent imperfection in that language or the futility of such an
 effort. We have considered the point about imperfection; as for  futility, the experiment in Bengal does not prove it. If anything, it only shows the incompetence of those who made the effort, or their lack of faith in it.
 In the North, Hindi is certainly making good progress. But a persistent effort to use it as the medium of instruction has been made only by the Arya Samajists in the gurukulas.
 In Madras, the movement for using the mother tongue as the medium of education started only a few years ago. The Telugu people are more active in this respect than the Tamilians. The latter are so dominated by the influence of English that they have little enthusiasm for making an effort to use Tamil as the medium of instruction. In the Telugu-speaking region, English education has not yet penetrated to the same extent. Therefore, the people in that part use the mother tongue more than the Tamilians. The Telugu people are not only carrying on experiments to impart education through their own language but have also started a movement for the redistribution of India on the basis of language. The movement is of recent origin, and is as yet in the initial stage. But so vigorous is their effort that it is not unlikely that we may see the idea being given a practical shape before long. There are rocks on the way, but their leaders have given me the impression that they have the strength all right to break them.
 Maharashtra is making the same attempt, sponsored by the great and  noble  Prof.  Karvelibtech_150_footnote.  Shri  Nayak  holds  the  same  view.  Private schools have taken up the task. With great effort, Prof. Vijapurkarlibtech_151_footnotehas revived his plan and we shall shortly see his school functioning. He had drawn up a plan for preparing text-books. Some of these have already been printed, others are ready in manuscript. The teachers of that school never wavered in their faith. If, unfortunately, it had not been closed, it would have by now settled the controversy whether or not Marathi can serve as the medium of education even at the highest level.
In Gujarat, too, this movement has got started. We know about it
 
 collaboration with Lokamanya Tilak, the Samartha Vidyalaya at Talegaon
 from the essay of R. B. Hargovinddas Kantawalalibtech_152_footnote. Prof. Gajjarlibtech_153_footnoteand the late Diwan Bahadur Manibhai Jasbhai may be regarded as the leaders of this movement. It is now for us to decide whether or not we should help the growth of the seeds sown by these persons. To my mind, there is no doubt that the more we delay, the greater our loss.
 It requires a minimum of 16 years to complete one’s education through the medium of English. If the same subjects were taught through the mother tongue, it would take ten years at the most. This is the opinion expressed by many experienced teachers. A saving of six years for each of the thousands of students means a saving of thousands of years for the nation.
 Education through a foreign language entails an excessive strain which only our boys could bear, they must needs pay dearly for it, though. To a large extent, they lose the capacity of shoulder-ing any other burden afterwards. Our graduates, therefore, are a useless lot, weak of body, without any zest for work, and mere imitators. They suffer an atrophy of the creative faculty and of the capacity for  original thinking, and grow up without the spirit of enterprise and the qualities of perseverance, courage and fearless-ness. That is why we are unable to make new plans or carry out those we make. A few who do show promise of these qualities usually die young. An Englishman has said that there is the same difference between Europeans and the people of other countries as between an original piece of writing and its impression on a piece of blotting paper. The element of truth in this statement is not to be attributed to any natural or innate incapacity on the part of the Asians. The reason lies, in a large measure, in the unsuitable med-ium of instruction. The natives of South Africa are enterpri-sing, strongly built and endowed with character. They do not have such evils as child marriage, etc., which we have, and yet their condition is similar to ours. Why? Because the medium of their education is Dutch. They are able to acquire mastery over  the  language within a short period as we do [over English], and like us they,  too,  become  weak  of   body and   mind   at   the   end   of   their
 
 “Compulsory Education in India”, 7-10-1905.
 education and often turn out to be mere imitators. From them, too, originality disapp-ears along with the mother tongue. It is only we, the English-educated people, who are unable to assess the great loss that results. Some idea of it may be had if we estimate how little has been our influence on the general mass of our people. The occasional remarks which our parents are led to make about the worthlessness of our education have some point. We get ecstatic over the achieve-ments of Boselibtech_154_footnoteand Raylibtech_155_footnote. But I am convinced that, had we been having our education through the mother tongue for 50 years, a Bose or a Ray would have occasioned no surprise among us.
 Ignoring for a while the question whether or not the new zeal and energy being exhibited by the Japanese at present is directed into the right channels, we find their enterprise really most remarkable. They have brought about the awakening of their people through the use of the mother tongue. That is why everything that they do bears the stamp of originality. They are now in a position to teach their teachers. They have belied the comparison [of non-Euro-pean peoples] with blotting paper. The life of the Japanese is throb-bing with vitality and the world looks on in amazement. The system under which we are educated through a foreign language results in incalculable harm.
 The continuity that should exist, on the one hand, between the culture the child imbibes along with the mother’s milk and the sweet words it receives and, on the other, the training school, is broken when education is imparted through a foreign tongue. Those who are responsible for this are enemies of the people, howsoever honest their motives. To be a voluntary victim of this system of education is to betray one’s duty to one’s mother. The harm done by this educa-tion received through a foreign tongue does not stop here but goes much further. It has created a gulf between the educated classes and the masses. We do not know them and they do not know us. They regard us as sahibs to be feared and may distrust us. If this state of affairs continues very long, the time may come when Lord Curzon’slibtech_156_footnotecharge
 
 that the educated classes do not represent the common people would be true.
 Fortunately, our educated classes appear to be awakening from their slumber. Now that they are beginning to come in contact with the people, they themselves realize the handicaps described above. How may they infect the people with their own enthusiasm? English certainly will not avail us, whereas we have little or no aptitude to do the thing through Gujarati. I always hear people say that they experience great difficulty in expressing themselves in the mother tongue. This barrier dams up the current of popular life. Macaulay’slibtech_157_footnotemotive in introducing English education was sincere. He despised our literature. His contempt infected us, too, and we also lost our balance. Indeed, we have left our masters, the English, far behind us in this matter. Macaulay wanted us to become prop-agandists of Western civilization among our masses. His idea was that English education would help us to develop strength of character and then some of us would disseminate new ideas among the people. It would be irrelevant here to consider whether or not those ideas were good enough to be spread among the people. We have only to consider the question of the medium of instruction. We saw in English education an opportunity to earn money and, therefore, gave importance to the use of English. Some learned patriotism from it. Thus the original idea became secondary and we suffered much harm from the  use  of English which extended beyond Macaulay’s original intention.
 If we had political power in our hands, we would have discov- ered the error soon enough and would have found it impossible to give up the mother tongue. The officials did not give it up. Many perhaps do not know that our court language is supposed to be Gujarati. The Government gets the laws translated into Gujarati as well. Speeches read at durbars are translated into Gujarati simult- aneously. We know that in currency notes Gujarati is used alongside with English. Mathematical calculations which land-surveyors have to learn are difficult. If they had to do so through English, the work of the Revenue Department would have become very expensive. So they evolved Gujarati terminology for the use of the surveyors. These
 
 terms will give us a pleasant surprise. If we have a sincere love for our language, we can this very moment put to use the resources at our disposal. If lawyers start using Gujarati for their work, much of the clients’ money would be saved. Clients would also get the requisite knowledge of law and come to know their rights. The expenses on the services of interpreters would also be saved. Legal terms would pass into current use. Of course, lawyers would have to put themselves to some trouble to do all this. I believe, and the belief is supported by experience, that this will not harm the interests of the client. There is no reason to fear that arguments in Gujarati would carry less weight with the Court than in English. It is compulsory for Collectors and other Government officials to know Gujarati. But, because of our unreasoning craze for English, we allow their knowl-edge to rust.
 It has been contended that there was nothing wrong in our people learning English and using it for earning money  and cultivating a sense of patriotism through it. But the contention has no bearing on the use of English as the medium of instruction. We shall respect a person who learns English for acquiring wealth or for doing good to the country. But we cannot, on this  account,  assert  that English should be used as the medium of instruction. All that is intended here is to bring out the harmful consequences of English having established itself as the medium of education because of these two developments. There are some who hold that English-knowing people alone have displayed patriotism. For the past two months, we have been witnessing something very different. We may, however, accept this claim with the modification that others never had the opportunity which the English knowing people had. The patriotism induced by the knowledge of English has not been infectious. Real patriotism is an expanding force which is ever propagating itself. The patriotism of English-knowing people lacks this quality.
 It is said that, however correct these arguments, the idea is not practicable today. “It is a pity that the study of other subjects should have to suffer because of the excessive importance given to English. And it is to be deplored that much of our mental energy is used up in mastering it. But, in my humble opinion, the way we are placed in relation to English leaves us no alternative but to accept the present arrangement and then find a way out.” This is the view not of any ordinary writer but of one of the foremost scholars of Gujarat and a great lover of our mother tongue. We cannot but take into account
 anything  that  Acharya  Dhruvalibtech_158_footnotelibtech_159_footnotesays.  Few  can   claim   to   have   the experience that he has. He has rendered great service in the fields of education and literature. He has a perfect right to advise and criti-cize. That being so, a man like me has to think twice before exp-res-sing a different opinion. Shri Anandshankarbhai has expressed in courteous language the view held by the entire body of the advo-cates of English. We are in duty bound to give consideration to this point of view. Besides, my position in respect of this is somewhat awkward. I am conducting an experiment in National Education under his guidance and supenision. In this experiment we are using the mother tongue as the medium of education. In view of such close relations between us, I naturally hesitate to write anything in criticism of his views. Fortunately, Acharya Dhruva has considered education through English and that through the mother tongue only as experiments and has not expressed any definite opinion about either. I do not,  therefore, feel as much hesitation in voicing my opposition to the above view as I otherwise would.
 We attach excessive importance to our relationship with English. I am aware that we cannot discuss this question with unrest-ricted freedom in this Conference. But it is not improper to tell even those who cannot take part in political affairs that the British rule in India should be for the good of our country. There can be no other justification for it. The British rulers themselves admit that for one nation to rule over another is an intolerable situation for both, that it is evil and harms both. This is accepted in principle in discussions which recognize the altruistic point of view. Therefore, if it is proved to the satisfaction of both the rulers and the ruled that education through English saps the mental energy of our people, then, no time should be lost in changing the medium of instruction. The obstacles that lie in the way will then be a challenge to us. If this view is accepted, it should not be necessary to give any further argument to convince those who, like Acharya Dhruva, admit the [present] drain on our mental energy.
 I do not think it necessary to consider whether or not the adoption of the mother tongue as the medium of instruction will have any adverse effect on the knowledge of English. It is not essential for all educated Indians to have a mastery of this alien language. Not only
 
 that, I even maintain, in all humility, that it is unnecessary to go out of one’s way to create the desire for such mastery.
 It is true that some Indians will have to learn English. Acharya Dhruva seems to have looked at this question only from the point of view of higher education. If, however, we consider it from all angles, it will be seen that two classes of people will need to learn English:
  Public-spirited 	people who possess 	special aptitude for 	languages, have 	time on their 	hand and want to study 	English literature in 	order to put 	the fruits of 	their learning before 	our people, 	or use 	them in their 	contacts with the rulers.  Those 	who want 	to use 	their knowledge 	of English 	for economic 	gain. 
 There is no harm in giving both these groups a thorough knowledge of English as an optional subject. We should even provide the necessary facilities for it. But in this arrangement the medium of instruction will be the mother tongue. Acharya Dhruva fears that, if we do not adopt English as the medium but learn it merely as a foreign language, it will share the fate of Persian, Sanskrit, etc. I must say, with due respect to the Acharya, that this view is not quite correct. There are many Englishmen who know French well and are able to use it satisfactorily for their work even though they received their education through English. In India, too, there are a number of Indians whose knowledge of French is quite good, though they learned it through the medium of English. The truth is that, when English comes to occupy its own place and the mother tongue has gained its rightful status, our minds which are imprisoned at present will be set free from the prison-house and, for brains which are well cultivated, well exercised and yet fresh, learning English will not be too much of a strain. I even believe that the English we learn under such conditions will be more of a credit to us than it is at present. What is more, with our intelligence vigorous and fresh, we shall be able to use it to better advantage. From the practical point of view of gain and loss, the course proposed will be found effective in promoting all our interests.
 When we start receiving education through our own language, our relations in the home will take on a different character. Today, we cannot make our wives real life-companions. They have very little idea of what we do outside. Our parents know nothing about what we learn at school. If, however, we were to receive education through our mother tongue, we would find it easy to educate the washerman, the
 barber, the Bhangilibtech_160_footnoteand others who serve us. In England, they discuss politics with the hair-dresser while having a hair-cut. Here, we cannot do so even with the members of our own families. The reason is not that they are ignorant. They, too, know as much as the English barber. We talk with them on the Mahabharata, the Ramayana and of holy places, because it is these things which our people hear and learn about. But, the knowledge we get at school does not seep down to others, not even to the members of our families, because we cannot impart to them what we learn in English.
 At present the proceedings of our Legislative Assemblies are in English. It is the same story with other bodies. Consequently, the riches of our knowledge lie buried in the ground, much  like  the wealth of the miser. The same thing happens in our courts of law. The judges offer useful counsel. Litigants are eager enough to know what they say, but they get to know nothing except the dry judgment at the end. They cannot even follow the arguments of their lawyers. It is the same with doctors, educated in schools through English. They cannot educate the patients as may be required. They do not even know the Gujarati names for the various parts of the body. In consequence, most of them show no interest in their patients except to write out prescriptions for them. It is said that, in our thoughtlessness, we allow huge masses of water flowing down the hills to go waste. In the same way, we produce precious manure worth millions, but, in the result, we get only diseases. Similarly, crushed under the weight of English and wanting in foresight, we fail to give our people what they are entitled to get. This is no exaggeration. It only expresses the intensity of my feeling on this point. We shall have to pay heavily for our disregard of the mother tongue. This has aIready done us great harm. I consider it the first duty of the educated to save our masses from any further harrn on this account.
 There can be no limit to the development of Gujarati, the language of Narasinh Mehtalibtech_161_footnote, the  language  in  which  Nandshankar wrote   Karanghelolibtech_162_footnote,   which   has   been   cultivated   by   writers   like
 
 Navalramlibtech_163_footnotelibtech_164_footnote, Narmadashankarlibtech_165_footnotelibtech_166_footnote, Manilallibtech_167_footnotelibtech_168_footnote,  Malabarilibtech_169_footnotelibtech_170_footnote,  in  which  the  late poet Rajchandralibtech_171_footnotelibtech_172_footnote, uttered his immortal words, a language which has Hindu, Muslim and Parsi communities to serve it, which has had, among those who use it, men of holy lives, men of wealth, and daring sailors voyaging across the seas, and in which heroic stories celebrating Mulu Manek and Jodha Maneklibtech_173_footnotelibtech_174_footnoteeven today resound in the hills of Kathiawad. What else can one expect of Gujaratis if they do not use such a language for their education? The pity is that the point needs to be argued.
 Finally, while bringing this topic to a close, I draw your attention to the articles of Dr. Pranjivandas Mehta on this subject. Gujarati translations of these articles have been published and I suggest that you read them. You will find in them many ideas which support these views.
 If, now, we are convinced that it is good to adopt the mother tongue as the medium of instruc.tion, the next thing is to consider the steps to implement the decision. Without going into any argument, I set down what these steps should be just in the order in which they occur to me:
  English-knowing 	Gujaratis should 	never, intentionally 	or inadvertently, use 	English among themselves.  Those 	who possess 	a sound 	knowledge of both 	English and Gujarati 	should translate into 	Gujarati good 	and useful 	books or 	ideas in English.  Societies 	for the promotion 	of education 	should get 	text books prepared.  The 	rich among us 	should start 	schools in 	various places for 	imparting education 	through Gujarati. 
 
 Swami Vivekanand refers in one of his letters to a paper by him which was read at one  of the sectional meetings of the Parliament of Religions.
  At 	the same time, various 	Conferences and 	Educational Associations 	should petition the 	Government for 	using the 	mother tongue as 	the sole 	medium of instruction. 	Courts and 	legislatures should 	carry on their 	proceedings in 	Gujarati and 	people should also use 	Gujarati in 	all their 	work. The prevailing 	practice of 	selecting only 	those who 	know English for 	lucrative posts should 	be changed 	 and  the 	candidates should 	be selected according 	to merit 	and without 	discrimination on 	the basis of 	language. A 	petition should also 	go to the Government 	that schools 	be opened 	where Government 	servants may 	acquire the 	necessary knowledge of Gujarati. 
 Exception may be taken to this programme on one count. It will be said that in the Legislative Assemblylibtech_175_footnotelibtech_176_footnotethere are Marathi, Sindhi and Gujarati members and, maybe, from Karnatak as well. The difficulty is serious enough, but not insurmountable. The Telugu-speaking people have already raised this question and there is no doubt that some day there will have to be a reorganization of provinces on the basis of language. But, meanwhile, members of the Assembly should have the right to speak either in Hindi or in their mother tongue. If you find this suggestion ridiculous today; I need only say—with due respect to you—that most radical suggestions seem similarly ridiculous in the beginning and on a superficial view. I am of the opinion that the progress of our country will largely depend on our deciding aright the question of the medium of education. I think, therefore, that my suggestion is of great consequence. When the mother tongue is better esteemed and has been restored to its rightful status—that  of  an official language—it will reveal powers and capacities undreamt of at present.
 As  we  have  had  to  consider  the   question  of   the   medium of education, so  also  is  it  necessary  to  consider  that  of the  national language. If this is to be English, it must be made a compulsory subject.
 Can English become our national language? Some of our learned men, good patriots, contend that even to argue that English should become the national language betrays ignorance, that it is already so. His Excellency the Viceroylibtech_177_footnotelibtech_178_footnotein his recent speech merely expressed the hope that it would occupy this place. His zeal did not
 
     Sind.       
 carry him as far as to say that it had already become our national language and that there could be no question about it. He believes, however, that English will spread in the country day by day, enter our homes, and finally attain the exalted status of a national language. On  a superficial consideration, this view appears correct. Looking at the educated section of our population, one is likely to  gain the impression that, in the absence of English, all our work would come to a stop. But deeper reflection will show that English cannot, and ought not to, become our national language.
Let us see what are the requirements of a national language:
 It 	should be 	easy to 	learn for 	Government officials.  It 	should be 	capable of 	serving as 	a medium of 	religious, economic and 	political intercourse 	throughout India. It 	should be 	the speech 	of large 	numbers of Indians. It 	should be 	easy for 	every Indian to learn.  In	choosing 	such a language, 	considerations of 	temporary or 	passing circumstances 	should not count. 
English does not fulfil any of these requirements.
 The first point ought to have been placed last, but I have purposely reversed the order because it seems as  though  English fulfils it. Closer examination will, however, show that even at the present moment it is not for officials an easy language to learn or handle. The Constitution, under which we are being ruled, envisages that the number of British officials will progressively decrease until finally only the Viceroy and a few others are left here. Even now, the majority of people in Government services are Indians and their number will increase as time passes. I think no one will deny that for them English is more difficult than any Indian language.
 As regards the second requirement, I think that religious intercourse through English is an impossibility unless our people throughout the land start speaking English. Spreading English among the masses to this extent appears quite impossible.
 English simply cannot satisfy the third requirement as it is not the speech of any very large number of Indians.
 The fourth also cannot-be met by English because it is not relatively an easy language for all our people to learn.
Considering the fifth point, we see that the status which English
 enjoys today is temporary; as a permanent arrangement, the position is that the need for English in national affairs will be, if at all, very slight. It will be required for dealings with the British Empire and will remain the language of diplomacy between different countries within the Empire; this is a different matter. It will certainly remain necessary for such purposes. We do not grudge English anything. We only want that it should not overstep its proper limits; this is all that we insist upon. English will remain the imperial language and accordingly we shall require our Malaviyas, our Shastris and our Banerjeas to learn it,libtech_179_footnoteconfident that they will enhance the glory of India in other lands. But English cannot be the national language of India. To give it that position will be like introducing Esperanto into our country. To think that English can become our national language betrays weakness, as the attempt to introduce Esperanto would betray sheer ignorance.
 Which language, then, fulfils all the five requirements? We shall have to admit that it is Hindi.
 I call that language Hindi which Hindus and Muslims in the North speak and which is written either in Devanagari or Urdu script. There has been some objection to this definition.
 It is argued that Hindi and Urdu are two different languages. But this is incorrect. Both Hindus and Muslims speak the same language in North India. The difference has been created by the educated classes. That is, educated Hindus Sanskritize their Hindi with the result that Muslims cannot follow it. Muslims of Lucknow Persianize their Urdu and make it unintelligible to Hindus. To the masses both these languages are foreign and so they have no use for them. I have lived in the North and have mixed freely with both Hindus and Muslims, and, though my knowledge of Hindi is limited; I have never found any difficulty in carrying on  communication  through it with them. Therefore, call it Hindi or Urdu as you like, the language of the people in North India is the same thing—basically. Write it in the Urdu script and call it Urdu, or write it in the Nagari script and call it Hindi.
 There now remains the question of the script. For the present, Muslims will certainly use the Urdu script and most of the Hindusthe Devanagari. I say “most” because thousands of Hindus even today
 
 write in the Urdu script and some even do not know the Devanagari script. In the end, when Hindus and Muslims will have ceased to  regard each other with distrust, when the causes for such distrust have disappeared, the script which has greater range and is more popular will be more widely used and thus become the national script. In the intervening period, Hindus and Muslims who desire to write their petitions in the Urdu script should be free to do so and these should be accepted at all Government offices.
 No other language can compete with Hindi in satisfying these five requirements. Next to Hindi comes Bengali. But the Bengalis themselves make use of Hindi outside Bengal. The Hindi-speaking man speaks Hindi wherever he goes and no one feels surprised at this. The Hindu preachers and the Mahomedan Moulvis always deliver their religious discourses in Hindi and Urdu and even the illiterate masses understand them. Even an unlettered Gujarati, when he goes to the North, attempts to speak a few Hindi words, but the man from the North who works as gate-keeper for the Bombay  businessman declines to speak in Gujarati and it is the latter, his employer, who is obliged to speak to him in broken Hindi. I have heard Hindi spoken even in far-off Dravidian provinceslibtech_180_footnotelibtech_181_footnote. It is not correct to say that in Madras one needs English. Even there, I have used Hindi for all my work. In the trains, I have heard hundreds of Madrasi passengers speaking to others in Hindi. Besides, the Muslims of Madras know good enough Hindi. It should be noted that  Muslims  throughout India speak Urdu and they are found in large number in every province. Thus Hindi has already established itself as the national language of India. We have been using it as such for a long time. The birth of Urdu itself is due to the aptness of Hindi for this purpose.
 Muslim kings could not make Persian or Arabic the national language. They accepted the Hindi grammar  and,  employing  the Urdu script, used more Persian words. They could not use a foreign tongue in their dealings with the masses. It is not as if the British are unaware of this position. Those who know anything about military affairs know that they have had to adopt Hindi and Urdu technical terms for use with the sepoys.
 Thus, we see that Hindi alone can become  our  national language, though the matter presents some difficulty to the educated
 
 classes of Madras.
 For Maharashtrians, Gujaratis, Sindhis and Bengalis, the thing is very easy. In a few months they can acquire enough command of Hindi to be able to use it for all-India intercourse. It is not so easy for Tamil friends. Tamil and other languages of the South belong to the Dravidian group. The structure and the grammar of these languages are different from those of Sanskrit. There is nothing in common between these two groups except certain words. But the difficulty in learning Hindi is confined to the present educated classes only. We are entitled to trust to their patriotic spirit and hope that they will make a special effort to learn Hindi. As for the future, if Hindi attains its due status, it will be introduced in every school in Madras and there will be increased possibilities of contact between Madras and other provinces. English has failed to reach the Dravidian masses, but Hindi will do so in no time. The Telugu people have already started moving in this direction. If this Conference reaches a decision on the question of the national language, we shall have to think of ways and means of implementing the decision. The measures suggested  for  the  promotion of the mother tongue could, with suitable modifications, be applied to the national language as well. The difference is that the responsibility for making Gujarati the medium of instruction in our province will have to be shouldered mainly by us, whereas, in the movement to popularize the national language, the whole country will play its part.
 We have discussed the question of the medium of instruction, the national language and, incidentally, the place of English. We have now to consider whether there are any defects in the present system of education in the schools.
 There is no difference of opinion on this point. Both the Government and public opinion condemn the present system. There are, however, differences of view regarding what aspects are fit to be preserved and what to be rejected. I am not competent enough to discuss these differences. I shall only venture to place before this Conference my own conclusions.
 Since education is not exactly my sphere of work, I feel diffident in saying anything on this subject. When I see a person talk about a thing of which he has no practical experience and which is, therefore, outside his range, I want to tell him off and grow impatient with him. It would be natural for a lawyer to feel impatient and angry
 with a physician talking of law. In the same way, I hold that those who have no experience in the field of education have no right to offer criticism on matters connected with it. I should, therefore, like to say a few words about my qualifications to speak on this subject.
 I started thinking about  modern  educationlibtech_182_footnotelibtech_183_footnotetwenty-five  years ago. I had my children and the children of my brothers and sisters to look after. I was aware of the defects in our schools. I  therefore carried out experiments on my children. No doubt, I tossed them about a good deal in the process. Some I sent to one place and some to others. A few I taught myself. My dissatisfaction with the prevailing system remained the same as ever even after I had left for South Africa, and I had to apply my mind further to the subject The management of the Indian Education Societylibtech_184_footnotelibtech_185_footnotewas in my hand for a long time. I never sent my boys to school. My eldest son was a witness to the different stages through which I passed. He left me in disappointment and studied at a school in Ahmedabad for some time. But, as he realized later, this did not benefit him particularly. I am convinced that those whom I did not send to school have not stood to suffer and that they have received a good training indeed. I am conscious of their deficiencies, but these are due to the fact that they grew up while my experiments were in their early stages and they were, therefore, victims of the modifications which the experiments went through despite the continuity of the general pattern. During the satyagraha struggle in South Africa, there were fifty boys studying under my supervision.libtech_186_footnotelibtech_187_footnoteThe general line of work in the school was laid down by me. It had nothing in common with the system in vogue in Government or other schools. A similar effort is now being made here and  a  National  Schoollibtech_188_footnotelibtech_189_footnotehas  been  started  in   Ahmedabad   with  the blessings of Acharya Dhruva and other scholars. It is now five months old. Prof. Sankalehand Shah, formerly of the Gujarat College, is its Principal. He received his education under Prof. Gajjar and there are many other lovers of the language associated with him. In the main,

 the responsibility for the scheme is mine, but it has the active approval of all the teachers connected with it. They have dedicated themselves to the work, content to receive a salary just enough to meet their needs. Though circumstances do not permit me to undertake actual teaching work in this school, its affairs constantly engage  my  attention. Thus, my contribution is more like an amateur’s but, I believe, not altogether devoid of thought. I would request you to keep this in mind in considering my criticism of the prevailing system of education.
 It has always appeared to me that the present  system  of education pays no attention to the general pattern of life in our families. Naturally enough, our needs were not taken into account when the scheme was drawn up.
 Macaulay despised our literature. He thought we were over- much given to superstitions. Most of those who drew up this scheme were utterly ignorant of our religion. Some of them thought that it was a false religion. Our scriptures were regarded as mere collections of superstitions. Our civilization seemed full of defects to  them. Because we had fallen on evil times, it was thought that our institutions must be defective. With the best of motives, therefore, they raised a faulty structure. Since a fresh start was being made, the planners could only think of the immediate needs of the situation. The whole thing was devised with this idea in mind, that the rulers would need lawyers, doctors, and clerks to help them and that the people should have the new knowledge. Consequently, books were written without any regard for our way of living. Thus, to use an English proverb, “The cart was placed before the horse”.
 Shri Malabari said that, if History and Geography were to be taught to children, a beginning should be made with the history and geography of the home. I remember, however, that I was made to memorize the counties of England, with the result that an interesting subject like geography became poison to me. I found nothing in History to enthuse me. History is a good means of inculcating patriotism. But the way it was taught in the school gave me no reason to take pride in this country. To learn that, I have had to read other books.
 In teaching Arithmetic and other allied subjects, too, the traditional method hardly finds any place. It is almost completely abandoned. With the disappearance of the indigenous method of learning tables, we have lost the capacity for making speedy
 calculations which our elders possessed.
 Science tends to be dry and dull. Our children cannot make much use of what they are taught in this field. A science like astronomy which should be taught to the boys in the open by actually showing them the stars in the sky is taught through books. I do not think many boys remernber how to decompose water into its constituent elements once they leave school.
 As to Hygiene, it is no exaggeration to say that it is not taught at all. We do not know, after 60 years of education, how to protect ourselves against epidemics like cholera and plague. I consider it a very serious blot on the state of our education that our doctors have not found it possible to eradicate these diseases. I have seen hundreds of homes. I cannot say that I have found any evidence in them of a knowledge of hygiene. I have the greatest doubt  whether  our graduates know what one should do in case one is bitten by a snake. If our doctors could have started learning medicine at an earlier age, they would not make such a poor show as they do. This is the disastrous result of the system under which we are educated. People in almost all the parts of the world have managed to eradicate the plague. Here it seems to have made a home and thousands of Indians die untimely deaths. If this is to be attributed to poverty, it would still be up to the Education Department to answer why, even after 60 years of education, there is poverty in India.
 Let us now turn our attention to the subjects which are  not taught at all. All education must aim at building character. I cannot see how this can be done except through religion. We are yet  to realize that gradually we are being reduced to a state in which we shall have lost our own without having acquired the new. I cannot go more into this, but I have met hundreds of teachers and they sighed in pain as they told me of their experiences. This is an aspect which the Conference cannot but deeply ponder over. If pupils in schools lose their character, everything will have been lost.
 In our country, 85 to 90 per cent of people are engaged in agriculture. Needless to say that no knowledge of this particular field of work can be too much. And yet it has no place at all in the school syllabus up to the end of the high school education. It is only in India that such an anomalous position can exist.
 The weaving industry is also falling into ruin. It provided work to farmers during their free hours. The craft finds no place in the
 curriculum. Our education can only produce clerks and, its general tendency being what it is, even goldsmiths, blacksmiths and cobblers, once they are caught up in its meshes, be come clerks. We desire that everyone should have a good education. But how will it profit us if our education makes us all clerks ?
 Military science finds no place in our education. Personally, I am not unhappy over this. I even regard it as an accidental gain. But the people want to learn the use of arms. Those who do so should not be denied the opportunity of learning it. But this science seems to have been completely lost sight of, as it were, in our scheme of education.
 Nowhere do I find a place given to music. It  exercises  a powerful influence over us. We do not realize this vividly enough, otherwise we would have done everything possible to teach music to our boys and girls. The Vedic hymns seem to follow musical tunes in their composition. Harmonious music has the power to soothe the anguish of the soul. At times, we find restlessness in a large gathering. This can be arrested and calmed if a national song is sung by all. That hundreds of boys may sing a poem full of courage and the spirit of adventure and bravery and be inspired with the spirit of heroism is no commonplace fact. We have an example of the power of music in the fact that boatmen and other labourers raise, in unison, the cry of Harahar and Allabeli and this helps them in their work. I have seen English friends trying to fight cold by singing songs. Our boys learn to sing songs from popular plays in all manner of tunes and without regard to time and place, and try their hands on noisy harmoniums and Other instruments, and this does them harm. If, instead, they were to be correctly trained in music, they would not waste their time singing, or attempting to sing, music-hall songs. Just as a  trained singer never sings out of tune or at the wrong time, even so one who has learnt classical music will not go in for street music. Music must get a place in our efforts at popular awakening. The views of Dr. Ananda Coomaraswamilibtech_190_footnotelibtech_191_footnoteon this subject are worthy of serious study.
 I include in the term “physical training” sports, games, etc. These, too, have been little thought of. Indigenous games have been given up and tennis, cricket and football hold sway. Admit-tedly, these games are enjoyable. If, however, we had not been carried away by
 
 enthusiasm for all things Western, we would not have given up our inexpensive but equally interesting games like gedi-dado, gilli-danda, kho-kho, mag-matali, kabaddi, kharo pat, nava nagelio, sat tali, etc. Exercises which provided the completest training for every bodily organ and the old style gymnasium where they taught wrestling have almost totally disappeared. I think if anything from the West deserves copying, it is drill. A friend once remarked that we did not know how to walk, particularly when we had to walk in squads and keep step. Silently to walk in step, by hundreds and thousands of us in twos and fours, shifting the directions from time to time is something we can never do. It is not that such drill is useful only in actual battle. It can be of great use in many other activities in the sphere of public service. For example, in extinguishing fire, in rescuing people from drowning, in carrying the sick and disabled in a  dolilibtech_192_footnote, etc., [previous practice in] drill is a valuable aid. Thus, it is necessary to introduce in our schools indigenous games, exercises and the Western type of drill.
 The education of women is as faulty as that of men. No thought has been given to the relations of men and women or to the place of woman in Indian society.
 Primary education for the two sexes can have much in common. There are important differences at all other levels. As Nature has made men and women different, it is necessary to maintain a difference between the education of the two. True, they are equals in life, but their functions differ. It is woman’s right to rule the home. Man is master outside it. Man is the earner, woman saves and spends. Woman looks after the feeding of the child. She shapes its future. She is responsible for building its character. She is her children’s educator, and hence, mother to the Nation. Man is not father [in that sense]. After a certain period, a father ceases to influence his son; the mother never abdicates her place. The son, even after attaining manhood, will play with the mother even as the child does. He cannot do that with his father.
 If this is the scheme of Nature, and it is just as it should be, woman should not have to earn her living. A state of affairs in which women have to work as telegraph clerks, typists or compositors can be,   I think, no good, such a people must be bankrupt and living on their capital.
 
 Hence, just as, on the one hand, it is wrong to keep women in ignorance and under suppression, so, on the other, it is a sign of decadence and it is tyrannical to burden them with work which is ordinarily done by men.
 There must be provision, therefore, for separate arrangements for the education of women after their attaining a certain age. They should be taught the management of the home, the things they should or should not do during pregnancy, and the nursing and care of children. Drawing up such a scheme presents difficulties. The idea is new. The right course would be to constitute a committee of men and women, of good character and well-informed, who would  think  further and arrive at conclusions, and ask them to produce a suitable plan for the purpose.
 This committee should consider measures for the education of girls from the time that they cease to be children. There is, however, a very large number of girls who have been married off before puberty, and the number is increasing. Once they are married, they just disappear from the field. I have given my views on this  in  my foreword to the first book of the “Bhagini Samaj” series. I reproduce them here:
 We shall not solve the problem of women’s education merely by educating girls. Victims of child marriage, thousands of girls vanish from view at the early age of twelve. They change into house-wives! Till this wicked custom has disappeared from among us, the husband will have to learn to be  the  wife’s teacher. A great many of our hopes lie  in  women  being educated on matters mentioned above. It seems to me that unless women cease to be a mere means of pleasure or cooks to us and come to be our life-companions, equal partners in the battle of life, sharers in our joys and sorrows, all our efforts are doomed to failure. There are men to whom their women are no better than animals. For, this sad state, some of the Sanskrit sayings and a well-known  dohalibtech_193_footnoteof Tulsidas may be held responsible. Tulsidas says at one place: “The drum, the fool, the Sudra, the animal and the woman—all these need beating.”libtech_194_footnote
 I adore Tulsidasji, but adoration is not blind. Either this couplet is an interpolation, or, if it is his, he must have
 
 to the Sanskrit sayings, people seem to labour under the impression that every verse in that language was a scriptural precept. We must fight this impression and pluck out from its very root the general habit of regarding women as inferior beings. On the other hand, blinded by passion, many among us regard women as beautiful dolls to be adored as so many goddesses and decorate them with ornaments just as we have Thakorjilibtech_195_footnotelibtech_196_footnotedressed up in new finery every few hours. We must keep away from this evil also. Ultimately, however, there can be salvation for us only when—and not until—our women become to us what Umalibtech_197_footnotelibtech_198_footnotewas to Shankarlibtech_199_footnotelibtech_200_footnote, Sita to Rama and Damayanti to Nala, joining us in our deliberations, arguing with  us, appreciating and nourishing our aspirations, understanding, with their marvellous intuition, the unspoken anxieties  of  our outward life and sharing in them, bringing us the peace that soothes. This goal can hardly be achieved in the immediate future merely by starting girls’ schools. As long as we have around our necks the noose of child marriage, men have to be teachers to their wives, and that not merely to make  them  literate. Gradually, it should be possible to introduce women to the subjects of politics and social reform. Literacy  is  not essential for this. The man, in such a case, will have to change his attitude to his wife. If a girl were treated as a pupil till she came of age, the husband observing brahmacharya the while, if we had not been pressed down by the weight of inertia,  we would never subject a girl of twelve or fifteen to the agony of child-bearing. One ought to shudder at the very thought of it.
 Classes are now conducted for married women and lectures arranged. All this is good as far as it goes. Those who are engaged in this work make a sacrifice of their time. This is to the credit side. It seems to me, however, that unless men simultaneously discharge the duty indicated above, these efforts will not produce much result. A little reflection will show this to be self-evident.
 Wherever we look, we find heavy structures raised on weak foundations. Those selected as teachers for primary education may in courtesy be termed so, but in doing this we, in fact, misuse this
 
 word. Childhood is the most important period of one’s life. Knowledge received during this period is never forgotten. But this is the period during which the child is allowed the least time [for learning] and is held prisoner in no matter what manner of school. I hold that, in our equipping high schools and colleges, we incur expense which this poor land can hardly bear. If, instead, primary education were to be given by well-educated and experienced teachers of high character, in surroundings which would reflect some regard for the beauty of Nature and safeguard the health of the pupils, we would see good results in a short time We would not succeed in bringing about the desired change even if we double the monthly salaries of the present teachers. Big results cannot be brought about through such small changes. The very pattern of primary education must change. I know that this is a difficult proposition and that there are several obstacles in the way. All the same, it should not be beyond the power of the Gujarat Kelavani Mandal to find a solution to this problem.
 I should, perhaps, say that it is not my intention to find fault with the teachers in primary schools. That they are able to show results beyond their powers is, in my opinion, to be attributed to our noble culture and traditions. I am sure that, given sufficient training and encouragement, these same teachers will show results of which we can have no conception at present.
 I think it would be improper for me to say anything about the question, whether or not education should be free and compulsory. My experience is limited. Besides, the idea of imposing anything as duty on our people does not appeal to me and so I cannot reconcile myself to this addition to their obligations. It will be more appropriate at present to make education free but optional and make experiments. I visualize many difficulties in making education compulsory until we have left the days of autocracy behind us. The experience of the Baroda Government may be of some help in coming to a decision on this matter. My own investigation has led me to conclude against the advisability of compulsory education; but the investigation was not thorough and, therefore, no weight can be attached to it. I hope some of the delegates to this Conference will throw helpful light on the point.
 I am convinced that petitioning the Government is not the royal road for correcting all the foregoing deficiencies. The Government cannot change things radically in a day. It is for leaders of the people
 road for correcting all the foregoing deficiencies. The Government cannot change things radically in a day. It is for leaders of the people to take the initiative in such ventures. The British Constitution leaves particular scope for such initiative. If we think that anything can be done only if the Government moves, we are not likely to realize our aims for ages. As they do in England, we must first make experiments and show results before asking the Government to adopt new measures. Whoever finds a deficiency in any field can try to correct it by his own efforts and, after he has succeeded, can move the Government for the desired improvement. For such pioneering ventures, it is necessary to establish a number of special educational bodies.
 There is one great obstacle in the way—the lure of degrees. We think our entire life depends on success at examinations. This results in great harm to the people. We forget that a degree is useful only for those who want to go in for Government service. But the edifice of national life is not to be raised on the salaried class. We also see that people are able to earn money quite well even without taking up any service. When those who are almost illiterate can become millionaires by their intelligence and shrewdness, there is no reason why the educated cannot do the same. If the educated would only give up their fear, they could be as capable as the unlettered.
 If this lure of degrees could be shaken off, any number of private schools could flourish. No government can provide fully for all the education which the people need. In America, education is mostly a private enterprise. In England, too, private enterprise runs a number of institutions. They give their own certificates.
 It will require Herculean efforts to put our education on a sound foundation. We shall have to make sacrifices and dedicate ourselves body, mind and soul to the task.
 I think there is not much that we can learn from America, but one thing we would do well to copy. Some of the biggest educational institutions there are run by a huge Trust. Wealthy Americans have donated millions to this Trust. It runs a number of private schools. If it has a huge fund, it also has at its disposal the services of a number of learned men who love their country and are well-equipped physically. They inspect all these institutions and help them in maintaining academic standards. They provide help wherever and in whatever measure they think necessary. It is available to any
 institution which agrees to adopt the approved constitution. An enthusiastic campaign launched by this Trust carried the results of new researches in the field of agriculture to elderly peasants. We can have a similar plan in Gujarat. There is wealth here and scholarship, too, and love of religion has not altogether disappeared. Children are only waiting to be taught. If we can take up this venture, we may show to the Government in a few years that our efforts are in the right direction. I am sure the Government, then, will not fail to adopt the plan. Actual work will speak to better effect than a thousand petitions
 This  suggestion  covers  the   other   two   objects   of   the Gujarat Kelavani Mandal. The establishment of such a Trust will ensure both a continuous campaign for the spread of education and also practical work in that field. This done,  everything  else  will  follow. Evidently, therefore, it  will  not  be  easy  work.  Wealthy people are like the Government, in that  they  wake  up  only  when  we prod them. For this, tapascharya is the only means we have. It is the first and last step in dharma. I take it that the Gujarat Kelavani Mandal is the embodiment of such tapascharya. When its secretaries and members are wholly possessed by the spirit of service and are also men of learning, money will pour forth on its own. Moneyed people are always sceptical. They have reason to be so. Therefore, if we want to please the goddess of wealth, we shall have first to prove our fitness.
 Though we shall need plenty of money, we need not stress the matter overmuch. Anyone who would work for the spread of national education will, if uneducated, teach himself as he goes about his daily labour and then, sitting beneath a tree, teach those who want to learn. This is the way of the Brahmin dharma. Anyone who chooses may follow it. When we have such Brahmins, both wealth and power will bow in reverence before them.
 I want the Gujarat Kelavani Mandal to have such unshakable faith; may God grant that it have.
 In education lies the key to swaraj. Let political leaders wait on Mr. Montagulibtech_201_footnote, if they want to. It does not matter if politics is out of bounds for this Conference. But the fact remains that all efforts are futile without the right kind of education, which is the special concern
 
 of this Conference. If we succeed in this, we succeed in all other things as well.

CHI. BHAI MAGANLAL,
 I have your letter. I leave the decision about Guruprasad to you. If you feel that he is really patriotic and can live on in the Ashram without quarrelling with anyone, and that he does the work assigned to him sincerely, I see no objection to sending him anything up to Rs.10. But do that on your responsibility. I do not want it to happen that I take a step and you suffer the consequence. I did not think that we would have to send him anything, nor did I know anything about his needs. All the same, we can accommodate a worthy  person. Vrajlalbhai keeps fit enough. Fulchand must have recovered. Ask him to write to me about his wife’s condition also. Ask Sankalehand to send me at once translation of the speech at the Educational Conference.

 "
39,,39. SCHEME FOR NATIONAL EDUCATIONlibtech_203_footnote,"
 For many years past, several friends and I have felt that our present education is not national and that, in consequence, people do not get from it the benefit they ought to. Our children languish as a result of this education. They become incapable of any great achievement and the knowledge they acquire does not spread among
 
 the masses—not even among their families. Nor do the young people have any aim in mind in taking this modern education except to get a job and make money
Prof. Anandshankar Bapubhai Dhruva writes:
 As, during the last five years or so, India stirred out of her sleep and opened her eyes, she found herself faced with the problem of her education. The people of India want to have a share in their government and, to be sure, they will get it. Are three-quarters of her population, then, to  remain condemned to illiteracy? They are to pledge themselves to the use of swadeshi goods. Is their education, then, to remain without  due provision  for instruction in commerce and industry? India will become conscious of her self- respect; is she to be content, then, to have her ancient literature and her arts, her religions and her philosophy, expounded always by foreign scholars ? These and other like aspirations for a fuller life, along with the changed circumstances, have invested the problem of education at the present day with especial importance and till, recognizing the seriousness of this all-important issue, we firmly adhere to certain principles as fundamental to our education, we shall not have done our duty by ourselves and our country, in fact, by the humanity in us.
And again:
 Social reform and religion seemed to be quite simple matters to the leaders of that generation, but the threads which go into the making of a religious life are many-coloured and closely inter-twined. Hindu society derives its vitality from its recognition of these two facts. It is the duty of the new age to understand this truth and order its life accordingly. The system of education in vogue in the last generation was defective as it limited itself to turning out government servants, lawyers and doctors.
 Wherever I have travelled in India, I have discussed this question with the leaders and, without exception, everyone has admitted that our educational system must change. The following extract makes it quite clear that the Government did not consider all the needs of the people in devising this system:
 We have, moreover, looked upon the encouragement of education as peculiarly important, because it is calculated not only to produce a higher degree of intellectual fitness, but to raise the moral character of those who partake of its
 advantages and so to supply you with servants to whose probity you may, with increased confidence, commit offices of trust in India.libtech_204_footnote
It is one of the recognized principles of education that it should
 be planned with a view to the needs of the people. This idea finds no place at all in our schools.
 The system of education has to change, but to look to the Government for this will be sheer waste of time. The Government will wait on public opinion and, being foreign, move very timidly;  it  cannot understand our needs, its advisers may be ill-informed or they may have interests of their own to serve. For a variety of such reasons, it will probably be quite long before there is any serious change in the present system; the time that passes meanwhile, is so much loss to the people. It is, however, not intended to suggest here that we should not try to get the Government to move. Let petitions be made to it and let public opinion be ascertained. But the best petition to the Government will be an actual demonstration by us and this will also be the easiest way of cultivating public opinion. It has accordingly been decided, in consultation with some educated gentlemen, to start a national school.
 EDUCATION IN THE SCHOOL
 Education in the school will be entirely through the mother tongue. It is surprising that, while among other nations the mother tongue enjoys pride of place, among us this place belongs to English. This state of affairs is ultimately harmful to the people. The President of the first Gujarat Educational Conference, too, expressed the view that the medium of education should be the mother tongue. The Chairman of the Reception Committee was very emphatic in  his speech that education should be through the mother tongue. The matter was specifically mentioned in the Government dispatch  of 1854. It is not easy to understand how, in spite of that, the basis of education was altered. The dispatch said:
 It is neither our aim nor our desire to substitute the English for the vernacular dialects of the country. We have always been most sensible of the importance of the use of the languages, which alone are understood by the great mass of the population. These languages, not English, have been, put by us in the place of Persian in the administration of justice and in the intercourse between the officers of the Government and the people. It is indispensable, therefore,
 
 that in any general system of education, the studio of vernaculars should be assiduously attended to. And any acquaintance with improved European knowledge which is to be communicated to the great mass of the people whose circumstances prevent them from acquiring a high standard of knowledge and who cannot be expected to overcome the difficulty of a foreign language, can only be conveyed to them through one or other of these vernacular languages. We look, therefore to the English language and the vernacular languages of India together as media for the diffusion of European knowledge, and it is our desire to see them cultivated in all schools in India of a sufficiency high class to maintain a school-master possessing the requisite qualifications.
His Excellency Lord Chelmsford, the Viceroy, also gave an idea,
 in his address to the Conference of Directors [of Education] held in Delhi on February 22, of the harm that has resulted from English instead of the mother tongue having been assigned the chief place. He asked where the British people would have been if they had had to receive their education through a foreign tongue. His own reply was that many Britons would have given up their studies in sheer despair. He described the present method of imparting education through English as a “vicious system”libtech_205_footnote. These are his words:
 I refer to the relative claims of English and vernacular teaching. At the present moment, we rely on English as the medium of higher instruction. This is due mainly to the fact that English is the passport to employment and that vernacular text-books are not available, but the consequence is obvious. Students endeavour to grapple with abstruse subjects through the medium of a foreign tongue and in many cases, thanks to their mediocre acquaintance with that tongue, have perforce to memorize their text-books. We criticize adversely this tendency to memorize but to my mind it reflects credit on the zeal of the student who, rather than abandon their quest for knowledge, memorize whole pages, whole books which they understand but imperfectly. This is, of course, a mere travesty of education. I would ask
 you and myself as University men how should we have fared in our education if it had been wholly through the medium of a foreign tongue. I doubt whether we would [not] have abandoned the attempt in despair; and I am lost  in admiration for the gift of those boys who made a gallant attempt to surmount the difficulties imposed on them by a vicious system.
 An attempt has been made in Poona to impart education  through an Indian language, and, in the view of those who run the
 
 school, the result has been good. This view is shared by the Government and the public; we, too, aim at providing education through the mother tongue.
 The President of the first [Gujarat] Educational Conference had pointed out in his speech that, if the mother tongue was adopted as the medium of instruction, it would require seven years to impart the knowledge which at present requires 11 years in the High School. This is no insignificant saving. The most important advantage of such  a policy would be the reduction in the financial burden on the people.
 Hindi has been included in the curriculum of this school for the simple reason that it is spoken by about 220 million people. If a language spoken by such large numbers of our countrymen can be taught [to the rest], they would all find it easy to understand the meaning of the various political movements. I am convinced that, in India, Hindi alone can occupy the position of a national language. It has a fine literature, too, and will therefore enrich our literatures.
 The schools under the present dispensation make no provision for teaching the science of religion. It has been given a place in the curriculum of this school.
The	pupils	here	will   be	trained	in	two	occupations:
 (1) agriculture and (2) weaving. Incidental to these, they will get training in carpentry and smithy. They will also receive instruction in Physics, Chemistry, Botany and Zoology. In India, the foregoing occupations occupy the most important place and anyone who learns them will never have to go in search of a job.
 Every pupil will be taught the means of preserving health and home remedies for common ailments. The pupil’s physical training will receive no less attention than the education of his mind.
Every pupil will be taught five languages: (1) Gujarati (2) Hindi
(3) Marathi (4) Sanskrit and (5) English.
 Mathematics will include Arithmetic, Algebra, Geometry and Trigonometry. In other words, the pupils will be brought up to the level of the present First Year of the College.
 History-Geography: The history to be taught will be of Gujarat, India, England, Greece, Rome, and of modern times. During the last year, Philosophy of History and Sociology will also be taught. In Geography, the standard will not be inferior to what obtains in the schools at present.
 In Astronomy, the elements of the subjects will be taught.
 A study of Economics is also essential and will, accordingly, be provided for.
 Some knowledge of law is useful to every person and provision will, therefore, be made for teaching it for practical purposes.
 Drill has been introduced in the first year to provide recreation and exercise to the pupils.
 Music has been introduced as an aid to recitation and also that one may understand something of the subject. All instruction in the first year will be oral. Such general knowledge as will help in the development of the child’s mind, it is intended to convey to it as it plays about. Knowledge of colours, shapes, size, etc., can be conveyed in this way and, so conveyed, it will stimulate the child’s powers of observation. Hence this aid to education will also be utilized as an integral part of the method.
 India never knew the institution of examinations. The method is of recent introduction. It received no great importance in the dispatch of 1854. The system has lent itself to serious abuse, every subject being taught with an eye on the examination and  the  conviction firmly planted in the pupil’s mind that passing the examination was all that was necessary. The teacher, too, has got into the habit of doing his work in the same spirit, as so much drudgery. Hence  any knowledge that is acquired is superficial. Not a single subject is taught with thoroughness. The following passage is worth quoting in this context:
 In recent years, they [examinations] have grown to extravagant dimension and their influence has been allowed to dominate the whole system of education in India with the result that instruction is confined to the  rigid  frame  of prescribed courses, that all forms of training which do not admit of being tested by a written examination are liable to be neglected, and that most teachers and pupils are tempted to concentrate their energies not so much on genuine study as upon questions likely to be set by the examiner.
Having    regard   to    the  view   that	examinations	are	quite
 undesirable, pupils in this institution will be tested periodically from two points of view—whether the teacher has made the right effort and whether the pupil has followed. The pupil will be freed from the fear of examinations. The tests will be held by the teachers of the school and by others familiar with the institution. The expectation is that a pupil  who  has   attended  the   school  for  ten   years   will  be   as well
 equipped as the present-day graduate. In addition, he will have a practical knowledge of agriculture and weaving. The use to which the student puts his abilities after leaving school will be the true measure of the worth of his education. Every opportunity will be taken to rid his mind of the fallacious notion that the aim of education is to get employment. At present, it is the general practice among business men to select for the better posts men who know English, and that from among those educated under the Government-controlled system. But they will have an alternative field for selection when scholars of this school go out on the completion of their studies. The people will then have some idea of the effectiveness of the method of education followed here. A businessman is not in love with a “degree”; his choice will fall on the efficient man.
 If, after ten years of study, anyone wants to pursue a subject further, necessary arrangements for the purpose are left to the future.
 EDUCATION FREE
 No fees will be charged in this school, the expenses being met from donations received.
 TEACHERS
 Paid teachers will be engaged and will be, all of them, grownup men who have reached the college level or possess equivalent attainments. The idea is that children should have the best teachers in the early stages.

It is for this reason that I urge its claims wherever I go. Seeing that my pleas have been of some avail here, I offer my thanks to you. Why should you thank me

All obstacles must yield to determined human effort. I am sorry that, for want of time, I have not been able to meet the wishes of the audience for a long speech. I thank you all, sisters and brothers. Only if I die for India shall I know that I was fit to live.

 BROACH,

 Ever since I came to know Mr. Anandashankar Dhruva, I have been all admiration for him. He is a priceless jewel  of Gujarat; perhaps, the latter has not yet fully recognized his greatness. When he was elected President, I saw that this body knew its own worth too. Mr. Dhruva has proved to the entire Hindu world that the supreme virtue of non-violence has been accepted by all in India. Jainism and Hinduism are not so different as to justify our treating them as distinct religions. The religion named after Gautam Buddha cherishes the  same ideals as Hinduism.
 Mr. Dhruva is a jewel not only of Gujarat but of the whole of India. The rest of India does not know him because he has not come out into public life in Gujarat. He is a scholar of great distinction. I could see his scholarship even from his speeches. Practical ability such as his is very necessary in the affairs of this world. I have had much experience of these affairs and gone through a great deal. It was a pleasure to me to listen to his sincere words and I would simply love to be in his company.
 
 Mr. Dhruva is a hidden jewel. He is well-informed about ancient and modern Hindu society. For the present generation, which is growing up in luxuries and building castles in the air and is, in its thoughtlessness, carried away by the flood of all these notions of reform, Mr. Dhruva is like a boat, a leader taking them back to the right place. Old men can value a flower aright. In like fashion, Mr. Dhruva, too, has shown due appreciation [of young people] and, mingling with them, given proof of his skill in bringing them round firmly to his views.
 That the Humanitarian League could accept Mr. Dhruva as its President proves that the League has been working along sound lines and that it will work more energetically in future to place its humanitarian principles before the people and cultivate  public opinion. And now I move the vote of thanks to the President which, I hope, you will all pass with acclamation.

 SATYAGRAHASHRAM,
 SABARMATI,
 October 31, 1917
 THE SECRETARY TO
 THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRIES DELHI
 SIR,
 I enclose herewith copy of a letterlibtech_210_footnoterecently addressed by me to the Press on the hardships of 3rd class railway passengers.
 The hardships are of two kinds: those which are due to the neglect of the passengers themselves and those that can only be remedied by the Railway Companies. They may again be divided into those that can be dealt with without any great extra cost and those that can be dealt with only on a large outlay of money.
I recognize that the hardships falling under the last category
 
 cannot be effectively dealt with whilst the War is going on. They are due to insufficiency of accommodation. On this I venture to suggest that some check can certainly be exercised in the issue of tickets, and guards or other officials should be instructed to regulate the traffic. As it is, the strongest find their own seats without any supervision or control by the officials and the weaker ones often find them selves left out. Officials should not only be instructed to regulate the traffic, but they should also be required to examine the state of the compartments from time to time and see that no passengers appropriate space to the discomfort of other passengers.
 In so far as the passengers are themselves responsible for the evils I have described, notices should be pasted on the walls of the carriages and put up at the stations giving detailed instructions regarding the use of closets, etc. Bye-laws prohibiting dirty  or offensive practices may be cautiously enforced. A book   of instructions in the different vernaculars may be issued together with long journey tickets and otherwise given gratis on demand. Co- operation of volunteers should be invited from the general public in the prosecution of this educative work.
As to the other grievances:
 Station inspectors or the other officials should be  directed tohave the carriages and closets swept and cleaned at every junction or principal station.
 Station closets ought to be kept scrupulously clean, earth and disinfectants should be used every time closets are used. This presupposes constant employment of Bhangis at every station. In my humble opinion, the importance of the matter demands such employment. It may be a wise thing to set apart special privies which any passenger may use on payment of a nominal fee. At present there is no privacy provided in the station latrines. I think that at a very small cost this can be provided.
There should be bathing facilities at all principal stations.
 I understand that only licensed vendors are permitted to sell refreshments at the stations. A written tariff should be provided and cleanliness of refreshments and vendors should be ensured before the granting of licences. Third-class refreshment rooms should not be allowed to be in the dirty state in which they are at present, but should be kept scrupulously clean.
Untold difficulties are put in the way of the passengers getting
 their tickets on application. Often they are issued only a short time before the departure of trains. The result is bribery, a fight among passengers for the purchase of tickets and disappointment to many.
 Waiting rooms at the principal stations need complete overhauling. There ought to be regulations for the observance of passengers. Benches should be provided in large numbers.  They should be cleaned several times during the day. Rooms should be provided for the use of the fair sex.
 In my humble opinion, all the evils except the provision of extra carriages can be dealt with at a very small additional cost  to  the railway administrations. What is needed is sympathy and due recognition of the rights of third-class passengers who provide the largest part of the income from passenger traffic.
 Though the grievances here adverted to are old,  they are pressing enough to demand immediate attention. I hope that your department will take up the matter at an early date. My services are at its disposal to be utilized in any manner it may deem fit.
 I remain, Yours faithfully,

 Gandhiji then read his speech.libtech_216_footnote
 BROTHERS AND SISTERS,
 I am thankful to you all for the exalted position to which you have called me. I am but a baby of two years and a half in Indian politics.libtech_217_footnoteI cannot trade here on my experience in   South  Africa.  I know that, in these circumstances, acceptance of the position is to a certain extent an impertinence. I have accepted it, all the samc, unable to resist the pressure of your overwhelming affection.
 I am conscious of my responsibility. This Conference is the first of its kind in Gujarat. The time is most critical for the whole of India. The Empire is labouring under a strain never before experienced. My views do not quite take the general course. I feel that some of them run in the opposite direction. Under the circumstances, I am hardly qualified for this privileged position. The president of a meeting is usually its spokesman. I cannot pretend to lay any such claim. It is your kindness that gives me such a unique opportunityof placing my

 thoughts before the Gujarat public. I do not see anything wrong in these views being subjected to criticism, dissent and even emphatic protest. I would like them to be freely discussed. I will only say with regard to them that they were not formed today or yesterday. But they were formed years ago. I am enamoured of them, and my Indian experience of two years and a half has not altered them.
 I congratulate the originators of the proposal to hold this conference as also those friends who have given practical shape to it. It is a most important event for Gujarat. It is possible for us to make it yield very valuable results. This conference is in the nature of a foundation, and if it is well and truly laid, we need have no anxiety as to the superstructure. Being in the nature of a foundation, it carries a heavy responsibility. I pray that God may bless us with wisdom and that our deliberations will benefit the people.
 This is a political conference. Let us pause a moment over the word “political”. It is, as a rule, used in a restricted sense, but I believe it is better to give it a wider meaning. If the work of such a conference were to be confined to a consideration of the relations between the rulers and the ruled, it would not only be incomplete, but we should even fail to have an adequate conception of those relations. For instance, the question of  mahwa  flowerslibtech_218_footnoteis of great importance for a part of Gujarat. If it is considered merely as a question between the Government and the people, it might have unhappy consequences or we might fail in our aim. If we considered the genesis of the law on mahwa flowers and also appreciated our duty as individuals in this matter, we would, very probably, succeed sooner in our fight with the Government than otherwise and easily discover the key to successful agitation. You will more clearly perceive my interpretation of the word “political” in the light of the views I shall place before you.
 Conferences do not, as a rule at the end of their deliberations, leave behind them an executive body, and even when such a body is appointed, it is, to use the language of the late Mr. Gokhalelibtech_219_footnotelibtech_220_footnote, composed of men who are amateurs; What we need is men who would
 
 
 make it their business to give effect to the resolutions of such conferences. If such men come forward in great numbers, then and then only will such conferences be a credit to  the  country  and produce lasting results. At present there is much waste of energy. It is desirable that there should be many institutions of the type of the Servants of India Society. Only when men, fired with the belief that service is the highest religion, come forward in great numbers, could we hope to see great results. Fortunately, India is richly endowed with the religious spirit, and if it is realized that in the present age service of the motherland is the best religion, religiously inclined men  and women would take part in public life in larger numbers. When sages and saints take up this work, I believe India will achieve her cherished aims quite easily. At all events, it is incumbent on us that, for the purposes of this conference, we form an executive committee whose business it would be to enforce its resolutions.
 The air in the country is thick with cries of swaraj. It is  due  to  Mrs.  Besantlibtech_221_footnotelibtech_222_footnotethat  swaraj  is  on  the  lips  of   hundreds   of thousands of men and women. What  was unknown to most men  and women only two years ago, has, by her consummate tact and her indefatigable efforts, become common property  for  them. There cannot be the  slightest  doubt  that her name will take the first rank in history among  those who inspired us with the hope that swaraj was attainable at no distant date. Swaraj was, and is, the goal of the Congress. The idea did not originate with her.libtech_223_footnotelibtech_224_footnoteBut the credit of presenting it to us as a goal realizable in the immediate future belongs to that lady alone. For that we  could hardly thank her enough. By releasing her and her associates, Messrs Arun dalelibtech_225_footnotelibtech_226_footnoteand  Wadialibtech_227_footnotelibtech_228_footnote, Government have laid us underan obligation, and at
 
 
 the same time acknowledged the just and reasonable nature of the agitation for swaraj.libtech_229_footnotelibtech_230_footnoteIt is to be wished that the Government extend the same generosity towards our brothers,  Mahomed  Alilibtech_231_footnotelibtech_232_footnoteand  Shaukat Alilibtech_233_footnotelibtech_234_footnote. It is not necessary to inquire  how  much  of  what  Sir  William Vincentlibtech_235_footnotelibtech_236_footnotehas said about them needs to be   looked  into.  It  is  to  be hoped that the Government will accede to the people’s desire for their release and leave it to them to see that no untoward results follow. This will place the people under a still greater obligation. The act of generosity will be incomplete so long as these brothers are not  released. The grant of freedom to the brothers will gladden the people’s hearts and endear the Government to them.libtech_237_footnote
 Mr. Montagu will shortly be in our midst. The work of taking signatures to the petitionlibtech_238_footnoteto be submitted to him is going on apace. The chief object of this petition is to educate the people about swaraj. To say that literacy is essential for achieving swaraj betrays ignorance of history. It is not necessary for the purpose of inculcating among people the idea that we ought to manage our own affairs. What is essential is the idea, the desire itself. Hundreds of unlettered kings have ruled kingdoms with great success. To see how far such an idea exists in the minds of the people and to try to create it where it is absent is the object of this petition. It is desirable that millions of men and women should sign it with the fullest understanding of what it means. That such a largely signed petition will naturally have its due
 
 weight with Mr. Montagu is its natural result.
 No one has the right to alter the scheme of reformslibtech_239_footnoteapproved by the Congress and the Moslem League, and one need not, therefore, go into the merits thereof. For our present purposes, we have to understand thoroughly the scheme formulated most thoughtfully by our leaders and, putting our faith in them, do whatever is necessary to get it implemented.
 This scheme is not swaraj, but is a great step towards swaraj. Some English critics tell us that we are not fit to enjoy swaraj, because the class that demands it is incapable of defending India. “Is the defence of India to rest with the British alone?” they ask, “and are the reins of Government to be in the hands of the Indians ?” Now this is a question which is both amusing and painful. It is amusing because our British friends fancy that they are not of us, whilst our plan of swaraj is based upon retention of the British connection. We do not want the Englishmen who have settled here to leave this country. They will be our partners in swaraj. And they will have nothing to complain about if, in such a scheme, the burden of the defence of the country falls on them. They are, however, hasty in assuming that we shall not do our share of defending the country. When India decides to acquire military strength, she will attain it in no time. We have but to harden our feelings to be able to strike. To cultivate a hardened feeling does not take ages. It grows like weeds. The question is painful, because it puts in mind the fact that the Government have up to now debarred us from military training. Had they been so minded, they would have had at their disposal today, from among the educated classes, quite a large army. Government have to accept a larger measure of blame than the educated classes for the latter having taken little part in the War. Had the Government policy been shaped differently from the very beginning, they would have today an unconquerable army. But let no one be blamed for the present situation. At the time the British rule was established, it was considered a wise policy for the governance of crores of men to deprive them of arms and military
 
 
 training. But it is never too late to mend, and both the rulers and the ruled must immediately repair the omission.
 In offering these views I have assumed the propriety of the current trend of thought. To me, however, it does not appear to be tending altogether in the right direction. Our agitation is based on the Western model. The swaraj we desire is of a Western type. As a result of it, India will have to enter into competition with the  Western  nations. Many believe that there is no escape from this. I do not think so. I cannot forget that India is not Europe, India is not Japan, India is not China. The divine word that “India alone is the land of  karmalibtech_240_footnotelibtech_241_footnote, the rest is the land of bhoga (enjoyment),” is indelibly imprinted on my mind. I feel that India’s mission is different from that of other countries. India is fitted for the religious supremacy of the world. There is no parallel in the world for the tapascharya that this country has voluntarily gone through. India has little use for steel weapons; it has fought with divine weapons; it can still do so. Other nations have been votaries of brute force. The terrible war going on in Europe furnishes an irrefutable proof of this. India can conquer all by soul- force. History supplies numerous instances to prove that brute force is nothing before soul-force. Poets have sung of this and men of wisdom have said so. A thirty-year-old youth behaves like a lamb before his eighty-year-old father. This is an instance of love-force. Love is atmanlibtech_242_footnotelibtech_243_footnote: it is the very property of  atman. If we have faith enough, we can wield that force over the whole world. Religion having lost its hold on us, we are without an anchor to keep us firm amidst the storm of modern civilization, and are, therefore, being tossed to and fro. I shall return to this idea at a later stage.
 These views of mine notwithstanding, I have joined the swaraj movement, for India is being governed at present under a modern system. The Government themselves believe that the “Parliament” is the best form of that system. Without such a parliament, we should have neither the modern nor the ancient form. Mrs. Besant is only too true when she says that we shall soon be facing a hunger-strike, if we do not have Home Rule. I do not want to go into statistics. The evidence of my eyes is enough for me. Poverty in India is deepening day by day. No other result is possible. A country that exports its raw produce and imports it back as finished goods, a country which,
 
 though growing its own cotton, has to pay crores of rupees to  outsiders for its cloth, cannot be otherwise than poor. A country, in which it is considered extravagance to spend on marriages, etc., can only be described as poor. It must be a terribly poor country that cannot afford to spend enough in carrying out improvements for stamping out epidemics like the plague. In a country whose officials spend most of their earnings outside, the people are bound to grow poorer day by day. What are we to say of the poverty of a country whose people, during cold weather, burn their precious manure for want of woollen clothing in order to warm themselves? Throughout my wanderings in India I have rarely, seen a face exuding strength and joy. The middle classes are groaning under the weight of awful distress. The lowest orders have nothing but the earth below and the sky above. They do not know a bright day. It is pure fiction to say that India’s riches are buried underground, or are to be found in her ornaments. What there is of such riches is of no consequence. The nation’s expenditure has increased, not so its income. Government have not deliberately brought about this state of things. I believe that their intentions are sincere. It is their honest opinion that the nation’s prosperity is daily growing. Their faith in their Blue-books is immovable. It is only too true that statistics can be made to prove anything. The economists deduce India’s prosperity from statistics. People like me who follow rough and ready ways of reckoning shake their heads over Blue-book statistics. If the gods were to come down and testify otherwise, I would insist on saying that I see India growing poorer.
 What then would our Parliament do if we had one? When we have it, we would have a right to commit blunders and to correct them. In the early stages we are bound to make blunders. But, we, being children of the soil, won’t lose time in setting ourselves right. We shall, therefore, soon find out remedies against poverty. Then our existence won’t be dependent on Lancashire goods. Then we shall not be found spending untold riches on building Imperial Delhi. It will, then, be in keeping with the cottages of India. There will be some proportion observed between that cottage and our Parliament House. The nation today is in a helpless condition; it does not possess even the right to err. He who has no right to err can never go forward. The history of the Commons is a history of blunders. Man, says an Arabian proverb, is error personified. The freedom to err and the power to correct errors is one definition of swaraj. Having a parliament means such swaraj.
 We ought to have Parliament this very day. We are quite fit for it. We shall, therefore, get it on demand. It rests with us to define “this very day”.
 Swaraj is not to be attained through an appeal to the British democracy, the British people. They cannot appreciate such an appeal Its reply will be: “We never sought outside help to obtain swaraj. We achieved it with our own strength. You have not received it because you do not deserve it. When you do, nobody can withhold it from you.”
 How then shall we fit ourselves for it? We have to demand swaraj from our own people. Our appeal must be to them.  When  the peasantry of India understands what swaraj is, the demand will become irresistible.
 The  late  Sir  W. W. Hunterslibtech_244_footnotelibtech_245_footnotesaid  that,  in  the   British   system, victory on the battle-field was the shortest way to one’s goal. If educated India had, silently, taken its full share in the present War, I am certain that we would not only have reached our goal already, but the manner of it would have been altogether unique.
 We often refer to the fact that many sepoys of Hindustan have lost their lives on the battle-fields of France and Mesopotamia. The educated classes cannot claim the credit for this. They were not sent out by us, nor did they join up through patriotism. They  know nothing of swaraj. At the end of the War they will not ask for it. They have gone to demonstrate that they are faithful to the salt they eat. In asking for swaraj, I feel that it is not possible for us to bring into account their services. The only thing we can say is that we are not to blame for not being able to take a big part in the prosecution of the War.
 That we have been loyal at a time of stress is no test of fitness for swaraj. Loyalty is no merit. It is a necessity of national existence all the world over. That loyalty can be no passport to swaraj is a self- demonstrated maxim.
 Our fitness lies in that we now keenly desire swaraj, and in our clearly realizing that bureaucracy, although it has served India with best intentions, has had its day. And this kind of fitness is sufficient
 
 for our purpose. Without swaraj there is now no possibility of peace in India.
 But  if  we  confine  our  activities  for  advancing  swaraj  only to holding meetings, the nation is likely to  suffer  harm.  Meetings and speeches have their own place and time. But they cannot make  a nation.
 In a nation fired with the zeal for swaraj, we should observe an awakening in all departments of life. The first step to swaraj lies in the individual. The great truth, “As with the individual, so with the Universe,” is applicable here as elsewhere. If we are ever torn by conflict from within, if we are ever going astray, and if instead of ruling our passions we allow them to rule us, swaraj can have no meaning for us. Government of self, then, is the first step.
 Then the family. If dissensions reign supreme in our families, if brothers fight among themselves, if members of a family cannot live together; if joint families, i.e., families enjoying self-government, become divided through family quarrels, how can we be considered fit for swaraj ?
 Now for caste. If caste-fellows become jealous of one another, if the castes cannot manage their affairs in an orderly manner, if the elders claim especial importance, if the members become self- opinionated and thus show their unfitness for self-government in this limited sphere, how can they be fit for national government ?
 After caste, the city. If we cannot regulate the affairs of our cities, if our streets are not kept clean, if our homes are dilapidated and if our roads are crooked, if we cannot command the services of selfless citizens for civic government, and those who are in charge of affairs are neglectful or selfish, how shall we claim larger powers?
 The way to national life lies through the cities. It is, therefore, necessary to linger a little longer on this subject. The plague has found a home in India.libtech_246_footnotelibtech_247_footnoteCholera has been always with us.  Malaria takes an annual toll of thousands. The plague has been driven out from every other part of the world. Glasgow stamped it  out  the moment it made its appearance there. In Johannesburg it could appear
 
 
 but once.libtech_248_footnoteIts municipality made a great effort and  stamped  it  out within a month, whereas we are able to do nothing about it. We cannot blame the Government for this state of things. To tell the truth, we cannot even blame it on our poverty. None can stand in our way in any remedies that we may wish to adopt. Ahmedabad, for instance, cannot evade responsibility by pleading poverty. I am afraid that in regard to the plague, we must shoulder the entire responsibility. It is very significant that when the plague is working havoc in our ruralquarters, cantonments as a rule remain free. The reasons are obvious. In the cantonments the air is pure, houses detached, roads are wide and clean and the sanitary habits of the residents wholesome, whereas ours are as unhygienic as they well could be. Our closets are as filthy as hell. In a country in which ninety per cent of the population go barefoot, people spit anywhere and perform natural functions anywhere and we are obliged to walk on roads and paths thus dirtied. It is no wonder that the plague has found a home in our midst.
 Unless we alter the conditions in our cities, rid ourselves of our dirty habits and have improved latrines, swaraj can have no value for us.
 It will not be out of place here to refer to another matter. We regard men who render us most useful service, Bhangis, as untouchables. The result has been that we let them clean only a part of our closets. In the name of religion, we ourselves would not clean the places for fear of pollution and so, despite our reputation for personal cleanliness, a portion of our houses remains the dirtiest in the world, with the result that we grow up in an air which is laden with disease germs. We were safe so long as we kept to our villages. But in the cities we are ever committing suicide by reason of our insanitary habits.
 Where large numbers suffer living death, it is very likely that people know neither true religion nor right action and conduct. I believe that it ought not to be beyond us to banish the plague from India, and if we can do so, we shall have so increased our fitness for swaraj, as it cannot be by any agitation, howsoever powerful. This is a question meriting the serious consideration of our doctors and
 
 
 vaidyaslibtech_249_footnotelibtech_250_footnote.
 Not far from here is the holy centre of pilgrimage, Dakor. I have visited it. Its unholiness is limitless. I consider myself a devout Vaishnavalibtech_251_footnote. I claim, therefore,  a  special  privilege  of  criticising  the condition of Dakorji. The insanitation of that place is so great that one used to hygienic conditions can hardly bear to pass even twenty-four hours there. The pilgrims pollute the tank and the streets as they choose. The keepers of the shrine quarrel among themselves and, to add insult to injury, a receiver has been appointed to take charge of the jewellery and costly robes of the idol. It is our clear duty to set matters right. How shall we, Gujaratis, out to have swaraj, fare as soldiers in the army fighting for it, if we cannot put our own house in order?
 To think of the state of education in our cities also fills us with despair. It is plainly our duty by our own effort to provide education to the masses. But our gaze is fixed upon  Government, whilst thousands of children go without education.
 In the cities the drink-evil is on the increase, tea-shops are multiplying, gambling is rampant. If we cannot remedy these evils, how can we attain swaraj ? Swaraj means managing our own affairs.
 We are approaching a time when we and our children may have to go without milk altogether. Dairies, here in Gujarat, are doing us infinite harm. They buy out practically the whole milk-supply and produce butter, cheese, etc., for sale. How can a nation whose nourishment is chiefly derived from milk permit itself to be deprived of this important article of food? How can men be so selfish as to be heedless of the national health and think of enriching themselves through commercial exploitation of an article of diet ? Milk and its products are of such paramount value to the nation that they deserve to be controlled by the municipalities. What are we doing about them?
 I have just returned from the scene of Bakr-i-Id riots. For a trivial cause, the two communities fell out with each other, mischie- vous men joined in the fray and a mere spark became a blaze. We found ourselves helpless. We have been obliged to depend entirely upon Government assistance. This shows how crippled we are.
 
 It will not be inopportune to dwell for a moment on the question of cow-protection. It is an important question. And yet it is left to be solved by cow-protection societies. Protecting the cows seems to be an ancient practice. It originated in the special needs of this country. Protection of its cows is incumbent upon a country 90 per cent. of whose population lives upon agricu-lture and needs bullocks for it. In such a country, even meat-eaters should abstain from beef-eating. These natural causes should be enough justification for not killing cows. But here we have to face a peculiar situation. The chief meaning of cow-protection seems to be to prevent cows from falling into the hands of our Muslim brethren and being used as food. The rulers need beef. On their account thousands of cows are slaughtered daily. We do nothing to prevent this slaughter. We hardly make any attempt to prevent the cruel torture of cows by certain Hindus of Calcutta, who subject them to a practice known as “blowing” and make them yield the last drop of milk. In Gujarat, Hindu cart-drivers use sharp goads to drive bullocks. We say nothing about this. The condition of bullocks in our cities is pitiable. Indeed, protection of the cow and her progeny is a very great problem. By making it a pretext for quarrelling with the Muslims, we have only ensured greater slaughter of cows. It is not religion, but want of it, to kill a Muslim brother in order to save a cow. I feel sure that if we were to discuss the matter with our Muslim brethren in the spirit of love, they also would appreciate the peculiar condition of India and readily co-operate with us in the protection of cows. By courtesy and through satyagraha, we can bring them to join that mission. But, in order to be able to do this, we shall have to understand the question in its true bearing. Instead of killing our brethren, we should be ready to die ourselves. But we shall be able to do this only when we understand the real value of the cow and have pure love for her. Success in this will ensure several things simulta-neously. Hindus and Muslims will live in peace, the cow will be safe, milk and its products will be available in a pure condition and will be cheaper than now, and our bullocks will become the envy of the world. If our tapascharya is pure, we shall succeed in stopping slaughter of cows, whether by the British, Muslims or Hindus. Even this one achievement will bring swaraj nearer.
 Many of these issues arise out of civic government. We can clearly see from this that our running the Government of India is dependent upon our upright management of civic affairs.
 
 It will not be incorrect to say that practically there is no swadeshi movement in the country. We do not realize that this movement almost holds the key to swaraj. If we have no regard for our own language, if we feel aversion to cloth made in our country, if our dress repels us, if we are ashamed to wear the sacred shikhalibtech_252_footnotelibtech_253_footnote, if our food is distasteful to us, even our climate is not good enough, our people uncouth and unfit for our company, our civilization ugly and the foreign attractive, in short, if everything native is bad and everything foreign pleasing to us, I do not know what swaraj can mean for us. If everything foreign is to be adopted, surely it will be necessary for us to continue long under foreign tutelage, for so far foreign ways have touched  the masses but little. It seems to me that, before we can appreciate swaraj, we should have not only love but passion for swadeshi. Every act of ours should bear the swadeshi stamp. Swaraj can only be built upon the assumption that most of what is national is, on the whole, sound. If the view here put forth be correct, we should have a big movement in our country for swadeshi. Every country that has carried on a move- ment for swaraj has fully appreciated the swadeshi spirit. Scottish Highlanders hold on to their kilts even at the risk of their lives. We humorously call them the“petticoat brigade”. But the whole world testifies to the strength that lies behind that “petticoat” and the Highlanders of Scotland will not abandon it, even though it is an inconvenient dress, and an easy target for the enemy. I don’t wish to suggest that we should treasure our faults, but that what is national, even though not rich in excellences, should be adhered to, and that what is foreign should be avoided though one may succeed well enough in adopting it. That which is wanting in our civilization can be supplied by proper effort on our part. I do hope that the swadeshi spirit will possess every member in this assembly; if they all take the vow of swadeshi and observe it in the face of any difficulty or inconvenience, swaraj will be easy of attainment.
 The foregoing illustrations go to show that  our  movement should be twofold. We may petition the Government, we may agitate in the Imperial Council for our rights; but for a real awakening of the people, the more important thing is activities directed inwards. There is a possibility of hypocrisy and selfishness tainting activities directed outwards. There is very much less danger of this in activities of the other kind. Not only will the former not be justified unless balanced
 
 by the latter, they may even be barren of res-ults. It is not my contention that we have no activities at all directed inward, but  I submit that we do not lay enough stress upon them.
 One sometimes hears it said, “Let us get the government of India in our own hands; everything will be all right  afterwards.” There could be no greater superstition than this. No nation has gained its independence in this manner. The splendour of the spring is reflected in every tree, the whole earth is then filled with the freshness of youth. Similarly, when the spring of swaraj is on us, a stranger suddenly arriving in our midst will observe the freshness of youth in every walk of life and find servants of the people engaged, each according to his own abilities, in all manner of public activities.
 If we admit that our progress has not been what it might have been, we should also admit two reasons for this. We have kept our women away from these activities of ours and have thus become victims of a kind of paralysis. The nation walks with one leg only. All its work appears to be only half or incompletely done. Moreover, the educated section, having received its education through a foreign tongue, has become enervated and is unable to give the nation the benefit of such ability as it acquires. I need not reiterate my views on this subject, as I have elaborated them in my addresslibtech_254_footnotelibtech_255_footnoteat the Gujarat Educational Conference. It is a wise decision, that of conducting the proceedings of this conference in Gujarati, and I hope that nothing will induce the people of Gujarat to change it.
 The educated class, lovers of swaraj, must freely mix with the masses. We dare not turn away from a single section of the community or disown any. We shall make progress only if we carry all with us. Had the educated class identified itself with the masses, Bakr- i-Id riots would have been an impossibility.
 Before coming to the last topic, it remains for me to refer to certain events as a matter of duty and to make one or two suggestions.
 Every year the god of death exacts his toll from among our leaders. I do not intend to mention the victims claimed by this god all over India during the last 12 months. But it is impossible to omit reference to the sage-like Grand Old Manlibtech_256_footnotelibtech_257_footnoteof India. Who am   I  to estimate the value of his services to the country ? I am no more than
 
 one who sat at his feet. I paid my respects to him when I went to London as a mere lad. I came to revere him from the very moment I waited upon him with a letter of introduction.libtech_258_footnoteDadabh-ai’s flawless and uninterrupted service to the country, his impartia-lity, his spotless character, will always furnish India with an ideal to follow. May God give him peace! May He grant his family and the Nation the ability to bear the loss. We can immortalize him by making his character our own, by copying his manner of service and by enthroning him for ever in our hearts. May the great soul of Dadabhai watch over our deliberations !
 It is our duty to express our thanks to His Excellency the Viceroy for having announced the decision of the Government of India to abolish the customs levy on the border [between Saurashtra and British Indian territory] at Viramgam. This step should have been taken earlier. The people were groaning under the weight of this impost. It cost large numbers their trade. It has caused much suffering to many women. The decision does not seem to have been brought into effect. It is to be hoped that it will soon be.
 I have submitted through the Press my experiences about the hardships of third-class railway passengers.libtech_259_footnotelibtech_260_footnoteThey  are,  indeed,  past endurance. The people of India are docile and trained in silent suffering. Thousands, therefore, put up with the hardships, but they remain unredressed. There is, indeed, merit in such suffering, but it must have its limits. Submission out of weakness is unmanliness. That we tamely put up with the hardships of railway travelling is a sign of our unmanliness. These hardships are of two kinds, those which are due to the remissness of railway administration and those occasioned by the carelessness of the travelling public. The remedies are also, therefore, twofold. Where the railway administration is to blame, complaints should be addressed to it by everyone who suffers. This may be done even in Gujarati. The matter should be ventilated in the Press. Secondly, where the public are to blame, the wiser among passengers should inculcate manners upon their ignorant companions and enlighten them on their carelessness and dirty habits. This will require volunteers. Everyone can do his share according to his ability,
 
 Vide An Autobiography, Part I, Ch. XXV.
 and leaders might, in order to appreciate the difficulties of third-class travelling, resort to it from time to time without making themselves known and bring their unhappy experiences to the notice of the administration. If these remedies are adopted, we should, in a short time, see great changes.
 A committee had been appointed in London to consider certain measures about the supply of indentured labour to Fiji and the other sister islands. The views of that committee have been officially published and the Government of India have invited the opinion of the public upon them. I need not dwell at length upon the matter as I have submitted my views already through the Press. I have given it as my opinion that the recommendations of the committee, if adopted, will result in a kind of indenture. We can, therefore, only come to one conclusion. We do not want to see labourers emigrating under bondage in any shape or form. There is no need for such emigration. The only thing required is a complete repeal of the law of indenture. It is no part of our duty to look to the convenience of the Colonies.
 I come now to the last subject. There are two methods of attaining one’s goal. Satyagrahalibtech_261_footnotelibtech_262_footnoteand  duragrahalibtech_263_footnotelibtech_264_footnote. In our scriptures, they have been described, respectively, as divine and devilish modes of action. In satyagraha, there is always unflinching adherence to truth. It is never to be forsaken on any account. Even for the sake of one’s country, it does not permit resort to false-hood. It proceeds on the assumption of the ultimate triumph of truth. A satyagrahi does not abandon his path, even though at times it seems impenetrable and beset with difficulties and dangers, and a slight departure from that straight path may appear full of promise. Even in these circumstances, his faith shines resplendent like the midday sun and he does not despond. With truth for sword, he needs neither a steel sword nor gun- powder. Even an inveterate enemy he conquers by the force of the soul, which is love. Love for a friend is not put to the test. There is nothing surprising in a friend loving a friend; there is no merit in it and it costs no effort. When love is bestowed on the so-called enemy, it is tested, it becomes a virtue and requires an effort, and hence it is an act of manliness and real bravery. We can cultivate such an attitude
 
 even towards the Government and, doing so, we shall be able to appre- ciate their beneficial activities and, as for their errors, rather than feel bitter on their account, point them out in love and so get  them rectified. Love does not act through fear. Weakness there certainly cannot be. A coward is incapable of bearing love, it is the prerogative of the brave. Looking at everything with love, we shall not regard the Government with suspicion, nor believe that all their actions are inspired with bad motives. And our examination of  their  actions, being directed by love, will be unerring and is bound, therefore, to carry conviction with them.
 Love can fight; often, it is obliged to. In the intoxication of power, man fails to see his error. When that happens, a satyagrahi does not sit still. He suffers. He disobeys the ruler’s orders and his laws in a civil manner, and willingly submits to the penalties of such disobedience, for instance, imprisonment and gallows. Thus is the soul disciplined. In this, one never finds that one’s time has been wasted and, if it is subsequently realized that such respectful disobedience was an error, the consequences are suffered merely by the satyagrahi and his co-workers. In the event, no bitterness develops between the satyagrahi and those in power; the latter, on the contrary, willingly yield to him. They discover that they cannot command the satyagrahi’s obedience. They cannot make him do anything against his will. And this is the consummation of swaraj, because it means complete independence. It need not be assumed that such resistance is possible only against civilized rulers. Even a heart of flint will melt in the fire kindled by the power of the soul. Even a Nero becomes a lamb when he faces love. This is no exaggeration. It is as true as an algebraic equation. This satyagraha is India’s distinctive weapon. It has had others but satyagraha has been in greater use. It is an unfailing source of strength, and is capable of being used at all times and under all circumstances. It requires no stamp of approval from the Congress or any other body. He who knows its power cannot but use it. Even as the eyelashes automatically protect the eyes, so does satyagraha, when kindled, automatically protect the freedom of the soul.
 But duragraha is a force with the opposite attributes. As we saw earlier, the terrible War going on in Europe is a case in point. Why should a nation’s cause be considered right and another’s wrong because it overpowers the latter by sheer brute force? The strong are
 often seen preying upon the weak. The wrongness of the latter’s cause is not to be inferred from their defeat in a trial of brute strength, nor is the rightness of the strong to be inferred from their success in such a trial. The wielder of brute force does not scruple about the means to be used. He does not question the propriety of means, if he can somehow achieve his purpose. This is not dharma but the opposite of it. In dharma, there can be no room for even a particle of untruth or cruelty, and no injury to life. The measure of dharma is love, compassion, truth. Heaven itself, if attained through sacrifice of these, is to be despised. Swaraj is useless at the sacrifice of truth. Such swaraj will ultimately ruin the people. The man who follows the path of duragraha becomes impatient and wants to kill the so-called enemy. There can be but one result of this. Hatred increases. The defeated party vows vengeance and simply bides its time. The spirit of revenge thus descends from father to son. It is much to be wished that India never gives predominance to this spirit of duragraha. If the members of this assembly deliberately accept satyagraha and chalk out its programme accordingly, they will reach their goal all the more easily for doing so. They may have to face disappointment in the initial stages. They may not see results for a time. But  satyagraha will triumph in the end. The duragrahi, like the oilman’s ox, moves in a circle. His movement is only motion but it is not progress. The satyagrahi is ever moving forward.
 A superficial critic of my views may find some contradiction in them. On the one hand, I appeal to the Government to give military training to the people. On the other, I put satyagraha on the pedestal. Surely, there can be no room for the use of arms in satyagraha? Of course there is none. But military training is intended for those who do not believe in satyagraha. That the whole of India will ever accept satyagraha is beyond my imagination. A cowardly refusal to defend the nation, or the weak, is ever to be shunned. In order to protect an innocent woman from the brutal design of a man, we ought to offer ourselves a willing sacrifice and by the force of love conquer the brute in the man. Lacking such strength, we should employ all our physical strength to frustrate those designs. The satyagrahi and the duragrahi are both warriors. The latter, bereft of his arms, acknowledges defeat, the former never. He does not depend upon the perishable body and its weapons, but he fights on with the strength of the unconquerable and immortal atman. Anyone who is neither of the two is not a man, for he does not recognize the atman. If he did, he would not take
 fright and run away from danger. Like a miser his wealth, he tries to save his body and loses all; such a one does not know how to die. But the armoured soldier always has death by him as a companion. There is hope of his becoming one day a satyagrahi. The right thing to hope from India is that this great and holy Aryan land will ever give the predominant place to the divine force and employ the weapon of satyagraha, that it will never accept the supremacy of armed strength. India will never respect the principle of might being right. She will ever reserve her allegiance to the principle: “Truth alone triumphs.”
 On reflection, we find that we can employ satyagraha even for social reform. We can rid ourselves of the many defects of our caste system. We can resolve Hindu-Muslim differences and can solve political problems. It is all right that, for the sake of convenience, we speak of these things as separate subjects. But it should never be forgotten that they are all closely inter-related. It is not true to say that neither religion nor social reform has anything to do with politics. The result obtained by bringing religion into play in the field of politics will be different from that obtained otherwise. When thinking of political matters, we cannot ignore 56,000 ignorant sadhus living as wandering mendicants. Our Muslim brethren cannot lose sight of their fakirs. Nor can we be unmindful of the condition of our widows and the custom of child marriage and the Muslims of the  custom  of purdah. The two communities cannot, likewise, shut their  eyes  to scores of questions that arise between them.
 Indeed, our difficulties are Himalayan. But we have equally potent means at our disposal for overcoming them. We are children of an ancient nation. We have witnessed the burial of civilizations: those of Rome, Greece and Egypt. Our civilization abides even as the ocean in spite of its ebbs and flows. We have all we need to keep ourselves independent. We have great mountains and rivers. We have the matchless beauty of nature, and the sons and daughters of this land have handed down to us a heritage of deeds of valour. This country is the treasure-house of tapascharya. In this country alone do people belonging to different religions live together in amity and the gods of all are venerated. If, despite all this bounty, we fail to work a miracle, bring peace to the world and conquer the British through the play of moral force in our life, we shall have disgraced our heritage. The English nation is full of adventure, the religious spirit guides it, it has unquenchable faith in itself, it is a nation of great soldiers, it treasures
 its independence; but it has given the place of honour to its commercial instinct, it has not always narrowly examined the means adopted for seeking wealth. It worships modern civilization. The ancient ideals have lost their hold upon it. If, therefore, instead of imitating that nation, we cherish our past and sincerely value our strength, trust firmly in its supremacy, we shall know how to take the best advantage of our connection with the British and so make it profitable to us, to them and to the entire world. I pray  to  the Almighty that this assembly may play its part in this great work and thereby shed lustre upon itself, upon Gujarat, and upon the whole of India.

 I am sorry that some of the speakers were not allowed to complete their very fine speeches, and I apologize to them for this. Those who have had to suppress their enthusiasm may show it in other ways. I must leave this very day, denying myself the love  of  the people of Godhra. I would have had some peace if I had stayed on for a while. These days, however, when a fire is raging, how can one expect peace? The songs were sweet to hear, but they are not the end of the matter. I hope what was sung would be acted upon. If you follow up the songs with sacrifices in the cause of the nation, the hopeslibtech_274_footnotelibtech_275_footnoteexpressed by Mr. Talati will be fulfilled.

 Of the resolutions passed, five relate to matters which we can get settled in a year’s time. As for the resolution on forced labour, if the Executive Committee does not get such labour abolished in that time, the members should resign. If, again, they do not succeed in securing improvement in the condition of students, they may as well go about with bangles on their wrists. Of course, it will be no great honour to men to do this.

  This 	Conference tenders its 	thanks to 	His Excellency 	the Viceroy 	for the decision 	he has announced 	to remove 	the levy, 	known as 	Viramgam customs, on 	certain categories of 	goods on their 	 entry  from Kathiawad 	into British 	territory, and earnestly 	requests him to 	give immediate effect to 	the decision.  Farmers 	without adequate means 	are put 	to extreme 	hardships because 	of the 	general practice of 	collecting revenue dues 	in one 	instalment instead of 	two and 	are obliged 	to sell their 	means of livelihood 	to pay 	the dues. This 	Conference therefore 	requests the Government 	to see that revenue 	dues are 	always collected in 	two instalments and 	to fix 	the time for 	the collection of 	instalments with 	due regard 	to the 	crop situation. 
 
  This 	Conference is 	of the view that the 	Sub-divisional Officer 	of every 	district should have his 	residence, during the 	monsoon months, 	in the principal 	town of 	his division instead of 	at the district 	headquarters. For 	some time past, the 	office of 	the District 	Deputy Collector 	of Dohad 	is shifted 	to Godhra 	during the monsoon 	months and 	this results in 	considerable hardship 	to the people 	of Zalod, 	Bhimdi, etc., 	and also puts them to 	heavy expense 	on transport. 	This Conference 	therefore requests the 	Government that 	the said office should 	remain in Dohad 	as in former years.  This 	Conference requests the 	Government of 	India to 	release all 	Indians, men 	and women, who 	had been detained for 	political reasons 	under the 	Defence of 	India Act 	and declares its 	view that the 	desire expressed 	by His 	Excellency the 	Viceroy to 	see peace 	prevail in India during 	Mr. Montagu’s 	visit here will be 	better realized if 	the detenus 	are released.  In 	revenue matters as 	also for the maintenance 	of peace 	and order 	in his 	district, the 	Collector is 	at present dependent on 	the one-sided 	reports of 	the Mamlatdar 	and the police 	and this 	often leads to serious 	errors in 	the administration 	of the 	district and 	injustice to 	the people. This 	Conference therefore 	recommends to the 	Government that 	it appoint an 	advisory board of 	elected members for 	each district.  Recently, 	some persons have set 	up, in disregard 	of the 	interests of 	the people, 	plants for 	the processing of 	milk and 	the Government has 	also been doing the 	same, with the 	result that people have 	to go 	without the nourishing 	items of 	milk and 	ghee in 	their food.

 November 5, 1917
 
MY DEAR BRETHREN,
 We are in the midst of those people, call them Dheds, Bhangis, Antyajaslibtech_280_footnote, or by whatever appellation you like. Beside me there are lawyers and doctors, I believe, and other gentlemen; we have today joined hands with the so-called backward classes; now we are sure to get swaraj. (Hear, hear.) We, Hindus and Muhammadans, have become one; here we are in association with this Dhed community. Do not suppose that that community belongs to a lower status; let the fusion take place between you and that community, and then you will be fit for swaraj. We lost the right to swaraj before, because we committed a sin before God in treating this community with such neglect. Why should we hesitate to touch the Antyajas? It is not mentioned in any religious book that this community should not be touched, or treated as we are doing now. It is a fallacy to give that community the lowest place in the scale of castes. Where the union of hearts takes place, there, I am sure, God is present. God is omnipotent, though some of us do not believe it. Therefore, we quarrel among ourselves. Where is the difference between us and this community? There is the same heart, the same nose, the same tongue, the same feeling—everything the same. (Cheers.) Where there is a divided heart, there Ramachandra cannot be. There is no Imam. (Laughter.) I do not know whether God was present at the political conference (Laughter.), but I am sure he is here. (Hear, hear.) I have not come here to make a long speech; I came to set an object lesson. (Hear, hear.) This lesson on social reform is not to be had elsewhere. (Cheers.) Here is a vast assemblage. It is like an ocean. Anyone can use this water for cooking his rice. (Laughter.) Let everyone speak. I now call upon the Hon’ble Mr. Patel to speak. (Loud cheers.)
 A young Dhed then asked permission to speak. He came forward very nervously. He said that he was not an educated man. He was the son of a Dhed. He thanked the assembly on behalf of his community and tendered their tribute of love
 
 and gratitude to the Bawaji (Mr. Patel). He gradually grew more confident and endeavoured to substantiate the claim of his community to be among the foremost ranks of the Rajput race.
 Mr. Gandhi rose at once to disillusion him of this, and advised him not to believe in such cock-and-bull stories regarding his ancestry. He admonished the Dheds to be content with their parentage and to rise by their own efforts, now that the higher classes had lent them a kindly hand.
 Other speakers followed—all striving to console and encourage Dhed
 community. . . .
 In his final speech Mr. Gandhi asked the upper classes to convert their theoretical sympathy for the Dheds into practical one and to subscribe towards opening and maintaining a school for Dhed children. Rs. 1,653 were subscribed on the spot.libtech_281_footnote

	A STAIN ON INDIA’S FOREHEAD","
      [GODHRA, 
  After 	November 5, 1917]  	That the untouchables are a separate class is a blot on India’s 	forehead. The caste system is a hindrance, not a sin. But 	untouchability is a sin, a great crime, and if Hinduism does not 	destroy this serpent while there is yet time, it will be devoured by 	it. The untouchables must not be considered as falling outside 	Hinduism. They should be treated as respectable members of Hindu 	society and should be assigned their varnas according to 	their vocations.  	The varna system, as I have defined and described it, is not 	practised by Hinduism today. Those who call themselves Brahmins have 	given up the pursuit of learning. They have taken to various other 	occupations. The same is true more or less of the other varnas. 	As a matter of fact, owing to our subjection to foreign rule, we are 	all slaves and are, in the eyes of the Westerners, untouchables 	lower even than the Sudras.  	Why does God permit this atrocity? Ravana was a rakshasa, but 	this  rakshasilibtech_284_footnoteof untouchability is even  more  terrible  than  	Ravana. And when we worship this rakshasi in the name of 	religion, the gravity of our sins is further increased. Even the 	slavery of the Negroes is better than this. This religion, if it can 	be called such, stinks in my nostrils. This certainly cannot be the 	Hindu religion, It was through the Hindu religion that I learnt to 	respect Christianity and Islam. How then can this sin be a part of 	the Hindu religion? But then what is to be done?  	I shall put up a lone fight, if need be, against this hypocrisy. 	Alone I shall undergo penance and die with His name on my lips. It 	is possible that I may go mad and say that I was mistaken in my 	views     
 on the question of untouchability, that I was guilty of a sin in calling untouchability a sin of Hinduism. Then you should take it that I am frightened, that I cannot face the challenge and that I change my views out of cowardice. You should take it, in that event, that I am in delirium.
 In my humble opinion, the dirt that soils the scavenger is  physical and can be easily removed. But there are those who have become soiled with untruth and hypocrisy, and this dirt is so subtle that it is very difficult to remove it. If there are any untouchables, they are the people who are filled with untruth and hypocrisy.libtech_285_footnote
 There has been a lot of comment in Gujarati on the convention of Bhangis, Doms and other untouchables that was held in the Mahar compound of Godhra. The writers of these comments have given completely distorted versions of the events at the convention and misled the readers. I therefore write the following lines to put things right.
 In matters concerning religion, I consider myself not a child but an adult with 35 years of experience. For I have thought and reflected on the question of religion for as many years. Especially, wherever I saw truth, I translated it into action. It is my conviction that mere perusal of the shastras does not lead to an awareness of the true spirit of religion. We see that without following a code of rules, without the study of the shastras, a man’s behaviour tends to be wayward. For the meaning of a doctrine I shall not go to a man who has studied the shastras with the desire to be called a pundit. For this reason, for formulating my code of ethics I shall not seek the assistance of the books written after laborious study by such scholars as Max Muller. Nowadays lots of people who profess themselves knowledgeable in the shastras are found to be ignorant and conceited. I seek a guru. That a guru is needed I accept. But, as long as I have not come upon a worthy guru, I shall continue to be my own guru. The path is arduous certainly, but in this sinful age, it seems to be the right one. Hinduism is so great and so wide in sweep that no one has so far succeeded in defining it. I was born in the Vaishnavisam sect
 
 
 and I dearly love its  siddhaslibtech_286_footnotelibtech_287_footnoteand  siddhantaslibtech_288_footnotelibtech_289_footnote.  Nowhere,  either  in Vaishnavism or in Hinduism, have I seen it laid down that Bhangis, Doms, etc., are untouchables.libtech_290_footnoteHinduism is hemmed in by many old customs. Some of them are praiseworthy but the rest are to be condemned. The custom of untouchability is, of course, to be condemned altogether. It is because of it that, now for two thousand years, Hinduism has been burdened with a load of sin in the name of religion. I call such orthodoxy hypocrisy. You will have to  free yourself of this hypocrisy; the penance for it you are already undergoing. It is no good quoting verses from Manusmriti and other scriptures in defence of this orthodoxy. A number of verses in these scriptures are apocryphal, a number of them are quite meaningless. Then again, I have not so far come across any Hindu who obeys or wants to obey every injunction contained in Manusmriti. And it is easy to prove that one who does this will, in the end, be himself polluted. The Sanatana Dharma will not be saved by defending every verse printed in the scriptures. It will be saved only by putting into action the principles enunciated in them—principles that are eternal. All the religious leaders with whom I have had occasion to discuss the matter have agreed in this. All the preachers who are counted among the learned and who are revered in society have clearly announced that our treatment of Bhangis, Doms, etc., has no sanction other than the custom to which it conforms. To be truthful, no one really follows this custom. We touch them in the trains. They are employed in mills where we touch them without the least compunction. Untouchables have found admission in the Fergusson and the Baroda Colleges. Society puts no hindrance so far as these matters are concerned. In English and Muslim homes they are politely welcomed. And we have no hesitation in touching Englishmen and Muslims; in fact, we feel a pride in shaking hands with many of these. When these same untouchables are converted to Christianity, we dare not treat them as untouchables. Thus, it is impossible for a thoughtful Hindu, even if he feels differently in the matter, to uphold a tradition which it is not possible to follow.
I can think of no epithet to describe those who deny the feeling
 
 of hatred which underlines untouchability. If a Bhangi by mistake finds his way into our compartment, he will hardly escape a beating and, as for abuse, this will fall on him in a shower. The tea-seller will not hand him tea nor the shopkeeper sell him goods. We will not care to touch him even if he be dying. We give him our leavings to eat and our torn and soiled garments to wear. No Hindu is willing to teach him. He cannot dwell in a proper house. On the road, out of fear of our wrath, he has to proclaim his untouchability repeatedly. What treatment can be more indicative of hatred than this ? What does this condition of his show ? Just as in Europe, at one time, slavery was upheld under cover of religion, so now in our society hatred for the untouchables is fostered in the name of religion. Till the very end there were some people in Europe who quoted the Bible in defence of slavery. I include our present supporters of orthodoxy  in  this category. We shall have to free religion of the sin of untouchability which is imputed to it. Unless we do this, diseases like plague, cholera, etc., cannot be rooted out. There is nothing lowly in the occupations of the untouchables. Doctors as well as our mothers perform similar duties. It may be argued that they cleanse themselves afterwards. Yes, but if Bhangis, etc., do not do so, the fault is wholly ours and not theirs. It is clear that the moment we begin lovingly to hug them, they will begin to learn to be clean.
 Unlike the movement for inter-dining, this movement does not need  to  be  pushed.  This   movement   will  not   cause   the   system of Varnashram to disappear. It aims at saving it by doing away with its excesses. It is also not the desire of the initiators of this movement that Bhangis, etc., should give up their vocations. They only want to demonstrate that the function of removing garbage and filth is a necessary and sacred function and its  performance  can impart grace even to a Vaishnava. Those who pursue this vocation are not, therefore, degraded but entitled to an equal measure of social privileges with those pursuing other callings; their work protects the country from a number of diseases. They, therefore, deserve the same respect as doctors.
 While this country is venerated for its tapasya, purity, compassion and other virtues, it is also a play ground of licence, sin, barbarity and other vices. At such a juncture it will be becoming for our fraternity of writers to gird up their loins to oppose and root out hypocrisy. I appeal to you to share in the sacred work that was taken
 
 up at Godhra greeting it as such and participate in the effort that may be undertaken in this cause, so that sixty million people may  not break away from us in despair.
 Before joining this campaign, I have thoroughly reflected on my religious responsibility. A critic has made the prophecy that, in course of time, my views will change.libtech_291_footnotelibtech_292_footnoteOn this I shall only say that, before such a tune comes, I shall have forsaken not only Hinduism but all religion. But it is my firm conviction that if, in the attempt to free Hinduism of this blot, I have to lay down my life, it will be no great matter. It is altogether impossible for the feeling of untouchability to survive in a religion which produced devotees like Narsi Mehta who saw all men as equals

52,"November 	11, 1917",SPEECH AT MUZAFFARPURlibtech_293_footnote,"
         FRIENDS,     November 	11, 1917 
  	I had intended to speak of three things only, but what I saw at the 	station has added one more. Wherever I go, our people, forgetting 	everything in their love, so rush at me and throw everything into 	such confusion that I grow weary of it all. This kind of behaviour 	makes things unpleasant and obstructs national work. If we wish to 	honour a public worker, there is a way of doing so and one should 	learn it. Our people do not even know how to maintain order as they 	stand on the station platform. We want to work for the nation. We 	have embarked on the service of Bharat. It is our duty then to learn 	how to behave in public, how to go about our work and how to honour 	public servants. We should learn drill for this purpose.  	The second thing is about Champaran. The people there have secured  	what  they   wanted.libtech_294_footnoteWe  had   no   quarrel   with  the   indigo- planters; 	we only wanted to shake off our slavery to them and this is       tinkathia, 	a levy on the indigo labourers. 
 all we have been able to achieve. The orders issued for the benefit of the people there do not apply to Muzaffarpur; I believe, however, that they will be, by and by. If we fail to secure anything, it is merely because of want of trust between us and those from whom we seek it. When I started my work in Champaran, the indigo-planters and the officials there felt that I was out to fight them; when, ultimately, they realized that I had no such intention, that I only wanted the indigo- planters to be just to the people, there was little difficulty in getting what we wanted.
 The work at Champaran is over, but something still more important remains. If a man who has shaken off slavery and gained his freedom is not properly educated, he may possibly abuse his freedom. The people of Champaran have secured local self- government of a sort. How it is to be used is the problem now. For this purpose my co-workers, Babu Brijkishorelibtech_295_footnotelibtech_296_footnoteand   others,  have  jointly decided to open schools all over the place and educate the people in general knowledge, especially in the rules of hygiene. The intention is to give instruction in letters to boys and girls and teach them as much hygiene as they need to keep themselves clean and tidy, and teach adults how to safeguard public health and keep clean the roads, disused wells, latrines, etc. With this object, a school is to be opened in   a place called Dhaka on the auspicious day of Tuesday. There is an urgent need of volunteers for this world. Any educated friends who so desire may come forward. Those who do will be examined and such of them as are found fit will be taken up.
 The third matter is this. What shall we do to bridge the gulf that exists between Hindus and Muslims and bring together hearts that have become estranged? It is my life’s mission to bring about amity between the two communities. For 25 years I have been thinking how this may be done and have been mixing with Muslim friends. What I hear about Shahabad pierces my heart and makes it bleed.libtech_297_footnoteIf I could, I would have run up to the place and had a heart-to-heart talk with our Muslim brethren there. But I know my limitations. The Champaran
 
 
 matter is not yet out of the way and it is a principle of mine that one must live and die for the work on hand till it is brought to a successful issue. But I have been thinking about the problem, and should like to tell my Hindu brethren that we have grievously erred on this occasion, that we are more to blame. It is the duty of the wiser among the Hindus to heal the Muslims’ wounds and compensate them for the losses we have inflicted on them in Arrah. I would even go to the extent of saying that, if Shahabad Hindus cannot do this, Hindus all over the country should combine to do it. The lawyer friends who have been fighting in the courts, on the two sides, should withdraw the cases and inform the Government that they do not now want them to be proceeded with. To Muslim friends, I shall say that the fighting between the two communities in one district need not be made an excuse for fighting all over India. Even two brothers sometimes fight, but they should not be allowed to disrupt the family as a whole. In like manner, the two communities here need not take their quarrel outside the Province. We must, as a matter of religious duty, help the Muslim League and the Congress to accomplish the task they have undertaken. Our leaders have bestowed full thought on what they are doing and we have, therefore, no right to obstruct their efforts. We are preparing ourselves for swaraj and, if we waste our time in fighting in this manner, our descendants will have cause to blame us. It is up to us to settle our differences, but we seem incapable of doing so. One reason for our fighting is that we receive our education through a foreign tongue. This has cost us our courage and our manhood. Besides, we have lost contact with the masses; there is a big gulf separating our educated class and the masses. With better relations between the educated and the rest, such unseemly fighting would be impossible.
 The differences between Hindus and Muslims are over the cow. If we want cows to be protected, the thing to do is to save them from slaughter-houses. Not less than 30,000 cows and calves are killed for the British every day. While we have not succeeded in stopping this slaughter, we have no right to raise our hand  against  Muslims.  I should like to tell the Hindus that it is no religious act to kill Muslims in order to save cows. Hinduism prescribes only one way: that of tapascharya. To quote Tulsidasji, compassion is the root that sustains one in dharma; we should, accordingly, approach this work in the spirit of compassion. I also want cows to be protected but, for that purpose, I would ask the Muslim friends to apply the knife to my
 neck and kill me rather than the cow. I am sure they will respond to this prayerful request. If we cherish our own freedom, we have no right to deprive others of theirs. Interference with one another’s freedom leads to strained relations. If a Muslim  arrogantly  asks Hindus not to play on drums [near a mosque], the latter will never agree. If, however, the Muslims were to say in all humility, “Please do not play on drums and disturb us in the performance of our religious duty, in our devotions; if you do, we will lay down our lives,” I am sure there is no Hindu so thoughtless as to act against their wishes. The truth is that in this matter neither the Hindu nor the Muslim is being honest. If we want harmony, we can have it through love; never through intimidation, [for] the other party will not speak out frankly what it really feels.
 I have been saying that there should be a single national language, and that this should be Hindi. This, I hear, has created some misunderstanding among Muslims. Some of them imagine that, in advocating Hindi, I ignore the claims of Urdu. By Hindi I mean the language spoken by Hindus and Muslims in North India and written in Nagari and Urdu scripts. I am in no way ill-disposed to the Urdu language. In my view, the two languages are one; they have a common structure and idiom, except for the difference in respect of the use of Sanskrit and Persian words. I bear English no grudge, but it will not help us to mix with the masses and work among them like one of themselves. This is all I mean. Whether you speak of Hindustani or Hindi, to me they mean the same. It is our duty to carry on national work through Hindi. As for the script, no harm will be done if the Hindu boy uses the Nagari and the Muslim boy uses the Urdu; on the contrary, each will have learnt both the scripts. Among ourselves, we should hear only Hindi words, not English. Not only this, our  councils, too, should resound with debates in Hindi. I shall struggle all my life to bring this about.
 I have but one thing more to say: all over India, we are agitating for swaraj. We have realized from the experience of the Shahabad riots why swaraj is being delayed. It will not come with petitions and speeches. If the Hindu is out to shed Muslim blood in order to save the cow, swaraj will never come. If harmony is restored between the two communities and they declare that they will themselves settle their differences and guarantee that there will be no need for third-party intervention, swaraj will be ours. It does not require spread of
 education; the only requisite is amity among us, and strength. We should cultivate fearlessness before we can achieve swaraj. While we have the spark of the Divine in us, never need we fear any human being.libtech_298_footnote

53,"November 	12, 1917","SPEECH AT OPENING OF GOKHALE LIBRARY, UMRETHlibtech_299_footnote","
            FRIENDS,     November 	12, 1917 
  	I have been invited to declare open this library, named after 	Gokhale,  and  to  unveil  his  portrait.  This   is   a   sacred   	mission, and a solemn one.  These  days  people  in  the  West  are  	obsessed  with the idea that in founding a library one renders 	social service. An American city has a millionaire, Carnegie by 	name. He is so rich that, even if he were to distribute rupees by 	the million among the people, his hoard of wealth would not be 	exhausted. He donates libraries at innumerable places, all named 	after him. Some Scottish leaders requested him not to import such a 	practice into their country against their wishes, for [they said] it 	was likely to do much more harm than good. In Paris, libraries are 	being increasingly misused. You need not understand from this that I 	am against libraries. When a library is being started, and before 	deciding to start it, one should consider after whom it is to be 	named and what kinds of books it should make available to the 	townspeople, so that the library may be [suitably] named and its 	books read to some purpose.     that 	Hindi should be adopted and not Urdu. He said that foreign language 	should not be adopted and only a language be adopted which is 	understood by all. He said that Hindi and Urdu are mostly spoken and 	readily understood.”  
 And now about the portrait. Not only was Gokhale not hungry for fame, he did not even like being honoured in public. Often, on such occasions, he would cast his eyes down. If you believe that, when his portrait is unveiled, his soul will rest in peace, you are mistaken. This great man, when dying, thus declared his cherished wish: “After I am dead, my biography will be written, my statues will be put up and condolence meetings will be held; all this will avail but little to bring peace to my soul. My only wish is that the whole of India live as I have lived and that the Servants of India Society which I have established prosper.” They who are prepared to abide by this  testament are entitled to unveil Gokhale’s portrait.
 Gokhale’s was a life of extensive activities. Today, I shall relate some incidents in his domestic life for the benefit of the women assembled here. It is an example for them to follow, for Gokhale served his family very well. He never acted in a manner which would cause pain to anyone in the family. He refused to follow the current practice in Hindu society of marrying off a girl, doll-fashion, as soon as she reached the age of eight and so cast her away to sink in the sea. His daughter is still unmarried. He had to go through much  in keeping her so. Moreover, he lost his wife while he was yet in the bloom of youth. He could have married again, but he did not. He served his family in many ways; ordinarily everyone does so. One may, however, serve one’s family either out of self-interest or to advance the interests of the nation. Gokhale had renounced all considerations of self-interest. He did his duty by the family, and then the town and then the country, as occasion demanded, with an undaunted spirit, with perseverance and labour.
 In  Gokhale’s mind  there was  not a  trace  of   the   feeling that Hindus and Muslims are different. He regarded all with an equal eye and with affection. He would get angry sometimes, but the anger was provoked only by concern for national interests and it had invariably a wholesome effect on the other party. It even converted many Europeans who had been hostile into close friends.
 Anyone who looks at Gokhale’s life, the whole of it, will see that he had made it synonymous with national service. He left this world of sorrow before he was fifty, and the only reason for this is that all the twenty-four hours of the day he laboured indefatigably, using up his mental and physical energies in the service of the nation. Never did he allow the petty concern for himself and his family to enter his mind.
 The only thing that concerned him was what he could do for the country.
 Gokhale, this high-souled man, was also daily exercised over the issue of the uplift of the Antyaj communities, who constitute a great source of strength for the country, and he laboured in many ways to raise them up. If anyone commented on this, he would reply plainly that contact with an Antyaj was no defilement, that, on the contrary, one committed a heinous sin by entertaining the evil prejudice against such contact.
 When I went to see how the  Meghwadlibtech_300_footnotelibtech_301_footnotebrethren here weave, I was surprised to hear the children accompanying me talk of defilement. While I don’t wish to take up on this occasion the subject of caste, I shall certainly say that, unless we assimilate these classes, one can hope for no improvement in one’s town or in the country. If you have any hopes for swaraj, you will be disappointed. So long as you have not shaken off unthinking faith, so long as dissensions continue in the home, the family, the town and society as a whole, so long will you shout in vain for swaraj. Formerly, there were 50 looms in Umreth and now only two remain, and even these are none too prosperous. The reason is to be sought in your narrow outlook. It is the duty of the leaders here that they develop the local industries and secure patronage for them. If they do not show such concern, they are not entitled to put up the portrait of a saint like Gokhale, dedicated to service of others. I don’t think, however, that Umreth is altogether devoid of spirit. It is a matter of satisfaction that it has expressed regard for Mahatma Gokhale and has recognized his achievements.

54,"November 14, 1917",NEWS PAPERS,"
  
 [Before November 14, 1917] I promised the Editor a contribution for the Diwalilibtech_302_footnoteNumber of
 Hindustan. I find that I have no time to make good the promise, but, thinking that I must write something, I place before the readers my views on newspapers. Under pressure of circumstances, I had to work in a newspaper office in South Africa and this gave me an opportunity to think on the subject. I have put into practice all the ideas which I venture to advance here.
 In my humble opinion, it is wrong to use a newspaper as a means of earning a living. There are certain spheres of work which are of such consequence and have such bearing on public welfare that to undertake them for earning one’s livelihood will defeat the primary aim behind them. When, further, a newspaper is treated as a means of making profits, the result is likely to be serious malpractices. It is not necessary to prove to those who have some experience of journalism that such malpractices do prevail on a large scale.
 Newspapers are meant primarily to educate the people. They make the latter familiar with contemporary history. This is a work of no mean responsibility. It is a fact, however, that readers cannot always trust newspapers. Often facts are found to be quite the opposite of what has been reported. If newspapers realized that it was their duty to educate the people, they could not but wait to check a report before publishing it. It is true that, often, they have to work under difficult conditions. They have to sift the true from the false in but a short time and can only guess at the truth. Even then, I am of opinion that it is better not to publish a report at all if it has not been found possible to verify it.
 The reporting of speeches in Indian newspapers is generally defective. There are very few who can take down a speech verbatim, so that speeches are generally found to be a mere hotchpotch. The best thing to do would be to send the proofs of the reported speech to the speaker for correction and the paper should publish its own report of the speech only if the speaker does not correct anything in the proofs sent to him.
 
 It is often observed that newspapers publish any matter that they have, just to fill in space. This practice is almost universal. It is so in the West, too. The reason is that most newspapers have their eye on profits. There is no doubt that newspapers have done great service. Their defects are therefore overlooked. But, to my mind, they have done no less harm. There are newspapers in the West which are so full of trash that it will be a sin even to touch them. Many, full of prejudices, create or increase ill will among people. At times, they produce bitterness and strife even between different families and communities. Thus, newspapers cannot escape criticism merely because they serve the people. On the whole, it would seem that the existence of newspapers promotes good and evil in equal measure.
 It is now an established practice with newspapers to depend for revenues mainly on advertisements rather than on subscriptions. The result has been deplorable. The very newspaper which writes against the drink-evil publishes advertisements in praise of drink. In the same issue, we read of the harmful effects of tobacco as also from where to buy it. Or we shall find the same issue of a paper carrying a long advertisement for a certain play and denouncing that play as well. Medical advertisements are the largest source of revenue, though they have done, and are still doing, incalculable harm to the people. These medical advertisements almost wholly offset the services rendered by newspapers. I have been an eye-witness to the harm done by them. Many people are lured into buying harmful medicines. Many of these promote immorality. Such advertisements find a place even in papers run to further the cause of religion. This practice has come entirely from the West. No matter at what cost or effort, we must put an end to this undesirable practice or, at least, reform it. It is the duty of every newspaper to exercise some restraint in the matter of advertisements.
 The last question to consider is: What is the duty of newspapers when laws like the Seditious Writings Act and the Defence of India Act are in force? We often find our papers guilty of equivocation. Some have perfected this method into a science. But, in my opinion this harms the country. People become weak and  equivocation becomes a habit with them. This changes the form of language: instead of being a medium for the expression of one’s thoughts, it becomes a mask for concealing them. I am convinced that this is not the way to develop strength in the people. The people,  both collectively and individually, must cultivate the habit of speaking only
 what is in their minds. Newspapers are a good means of such education, for those who would evade these laws had better not bring out a paper at all; the other course is to ignore the laws in question and state one’s real views fearlessly but respectfully and bear the consequences. Mr. Justice Stephen has said somewhere that a man who has no treason in his heart can speak no treason. If it is there in the heart, one should speak it out. If one does not have the courage for this, one should stop publishing a newspaper. This is in the best interests of all.

HINDU STRI MANDALlibtech_303_footnote","
  
 [On or before November 14, 1917]
 The women whom this message reaches are likely to have had some measure of education. I wish, therefore, to consider one thing. What should educated women do for their illiterate sisters ? This is a very important issue. Beyond question, if women choose, they can attain a far greater measure of success in this field than men can ever do. At present, we do not find many women taking to this work. That is, I believe, not their fault but that of their education. The first thing, therefore, which educated women must do is to try and see that their sisters do not fall a victim to it. Modern education fails utterly to prepare women for their distinctive role; this is not questioned by anyone. I do not wish here to examine the shortcomings of modern education or to bother you with the question how they may be overcome. All that I desire is that educated women should make this question their own and that those of them with some experience should dedicate their all to rouse Gujarat over it and focus attention on the right lines [of reform].
 Educated women have no contact with those not educated; often, they don’t welcome such contacts. This disease must be cured. It is necessary that educated women are made conscious of their most obvious duty. Men also are not free from faults of this kind, but women need not follow in their footsteps. They  have  the  power, denied to men, of creating new ideals and translating them into action. By comparison, man is thoughtless, impatient and given to the pursuit
 
 
 of novelty. Woman, it is observed, is serious-minded, patient and inclined generally to cling to old ways. When, therefore, she has a new idea, it seems to have its birth in the tender depths of her heart. An idea born in this manner commands her unshakable faith and, for that reason, it is capable of being rapidly propagated. I believe therefore that, if educated women give up copying the ways of men and think independently about the important questions affecting their sex, we shall find it quite easy to solve many a knotty problem.
 The problem of widows is not quite a simple one. It is a worthy cause to which quite a few women can dedicate their lives. It is one thing for a widow to marry again, if she so desires, quite another to waste one’s time over persuading a child-widow to do so. If women were to resolve, instead, and induce others to resolve, not to marry a widower or offer one’s daughter in marriage to one, and  not  to sacrifice one’s daughter to a child bridegroom, fit enough  to  be rocked in a cradle, I am confident the fruits will be sweet for India. It is worth considering carefully in what way the country can avail itself of the services of hundreds of widows, young and old; if educated women will not think about this, who else should? I have had an idea for many years; I may as well mention it here. Only a few years ago, our women used to spin cotton, and even weave. Today, the art is about to disappear. India has had to suffer much because  of  its decline. Millions of rupees have been lost to foreign countries. At present, widows spend their time going to temples or in the service of those claiming to be holy men, or in idle gossip. It does not seem to me that one can live a religious life only by going to a temple, though, of course, I do not wish to suggest that thoughtful visits to a temple may not be profitable. The idea, however, that spending time in a temple, unmindful of other tasks, is the furthest limit of selflessness is sheer superstition. Likewise, to wait on men of holy life, who stand in no need of services from others, and to serve them in all manner of ways, is unwholesome for both parties and waste of one’s time. To draw widows away from such activities and induce them to take up the task of serving India, work which will promote their ultimate good, is to help them to remarriage of the purest kind. Why do  not  the educated women embark upon this mission? Those of  them who might think of doing so should themselves take the first lesson in the school of industry, namely, spin cotton and weave.

DEAR MR. MERRIMANlibtech_304_footnote,
 I think that I ought to keep you informed of my doings. Having received an offer of a ready-made school building and an invitation to open a school in a Kham village, I opened one today in Barharva Lakhamsen near Daka. I have put there the best volunteer teachers from among those who have offered their assistance. They are Mr. and Mrs. Gokhalay from Bombay. They have their independent means, and Mrs. Gokhalay was doing educational work in Bombay. The nature of the work they will do I have already described to you. I am hoping, with the assistance, if possible, of the heads of the respective concerns to open similar schools, one in the Peeprah Dehatlibtech_305_footnoteand another in the Tarkaulia Dehat, and I hope to open one in the Belwa Dehat, As this attempt is in the nature of an experiment, I do not want to open more than four or five schools, until some definite result is obtained. I hope that I shall have the co-operation of the local officials in an experiment which, I know, is full of difficulty, but which is fraught with important consequences if it becomes successful.libtech_306_footnote
 I am, Yours truly.

 What shall I give you on this auspicious day? I am trying to give you what you, I and many others lack. If one has that, one has everything. Only he who has it can give it. If that is the truth, what can I give? However, we may strive for it together.libtech_315_footnote
 Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.
 And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.
 And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing. Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not, charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil; rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.
 Charity never faileth; but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.
 For we know in part, and we prophesy in part. But when that which is perfect  is come, then that which is in part shall be done away. When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things. For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.
 And now abideth  faith,  hope,  charity,  these three;  but  the  greatest  of  these is charity.
 
 Read this, meditate on it and read it again. Read it in English and translate it into Hindi. Strain every nerve to have at least a brief glimpse of love. Miralibtech_316_footnotelibtech_317_footnotehad felt the stab of this dagger of love, deep in her heart. If we could but get hold of this dagger and get also the strength to stab ourselves with it, we could shake the world. The thing is there in me, and yet I feel its lack every moment. There is much that is wanting. Sometimes, I behave like a half-filled pot. Only yesterday, I had no time to spare for people who wanted, in their love, to detain me. I felt sore over this all the time. This is no sign of love. That is just the way a half-filled pot spills over. May the New Year bring you prosperity. It is my wish, and my only blessing, that you may grow in your physical, mental and spiritual powers and dedicate them all, with love, to India.

RESPECTED BHAISHRI,
 Your letter brought the same calm to my mind that one from Kalabhailibtech_322_footnotewould have done. I   am  all  love  and  admiration  for  the Patwari family. I can never forget the helplibtech_323_footnoteyou gave me at a critical moment. I have looked upon you as an elder brother. No one can say what way I would have gone if you had not helped me in Bombay.
 I can make only one return: I can so live as to make you think that the help given to me was well deserved. I have a feeling that you are saddened after I have taken up my work for Bhangis. I could not, and I cannot, give up my work for Bhangis. But your being unhappy makes me sad and so, when I received your letter, I knew that, though you disapprove of my work for Bhangis, on the whole you don’t disapprove of all my activities. This came to me as a blessin. But I hope for more. In the name of Vaishnava dharma that most sacred
 
 dharma is being destroyed; in the name of cow-protection, destruction of cows is brought about; in the name of religion, the most irreligious practices are prevalent; posing to be men  of  religion,  irreligious people lay down the law on religious matters. If I can see these things, how is it that you, who cherish Vaishnava dharma, should not see them? I find myself constantly asking this question. Contact with a Bhangi can never be sinful; killing a Muslim for [saving] cows can never be a righteous act; the holy books can never have enjoined untruth; men who give free rein to their desires ought not to rule in matters of religion; all this is axiomatic. How can there be any difference of opinion about this? Would you not like to use the influence you have acquired over the Vaishnava community towards this end? Can you not help men like me at least with your verbal support? What tapascharya can I go through to make you see things as I see them? I keep asking these questions. Please think [of them] inwardly again.
 I send you [reports of] my speecheslibtech_324_footnoteand  should  like  you  to read them again from this point of view.
 Though I may not be able just now to read the books you mention, please send them to me.

MOTIHARI,
 November 19, 1917
 
DEAR MR. MERRIMAN,
 
 In the schools I am opening, children  under  the  age  of  12 only are admitted. The idea is to get hold of as many children as possible and to give them an all-round education, i.e., a knowledge of Hindi or Urdu and, through that medium, of Arithmetic, rudim-ents of History and Geography, a knowledge of simple scientific principles and some industrial training. No cut and dried syllabus has been yet prepared, because I am going along an unbeaten track. I look upon our own present system with horror and distrust.  Instead  of developing the moral and the mental faculties of the little children, it dwarfs them. In my experiment, whilst I shall draw upon what is good in it, I shall endeavour to avoid the defects of the present system. The chief thing aimed at is contact of the children with men and women of culture and unimpeachable moral character. That to me is education. Literary training is to be used merely as a means to that end. The industrial training is designed to give the boys and girls who may come to us, an additional means of livelihood. It is not intended that on completing their education, they should leave their hereditary occupation, viz., agriculture, but make use of the knowledge gained in the school to refine agriculture and agricultural life. Our teachers will also touch the lives of the grown-up people and, if at all possible, penetrate the purdah. Instructions will, therefore, be given to grown- up people in hygiene and about the advantages of joint action for the promotion of communal welfare, such as the making of village roads proper, the sinking of wells, etc. And as no school will be manned by teachers who are not men or women of good training, we propose to give free medical aid, so far as is possible. In Badharwa for instance, Mrs. Avantikabai Gokhalay who is a trained nurse and midwife and who, assisted by her husband, is in charge of the school, has already dispensed castor oil and quinine to scores of patients during the four days that she has been at work and visited several female patients.
 If you desire any further information, I shall be only too glad to supply you with it. My hope is that I shall be able to enlist in my work full co-operation of the local authority. I am opening another school
 tomorrow near Shrirampur, about two miles from Amolwa.
 Regarding the raiyats, complaints about documents, evidently the point I wished to make was not made by me. I know that the raiyats can go to court about compulsion. The difficulty is that they are neither trained nor organized enough for orderly work. What is morally compulsion may not be compulsion in law. My experience of the Champaran raiyat is that he is extremely unintelligent and is easily made to assent mentally to any proposition. I hold, therefore, that the Government, as the guardian of such people, have to save them from their own ignorance. I do not say that in the Saraiya case brought to your notice, any compulsion has been used. I simply suggested that, in order that there might be no allegation of compulsion after such documents as I have referred to in my previous letter are signed, you might, if you deemed it proper, inquire about the  contracts  now offered to the raiyats for their signatures.
 I am, Yours truly,

 MOTIHARI,
 
   DEAR 	MR. MERRIMAN,  November 	22, 1917 
  	I went over to Bhitiharva on Tuesday last and opened a school there. 	Mr. Soman, a public worker from  Belgaum,  and  a  B.A.  LL.B., has  	been  left  in  charge,  and  he  will  be  assisted  by   Mr. 	Balkrishna, a young man from Gujarat. Mrs. Gandhi will join them on 	the 24th. Her work will be chiefly confined  to  moving  among the 	women.  	I was in Badharwa yesterday, and Mrs. Gokhalay and my son were just 	returning from a visit to a dying man. They told me that the people 	in the District were woefully neglectful of the patients, and they 	believed that many preventible deaths must occur in the District for 	want of a simple observance of the rudimentary principles of 	hygiene. I know that this will not come to you as news, because it 	is not a peculiar condition of the District in which Mrs. Gokhalay 	is working, or of Champaran, but it is a chronic condition among the 	peasantry of India.  	I simply mentioned the incidents in order that, as soon as I have 	advanced a little more in my experiment, I may enlist your active 	sympathy and help in a Department in which all can meet without 	reserve.  	Dr.  Devlibtech_330_footnotelibtech_331_footnote,  who   is  a   qualified   and   experienced   	surgeon   and physician, and Secretary of the Servants of India 	Society came on Tuesday.

Dr. Dev will 	chiefly supervise the Medical Branch of the work.  	I may state that I shall be away from Champaran for over a 	fortnight. Babu Brijkishore Prasad will represent me in my absence.libtech_332_footnote  I 	am, Yours truly,  M. K.

  	I have your letter. You have been keeping your vows well enough and 	they are good ones to take. It is my conviction that one cannot 	build one’s character without the help of vows. They are to a man 	what anchor is to a ship. A ship without an anchor is tossed to and 	fro and finally broken on the rocks; without vows, human beings meet 	a similar fate. The vow of truth includes all others. How would a 	man who respects truth violate brahmacharya or steal 	anything? “ Brahma alone is real; all else is 	non-existent.” If this  sutralibtech_333_footnotelibtech_334_footnoteis 	true, knowledge of Brahma is implied in the observance 	of truth.  	Non-violence and truth are convertible terms. This seems to be the 	idea behind the saying, “One must speak truth, truth that is 	agreeable.”libtech_335_footnoteThat 	is genuine truth which causes no pain, for that alone is 	non-violent. Truth may sound harsh but it can never result in 	suffering. Our employment of truth may offend the other person, but 	his conscience will tell him that what was said about him was true 	and was said with the best of motives. We are here interpreting 	truth in its widest connotation. Truth does not mean merely being 	truthful in speech; the term “truth” means exactly the same 	thing as it does in the sutra about Brahma alone being 	true. The English word “truth” also carries the same meaning.  	I remember to have told you that you are not made to work for 	women’s education. I may be wrong, but I think it is quite a 	difficult task and I have not felt that you have the strength 	required for it. From my experience of you, I do not think that you 	can take up the work by yourself. All the same, if you are so much 	in love with it, by all means go on with it. I think Sharadabehn 	also will not be able to manage without you now. It may be just as 	well, therefore, if you do not give up that work.      : 	|| 
 I have not noticed much physical energy in you. You need to spend, in the Ashram or elsewhere, two or three months in purely physical work, as much of it as your body can stand—from cleaning food grains to digging pits. This will give you fresh mental energy. Your slowness in work will disappear. The eyes, hands, legs, etc., need to be exercised. I have noticed that you lack energy.
 I have read Nandlal Kisan’s letter. We shall have a talk about what we can do in the Indian States. You will meet me in Bombay, or in Ahmedabad at any rate, in December.
 If you have faith in yourself, you will be able to do much in your family circle. It is for the son to bring round the mother. A mother loves her son so much that she even submits to his wishes. It will be a crime for you not to spare enough time for your daughters.

 HOW  TO PREVENT 1T ?
  If 	one’s blood is 	pure, it 	has the power 	of destroying 	the germs 	of every 	type of disease.  If, 	therefore, we 	maintain our 	body in 	a healthy state, thanks 	to the 	pure blood, 	it will remain 	well protected 	even in an epidemic 	of contagious disease.  For 	maintaining purity 	of blood, 	one must 	eat simple 	food, in 	limited quantity and 	at fixed 	hours. Any diet 	containing excessive fat 	or sugar, 	or cooked 	with spices, must be 	avoided. One 	 must  eat nothing for at least three hours before bed time. Air too is food. One 
 
 should not, therefore, sleep except in a house with proper windows and doors, and these should be kept open. Nor should one sleep with one’s face entirely covered with the sheet. If the head feels cold, one may wear a cap, but the face should always be left uncovered. If the mouth is kept closed and air inhaled only through the nostrils, there is no risk of one’s feeling cold. Water, too, must be clean. It is an excellent practice always to drink water that has been boiled and strained through thick cloth. The latter should be carefully washed every day. And so, also, the inside of the water-pot should be properly cleaned every day. Every man or woman should have as  much  exercise daily as may be got by walking for two hours.
  Even 	a person 	who does 	all this 	and keeps 	healthy may 	have his 	blood affected if 	the home 	and its surroundings 	are not clean. 	The doors 	and windows, the ceiling, the floor, the staircase—in short, every 	part of 	the house—should 	be kept 	perfectly clean. 	For this 	purpose, such 	part of the 	house as 	can be 	washed should be 	washed properly 	and then 	allowed to dry. 	Cobwebs, dust, 	straw and rubbish 	of every 	description should 	every day be 	carefully swept 	out of 	the house. 	It should 	be ensured 	that no 	part of 	the house remains 	wet. Carpets 	and floor-coverings 	should be daily 	taken up [for 	dusting] and 	not left in their place day 	after day. Doctors say 	that the 	plague spreads through 	fleas. In 	a well-swept 	house with 	plenty of 	air and 	light, fleas will 	hardly ever enter. They 	say, too, that the 	disease spreads through 	rats. One 	should, therefore, 	examine all 	the corners of 	the floor 	and the 	entire plastering and 	see that there are 	no holes 	anywhere. This can be 	done easily enough, and 	at no expense. 	It is because 	of our 	laziness that 	rats make their holes in 	our houses. 	Keeping a cat 	in the 	house will 	prevent it from 	being so infested.  But 	the most important 	cause of 	illness in 	India is 	the defective 	and extremely 	harmful methods 	we follow for 	answering calls of 	nature. A 	large number 	of people 	do this 	in the 	open. The excreta are 	not covered 	over with earth or 	otherwise, and 	this leads to 	the breeding of 	millions of 	flies every 	day. They come 	into contact, first, 	with excreta and 	then with our body, food 	and clothes. Several 	kinds of poisonous 	gases are 	generated by 	the excreta 	all the time and these 	pollute the 	air all round. It 	is obvious that when 	air, which is men’s 	best food, 	is being 	thus continually 	polluted, they cannot 	maintain good health. 	The filth 	in our 	latrines is 	equally or 	even more harmful. 	For it is in our very homes. If, therefore, we go out into the open, after 
 defecating we must cover the excreta with earth as people in other countries do. Latrines should have arrangements for dry dust to be sprinkled in sufficient quantity every time after use.  The  excreta should be collected in some sort of a bucket. The refuse-pit should be avoided altogether and all conduits should be closed up. Urine and water should also be collected in the bucket. If we did not cherish false notions in the name of religion, we would never tolerate such hellish filth. The latrine should be so constructed as to permit the scavenger access to every part of it. Unless these improvements are carried out, cities in India will never be free from infectious diseases.
  The 	air gets polluted 	also by 	reason of people 	urinating or spitting 	or throwing 	litter and 	other rubbish anywhere 	on the 	roads. Doctors 	have discovered that 	germs spread even from the 	spittle of 	certain categories of 	patients, of 	tuberculous patients for 	instance, and 	infect others. 	We must 	certainly consider 	what we do 	and where. Millions 	of people 	in this 	country walk 	bare-foot. It 	is a sorry 	state of affairs 	that they have to 	walk on 	filth. Our 	roads, our 	streets or 	the verandahs 	of our 	houses should 	be so clean 	that  one 	 would  not hesitate to 	sit down or even sleep on them, 
 We would do well to do some careful thinking why it is that, in   cities   with   an   English   population,   the    English    localities are unaffected even when an epidemic of the plague is raging. The reason is nothing else than the cleanliness of the place. Maintaining cleanliness requires no money but merely intelligent care.
 TREATMENT
  The 	plague will 	never spread to 	cities where these rules are carefully 	observed. Let us 	now consider 	what should 	be done 	when it has actually 	broken out. Whenever 	a case 	of plague 	is detected, 	one must search out 	rats and, if 	one finds any 	dead ones, they 	must be removed 	with a pair 	of tongs 	to a distant 	place and burnt 	with the help 	of hay 	or kerosene 	or buried 	in a 	deep pit 	far away from 	human habitation. 	The place 	where a dead 	rat is 	found should be 	covered with 	live ashes and 	whitewashed, the room 	emptied of everything, 	swept clean and 	fumigated with 	neem leaves. 	If the 	walls permit of 	being whitewashed, 	they should 	be. If 	there are 	any rat holes, they 	should be 	opened up 	to make sure that there 	are no 	dead rats inside 	and then filled 	in. Any holes 	elsewhere in the 	house should be 	treated in the same manner. The doors and windows should be kept open and 
 plenty of light and heat let in; if the roofs are covered with country tiles, they should also be removed so as to let in air and light. Having cleaned up the house in this manner, we should leave it empty and, if possible, live in tents or huts put up in the open. We should avoid contact with other people in the town and even when shopping be careful not to touch the shopkeeper. If in this way immediate remedial measures are taken, the plague will not spread further. It will not affect other families in the same town or neighbouring towns through the families which have already been affected. If, after 31 days outside, one finds that the infection has not spread elsewhere or that no dead rats are found in the unoccupied house, the family can return to it.
 8 In any town where a case of the plague has occurred, the other families should immediately inspect their own houses. They should remove the household things outside and look for rats. If they find any dead ones, they should leave the house and go to live outside as advised above. Even if no dead rats are found, the house should be thoroughly swept and kept very clean afterwards. It should be whitewashed. If there are no arrangements for ventilation,  the necessary structural improvements should be carried out. Measures should also be adopted to maintain the utmost cleanliness in the surroundings. If the neighbours’ houses are not clean, it should be seen to it that they are cleaned.
  Nothing 	should be done 	to put 	the patient into 	a fright. 	No one 	except the 	person nursing 	him should 	be allowed 	to go near 	him. He should 	be kept 	only in a room 	with plenty of air 	and light. If 	there is 	a public hospital, 	he should be 	removed there. All 	food should 	be discontinued. 	If he has 	had no food 	for three 	hours at the 	time the 	symptoms of 	the plague 	are detected, 	he should 	be immediately 	given an enema. 	He should 	be placed 	in a tub, 	filled with cold water, for 	two minutes 	or, if 	he prefers, for 	five minutes so 	that his 	legs and 	chest remain 	out of 	water, and 	the portion from 	the knees to the 	hips under water. 	If he feels thirsty, he may be given as much as he needs of water 	that has been boiled, 	cooled, and filtered. 	Apart from this, he 	should have 	nothing to eat, 	or even 	to drink. 	If the 	head feels very hot, a 	mud poultice 	or a wet 	sheet pack should be 	applied to 	it. Very 	likely, these measures 	will suffice 	to secure 	the patient 	against the risk of 	death. If 	he survives 	the next day and if 	he feels hungry, he 	may be 	given lime 	juice or 	orange juice to 	drink, mixed with 	boiling water or cold 	water. When the temperature has become quite normal, he may be started on 
 milk. If there is a tumour, it should be treated with hot water poultice, which should be changed often. A piece of thick cloth 1_ ft. long and 9 in. broad should be wetted with hot water and the water drained out, placing the cloth in a dry handkerchief. The cloth should then be folded up into four layers and placed on the tumour, as hot as the patient can bear, and the tumour should be bandaged up. The poultice should be changed after every 30 minutes. In this  disease,  the patient’s heart grows very weak and he should, therefore, be given complete rest.
  The 	man attending on 	the patient 	should keep away from 	others and 	avoid any 	work which requires 	contacts with them. 	To ensure 	his own 	safety, he 	should reduce his 	food to 	a minimum and 	otherwise be 	very careful 	of his 	health. He 	should not 	worry at 	all. If he feels constipated, 	he should 	take an enema 	to clear 	the intestines 	and live 	only on fruits.  The 	patient’s clothes 	should not be 	washed in 	a river 	or at any 	other place where 	others’ clothes are 	washed. They 	should be 	soaked in boiling 	soap water. 	If they 	are very dirty, they 	should be 	burnt away. The 	bedding, etc., should 	not be 	used by 	anyone else 	and, if clean 	enough, it should 	be dried 	in the sun daily 	for eight 	days, exposing 	both sides by 	turns to 	sunshine. If 	one can afford 	it, one 	should have it burnt away.

MY DEAR WEST,
 I have your important letter before me. My view is that if you can turn out Indian Opinion  only by removing to Townlibtech_345_footnote, you should suspend publication. I do not like the idea of your competing for jobs or advertisements. I think that when that time comes we shall have outlived our purpose. I would rather that you sold out Phoenix and
 
 
 you and Samlibtech_346_footnotelibtech_347_footnotewere engaged in some other independent work. If you can make of Phoenix something without the Paper, I shall like the idea. But if you cannot even eke out a living from agriculture at Phoenix, Phoenix should be sold. Hilda’s education can remain in your own hands. Surely some drastic steps are necessary for a due fulfilment of one’s ideals.
 If you cannot support yourself out of Phoenix with or without the Paper and cannot secure a decent job for yourself, I must find your maintenance from here. You will then let me know how much you will require and for how long. For I presume that you will try to secure work there. I am quite willing to have Devilibtech_348_footnotelibtech_349_footnotehere if she would come and even you if you could come alone for a time. But I know that Mrs. Pywelllibtech_350_footnotelibtech_351_footnoteand perhaps Mrs. West too may not like the climate or the surroundings here.
 If Manilal wants to try his hand at turning out a sheet himself at any cost, he may be allowed to do it.
 This I  know  that  the  proposed  attempt  in  Town  must  become a dismal failure. We left it because we found it unworkable. We have arrived at all the stages after careful  deliberation  and  as  they   were   found  necessary.   Your   methods   cannot    be    those  of ordinary business men. You will soon tire. Why try what is foredoomed to failure? I would like to let Manilal have a hand if he will but try. I am writinglibtech_352_footnotelibtech_353_footnoteto him.libtech_354_footnote

  	I arrived here this morning from my peregrinations and found your 	letter awaiting me. I hope you will not worry about the money. I 	shall trace the error somehow. Anyway, I have told Revashankarbhai 	that he is to honour your drawings. You need not therefore put off 	your visit to Calcutta if you can otherwise manage it. I should like 	you not to feel hampered by the imaginary pecuniary difficulty.  	I am sorry you can no longer take you walks. They are such a tonic 	and a necessity. I shall therefore hope to hear from you that you 	have been able to resume them.  	Yes, I went to Delhi to see Mr. Montagu and had a good chat with him 	as also Mr. Roberts. The Viceroy was also present. All the three 	were nice. There is no doubt that we shall gain something good.      
 I then went to Calcutta to attend the opening of Sir.J.C. Bose’s Institute. It was a spiritual affair rather than a popular show. I was glad to be able to go.
 Thence I went to Ahmedabad and Bombay and attended imp- ortant meetings. But the journeying was trying. The trains were always crowded. Night and day travelling under such conditions must tell.

MY DEAR SAM,
 
 Mr. West has asked me whether it may not be advisable to shift to Town. My  answer  is  in  the  negative.  I  would  feel   deeply  hurt if you cannot  keep  up  Indian  Opinion  in  Phoenix.  In  any  case you should not remove the works. If you cannot turn out the Paper in Phoenix, it must be stopped. You should then try to get a living from agriculture alone devoting the whole of your time to it. If that too fails, you should earn your living in Town. I have suggested to Manilal that he should, with the assistance of Ramlibtech_363_footnotelibtech_364_footnote, Devi Behn and Nagarji alone, turn out the Gujarati part only. If  Ram  and  even Nagarji cannot be supported they too should go. I do not care even if two sheets only are turned out in Gujarati every week.
You are on your trial. Please do not fail. We cannot compete in

OPINION”libtech_372_footnote","
 
 
MOTIHARI,
  December 	15, 1917  	When I left South Africa, I had fully intended to write to my Indian 	and English friends there from time to time, but I found my lot in 	India to be quite different from what I had expected it to be. I had 	hoped to be able to have comparative peace and leisure but I have 	been irresistibly drawn into many activities. I hardly cope with 	them and local daily correspondence. Half of my time is passed in 	the Indian trains. My South African friends will, I hope, forgive me 	for my apparent neglect of them. Let me assure them that not a day 	has passed when I have not thought of them and their kindness. South 	African associations can never be effaced from my memory.  	You will not now be surprised when I tell you that it was only today 	that I learnt from Indian Opinion to hand, about the 	disastrous floods. During my travels I rarely read newspapers and I 	have time merely to glance at them whilst I am not travelling. I 	write this to tender my sympathy to the sufferers. My imagination 	enables me to draw a true picture of their sufferings. They make one 	think of God and His might and the utter evanescence of this life. 	They ought to teach us ever to seek His protection and never to fail 	in the daily duty before us. In the divine account books only our 	actions are noted, not what we have spoken. These and similar 	reflections fill my soul for the moment and I wish to share them 	with the sufferers. The deep poverty that I experience in this 	country deters me even from thinking of financial assistance to be 	sent for those who have been rendered homeless. Even one pie in this 	country counts. I am, at this very moment, living in the midst of 	thousands who have  nothing  but roasted pulse or grain-flour mixed 	with water and salt. We, therefore, can only send the sufferers an 	assurance of our heartfelt grief.  	I hope that a determined movement will be set on foot to render 	residence on flats exposed to visitations of  death-dealing  floods 	illegal. The poor will, if they can, inhabit even such sites 	regardless of consequences. It is for the enlightened persons to 	make it impossible for them to do so.  The 	issues of Indian 	Opinion that 	acquainted me with the    
 destruction caused by the floods gave me also the sad news of Mr. Abdul Gani’slibtech_373_footnotelibtech_374_footnotedeath. Please convey my respectful condolences to the members of our friend’s family. Mr. Abdul Gani’s services to the community can never be forgotten. His sobriety of judgment and never-failing courtesy would have done credit to anybody. His wise handling of public questions was a demonstration of the fact that services to one’s country could be effectively rendered without a knowledge of English or modern training. I note, too, that our people in South Africa are not yet free from difficulties about trade licences and leaving certificates. My Indian experience has confirmed the opinion that there is no remedy like passive resistance against such evils. The community has to exhaust milder remedies, but I hope that it will not allow the sword of passive resistance to get rusty. It is our duty, whilst the terrible war lasts, to be satisfied with petitions, etc., for the desired relief, but I think the Government should know that the community will not rest until the questions above mentioned are satisfactorily solved. It is but right that I should also warn the community against dangers from within. I hear from those who return from South Africa that we are by no means free of those who are engaged in illicit traffic. We, who seek justice, must be  above suspicion, and I hope that our leaders will not rest till they  have purged the community of internal defects.

82,"December 	19, 1917",LETTER T0 REVENUE SECRETARY,"
             TO  THE 	SECRETARY         MOTIHARI,  December 	19, 1917 
  GOVERNMENT 	OF BIHAR 	AND ORISSA 	REVENUE 	DEPARTMENT  [PATNA 	SIR,] I 	have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter No.  	116-II-T-44-R.T. of the 6th December 1917, enclosing copy of the 	Champaran Agrarian Bill and inviting my remarks thereon.libtech_384_footnote I 	beg to submit as follows:—   With 		reference to 		Section 4, 		I observe 		that although 		both sub-sections (a) 		and (b) apply to 		the same transaction, 		sub-section (a) covers 		a wider 		area than sub-section 		(b), I have not 		been able to conjecture 		any reason 		for it. But I 		suggest that 		the wording of 		sub- section 		(b) may be 		copied for 		sub-section (a) 		and, therefore, the 		word “condition” 		occurring in 		the second line 		of sub-section 		(a) be 		removed. And 		the words “Section 3” 		occurring in 		line 3 		thereof may 		be replaced 		by “sub-section 		2 of 		Section 3”.  With 		reference to 		Section 5, 		I beg 		to state 		that the Commit- tee’s 		recommendations cover contracts between landlords and 		raiyats, 		not their tenants as well as their tenants.       
 There are numerous cases in which raiyats enter into contracts with zamindars who are not their landlords. It is necessary, therefore, to amend the wording “a tenant whether holding under him” occurring in line 2 thereof by saying “a tenant whether holding, under him or otherwise”, and by removing the words “grown upon the land of his tenancy or any portion thereof” occurring in lines 3 and 4 of the Section.
 It is suggested that these last words are redundant. It is intended that the Legislature should protect the raiyats in  respect  of all contracts as between zamindars and the raiyats concerning the sale of produce.
  With 	reference to 	Section 6, 	I fear that 	as it stands it is calculated 	to produce 	results the reverse 	of what 	is contemplated 	by the 	Government and 	the Committee. Under 	sub-section (1) thereof, 	an agent 	who is 	a mere straw may 	be put 	up by an unscrupulous 	landlord to collect abwablibtech_385_footnotelibtech_386_footnote. Such an agent, if he is detected, will unhesitatingly suffer 	the penalties 	prescribed by the 	Section, as 	the landlord 	of the 	type mentioned 	by me will 	always make 	[it] worth his 	while to 	do so. I, 	therefore, suggest 	that it is necessary 	in every 	case to make the 	landlord liable. 	Sub-section (1), 	therefore, should 	be amended 	by removing 	the words “or his 	agent” occurring in 	line 1 	and by 	adding the words 	“whether directly or 	through an 	agent” after the 	pronoun “who” 	in the 	said line. Sub-section 	3 of 	the said Section 	should be entirely 	removed. It is possible 	for a 	poor ignorant raiyat 	to be in the 	right and 	yet be unable 	to prove 	his case. 	It will 	be a 	gross injustice if 	such an 	innocent raiyat 	is punished. 	Moreover, the existence 	of such 	sub-section will 	act as an effective deterrent 	against any 	 raiyats  lodging 	a complaint 	about abwab. 	It should 	be added 	that the power 	of punishing 	complainants for 	lodging false 	complaints is 	to be sparingly used. It 	requires a 	highly trained judicial 	mind to 	arrive at 	a firm 	conclusion as to 	complaints being 	false. It is, therefore, 	a dangerous 	thing to 	give summary 	powers to a 	Collector who 	will not be 	acting judicially. 	Lastly, a single 	abortion of 	justice under 	sub- section 3 is 	bound to 	result in 	an unscrupulous landlord 	being bolder 	in his 	exactions, for 	he will 	know that the raiyats 	after proceedings 	under sub-section 	3 will 	have been cowed down. Considering 	all the 	above circumstances, 	I trust 	that the sub-section 	in question 	will be 	removed. If, however, it is found difficult to carry the amendments to 
 
 
 Section 6 as proposed by me, I suggest that the whole of the Section be withdrawn. I would far rather have the less effective protection of Section 75 of the Bengal Tenancy Act than have the doubtful protection of Section 6.
  I 	 observe 	 that  cart  sattaslibtech_387_footnotelibtech_388_footnotedealt  with 	 by 	  the  Committee 	have been 	covered by 	the proposed 	law. There 	 are  such sattas  running 	into anything 	between 7 and 	20 years 	with the same 	rate of payment 	throughout. Several 	planters in 	reply to 	questions by 	the Committee 	not being able to 	justify the 	terms of their 	sattas said 	that they 	did not enforce them 	as a 	matter of 	fact. I 	venture to 	suggest that 	there ought to 	be a section 	declaring such sattas 	to be void. New 	sattas, 	if necessary for 	short periods, may 	be entered 	into after the rate 	of hire 	is fixed 	in consultation 	with the 	Divisional 	Commissi-oner. I may 	state, even at 	the present 	moment, proceedings for 	damages for 	breach of 	these sattas 	are pending. 
 I have read the correspondence in the Press carried on by Messrs  Irwinlibtech_389_footnoteand   Jamesonlibtech_390_footnoteand   I   have   read   also   the   speeches delivered by Messrs Jameson and Kennedylibtech_391_footnotein the Council on the Bill. Regarding both I wish merely to state that there is a complete answer to every one of the statements made by these writers and speakers. I have refrained from saying anything about them for fear of unnecessarily burdening the Government. But should any point raised by these gentlemen require elucidation from me, I shall be pleased to offer my views on any such point on hearing from you.

How is your health ?  	My activities are expanding. I am wearing myself out in placing my 	ideals before the country while my star is in the ascendant.  	Mahadev will give you some idea about the situation here. He has 	joined only recently but is an old hand already.  	Manilal is being severely tried in Phoenix.

 You should write even if I do not. When you think you can stay with me all by yourself, I shall readily have you at Champaran. But that is a risk to be taken only when you desire it. I know there can be nothing better for you than to stay with Jamnadas at present.

 DEAR BHAI AMBALALJI,
 I do not wish to interfere with your business affairs at all. However, I have had a letter from Krishnalallibtech_401_footnotelibtech_402_footnotetoday which leaves me no option but to write. I think you should satisfy the weavers for the sake of Shrimati Anasuyabehnlibtech_403_footnotelibtech_404_footnoteat any rate. There   is  no  reason  to believe that, if you satisfy these, you will have others clamouring. Even if that should happen, you can do what you think fit then. Why should not the mill-owners feel happy paying a little more to the workers? There is only one royal road to remove their discontent: entering their lives and binding them with the silken thread of love. This is not beyond India. Ultimately, the right use of money is to spend it for the country; if you spend money for the country, it is bound to yield fruit. How could a brother be the cause of suffering to  a sister?—and that, too, a sister like Anasuyabehn? I have found that she has a soul which is absolutely pure. It would be nothing strange if you took her word to be law. You are, thus, under a double obligation: to please the workers and earn a sister’s blessings. My presumption, too, is doubly serious; in a single letter I have meddled in your  business and your family affairs. Do forgive me.

 That this Conference is of opinion that the measures adopted by the Government and certain associations for the education and elevation of the depressed classes have served the purpose of drawing public attention to the existence of degrading social inequality and to their detrimental influence on the general progress of the country. But in the opinion of this Conference, the measures hitherto adopted are quite inadequate to meet these evils. This Conference, therefore, urges upon the Government and Social Reform Bodies (1) to  provide  greater facilities for the education of the depressed classes, and (2) to enforce equality of treatment in all public institutions so as to remove the prejudice and disabilities of untouchableness.

 . . .Mr. Gandhi regretted that there should be a lack of the understanding and knowledge of Hindi by Indians. All were eager, he said, to do national service, but there could be no national service without a national tongue. He regretted that his Bengali friends were committing national suicide by omitting to use their national tongue, without which one cannot reach hearts of the masses. In that sense, the wide use of Hindi would come within the purview of humanitarianism.
 
 Mr. Gandhi next passed to another phase of humanitarianism, viz., sacrifice of animals before goddesses and slaughter for food. The Hindu shastras do not really advocate animal sacrifice. This current practice is one of the many things which have passed under the name of Hinduism. The Hindu religion aptly finds expression in the two apphorisms—”Harmlessness is the best form of religion” and “There is no force higher than Truth”, and these principles are incompatible with the cruel practice of animal sacrifice.

 He then delivered the following presidential address.libtech_417_footnote
 FRIENDS.
 I thank you for the honour you have conferred upon me. I was totally unprepared for the invitation to preside over the deliberations of this assembly. I do not know that I am fitted for the task. Having fixed views about the use of Hindi at national gatherings, I am always disinclined to speak in English. And I felt that the time was not ripe for me to ask to be allowed to deliver the presidential speech in Hindi. Moreover, I have not much faith in conferences. Social service to be effective has to be rendered without noise. It is best performed when the left hand knoweth not what the right is doing. Sir Gibble’s work told because nobody knew it. He could not be spoiled by praise or held back by blame. Would that our service were of this nature !
 
 
 Holding such views, it was not without considerable hesitation and misgivings that I obeyed the summons of the Reception Committee. You will, therefore, pardon me if you find in me a candid critic rather than an enthusiast carrying the conference to its goal with confidence and assurance.
 It seems to me then that I cannot do better than draw attention to some branches of social service which we have hitherto more or less ignored.
 The greatest service we can render society is to free ourselves and it from the superstitious regard we have learnt to pay to the learning of the English language. It is the medium of instruction in our schools and colleges. It is becoming the lingua franca of the country. Our best thoughts are expressed in it.  Lord  Chelmsford hopes that it will soon take the place of the mother tongue in high families. This belief in the necessity of English training has enslaved us. It has unfitted us for true national service. Were it not for force of habit, we could not fail to see that, by reason of English being the medium of instruction, our intellect has been segregated, we have been isolated from the masses, the best mind of the nation has become gagged and the masses have not received the benefit of the new ideas we have received. We have been engaged these past sixty years in memorizing strange words and their pronunciation instead of assimilating facts. In the place of building upon the foundation, training received from our parents, we have almost unlearnt it. There is no parallel to this in history. It is a national tragedy. The first and the greatest social service we can render is to revert to our verna- culars, to restore Hindi to its natural place as the national language and begin carrying on all our provincial proceedings in our respec- tive vernaculars and national proceedings in Hindi. We ought not to rest till our schools and colleges give us instruction through  the vernaculars. It ought not to be necessary even for the sake of our English friends to have to speak in English. Every English civil and military officer has to know Hindi. Most English merchants learn it because they need it for their business. The day must soon come when our legislatures will debate national affairs in the vernaculars or Hindi, as the case may be. Hitherto the masses have been strangers to their proceedings. The vernacular papers have tried to undo the mischief a little. But the task was beyond them. The Patrika reserves its biting sarcasm, The Bengalee its learning, for ears tuned to English. In this
 ancient land of cultured thinkers, the presence in our midst  of  a Tagore or a Bose or a Ray ought not to excite wonder. Yet the painful fact is that there are so few of them. You will forgive me if I have carried too long on a subject which, in your opinion, may hardly be treated as an item of social service. I have however taken the liberty of mentioning the matter prominently as it is my conviction that all national activity suffers materially owing to this radical defect in our system of education.
 Coming to more familiar items of social service, the list is appalling. I shall select only those of which I have any knowledge.
 Work in times of sporadic distress such as famine and floods is no doubt necessary and most praiseworthy. But it produces no permanent results. There are fields of social service in which there may be no renown but which may yield lasting results.
 In 1914, cholera, fevers and plague together claimed 4,639,663 victims. If so many had died fighting on the battle-field during the War that is at present devastating Europe, we would have covered ourselves with glory and lovers of swaraj would need no further argument in support of their cause. As it is, 4,639,663 have died a lingering death unmourned and their dying has brought us nothing but discredit. A distinguished Englishman said the other day that Englishmen did all the thinking for us whilst we sat supine. He added that most Englishmen basing their opinions on their English experience presented impossible or costly remedies for the evils they investigated. There is much truth in the above statement. In other countries, reformers have successfully grappled with epidemics. Here Englishmen have tried and failed. They have thought along Western lines, ignoring the vast differences, climatic and other, between Europe and India. Our doctors and physicians have practically done nothing. I am sure that half a dozen medical men of the front rank dedicating their lives to the work of eradicating the triple curse would succeed where Englishmen have failed. I venture to suggest that the way lies not through finding out cures but through finding or rather applying preventive methods. I prefer to use the participle “applying”, for I have it on the aforementioned authority that to drive out plague (and I add cholera and malaria) is absurdly simple. There is no conflict of opinion as to the preventive methods. We simply do not apply them. We have made up our minds that the masses will not adopt them. There could be no greater calumny uttered against them. If we would
 
 but stoop to conquer, they can be easily conquered. The truth is that we expect the Government to do the work. In my opinion, in this matter, the Government cannot lead; they can follow and help if we could lead. Here, then, there is work enough for our doctors and an army of workers to help them. I note that you in Bengal are working somewhat in this direction. I may state that a small but earnest band of volunteers is at the present moment engaged in doing such work in Champaran. They are posted in different villages. There they teach the village children, they give medical aid to the sick and they give practical lessons in hygiene to the village folk by cleaning their wells and roads and showing them how to treat human excreta. Nothing can yet be predicted as to results as the experiment is in its infancy. This Conference may usefully appoint a community of doctors who would study rural conditions on the spot and draw up a  course  of  instructions for the guidance of workers and of the people at large.
 Nothing perhaps affords such  splendid  facility  to  every worker, wholetime or otherwise, for effective service as the relief of agony through which the 3rd class railway passengers are passing. I feel keenly about this grievance not because I am in it, but I have gone to it as I have felt keenly about it. This matter affects millions of our poor and middle-class countrymen. This  helpless  toleration of every inconvenience  and  insult  is  visibly  deteriorating  the nation, even as the cruel treatment to which we have subjected the so-called depressed classes has made them indifferent to the laws of personal cleanliness and the very idea of self-respect. What else but downright degradation can await those who have to make a scramble always like mad animals for seats in a miserable compar-tment, who have to swear and curse before they can speak through the window in order to get standing room, who have to wallow in dirt during their journey, who are served their food like dogs and eat it like them, who have ever to bend before those who are physically stronger than they and who, being packed like sardines in compartments, have to get such sleep as they can in a sitting posture for nights  together  ? Railway servants swear at them, cheat them. On the Howrah-Lahore service, our friends from Kabul fill to the brim the cup of the misery of the third-class travellers. They become lords of the compartments they enter. It is not possible for anyone to resist them. They swear at you on the slightest pretext, exhaust the whole of the obscene vocabulary of Hindi language. They do not hesitate to belabour you if you retort or in any way oppose them. They usurp the best seats
 and insist on stretching themselves full length even in crowded compartments. No compar-tment is deemed too crowded for them to enter. The travellers pati-ently bear all their awful impertinence out of sheer helplessness. They would, if they could, knock down the man who dared to swear at them as do these Kabulis. But  they  are physically no match for the Kabulis and every Kabuli considers himself more than a match for any number of travellers from the plains. This is not right. The effect of this terrorizing on the national character cannot but be debasing. We the educated few ought to  deliver the travelling public from this scourge or for ever renounce our claim to speak on its behalf or to guide it. I believe the Kabulis to be amenable to reason. They are a God-fearing people. If you know their language, you can successfully appeal to their good sense. But they are spoilt children of nature.  Cowards  among  us  have  used  their  undoubted  physical  strength  for  our  nefarious  purposes. And they have now come to think that they can treat poor people as they choose and consider themselves above the law of the land. Here is work enough for social service. Volunteers for this class of work can board trains and educate the people to a sense of their duty, call in guards and other officials in order to remove over-crowding, see that passengers leave and board trains without a scramble. It is clear that until the Kabulis can be patiently taught to behave themselves, they ought to have a compartment all to themselves and they ought not to be permitted to enter any other compartment. With the exception of providing additional plant, every one of the other evils attendant on railway travelling ought to be immediately redressed. It is no answer that we have suffered the wrong so long. Prescriptive rights cannot accrue to wrongs.
 No less important is the problem of the depressed classes. To lift them from the position to which Hindu society has reduced them is to remove a big blot on Hinduism. The present treatment of these classes is a sin against religion and humanity.
 But the work requires service of the highest order. We  shall make little headway by merely throwing schools at them. We must change the attitude of the masses and of orthodoxy. I have already shown that we have cut ourselves adrift from both. We do not react on them. We can do so only if we speak to them in their own language. An anglicized India cannot speak to them with effect. If we believe in Hinduism, we must approach them in the Hindu fashion. We must do
 tapasya and keep our Hinduism undefiled. Pure and enlightened orthodoxy must be matched against superstitious and ignorant orthodoxy. To restore to their proper status a fifth of our total population is a task worthy of any social service organization.
 The bustees of Calcutta and the chawls of Bombay badly demand the devoted services of hundreds of social workers. They send our infants to an early grave and promote vice, degradation and filth.
 Apart from the fundamental evil arising out of our defective system of education, I have hitherto dealt with evils calling for service among the masses. The classes perhaps demand no less attention than the masses. It is my opinion that all evils like diseases are symptoms of the same evil or disease. They appear various by being refracted through different media. The root evil is loss of true spirituality brought about through causes I cannot examine from this platform. We have lost the robust faith of our forefathers in the absolute efficacy of satya (truth) ahimsa (love) and brahmacharya (self-restraint). We certainly believe in them to an extent. They are the best policy but we may deviate from them if our untrained reason suggests deviation. We have not faith enough to feel that, though the present outlook seems bleak, if we follow the dictates of truth or love or exercise self-  restraint, the ultimate result must be sound. Men whose spiritual vision has become blurred mostly look to the present rather than conserve the future good. He will render the greatest social service who will reinstate us in our ancient spirituality. But humble men that we are, it is enough for us if we recognize the loss and, by such ways as are open to us, prepare the way for the man who will infect us with his power and enable us to feel clearly through our reason.
 Looking then at the classes, I find that our Rajahs and Maharajahs squander their resources after so-called useless sport and drink. I was told the other day that the cocaine habit was sapping the nation’s manhood and that, like the drink habit, it was on the increase and in its effect more deadly than drink. It is impossible for a social worker to blind himself to the evil. We dare not ape the West. We are a nation that has lost its prestige and its self-respect. Whilst a tenth of our population is living on the verge of starvation, we have no time for indulging ourselves. What the West may do with impunity is likely in our case to prove our ruin. The evils that are corroding the higher strata of society are difficult for an ordinary worker to tackle. They
 have acquired a certain degree of respecta-bility. But they ought not to be beyond the reach of this Conference.
 Equally important is the question of the status of women, both Hindu and Mahomedan. Are they or are they not to play their full part in the plan of regeneration alongside their husbands? They must be enfranchised. They can no longer be treated either as dolls or slaves without the social body remaining in a condition of social paralysis. And here again, I would venture to suggest to the reformer that the way to women’s freedom is not through education, but through the change of attitude on the part of men and corresponding action. Education is necessary, but it must follow the freedom. We dare not wait for literary education to restore our womanhood to its proper state. Even without literary education, our women are  as cultured as any on the face of the earth. The remedy largely lies in the hands of husbands.
 It makes my blood boil as I wander through the country and watch lifeless and fleshless oxen, with their ribs sticking through their skins, carrying loads or ploughing our fields. To improve the breed of our cattle, to rescue them from the cruelty practised on them by their cow-worshipping masters and to save them from the slaughter-house is to solve half the problem of our poverty. We have to educate the
 people to a humane use of their cattle and plead with the Government to conserve the pasture land of the country. Protection of the cow is an economic necessity. It can not be brought about by force. It can only be achieved by an appeal to the finer feelings of our English friends and our Mahomedan countrymen to save the cow from the slaughter-house. This question involves the overhauling of the management of our pinjrapoles and cow protection  societies.  A  proper solution of this very difficult problem means establishment of perfect concord between Hindus and Mahomedans and an end of Bakr-i-Id riots.
 I have glanced at the literature kindly furnished at my request by the several Leagues who are rendering admirable social service. I note that some have included in their programme many of the items mentioned by me. All the Leagues are non-sectarian and they have as their members the most distinguished men and women in the land. the possibilities for services of a far-reaching character are therefore great. But if the work is to leave its impress on the nation, we must have workers who are prepared, in Mr. Gokhale’s words, to dedicate
 their lives to the cause. Give me such workers and I promise they will rid the land of all the evils that affict it.

What work is 	Avantikabehn doing in the women’s school?  	As to news from here, what can I write to you now? Mahadev has been 	flooding you with news.  	The Hindi teacher has returned.

 [PPS.]  	I received your letter after the above was written. I am very much 	pleased with what you have said. I am equally dissatisfied with your 	handwriting. Do please improve it. I am  constantly  worried  about 	your cough. The cough has got to go. Do you breathe sufficiently 	deeply? Whenever you have cough, try salt-free diet for a couple of 	days. You should dispense with milk and ghee also and subsist on 	porridge and vegetables only. By this means your body will be rid of 	all impurities and will begin to function as before. But the main 	thing is that the root cause of cough should be removed. To this end 	do your best when you are not actually suffering from it. The best 	means is correct breathing. Do not breathe perfunctorily. Do you 	keep your mouth closed and head uncovered while asleep?  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From a photostat of the Gujarati original in Gandhiji’s hand: G.N. 2026 "

AHMEDABAD,
     TO  J. L. MAFFEY, 	C.I.E., I.C.S.  PRIVATE 	SECRETARY 	TO  HIS 	EXCELLENCY 	THE 	VICEROY 	DELHI  [DEAR 	MR MAFFEY,]  January 	1, 1918 
  	It grieves me to have to worry His Excellency in the midst of his 	many and onerous engagements. But I think that I am rendering a 	service in writing this letter. It is needless to say that I have 	been keenly following the agitation for the release of Messrs 	Muhammad Ali and Shaukat Ali. I met their mother during my stay in 	Calcutta, and I ascertained the position of the brothers from her. 	She gave me the fullest assurance that her sons were in no way 	disloyal to the British Raj, and that in the scheme of Reform they 	contemplated permanent retention of the British connection. I have 	been attending the sessions of the Muslim League held there and I 	have moved freely among the leading Muhammadans. It is my firm 	opinion that the continued internment of the two brothers and the 	refusal to discharge them is creating greater and greater 	dissatisfaction and irritation from day to day. The Muhammadans, and 	also the Hindus for that matter, bitterly resent the internment. I 	am sure that it is not a healthy feeling. There is undoubted unrest 	among the Muham-madans. Discharge of the two brothers will, I am 	sure, greatly mitigate it. It will not remove it entirely so long as 	the war lasts. I had the privilege of supporting the resolution 	passed at the League about the release of the brothers.libtech_418_footnoteThe audience were weeping whilst their mother’s 	address was being  recited.  	I am prepared to give due assurances to the Government about their 	future conduct. I feel that, in order to be able to live a healthy 	public life, either the brothers should be discharged or should be 	properly tried and convicted. I recognize the danger at the present 	moment of having a public trial and all it means. But I am certain 	that the continued imprisonment is no less dangerous. I therefore 	suggest that I should be allowed to go to Chindwara and visit the 	brothers. I    
 would get from them a public declaration of their loyalty, on the strength of which they may, in my humble opinion, be discharged without risk of public peace being in any way imperilled.
 I may add that I know the brothers well. They are intensely devoted to their religion and equally devoted to India. I make bold to say that they will not make to me a statement which they do not fully intend to carry out. I hope, therefore, that the permission I have requested will be granted me. Will you kindly place my request before His Excellency? I need hardly say that I should be pleased to run down to Delhi if my presence is required. My address up to the 10th instant will be Ahmedabad and Motihari, Champaran from the 13th.

MEETINGlibtech_420_footnote","
      
 
AHMEDABAD,
 January 1, 1918
 We meet here today on a matter which is important because it is but an aspect of swaraj. In saying this, we are guilty of no exaggeration. Swaraj means rule over oneself. A meeting which asks whether the Ahmedabad Municipality is able to manage its affairs well is surely a meeting in the cause of swaraj. The subject to be discussed at this meeting has a bearing on public health. Air, water and grains are the three chief kinds of food. Air is free to all, but, if it is polluted, it harms our health. Doctors say that bad air is more harmful than bad water. Inhalation of bad air is harmful by itself and this is the reason we [sometimes] need change of air. Next comes water. We are generally very careless about it. If we were to be sufficiently careful about air, water and food, the plague would never make its appearance among us. Some parts of Ahmedabad have been experiencing difficulties about water during the last eight years. For these three months, the whole city has been in difficulty, and we have assembled here to protest against this to the Collector of Ahmedabad, the Commissioner of the Northern Division and the Municipal Commissioner. From now on we must take up the effort to secure water. Councillors are servants of the people and we have a right to question them and, if they fail to discharge their responsibilities properly, even to ask them to resign. Under one of the sections of the [Municipal] Act, the Municipal Commissioner is appointed by the Government. We are also entitled to call the Municipal Commissioner and the Municipal Engineer to account; we have assembled here to take even further steps, if necessary. The larger the attendance at a meeting like this, discussing an issue of public importance, the weightier will be its protest. I should like to request you all not to rest till you have succeeded in this effort. If we approach every problem as seriously as we would a task of the highest importance, we are bound to succeed. We have the right to demand our money back.libtech_421_footnote
We must protest, for, otherwise, the officials will never know what
 
 we suffer; nor need we wait till the new elections, as it is quite likely that they may be delayed by a year.

 MY DEAR ESTHER,
 Having been wandering about, I have not been able to reply to your letters. I was in Calcutta, thence went to Bombay and the Ashram and returned only yesterday. I had varied experiences which I cannot describe for want of time.
 To say that perfection is not attainable on this earth is to deny God. The statement about impossibility of ridding ourselves of sin clearly refers to a stage in life. But we need not search scriptures in support of the assertion. We do see men constantly becoming better under effort and discipline. There is no occasion for limiting the capacity for improvement. Life to me would lose all its interest if I feel that I could not attain perfect love on earth. After all, what matters is that our capacity for loving ever expands. It is a slow process. How shall you love the men who thwart you even in well-doing? And yet that is the time of supreme test.
 I hope that you are now enjoying greater peace of mind. Let your love for the Ashram be a sourcelibtech_430_footnotelibtech_431_footnoteof strength in your attempt to do your duty there.libtech_432_footnotelibtech_433_footnoteThe Ashram is undoubtedly intended to teach us to do our assigned task with the utmost attention  and  with cheerfulness.

BHAISHRI CHIMANLAL (CHINAIWALA),
 I have your letter. It is our duty to help every class of workers. I have no doubt about this. I have little faith in what goes under the name of “co-operation”. I think our first task is to make a careful survey of the conditions of the working class. What does the worker earn? Where does he live? In what condition? How much does he spend ? How much does he save ? What debts does he incur? How many children has he? How does he bring them up? What was he previously? What brought about the change in his life? What is his present condition? It does not seem proper at all to start a co-operative society straightway, without finding answers to all these questions. It is necessary that we go into the midst of the working class. If we do, we can solve a number of problems in a very short time. For the moment,  I should just advise you to mix with the workers and make yourself familiar with their condition. More when we meet.

 CHI. MATHURADAS,
 1 can now understand your criticism of the translation of the section on education. I started reading itlibtech_437_footnotewith the idea of writing the introduction. The very first sentence put me off. My trepidation increased as I read further on. It seems to me that it would be unfair to put this translation before the public. Hence even though it would mean so much money wasted, we really have no alternative. Right now we need do no more than take the decision. We shall hold back this translation and not get it bound. We shall have the second and third parts published as volume one. The pages should be renumbered. I assume from what you say that we can bring out the volume before 19th  Februarylibtech_438_footnote.  The  Gujarati  of  the  translation  should  be  simple, natural, free from grammatical blemishes and should possess literary beauty. I see none of these qualities in the present translation.
 Please feel free to make such critical comments on parts two and three as you consider necessary. I shall start drafting the introduction after I have received at least some of the proofs. Arrange to have the first forme printed after I get the proofs. I shall return the forme immediately. We shall have to make the full payment to the printer. It will be nice if he can reduce the printing charges when we reprint the section on education. If you feel so inclined, you can take up the
 
 translation of the part covering the translation we have rejected. In that case please send me the translation of the first two speeches so that I can go through it.
 I can see that you have done very well in correcting the proofs. As a rule, we should work in such a way that we do not have to give errata. From whatever little I have read, I can see that you have been able to follow that rule.

 TO
 THE EDITOR THE STATESMAN [CALCUTTA]
 SIR,
 Mr. Irwin’s latest letter published in your issue of the 12th instantlibtech_442_footnotelibtech_443_footnotecompels me to court the hospitality of your columns. So long as your correspondent confined himself to matters directly affecting himself, his misrepresentations did not much matter, as the real facts were as much within the knowledge of the Government and those who are concerned with the agrarian question in Champaran, as within mine. But in the letter under notice, he has travelled outside his jurisdiction as it were, and unchivalrously attacked one of the most innocent women walking on the face of the earth (and this I say although she happens to be my wife) and has unpardonably referred to a question of the greatest moment, I mean, the cow protection question, without taking the precaution, as behoves a gentleman, of ascertaining facts at first hand.
 My address to the Gau Rakshini Sabhalibtech_444_footnotelibtech_445_footnotehe could have easily obtained upon application to me. This at least was due to me as between man and man. Your correspondent accuses me of “making a united attack on Saheb log (the landlords) who slaughter and eat cows daily”. This presupposes I was addressing a comparatively microscopic audience of the planters’ ryots. The fact is that the audience was composed chiefly of the non-ryot class. But I had in mind a much bigger audience, and not merely the few thousand hearers before me. I spoke under a full sense of my responsibility. The question of cow protection is, in my opinion, as large as the Empire to which Mr. Irwin and I belong. I know that he is a proud father of a young lad of twenty-four, who has received  by  his  gallantry the unique honour of a colonelcy at his age. Mr. Irwin can, if  he  will, obtain a greater honour for himself by  studying   the  cow
 
 Appendix “W.S. Irwin’s Letter to The Statesman”, 8-1-1918.
 question and taking his full share in its solution. He will, I promise, be then much better occupied than when he is dashing off his misrepr- esentations to be published in the Press and most unnecessarily preparing to bring 2,200 cases against his tenants for the sake of deriving the questionable pleasure of deeming me responsible for those cases.
 I said at the meeting that the Hindus had no warrant for  resenting the slaughter of cows by their Mahomedan brethren, who kill them from religious conviction, so long as they themselves were a party to the killing by inches of thousands of cattle who were horribly ill-treated by their Hindu owners, to the drinking of milk drawn from cows in the inhuman dairies of Calcutta, and so long as they calmly contemplated the slaughter of thousands of cattle in the slaughter- houses of India for providing beef for the European and Christian residents of India. I suggested that the first step towards procuring full protection for cows was to put their own house in order by securing absolute immunity from ill-treatment of their cattle by Hindus themselves, and then to appeal to the Europeans to abstain from beef- eating whilst resident in India, or at least to procure beef from outside India. I added that in no case could the cow-protection propaganda, if it was to be based upon religious conviction, tolerate a sacrifice of Mahomedans for the sake of saving cows, that the religious method of securing protection from Christians and Mahomedans alike was for Hindus to offer themselves a willing sacrifice of sufficient magnitude to draw out the merciful nature of Christians and Mahomedans. Rightly or wrongly, worship of the cow is ingrained in the Hindu nature and I see no escape from a most bigoted and sanguinary strife over this question between Christians and Mahomedans on the one hand and Hindus on the other except in the fullest recognition and practice by the Hindus of the religion of ahimsa, which it is my self- imposed and humble mission in life to preach. Let the truth be faced. It must not be supposed that Hindus feel nothing about the cow slaughter going on for the European. I know that their wrath is today being buried under the awe inspired by the English rule. But there is not a Hindu throughout the length and breadth of India who does not expect one day to free his land from cow slaughter. But contrary to the genius of Hinduism as I know it, he would not mind forcing, even at the point of the sword, either the Christian or the Mahomedan to abandon cow slaughter. I wish to play my humble part in preventing such a catastrophe and I thank Mr. Irwin for having provided me with
 
 an opportunity of inviting him and your readers to help me in my onerous mission. The mission may fail to prevent cow slaughter. But there is no reason why by patient plodding and consistent practice it should not succeed in showing the folly, the stupidity and the inhumanity of committing the crime of killing a fellow human being for the sake of saving a fellow animal.
 So much on behalf of the innocent cow. A word only for my innocent wife who will never even know the wrong  your correspondent has done her. If Mr. Irwin would enjoy the honour of being introduced to her he will soon find out that Mrs. Gandhi is a simple woman, almost unlettered, who knows nothing of the two bazaars mentioned by him, even as I knew nothing of them until very recently and some time after the establishment of the rival bazaar referred to by Mr. Irwin. He will then further assure himself that Mrs. Gandhi has had no hand in its establishment and is totally incapable of managing such a bazaar. Lastly, he will at once learn that Mrs. Gandhi’s time is occupied in cooking for and serving the teachers conducting the school established in the dehat (interior) in question, in distributing medical relief and in moving amongst the women of the dehat with a view to giving them an idea of simple hygiene. Mrs. Gandhi, I may add, has not learnt the art of making speeches or addressing letters to the Press.
 As to the rest of the letters, the less said the better. It is so full of palpable misrepresentations that it is difficult to deal with them with sufficient self-restraint. I can only say that I am trying to the best of my ability to fulfil the obligation I hold myself under, of promoting good-will between planters and ryots, and if I fail, it would not be due to want of efforts on my part, but it would be largely, if not entirely, due to the mischievous propaganda Mr. Irwin is carrying on openly and some others sub rosa in Champaran in order to nullify the effect of the report published by the Agrarian  Committee,  which  was brought into being— not as Mr. Irwin falsely suggests at my request—but by the agitation carried on, as your files would demonstrate, by Mr. Irwin and his friends of the Anglo-Indian Association. If he is wise, he will abide by his written word, voluntarily and after full discussion and deliberation, given by him at Ranchi.

MOTIHARI,
 January 16, 1918
 
  	I am dictating this letter to Mr. Desai as, owing to an acute pain 	in the left side, I am disinclined to do much writing. What I want 	from you, if I can get it, is not a hastily written letter about the 	vernaculars, but a full, enthusiastic and eloquent plea for them 	which I can use for rousing the public to a sense of its duty in 	this matter. Why should you have teaching [in] the vernacular and 	answers in English? Why should every lad have to know English? Is it 	not enough if some men are specially trained in English in each 	Province so that they may diffuse among the nation through the 	vernaculars a knowledge of new discoveries and researches? So doing, 	our boys and girls will become saturated with the new knowledge and 	we may expect a rejuvenation such as we have never witnessed during 	the past sixty years. I feel more and more that, if our boys are to 	assimilate facts of different sciences, they will only do so if they 	receive their training through the vernaculars. No half measures 	will bring about this much needed reform. Until we attain this state 	of things, I fear that we shall have to let the Englishmen think for 	us and we must continue slavishly to imitate them. No scheme of 	self-government can avert the catastrophe if it does not involve 	this much needed change. If you feel with me, I want your letter 	expressing the above views in your own language.  	I had a very nice time of it in Calcutta, but not in the Congress  	pandal.libtech_447_footnotelibtech_448_footnoteIt  was  all  outside  the  pandal.  I  was  enraptured 	to   witness   the   “Post-Office”libtech_449_footnotelibtech_450_footnoteperformed   by   the   Poet   and   his company. Even 	as I dictate this, I seem to hear the exquisitely sweet voice of the 	Poet and the equally  exquisite  acting  on  the  part  of the sick 	boy. Bengali music has for me a charm all its own. I did not have 	enough of it, but what I did have had  a  most  soothing  effect 	upon my nerves which are otherwise always on trial. You will be glad 	to learn that, at the Social Service Conference, I made full use of 	my privilege as President and as a lover of so much that is good in 	the      
 Bengali  life  to  speak  strongly  against  Bengali  provincialismlibtech_451_footnote.  The audience did not resent it. It seemed to appreciate my remarks. I am sending you a copy of my address which, of course, does not contain the personal appeal mentioned above.
 I have not given you a tenth of my experiences, but Mr. Desai reminds me that I must give you one more. I attended a Humanitarian League meeting. There, too, I was the President and I felt that I should be untrue to myself and the audience if I did not touch upon the devilish worship going on at the Kalighat. I therefore spoke about it without mincing  words.libtech_452_footnoteI  was  watching  the  audience  while  I  was speaking. I am unable to say whether I made any impression upon it. Anyway I eased my conscience by referring to the matter fairly fully.

  	I hope you have received the two letters written to you during the 	past fortnight. In the one I told you not to worry about the money 	discrepancy and in the other I gave you a brief account of the 	Congress. Here the planters are doing their utmost to upset the 	committee’s work. They are carrying on a most unscrupulous 	agitation. I believe it was at their instance that a case was 	brought against one of the workers for rash driving. He was unjustly 	found guilty and has, therefore, by way of protest elected to go to 	gaol and has become a hero. His sentence is fortnight’s 	imprisonment or Rs. 40 fine.

      CHI. 	JAMNADAS,  Posh 	Sud 5 [January 	17, 1918] 
  	I have your letter. If Meva can stay by herself with me, I can 	arrange to have her here. The Doctor may send her in the company of 	some reliable person or with you. After leaving her here, you can go 	back.  	There are four ladies working here, Narhari’s wife, Mahadev’s, 	Anandibailibtech_459_footnotelibtech_460_footnote(a widow) and Avantikabai. I propose to assign them to 	different villages. Three of them are even now in villages. Ba, too, 	is in   a village working among the women there. You 	have suffered long enough from the injury caused by the     
 nail. I hope you are absolutely free from it now.
 Ramdas has purposely joined the tailor’s. He wants to earn a little and also have some experience of unpleasant conditions. He did not leave in a pique. I was pleased that he went. He will get seasoned. He does not expect and should not expect any monetary help from me.
 The question you have asked arises because of the changes that have taken place in my life. If I had been, from the beginning, a poor man with no interest other than in the service of the country, nothing more would have been expected of me. I could then have brought up my children according to my ideals, and they, on their part, would have been free, on growing up, to follow a path different from mine. In that case, they would expect from me nothing more than my blessings. I could have claimed this right if I had always been a poor man; if so, I should be able to claim it even now. Parents may change their ideals; when they do, the children should either follow them or gently part company with them. Only if this happens can everyone enjoy swaraj.
 When an employer becomes what you have pictured, the employee has the right to leave his service. He should only take care that the master is not put into difficulty immediately. If the employer becomes an outright brute, the employee may leave his service regardless of what may happen to the master’s business. He may also give up service if others under the master behave that way. There cannot be, however, one single rule to fit all circumstances. One can decide only with reference to a given situation.
 When a Kshatriya has lost all his weapons, he fights with his bare hands and feet and dies fighting. On this point, too, one cannot lay down an absolute rule. There may be occasions when, losing his weapons, the Kshatriya will surrender and then fight again after securing new ones.
 It is not correct to say that the truth is been discovered in the West. One is right in holding that truth and non-violence are the same thing. The one includes the other. If anyone vowed to non-violence speaks or acts untruth, he will be violating his vow. If a man dedicated to truth commits violence, he will sacrifice truth. Even if a man refuses to reply, out of fear, he will be violating the vow of non-violence.
 If we think of Shri Krishna as the ground  of  all  being  and  not as a human figure, all doubts will vanish. He is an imaginary
 figure, but He has so taken possession of the Hindu heart that He exists in body more truly than we do. Of a certainty, Shri Krishna will live as long as Hinduism lives.
 There is much more I can write, but I shall not now. Even this I have set down in the midst of difficult circumstances.

  	I am dictating this letter to you and not writing it myself, for 	otherwise there may be none at all. You are right in what you say 	about things being dear. To keep oneself away from relishing food 	even while living in daily company with it is a great vow to 	observe. Only an exceptional man can do so and moksha is for 	such a man alone. We may, as yet, only make the attempt. Keep the 	vow as best as you can. I think I am myself unworthy at present to 	speak with any very great authority on this subject. Prof. 	Kripalanilibtech_461_footnotewent 	to jail the day before yesterday and we observed a fast. The joy I 	knew on that day is not mine today. I broke the fast yesterday and 	had fruits to eat; they were sweet enough, but I ate them without 	zest and so was full of joy; however, less [than on the previous 	day]. I know that, trying to find pleasure in food that is not 	particularly savoury, I ate too much today and in consequence I am 	ill at ease in my mind, not happy. Thus, despite the fact of my diet 	being limited to five articles [during    
 the course of a day] and altogether devoid of the savours which make food tasty, the palate continues to extract its pleasure and the atman suffers. If, at the age of 49 and despite this effort at discipline, I have not succeeded in bringing my palate fully under control, what may you do, in the prime of youth and living surrounded by all manner of dainties. I can guess the answer well enough. To be sure, it is my intense desire that you and other young men who have understood the importance of self-control in this matter and are endeavouring, in my company, to achieve it, may outdo me. You can. I have struggled long to attain complete mastery. More than this, I shall write when I am worthy enough to do so.
 It is quite likely that earth will have no effect on a deep wound. Keep up patiently the treatment you are following, that of inserting a cloth plug. If you cannot manage the insertion well, take the Doctor’s help. The wound should not remain unhealed for very long now.
 You may put me any questions you like. I shall reply when I find the time.

 DEAR KALYANBHAI,
 I have your letter. I can see only two ways. One, the better of the two, is this: the woman should put her education to the right use and try to improve the husband to whom fate has joined her. Women have done this before now and, if this one shows such a spirit today, all concerned will soon be happy. She must be wise in spirit to succeed in this task. If she is not so well equipped, she should make bold and plainly refuse to go and live with her husband. If there is reason to fear pressure on her in her parents’ home, she will have every right to leave it. In that case, some friend should give her shelter. If this cannot be done in a village, she may be removed from there. I should like
 you to put your friendship to some use by protecting the woman. Please try the better way first.

  	I am likely to have a battle royal over Mahomed Ali. If India 	carries out my plan, the Government of India will be properly 	humbled. Hindus and Muslims, never united, will become so, mother 	cow will be safe and we shall hear the triumph of non-violence 	proclaimed all over the world. Before all this comes to pass, 	however, I shall have to go through an ordeal myself. A power which 	has till now brooked opposition from no Indian is sure to fight as 	if for its very life when defied by a handful of Indians. Its fury 	then will be almost unbearable. But I am resolved to face it all. I 	mention this to remind you to be careful that in the storm that will 	follow we do not lose, whether in our wisdom or folly, the money 	that we have received for the Ashram. I have already told you there 	should be nothing in my name, at any place. Keep everything in your 	name. Transfer everything standing in my name to yours. The receipt 	for the money which Revashankarbhai has deposited in the bank at 	Bombay is probably in our joint names, his and mine. My name in it 	should be replaced by yours. You should make your will to provide 	against accidents, nominating the Doctor your heir and executor. 	Your plan of work has been chalked out. You must devote yourself to 	weaving and     agriculture.     You     should     so     train     	Santoklibtech_470_footnotethat   	  she may join you whole-heartedly in this work. Simultaneously with 	this and in order that you may succeed in it, you have to address 	yourself to the almost superhuman task of moulding Radhalibtech_471_footnotelibtech_472_footnoteand 	Rukhilibtech_473_footnotelibtech_474_footnoteto be ideal girls. For this, you will need to observe 	always the highest of dharma. Naturally enough, therefore, you will 	be daily advancing towards moksha, and so in this work your 	satyagraha and  your patriotic services will find their 	consummation. All the money we have is for these two activities and 	for the National School. That will also continue to be the position 	in law. The amounts that will be transferred to your name will not 	become your property, but will be treated as donations in aid of our 	activities. But do not rely on my      
 interpretation of the law. Consult Shri Krishnalal, Mavlankar and others. Drink deep the draught of love from anywhere and everywhere, like that cowherdlibtech_475_footnotelibtech_476_footnoteof Dwarka, no matter even if you have to steal the thing. The more you drink of it, the greater will be your bliss and you will have had your heart’s desire. If the handloom, which they formerly worked in the pit, had been flourishing today and if we had been spinning all the yarn we require, we would not, with all this cotton available, have to face this terrible rise in the prices of cloth. Here people shiver in the cold for want of clothes. Every moment I realize the value of cloth. Either I have to supply myself with plenty of covering so that I may sleep outside and have oxygen, or for want of such covering suffocate in a box-like room, swallowing again my own carbonic acid gas. My only prayer, and my blessing as well, is that you may have the necessary strength to realize your aspirations and fulfil my hopes. In all that you do, please consult the Ashram inmates and the teachers of the National School. I hope to be there at the latest by the 17th or the 18th of February. But it occurred to me this morning that I had better write about all this immediately to you.

The method that I have adopted for reinstating those who have
 left off weaving is to supply them with yarn, at the lowest market rates, to buy out all the cloth they may manufacture, for cash, at the highest market rates, the yarn to be paid for in instalments, without interest, convenient to the weaver. This has enabled them to earn at the rate of about Rs. 17 per month. These weavers do not give their whole time to weaving and their manufacture is confined to the coarsest cloth. They do not want to aspire higher and what they earn is enough for their wants. But I know that a clever weaver manufacturing finer counts, with perhaps a little pattern-work, can make twenty-five rupees per month. Every weaver lost to the country is, in my opinion, so much national waste, and every weaver reinstated is so much national gain. Whatever the plan you may adopt, I would like you to keep me informed of your activity from time to time.

 The question who should write a preface to a volumelibtech_482_footnotelibtech_483_footnoteof  my speeches and writings, or whether there should be any preface at all, can be answered after I know the publisher’s name and his motive. If the volume is to be brought out by a firm for making profit, it will need a preface by Sarojinilibtech_484_footnotelibtech_485_footnote. If by a pious  Vaishnava,  to  be  sure  he should approach Ranchhodbhailibtech_486_footnotelibtech_487_footnote.

 Mathuradas are to father the volume, it would need no preface at all. At present, I am known all over as if I were one of the wild animals in the Felix Circus and, so, it will not be necessary to put a stamp on me except for the reasons mentioned above. The desire that, while the sea of my thoughts is yet in tide, as many people as possible should be enabled to have a plunge in it without loss of time, is the only proper motive for bringing out a volume. I am, of course, in love with these ideas so that I would naturally desire that the largest number of people be given a chance to read them. At present, therefore, I am also one of the sponsors of the plan for publishing a volume. Where, then, is the need for a preface? My life itself is the best preface. Those who can will read it.

125,"January 24, 1918",LETTER T0 REVENUE SECRETARY,"
        MOTIHARI, 
      TO  THE 	SECRETARY 	TO  REVENUE 	DEPARTMENT  THE 	GOVERNMENT 	OF BIHAR 	AND ORISSA  January 24, 1918libtech_488_footnote 
  	The   Hon’ble   Rai   Bahadur   Purnendu   Narayan   Sinhalibtech_489_footnotehas supplied me with the papers given to him 	about the Champaran Agrarian Bill. I note therein a memorandum 	submitted by the Champaran members of the Bihar Planters’ 	Association,libtech_490_footnoteas 	also one from the managers of the Sirnie Concern. These memoranda as 	also certain other papers call for a reply for the consideration of 	the Select Committee.  	Before, however, offering my observations I wish to submit that, if 	it is at all the intention of the Government to make material 	alterations in the Bill, a representative on behalf of the raiyats should      
 be appointed to the Council and should also be on the Select Committee. And I feel that nobody is so capable of sufficiently representing these interests as Babu Brajkishore Prasad or myself, and I hope my submission will receive from the Government the attention it deserves.
 In considering the provisions of the Bill, it is, in my humble opinion, of paramount importance for all concerned to remember that the Government have proclaimed to the raiyats their decision upon the Committee’s recommendations.libtech_491_footnoteIt is respectfully suggested that the Bill is in fulfilment of the assurance issued to the raiyats in the said proclamation. The Bill, therefore, does not admit of any alteration in any material respect. As it is, owing to the acrimonious correspondence going on in the Press and all sorts of rumours set afloat by interested parties, the raiyats are becoming restive. Bis dat qui cito dat applies in the present instance with peculiar force. Any undue delay in passing the Bill may spell disaster. I, therefore, urge that the Bill should be placed on the Statute-book of the province as expeditiously as possible.
 Coming to the examination of the papers in question, I shall first take the Champaran Planters’ memorandum. Generally speaking, it is a paper containing a series of misrepresentations completely disentitling it to any weight being attached to it. The memorandum states that the Agrarian Committee was “admittedly appointed to allay an artificial agitation”. The fact is that it was appointed in answer to the agitation set up by the planters in expectation of the raiyats’ agitation being thereby stopped or suppressed. I cite in support the following extract from the Pioneer, the leading organ  of Anglo- Indian opinion in the country. In its issue of about the middle of May 1917, it said:
 It appears to us that the Government of Bihar and Orissa would do well forthwith to appoint a commission to investigate the differences which exist between the planters and the raiyats in the Indigo districts. It is difficult to see what good can come of Mr. Gandhi’s investigations. But an enquiry conducted with strict impartiality by a commission containing possibly a non-official element, would give both sides a fair opportunity of stating their case, and ought to result in a lasting peace.
 
 And by the beginning of June the Government of Bihar and Orissa decided to appoint the Champaran Agrarian Committee. On the 8th   of   June,   1917,   the   Secretarylibtech_492_footnoteof   the   European   Association addressed a letter to the Chief Secretary to the Government of Bihar and Orissa saying:
 My Council observe with great satisfaction the decision of your Government to appoint a Committee to enquire and investigate into the relations between landlords and tenants in the Province of Bihar and Orissa.
 The memorandum says that the raiyats’ agitation was, “artificial” and organized outside Champaran. The fact is that it was and has been solely confined to Champaran and an agitation in which large masses of men took part could hardly be called an “artificial agitation”. The memorandum says “the agitation was in no way the consequence of any widespread grievances”. The Government’s own finding and the voluminous papers produced before the Committee by the Government completely contradict this statement.
 It would hardly be dignified for me to notice the many uncalled for and groundless aspersions cast upon the Agrarian Committee.
 I will now take up the various amendments to the provisions of the Bill proposed by the Champaran planters in the memorandum.
 AMENDMENTS TO SECTION 3, CLAUSE (1): Nothing perhaps can surpass in recklessness the statement made in the memorandum that the Bill
 proposes to abolish without compensation and for no adequate reason a  system (tinkathia) which has been in existence for over a hundred years.
 Such a statement is made in face of the fact that the Bill is designed to give partial and, in my opinion, inadequate relief from the extortionate compensation taken by the planter for ending a system when it had ceased to become a paying proposition to them. One planter has even made a boast in the Press of the fact that he has taken Rs. 3,20,000 from his raiyats as  tawanlibtech_493_footnoteand has made addition to his rent-roll of an annual income of Rs. 52,000 by taking  sharahbeshilibtech_494_footnote. And there are several such planters.
The whole of the argument advanced in the memorandum
 
 about the khushki system simply shows that the signatories desire a modified revival of tinkathia under the name of khushki. By khushki I understand a contract voluntarily entered into by  the  raiyat  to supply a particular produce to his landlord for a fair price to be mutually agreed upon. Any clause in the contract binding the raiyat to grow a particular crop on the whole or a portion of his land or in a particular plot even selected by himself would immediately rob it of the voluntary nature, and the raiyat is deprived of the right to use his land as he chooses. Such a clause would contravene the provisions of Section 23 read with Section 178 (3) (b) of the Bengal Tenancy Act. The system of advances has in the past operated as a bait and as a snare. A khushki contract should have nothing to do with the land of the raiyat . It should only provide for the delivery by the raiyat to the planter of so much of indigo by weight at a rate mutually agreed upon. The raiyat may produce the indigo on his own  land  or  purchase it from others or get it from any other source. Once his land is brought in the contract, the inevitable result will be that the same sense of obligation with which the growing of indigo has up to now been connected and which it is the desire of the Agrarian Committee and of the Government to remove, in the interest of the future peace of the district, will gradually creep in the mind of the raiyat and will in time overpower him. It might be mentioned that the prime concern of the Legislature is not so much the prosperity or even the existence of an industry as the welfare of the raiyats. If the raiyat is to be freed entirely from the baneful effects of tinkathia,  the khushki system must
(a) leave  him  free  to   obtain  the   particular  crop  he   undertakes to
 supply where he likes and how he likes, his obligation being limited to supply the quantity agreed upon; (b) make the period of khushki contracts as short as possible; and (c) give him the market-rate of the produce supplied by him.
 The amendments (b) and (c) to Section 3(1) proposed in the memorandum, as they fail to satisfy the tests set forth above, are wholly unacceptable from the raiyats’ standpoint.
 Coming to the amendment (a) to Section 3(1) proposed in the memorandum extending the period of termination of tinkathia, whether as an incident of tenancy or whether arising from sattas or agreements, to 1920, it is a most dangerous proposition and in breach of the undertaking of the three principal concerns referred to in the Committee’s report. The Committee’s recommendation that it should stand abolished as from October 1917 is the one recommendation
 which is already being acted upon. Acceptance, now, of the proposal of the Champaran planters who have signed the memorandum, would reopen the sore and give rise to unthinkable result[s]. The proposal is designed virtually to nullify the effects of the Committee’s report and the Govern-ment proclamation based thereon. The chief reason for continuing the system is said to be that planters have already got seed and made arrangements for the future growing of indigo. It must not, however, be forgotten that khushki is at their disposal and they can make use of the seed, machinery and everything under it. It is true that real khushki will not give them that hold on the raiyats which the sattas do and will not give them the exorbitant profits, too, that they have hitherto received. But they never had a right in equity to any such onesided advantages. Consider [it] how we may, it is difficult to find a proper justification for continuing the system.
 As to amendment (d) to Section 3(1) which seeks to continue the obligation until advances are repaid, I am sorry to find that even the Board of Revenue has fallen into the trap. A moment’s thought will show that such a continuance may even lead to endless continuation of the obligation, to harassments and to [a] crop of law suits. There will be nothing to prevent a planter from never asking a raiyat for a refund of the advance and thus an ignorant raiyat may for ever remain in serfdom. I hope it will not be contended that the planter should have security for refund of the advances. They do not need it. The raiyats are their tenants and they have the fullest hold upon them for any financial obligation, and I cannot help saying that the proposed amendment is merely a device for keeping on foot the pernicious system as long as possible. The whole of the soothing effect of the proposed legislation will be practically neutralized if the amendment in question is accepted and [it] will put Champaran in a ferment.
 AMENDMENTS PROPOSED TO SECTION 4 “SHARAHBESHI”: The first
 amendment to this Section is based on a representation made by the managers of Sirnie Concern. But the amendment as it is worded proposes to reopen the question of the rate of reduction to be allowed not only in the case of Sirnie but also of Jalha and Motihari Concerns. There is absolutely no reason why the matter should be reopened. Mr. Irwin of the Motihari Concern was party to the compromise. As to the Sirnie case; I do not know that I am free to interpret the attitude of the Agrarian Committee in the matter. I can only say that, without a fresh reference to the Agrarian Committee, it is not possible to go behind
 the figures as they are a result of a solemn compromise, not merely as between the Committee and the planters, but also as between the different interests represented on the Committee itself. The compromise was one and an indivisible whole and one cannot break a part of it without breaking the whole. It is not true as stated in his representation that Mr. Bionlibtech_495_footnotelibtech_496_footnotewas not called to give evidence or given opportunity of having any statements recorded. Not only did he come under the general notice issued to all to send in their statements if they wanted to give any evidence, but he had received a special call from the Committee’s report to show that, in fixing the rate of reduction in the enhancements, the sole determining factor was not the rates at which the enhancements were made. The reasoning applied to the case is generally applicable to the case of Jalha also.
 AMENDMENT TO SECTION 4(2): There is one point on which it is possible to agree with the Champaran planters’ memorandum. That the rental fixed under the Bill should be final and binding is fair; but any amendment that may be made will have to carefully guard the right of appeal on grounds of irregularity and want of jurisdiction.
 SECTION 5 OF THE BILL: I have already sent in my amendment to the effect that the words “grown upon the land of his tenancy or any portion thereof” be omitted from the Section. I have explained in the earlier part of this letter, when dealing with tinkathia, why in a khushki contract no reference to the land of the raiyat should be made.
 There are two amendments to this Section proposed by the Champaran planters in the memorandum.
 The first is that the word “three” of Clause (1) should be substituted by the word “five”. In other words, it is urged that sattas be limited to five years and not to three years only. The fact that even three years are granted is a concession. The period of  khushki contracts should be as short as possible. The memorandum deplores the proposed termination of long-term sattas forgetting that not a single planter witness before the Committee has the hardihood to defend long-term sattas and some of them went even so far as to say that they did not enforce their sattas. Speaking of sugarcane sattas, Mr. Gordon Canninglibtech_497_footnotelibtech_498_footnotesaid that “there were sattas entered into when he started sugarcane, but they were not enforced and might be regarded as a dead letter”.
 
 
 The other suggestion in the memorandum is that the raiyats should infinitely prefer to be paid at a flat rate based on  the  area  of the land in which the specified crop is  grown  rather  than by weight or appraisement. This is contrary to my experience. The real object, it may be observed, is here too as elsewhere a revival of tinkathia.libtech_499_footnote

126,"January 	24, 1918",LETTER T0 DR. KULKARNI,"
         [MOTIHARI,] 
     DEAR 	DR. KULKARNI,  January 	24, 1918 
  	When I posted my last letter to you, I had read the literature [sent 	by] you, but for me it was not convincing enough to turn me from my 	experiment. What you say is either true or untrue. If salt is the 	panacea for all evils, no effort should be spared to double or even 	to quadruple its consumption. What I require is statistics showing 	successful treatment of plague, etc., by the saline method. Having 	read a great deal against the use of salt in books on vegetarianism, 	I wanted to make the experiment on myself. Nearly 7 years ago Mrs. 	Gandhi was suffering from copious haemorrhage. I was treating her 	with Kuhne baths and a strict dietary. When I was almost in despair, 	I thought of the reasoning applied against salt by Mrs. Wallace and 	against pulses by Dr. Haig. Salt, Dr. Wallace has argued, is an 	irritant and a stimulant. Being inorganic it passes out without 	being assimilated, but in its passage making a great deal of 	mischief. It unduly excites the salivary glands, irritates the 	stomach and  thus induces men to eat more than they need, and taxing 	the  organs  unduly, it impoverishes the blood. Both Mrs. Gandhi and 	I were, like most people, lovers of salt and ate large quantities of 	it. I argued to myself that probably the introduction of salt in the 	system was responsible for the continuation of her illness. I need 	not enter into the reasoning applied by me to the pulses. I was 	myself at this time    
 ordinarily hale and hearty. Certainly no change on the score of health was called for. But discovering that I could not wean Mrs. Gandhi from the use of  salt  and  pulses  without  doing  so  myself,  I  left them off and so did she. There was no other change made in the treatment. Within a week’s time she was free from haemorrhage and she who was, at the time of change, a skeleton quickly put on fleshlibtech_500_footnotelibtech_501_footnote. I have ever since remained without salt. The condiment has such a hold upon her that she could not resist the temptation when there was no necessity for it. So when she had completely recovered, she took to salt eating. She does have haemorrhages now and then, and leaving off salt and taking friction baths enables her to recover  quickly. During the seven years of my experiments, I have treated asthmatics and patients suffering from other lung diseases with a saltless diet, and they have almost invariably responded. As for myself, I have not suffered from serious illnesses any more than those with whom I come in daily contact. This saltless diet has, I believe, materially assisted me in my brahmacharya vow. With these experiences before me, your persistent advocacy of salt has come upon me with somewhat of a shock. There is one great change in me which I have been noticing and which I have discussed with medical friends without getting any light from them. If I receive a wound, it heals more quickly than before. I experience no feeling of excessive fatigue after long walks. But I seem to have become a green stick. The skin has become too tender and delicate. A knife would tear it, much more quickly than anybody else’s. Although I invariably walk barefoot, the soles of my feet refuse to become tough and hard, as would anybody else’s. My gums have become flabby and the few teeth I have left are more ornamental than useful. Is it possible that this delicateness is a result of a saltless diet ? Of course, there are so many other changes that I have made in my life that it is difficult to single out salt for my condemnation. If I had not noticed this deterioration in me— if it is a deterioration—I should have, owing to the many other advantages I have experienced, very actively advocated a saltless diet. If I received some enlightened assistance from you, I would like, if it be for a temporary period, to go back to salt and watch its results upon my system. I was already conferring with Dr. Dev upon the advisability of
 
 
 interrupting my experiment when your letter came. Hence my last letter to you. If you have an accurate knowledge about the matter and if you are an enthusiast with a scientific mind which would refuse to swerve even by a hair’s breadth from the path of truth even in a fit of enthusiasm, I would like to utilize your services both for plague research and for finding out the real value of salt as an article of human consumption. I shall try to secure the books you have mentioned.

KALELKARlibtech_502_footnote","
         [MOTIHARI,] 
  January 	24, 1918  	The accused is either guilty or not guilty. If the former, he should 	go to jail by way of penance; if the latter, he should do so by way 	of a lesson to the magistrate. If every accused who is innocent were 	to go to jail after declaring his innocence, it would come about 	ultimately that an innocent person would hardly ever find himself in 	jail. So much from the common-sense point of view. The Professor’s 	case has several special features. His riding a horse too fast was 	not the reason why it was instituted. That merely furnished a 	pretext. The motive behind the case was to discredit me anyhow, and 	through me the agitation. The assumption behind the step was that, 	though I could not be touched, my enemies would be pleased if others 	associated with me were. At a time like this, it was necessary that 	the Professor should go to jail and show what he was made of. The 	people here, moreover, are very much afraid of going to jail. This 	was a fine opportunity to rid them of their fear. It would not have 	been right to miss it. For the Professor as well to refuse to go 	through  the experience [of imprisonment], which had offered itself 	to him unsought, would have been to throw away a golden opportunity. 	Satyagraha means fighting injustice by voluntarily submitting 	oneself to suffering. The judgment of the court was naked injustice. 	The Professor, undertaking to suffer by submitting to imprisonment, 	offered satyagraha. It is not for a    
 satyagrahi to prefer an appeal. There is no room for [legal] defence in pure satyagraha. What we see is not pure satyagraha, but its diluted variety. Such dilution is a measure and a sign of our weakness. When we have pure satyagraha, the world will see its miraculous power. I am quite confident of this. From this point of view of satyagraha, therefore, there was no question at all of preferring an appeal. However, the desire to adhere to pure satyagraha was but a secondary consideration in deciding against an appeal. The case was so trivial, as it seemed to me, that we have been able to expose both the partisan spirit and the stupidity of the magistrate by not magnifying its importance through an appeal. Moreover, no lawyer came forward to guarantee success in the appeal, if made. I suggested to them that they could file one on their own responsibility, telling them also that, if they lost, I would certainly blame them. There could be no appeal in this case. Revision was possible. In a revision, the superior court never goes into questions of fact. It only sets matters right if there has been an error of law. There was no scope for legal technicalities in this case. You will see that, in what we have done, the requirements of both satyagraha and the justice that obtains in what the world calls its practical affairs have been met.

        MOTIHARI, 
  Posh 	Sud 14 	[January 	25, 1918]    CHI. 	CHHAGANLAL,  	I have your letter. The reason for handing over the material to 	Mathuradas is that he may then publish it as he thinks fit. English 	speeches must, of course, be translated. He can do this. He is eager 	enough and likes the work. He is tempted by the thought that, as he 	translates, he will discover himself. He is a young man of 	character,      
 and is anxious to serve the country. He has clung to me and has made the request with the most admirable motive. For all these various reasons, it seems right that he should be allowed to do this work. He has ample time for proof-reading, etc. Unless you help him, he is like a bird without wings. He can collect the material only if we give him the articles. He too does not want to be content with translating Natesan’s volume. If you are free from this translation work, there is much else you can do. There remains now only one thing to consider. If you are committed to Akhandanandji and others and they don’t release you, then, Mathuradas will certainly have to be disappointed. Even if they publish [the writings], it will be necessary to make some arrangements about proofs.
 I have gone through your list. You can expand it considerably, if you care to. There are a great many articles of mine in Indian Opinion which I thought very valuable. You can make a selection from among them. Some of the petitions I drafted in South Africa contain a good amount of history. The open letterlibtech_508_footnoteI addressed  in 1894 and the Green Pamphletlibtech_509_footnotelibtech_510_footnotewhich I wrote while here in India are a digest of numerous Blue-books. The petitionlibtech_511_footnotelibtech_512_footnoteabout indenture which I drafted in 1894  contains the substance of several Government dispatches on the subject. Thus, if you open the trunk of South Africa [papers], you will get plenty of material of every description. Anyone who feels tempted to collect it [in a volume] will have not less than six months’ work on his hands. If, however, we publish  Dharmanitilibtech_513_footnotelibtech_514_footnoteand other books, that will also make a long list. The articles I wrote in England in 1890-91 are also worth including.libtech_515_footnotelibtech_516_footnoteI don’t know where you will find them. I have a faint idea that  Manilal  or Harilal preserved them.

[MOTIHARI,]
     BHAISHRI 	MAVLANKAR,  January 	27, 1918 
  	I have your letter about the Sabha’s draft reply to the Press Note 	on Kaira. I like the first part of our reply. The second part is as 	weak [as the first is good]. I am not bothering to revise it. A 	stronger reply can be given to the Government’s contention that 	any body outside the Kaira District is not competent to do anything 	in matters relating to that district. Whether or no that district 	was represented by any member on the Sabha, it is entitled to 	address the Government concerning any part of Gujarat. It is even 	its duty to do so. It was necessary to mention the names of the 	members of the Inquiry Committee. It was not proper to have made a 	distinction between senior and junior officers; unwittingly, we seem 	to have admitted that the inquiry would have been more searching and 	fair if made by senior officers. Our contention is that Government 	officers, from the very fact of being officers, inspire less 	confidence than experienced citizens who know their responsibility, 	for the officers are appointed to safeguard the interests of their 	class and they have a habit of rejecting anything that the people 	say. Public workers, on the other hand, have no interest of their 	own to serve. They are impartial and conscious that an error by them 	will not be passed over, they are more careful in conducting an 	inquiry. We ought to have brought out all this very effectively. In 	taking up this issue, our purpose is to educate [the people] and to 	show that we are as anxious for our prestige as the Government is 	for its. The latter often seeks to uphold its prestige by the 	strength of its authority. We should do ours merely by the justice 	of our actions. A training to this end in every detail [of conduct] 	and a definite lead for the purpose will provide the people an 	excellent education in swaraj. This is why I have concerned myself 	to offer all this criticism.  	Another  thing  I  should  like  to  say  is  that,  at   a   moment 	like this, timely action wins appreciation. The Committee must 	immediately attend to the problem, setting aside all other work, if 	need be. In short, the  Committee  can  in  no  circumstances  put  	off  its duty. It should have able members, men of responsibility, 	who can attend at any time. If we are right in our cause, it 	involves the safeguarding of the interests of thousands of poor 	people. Every 
 public worker should think himself bound, as by a pledge, to leave aside all other work in public interest just as he would in his own. I think we are too late with our reply. Often, the Government, just because it is more alert, is able to suppress a popular movement. Justice does not help the ones who slumber but helps only those who are vigilant. This is not a maxim to be mouthed in courts of law but to be applied in every concern of practical life.
 It is because you are all doing such fine work and are holding out so firmly that I have honoured you with this criticism. If I had wanted to suggest that you had been negligent, I would have done so by maintaining silence. It is never my practice to waste  my  time saying anything of the kind in so many words. I have said all this in love, that you may be more vigilant in future and that a body like the Sabha, of thirty years’ standing, may gain in stature. Do not think it is  a rebuke and do not take it to heart

[PATNA,]
  January 	31, 1918  	I can very well realize the moral dilemma in which you find 	yourself. Damayanti found herself in difficulty only when she was 	face to face with several persons looking like Nala. Real firmness 	is displayed in a situation of this kind. That is no easy matter, 	however, and hence mistakes on such occasions are pardonable. I can 	see the point in our collecting a hundred thousand rupees and paying 	the revenues from the amount, but the effort will have no effect on 	the Government. I don’t see how our paying up the dues on behalf 	of the farmers can ever worry the Government. On the other hand, 	auctioning their cattle will be a jaw-breaking undertaking. The  	purpose of satyagraha is not to save our face but to instil courage 	into the people and make them independent in spirit. If, because of 	fear, or distrust of us, people lose heart and pay up, they but 	deserve to pay [compulsorily]. We, on our part, should exert 	ourselves still more to be worthy of their trust. This is the royal 	road of satyagraha. If I had a hundred thousand rupees, I would go 	from house to house telling people to let their cattle be auctioned, 	but not to borrow money to pay up the revenue dues. At the auction I 	would use the money to bid for the people’s cattle and, in due 	time, return them to the owners who would have held out through a 	difficult time. I would not tell the people that I intended to see 	their cattle safe. As things are, if everything goes all right, the 	Government will practically have to apologize.  	All this will appear as wisdom after the event and hence of little 	value. Do what you think the situation demands from time to time. I 	have the invaluable opportunity of watching your work from a 	distance and you, on your part, are discovering that no one in this 	world is indispensable.

They came to know that Government officials were collecting taxes and the people were even selling their cattle to pay the taxes. The matter had come to such a pass, and, knowing this, the Sabha thought it better to issue a notice to console the people who braved these hardships. And the notice was the result of that information, and I have every hope that, in the deputation that is going to wait on the Governor, the result of the deliberations will end in the success of the people.
 If the Commissioner had not been angry with us, and had talked politely with the deputation that waited on him, and had not misinstructed the Bombay Government, such a grave crisis would not have eventuated, and we would not have had the trouble of meeting here this evening. The Sabha’s request was to suspend the collection of dues till the negotiations were over. But Government did not take this proper course and issued an angry Press Note. It was my firm belief—and even now I firmly believe—that the representatives of the people and Government could have joined together and taken the proper steps. I regret to have to say that Government has made a mistake. Perhaps subordinate officers of Government would say to Government that the notice was issued not from a pure motive, but from some other ulterior motive. If Government are impressed with this erroneous belief, those who have stood by the people, I hope, will continue to stand by them to the end and will not retreat. Any responsible right-thinking man could have given them the same  advice. People possess the same rights as the authorities have, and public men have every right to advise the people of their rights. The people that do not fight for their rights are like slaves (“Hear, hear”), and such people do not deserve Home Rule.libtech_525_footnotelibtech_526_footnoteWhen authorities think that they can take anything from the people and can interfere, a difficult situation arises and if such a situation arises, I must plainly say that those who have given the people the right advice will stand by
 
 them till the end.
 I have not yet come to any conclusion, and I sincerely trust that those who understand the responsibility will not hesitate to undergo hardships in order to secure justice.(Applause.) And in such an eventuality I hope you will not beat an ignominious retreat. The first and the last principle of passive resistance is that we should not inflict hardships on others, but put up with them ourselves in order to get justice, and Government need not fear anything, if we make up our mind, as we are bent on getting sheer justice from it and nothing else. To get that justice we must fight with the authorities, and the people that do not so fight are but slaves. We can have only two weapons on occasions like this: revolt or passive resistance, and my request is for the second remedy always. The right of suffering hardships, and claiming justice and getting one’s demands is from one’s birth. Similarly, we have to get justice at the hands of the Government by suffering hardships. We must suffer hardships like brave men. What I have to say is: resort to the right means, and that very firmly, in order to remove the distress through which the people of Gujarat are passing. It is my conviction that if we tell the truth to the British Government it can ultimately be convinced, and if only we are firm in our resolve, rest assured that Kheda people shall suffer wrongs no more.

            DEAR 	SIR,         BOMBAY,  February 5 [1918]libtech_528_footnote 
 I 	shall thank you to place this letter before His Excellency.  	The importance of the events that are at present happening in 	Gujarat is such that I feel I am warranted in addressing this 	circumstance.  	The stories circulated regarding the hardships of the people in the  	districtlibtech_529_footnoteand 	 the  severe  pressure  being  exercised  by   the   local      
 officials for collecting revenue dues are such as to require an investigation by a person of unimpeachable character. I do not say that there is truth in the above-mentioned stories. It is enough that hundreds of honest men believe them. I therefore hope that the Government will not only grant the inquiry suggested by me but that it would be an absolutely independent committee that will conduct the inquiry. If there are to be five members, I would suggest the names of Messrs. Parekh and Patel. They have already interested themselves in the question and I have reasons for believing that their findings will not be questioned by anybody. As chairman of the committee  I venture to think that no name will be so popular as that of Dr. Harold Mann and if he is not available I think Mr. R. L. Ewbank’s name will be second best.
I hope that the spirit of my letter will not be misunderstood.
 In the event of my presence being required my address for two days will be Sabarmati. I am leaving for Sabarmati tonight.libtech_530_footnote

 You should address a letter to the mill-owners about your grievances. We do not want any bitterness to grow between the twoparties. We cannot all at once demand an increase of 50 to 60 per cent. We shall appeal to them with due firmness. If, despite that, they do not agree, we will have five persons nominated by each side and accept their decision. It will be binding on both sides. They are sure to consider our reasonable demands. They, too, are Indians, like us and there is no reason, therefore, to give up hope. You should follow the path of justice and seek a solution without bitterness. This will make your case all the stronger. Anasuyabehn lives only for you. With increased earnings as demanded by you, you should learn to be clean, should get rid of your various addictions and see that your children get education. Place your just demands before your  employers without fear. I want to help you in all this as much as I can.

 The sentence about Mrs. Gandhi’s signature in English was unhappily worded. The complete thought has not been given in it. Mrs. Gandhi is not educated in any sense of the term. She can hardly read and write Gujarati. That she cannot even sign her  name  in English was intended to convey to those who prize English education the full measure of Mrs. Gandhi’s unfitness to become a member of

 THE ASHRAM, SABARMATI,
 
    DEAR 	MR. PRATT,  February 	15, 1918 
  	We were not able on Wednesday last to resume discussion of my 	complaint about unbecoming language used in Gujarati circulars. l 	enclose copy of a public notice dated the 14th January over the 	Collector’s signature. I have underlined what I have ventured to 	term undignified and offensive. The underlined portion insults both 	the Secretarieslibtech_540_footnoteand 	those who have accepted their advice. As I told you I do not think 	that the Collector had intended to use expressions which in the 	Gujarati language could not be used about respectable men.  	You will find herewith enclosed a copy of a circular over the 	Mamlatdar’s signature. I venture to suggest that the language of 	this circular is open to grave objection.  	As to the anti-dairy activity, I enclose herewith  the  circular 	which is being printed specially for distribution. You will notice 	that it covers the whole ground. There is a slight misunderstanding 	in your letter. I have not confined my attention to the milk supply 	to the infants of the sellers only, but my attention extends to the 	public at large.  	In my opinion milk supplied to the dairies is so much milk taken 	away from the infants’ mouths. Could you give me some details as 	to the coercion alleged to have been used by some people against 	milk-sellers intending to deal with the dairies? If I knew the 	villages and perhaps the names of the offenders 1 would try to reach 	them.  	As for the forfeiture notices 1 would venture to say this. To 	confiscate land worth several thousand rupees’ assessment is, in 	my opinion, a punishment out of all proportion to the default and 	can therefore only be termed vindictive. I observe that more such 	notices have been issued. I hope they will be withdrawnlibtech_541_footnote.  Yours sincerely,  M. K. GANDHI  From 	a copy: C.W. 10629. Courtesy: Chhaganlal Gandhi     "

[SABARMATI,
  	After February 10, 1918] I do not know in what terms to 	praise you. Your love and your character fascinate me and so also 	your self-examination. I am not fit  	to measure your worth. I accept your own estimate and assume the 	position of a father to you. You seem almost to have met a long-felt 	wish of mine. In my view a father is, in fact, a father only when he 	has a son who surpasses him in virtue. A real son, likewise, is one 	who improves on what the father has done; if the father is truthful, 	firm of mind and compassionate, the son will be all this in a 	greater measure. This is what you have made yourself. I don’t see 	that you owe your achievement to any effort of mine. Hence, I accept 	the role you offer to me as a gift of love. I shall strive to be 	worthy of it; and, if ever I become another Hiranyakashipu, oppose 	me respectfully as Prahlad, who loved God, disobeyed him.  	It is true as you say that, though outside the Ashram, you have 	scrupulously observed its rules. I never doubted that  you  would 	return. Besides, I had your written messages, read out by Mama. May 	God grant you long life, and use you for the uplift of India.  	I don’t see any need for changes in your diet just yet. Do not 	give up milk for the present. On the contrary, increase the 	quantity, if necessary.  	About the railways, no satyagraha is required. What is wanted is 	intelligent workers to carry on propaganda. On the issue in Kheda 	District, satyagraha may possibly have to be offered. I am something 	of a tramp these days. In a day or two, I shall have to leave for 	Delhi.  	More when you arrive. Everyone is looking forward to seeing 
 you.libtech_543_footnote       [From Gujarati]  Mahadevbhaini 	Diary, Vol. IV    Blessings 	from  BAPU

  	Though I don’t write to you, your image has not been out of my 	mind even for an hour. Your not being with me has given me a wound 	that will never heal. You alone can heal it. If you were with me, 	seeing you I would at least have some recollections of mother. You 	have deprived me of that also. I have a standing complaint against 	you. You do not give me an opportunity to claim, with pride, that 	even my sister is helping me in my work. Even if I should write, I 	could only pour out my grief and twit you as I am doing now. That is 	one reason why I put off writing. I know prices have gone up these 	days, but where am I to find more money? I can only obtain it from a 	friend. With what face can I approach one? He also will say that my 	sister should be living with me. What am I to reply, then? The world 	does not regard me as defiled. I am so to you, however. In these 	circumstances, there is only one thing I can say. I don’t live in 	greater comfort than you do and so your hardships don’t seem 	unbearable to me. I am not in the least ashamed that you have to 	find the extra money you need by grinding corn for others. I only 	pray, if you have any compassion in you, that you come over and live 	with me and join 
 me in my work. You will then cease to feel, as you perhaps do at present, that you have no brother and will find not one but many brothers and be a mother to many children. This is true Vaishnava dharma. And till you see that it is, we cannot do otherwise than endure separation.

  	I have your letter. It would serve no purpose to hurt you by using 	strong words. There are quite a few men who speak of their 	weaknesses as though they were their virtues. You are one such. It 	might be claimed that you take part in public life because you have 	some exceptional gift, but, in your actions, you show yourself 	weaker than others. You made it out that you had been deeply grieved 	for your former wife, that her dying words had had a profound effect 	on you. Then you forgot all about the wound, and the effect of the 	dying words faded into nothingness. If a man crying in extreme pain 	had suddenly started laughing aloud he would be considered either an 	actor or a lunatic. You, who were crying yesterday, are all smiles 	today. What epithet can describe you? A man whose desires are not 	under his control, who is incapable of the least self-discipline, is 	such a man fit to be in public life? Do not answer back that you are 	better than many others one comes across in public life and thus 	sink lower than you have already done.  	The step you have taken has an important bearing on social reform 	among Hindus. It is more needful that widowers show some sense of 	decency than that widows should remarry. You have violated 
 the most fundamental principle. If a Gujarat Sevamandal comes to be formed and I amlibtech_545_footnoterequired to have close association with it, it would be very difficult for me to decide whether you could be admitted to it or not. God forbid I should judge you—it is for Him alone to judge— but I would not give up my right to decide who shall be my associates in my life’s work.
 You have let the world know what kind of a wound it was that your former wife’s death had inflicted on you. Your action has struck me like a thunderbolt. May God save you and grant you good sense.

  	I hope you have received all my letters. I have your two letters to 	acknowledge. I do not really know what to say. I have read Ritch’s 	and Debeer’s letters. From their standpoint they are right. For 	me, you would better serve the work by being a good agriculturist. 	Manilal’s advice from Johannesburg does not appeal to me. He ought 	to be in Phoenix to manage the Gujarati portion.libtech_546_footnotelibtech_547_footnoteBut, as I have said, you are the final arbiter and 	you should do what you think is best. So far as I am concerned the 	property is as much yours as mine, and so is the cause. Having said 	so much about Phoenix, I would like to speak to you about my 	activities here. The very fact that I write so little to you shows 	how busy I must be here. I think everybody wonders at my output of 	work. And nothing is of my seeking. I have taken up activities as 	they have come to me. In Bihar, besides watching the legislative 	activity, I am opening and managing schools. The teachers are as a 	rule married people. And both husband and wife work. We teach the 	village children, give the men lessons in hygiene and sanitation and 	see the village women, persuade them to break through the purdah and 	send their girls to our schools. And we give medical     
 relief free of charge. Diseases are known and so are remedies. We, therefore, do not hesitate to entrust the work to untrained men and women provided they are reliable. For instance, Mrs. Gandhi is working at one such school and she freely distributes medicine. We have, perhaps, by this time relieved 3,000 malaria patients. We clean village wells and village roads and thus enlist villagers’ active co- operation. Three such schools have been opened and they train over 250 boys and girls under 12 years. The teachers are volunteers.
 Then there is the work in Gujarat. It consists in carrying out the programme set forth in the Godhra and Broach   addresses.libtech_548_footnoteAt  the present moment I am trying to deal with imminent passive resistance. The activities in Gujarat are multifarious. Lastly, I am endeavouring to lead the movement for the release of the Ali Brothers. I am working on a programme for dealing with cow-protection, sanitation, national system of education, hand-weaving and acceptance of Hindi as the lingua franca of India. Of course, the Ashram and the national school continue.
 In all this it is my good fortune to be well assisted. This activity involves a great deal of travelling.
 The Ashram is beautifully situated on the banks of the Sabarmati river. We daily bathe in it. All the children can swim now. The  school  is  under   an   able   Principallibtech_549_footnotewho   was  a   distinguished professor of the Gujarat College. The Ashram, of course, is under Maganlal’s management. I do not know what is in store for  the Ashram or the school. They are at the present moment popular institutions.
 In all these activities I often wish for the co-operation of fellow- workers there. But I know it cannot be. But, believe me, there is not a moment I do not think of one or the other of you. Many of your exploits serve as apt illustrations for me. I am building on the experience gained there.
 Please tell Mrs. West that she should not consider for one moment that I have forgotten her or granny. Nor have I forgotten the assurances given by me. New ties and new acquaintances cannot make me forget old ones.
 
 
 This letter is not for publication. I do not wish to talk publicly of my activities.

 SATYAGRAHA ASHRAM,
 SABARMATI,
 February 15, 1918
 
DEAR MR. PRATT,
 After the most mature deliberation, I have come to the conclusion that I dare not leave Gujarat without satisfying myself personally as to the truth or otherwise of the statements made about the failure of crops in a large part of Kaira. I have, therefore, decided not to leave Gujarat for the time being, and I am proceeding by the one o’clock train today to Nadiad with a party of co-workers. I must confess that convincing proof has not been produced before you to warrant suspension on the scale asked for, but so far as I am aware both  Messrs.  Parekh  and   Company   and   Deodharlibtech_552_footnoteand   Company believe that though they have not been able to stand the fire of cross-examination, the truth is on their side. Only they have not succeeded in producing convincing proof. I think it is the experience of most of us that there are some facts we know, though we cannot prove them. That has been the position of these friends.
 On the strength of the failure of evidence hitherto produced, His Excellency has thrown on my shoulders the responsibility  of removing the impression, which people are labouring under, as to the failure of crops in Kaira. But obviously I cannot do so as at present equipped. Whilst it is true that the evidence hitherto produced as to failure of crops to such all extent as to warrant supension under the revenue rules, has not been conclusive, it is not possible  for  me, without conducting a personal investigation, to declare  that  the popular belief in such failure is wrong. This investigation is a duty I owe to the people of Kaira, to the Gujarat Sabha, of which I have the privilege of being the President, and, if I may say so, to the Government.
 I have entered somewhat into details because I am anxious, if I can do so, to assure you that I have absolutely no desire to encourage or produce a useless agitation and that I am proceeding to Kaira purely and simply in search of truth. You have agreed that if the people are right they are entitled to relief. You very properly declined
 
 to grant it unless reports of your officials could be successfully challenged. And I, on my part, would be shirking a plain duty in spite of the persistent statements made by responsible people  to  the contrary, if I did not satisfy myself as to their truth or otherwise.
 You will most materially help in allaying the ferment in Kaira, if you could possibly be generous enough to postpone collection pending the result of my self-imposed mission.libtech_553_footnote
 And if you think that I may be afforded the usual facilities may  I ask you to advise the Collector to help me with information that may be legitimately granted to a public worker. I wish also to add that if you desire that any representative of yours should be present while I am inquiring, I have no objection whatsoever. I trust you will excuse the length of the communication.
 In reply to the invitation to attend the Durbar on the 26th instant I was obliged to send a reply in the negative in view of my then impending departure for Delhi. But in the circumstances now altered, I hope to be able to attend, and pay my respects.
 Yours sincerely,

But a moment ago, Navalram told me that 	some others of your co-workers also died while nursing victims of 	the plague. If such was the manner of their death, there is no 	reason for grief, only for rejoicing. We should welcome such a death 	for any of us. The saying that there is no better death than on the 	field of battle is apposite in this case. The body is bound to 	perish when it is worn out. One may even welcome that. Let us, 	therefore, believe that the spirits of Amritlal, Motilal and their 	co-workers will inhabit new and fitter bodies and serve India when 	it is their time to do so. Give 	my condolences to Amritlal’s family.  	It will also be a kind of service if you try your best and see that 	Motilal’s widow is sent over here as early as possible.  Vandemataram 	from  M.

 SATYAGRAHA ASHRAM,
 SABARMATI,
 February 16, 1918
  	After the most mature deliberation, I have come to the conclusion 	that I dare not leave Gujarat without satisfying myself personally 	as to the truth or otherwise of the statements made about the 	failure of crops in a large part of Kaira. I have, therefore, 	decided not to leave Gujarat for the time being, and I am proceeding 	by the one o’clock train today to Nadiad with a party of 	co-workers. I must confess that convincing proof has not been 	produced before you to warrant suspension on the scale asked for, 	but so far as I am aware both Messrs. Parekh and Company and 	Deodhar2 and Company believe that thoughthey have not been able to 	stand the fire of cross-examination, the truth is on their side. 	Only they have not succeeded in producing convincing proof. I think 	it is the experience of most of us that there are some facts we 	know, though we cannot prove them. That has been the position of 	these friends.  	On the strength of the failure of evidence hitherto produced, His 	Excellency has thrown on my shoulders the responsibility  of 	removing the impression, which people are labouring under, as to the 	failure of crops in Kaira. But obviously I cannot do so as at 	present equipped. Whilst it is true that the evidence hitherto 	produced as to failure of crops to such all extent as to warrant 	supension under the revenue rules, has not been conclusive, it is 	not possible  for  me, without conducting a personal investigation, 	to declare  that  the popular belief in such failure is wrong. This 	investigation is a duty I owe to the people of Kaira, to the Gujarat 	Sabha, of which I have the privilege of being the President, and, if 	I may say so, to the Government.  	I have entered somewhat into details because I am anxious, if I can 	do so, to assure you that I have absolutely no desire to encourage 	or produce a useless agitation and that I am proceeding to Kaira 	purely and simply in search of truth. You have agreed that if the     
 people are right they are entitled to relief. You very properly declined to grant it unless reports of your officials could be successfully challenged. And I, on my part, would be shirking a plain duty in spite of the persistent statements made by responsible people  to  the contrary, if I did not satisfy myself as to their truth or otherwise.
 You will most materially help in allaying the ferment in Kaira, if you could possibly be generous enough to postpone collection  pending the result of my self-imposed mission.1
 And if you think that I may be afforded the usual facilities may  I ask you to advise the Collector to help me with information that may be legitimately granted to a public worker. I wish also to add that if you desire that any representative of yours should be present while I am inquiring, I have no objection whatsoever. I trust you will excuse the length of the communication.
 In reply to the invitation to attend the Durbar on the 26th instant I was obliged to send a reply in the negative in view of mythen impending departure for Delhi. But in the circumstances now altered, I hope to be able to attend, and pay my respects.
 Yours sincerely,
 M. K. GANDHI

  	I have delayed acknowledging your letter of the 9th instant 	conveying His Excellency’s decision regarding the submission of 	the Kaira Deputationlibtech_557_footnoteas 	before replying I was desirous of learning the result of the 	interview that Mr. Deodhar and friends had with Mr. Pratt and at 	which I was also present. I now beg to enclose herewith copy of a 	letter I have sent to Mr. Pratt, which explains what I am doing. 1 	am     
 proceeding to Kaira in order that I may, so far as in me lies, stop the agitation now going on, if I find the statement as to failure to be not warranted by facts, or direct it on what I venture to consider are healthy and uplifting lines, should the statement appear to me to be true. l cannot still help feeling that had a public inquiry been granted it would have at once put a stop to all agitation. Much the same result is likely to follow if the request made in my letter to Mr. Pratt regarding postponement of collection of the revenue is granted. I need hardly repeat the assurance I have given to H. E. that before taking any extreme step I shall seek an interview and  place  my position before him."

  	I came here for a day, but it seems I shall have to stay for about  	a month. I wanted to go to Delhi today; instead, I shall have to go 	to Nadiad for the Kaira work. If I back out now, thousands will be 	put to heavy loss. People will yield and be utterly dispirited. The 	situation being what it is, I have stayed on for the present. I am 	hoping that I shall be able to get away in ten days. I keep thinking 	of you all the time. I know you have plenty of zeal and can interest 	yourself in anything. Had you been here, you would have every moment 	observed the supreme wonder and power of truth. This is all  the 	legacy I can leave for you. As I believe, it is an inexhaustible 	legacy. For him who knows its worth, it is priceless. Such a one 	would ask to have or desire no other legacy. I think you have 	realized its worth and will cherish it with love. I dreamt last 	night that you betrayed my trust in you, stole currency notes from a 	safe and changed them. You spent the amount on vices. I came to know 	about it. I took alarm; felt very miserable. Just then I awoke and 	saw that it was all a dream. I thanked God. This dream bespeaks my 	attachment to you. You of course want it. You need not fear that it 	will ever disappear altogether during this present life.

164,"February 19, 1918",FOREWORD TO VOLUME OF GOKHALE’S SPEECHES,"
  	Mr. Pratt must have informed you that after all I decided to 	postpone my departure from Ahmedabad for Delhi and to make personal 	investigation in your District. I came in yesterday. I went to 	Wadthal today. I observe that three forfeiture notices have been 	issued there. The values of the plots which are described in the 	forfeiture notices is far in excess of the revenue dues. There are 	two buffaloes also seized in respect of these dues and advertised 	for sale tomorrow.  	I have advised the men to send in a petition to you in respect of 	these matters and I hope that the petition has been duly delivered 	to you and I venture to trust that their prayer as to the 	postponement of the sale will at least be granted. I have got what I 	consider to be striking proof about the valuation of the crops in 	Wadthal which I would like, if I may, to discuss with you, and study 	your own valuation papers, so that I may check and if and when 	necessary correct myself.  I shall thank you if you will favour me 	with an appointment.  Yours 	sincerely,   From 	a copy: C.W. 10634. Courtesy: Chhaganlal Gandhi       [Before 	February 19, 1918]  	As I was the first to come by the idea of bringing out a translation 	of the speeches of the late mahatma Gokhale on his death 	anniversary, it is in a way appropriate that I myself write the 	foreword to the first volume. It is hoped that we will keep on 	celebrating the Gokhale anniversary. Every time to sing devotional 	songs, make speeches and then disperse is very much of a waste of 	time with no gain to anyone. In order that people may attach more 	importance to action than to speech-making and that they may derive 	some tangible     
 benefit from the annual celebrations, the organizers of the anniversary resolved last year to publish, on the occasion, a useful book in the mother tongue. They decided, at the same time, what book was to be published and, naturally enough, the choice fell on the speeches of the late mahatma.
 It was everyone’s wish that the translation should be an outstanding work in Gujarati literature and that every effort should be made to preserve in the translation the beauty of the holy word of the mahatma as it stands in the original. This could not be secured with money but only through voluntary services. These we obtained, but, even so, the future alone can say whether the desired result has been achieved. The part to which this is a foreword has been translated by Shri Mahadev Haribhai Desai. This is no occasion to say anything of him by way of introduction. I shall only mention that he is a lover of Gujarati literature. He is no stranger to the subject; besides, he is one of the thousands of the late mahatma’s votaries. He has carried out his task with great enthusiasm and devotion and one may justifiably hope, therefore, that this translation will earn a place in Gujarati literature.
 During last year’s anniversary celebrations, as soon as the Home Rule League of Bombay learnt that a decision to publish the volume was about to be announced, its secretaries wired an offer of generous help and later sanctioned a big amount, no less than three thousand rupees, for this project; and so the organizing committee had little worry left for collection of funds and its desire to ensure beauty of printing and the general get-up was satisfied even in these times of rising prices. The Home Rule League deserves congratulations on this large-hearted help. The foregoing paragraphs are but a foreword to the Foreword. In the Foreword itself, one must write something about the departed soul. What could a disciple, however, write about his master? How could he write it ? It would be presumptuous for a disciple to do so. The true disciple merges himself in the guru and so can never be a critic of the guru. Bhakti or devotion has no eye for shortcomings. There can be no cause for complaint if the public do not accept the eulogies of one who refuses to analyse the merits and shortcomings of his subject. The disciple’s own actions are, in fact, his commentary on the master. I have often said that Gokhale was my political guru. That is why I consider myself incapable of writing about him. Whatever I write would seem imperfect in my eyes. I believe the relationship between the master and the disciple is purely spiritual. It is not based on arithmetical calculations. The relationship
 is formed on the instant, spontaneously, as it were and never snaps once it is formed.
 This relationship of ours was formed in the year 1896.libtech_560_footnotelibtech_561_footnoteI had no idea of its nature then; nor had he. About the same time, I had the good fortune to wait on the master’s master [Justice Mahadev Govind    Ranadelibtech_562_footnotelibtech_563_footnote],   Lokamanya    Tilak,    Sir    Pherozeshah    Mehtalibtech_564_footnotelibtech_565_footnote, Justice  Badruddin  Tyabjilibtech_566_footnotelibtech_567_footnote,  Dr  Bhandarkarlibtech_568_footnotelibtech_569_footnote,  as  also  the   leaders   of Madras and Bengal. I was but a raw youth. Everyone of them showered his love on me. These were among the occasions which I can never forget while I live. But the peace of mind which my contacts with Gokhale gave me, those with others did not. I do not remember that any special affection was shown to me by Gokhale. If I were to measure and compare the love I experienced from them all, I have an impression that no one else showed such love to me as Dr. Bhandarkar did. He told me: “I do not take any part in public affairs now. But, for your sake I will preside over the public meeting on the issue which you have at heart.” Still, it was only Gokhale who bound me to himself. Our new relationship did not take shape immediately. But in 1902libtech_570_footnotelibtech_571_footnote, when I attended the Calcutta Congress, I became fully aware of my being in the position of a disciple. Now, again, I had the privilege of meeting almost all the leaders mentioned above. I saw that Gokhale had not only not forgotten me but had actually taken me under his charge. This had its tangible results. He dragged me to his quarters. During the Subjects Committee meeting, I felt helpless. While the various resolutions were under discussion, I could not, right till the end, gather enough courage to declare that I too had a resolution in my pocket on South Africa. It was not to be expected that the night would halt for my sake. The leaders were impatient to finish the business on hand. I was trembling with the fear that they would rise to leave any moment. I could not summon up courage to remind even Gokhale of my business. Just then he cried out, “Gandhi has a
 resolution on South Africa; we must take it up.”libtech_572_footnoteMy  joy  knew  no bounds. This was my first experience of the Congress and I put great store by resolutions passed by it. There is no counting the occasions [of our meeting] that followed, and they are all sacred to me. For the present, however, I think I would do well to state what I have believed to be the guiding principle of his life and conclude this Foreword.
 In these difficult and degenerate times, the pure  spirit  of  religion is hardly in evidence anywhere. Men who go about the world calling themselves  rishi,  munis  and  sadhus  rarely  show  this  spirit  in themselves. Obviously, they have no  great treasure  of  the religious spirit to guard. In one beautiful phrase, Narasinha Mehta, best among the lovers  of God,  has  shown  in  what  that  spirit consists:
 Vain, vain all spiritual effort Without meditation on the Self.
 He said this out of his own vast experience. It tells us that  religion does not necessarily dwell even in the man of great austerities or a great yogi who knows all the procedures of Yoga. I have not the least doubt that Gokhale was wise in the truth of the Self. He never pretended to observe any religious practice but his life was full of the true spirit of religion. Every age is known to have its predominant mode of spiritual effort best suited for the attainment of moksha. Whenever the religious spirit is on the decline, it is revived through such an effort in tune with the times. In this age, our degradation reveals itself through our political condition. Not taking a comprehensive view of things, we run away with the belief that, if but our political conditions improved, we would rise from this fallen state. This is only partially true. To be sure, we cannot rise again till our political condition changes for the better ; but it is not true that we shall necessarily progress if our political condition undergoes a  change, irrespective of the manner in which it is brought about. If the means employed are impure, the change will be not in the direction of progress but very likely the opposite. Only a change brought about in our political condition by pure means can lead to real progress. Gokhale not only perceived this right at the beginning of his public life but also followed the principle in action. Everyone had realized
 
 that popular awakening could be brought about only through political activity. If such activity was spiritualized, it could show the path to moksha. He placed this great ideal before his Servants of India Society and before the whole nation. He firmly declared that, unless our political movement was informed with the spirit of religion, it would be barren. The writer who took notice of his death in The Times of India drew particular attention to this aspect of Gokhale’s mission and, doubting if his efforts to create political sannyasis would bear fruit, warned the Servants of India Society, which he left as his legacy, to be vigilant. In this age, only political sannyasis can fulfil and adorn the ideal of sannyasa, others will more likely than not disgrace the sannayasi’s saffron garb. No Indian who aspires to follow the way of true religion can afford to remain aloof from politics. In other words, one who aspires to a truly religious life cannot fail to undertake public service as his mission, and we are today so much caught up in the political machine that service of the people is  impossible  without taking part in politics. In olden days, our peasants, though ignorant of who ruled them, led their simple lives free from fear ; they can no longer afford to be so unconcerned. In the circumstances that obtain today, in following the path of religion they must take into account the political conditions. If our sadhus, rishis, munis, maulvis  and priests realized the truth of this, we would have a Servants of India Society in every village, the spirit of religion would come to prevail all over India, the political system which has become  odious  would reform itself, India would regain the spiritual empire which, we know it enjoyed in the days gone by, the bonds which hold India under subjection would be severed in an instant, and the ideal state which an ancient seer described in his immortal words would come into being: “Iron would be used not for forging swords but for forging ploughshares, and the lion and the lamb would be friends and live together in love.” Gokhale’s ideal in his life was to labour to bring about this state of affairs. That, indeed, is his message and I believe that whoever reads his writings with an open mind will recognize this message in every word of his.

       DEAR 	SISTERS AND BROTHERS OF BHAGINI SAMAJ,   [February 	20, 1918] 
  	I am thankful to you for asking me to preside over this annual 	function of the Samaj. Your president, I really feel, should be  a  	woman,  though  you  may  seek  men’s  help  or advice  in  your 	work. The Samaj is dedicated to the noble aim of women’s 	regeneration and, in the same way that another’s tapascharya 	does not help one to ascend to heaven, men cannot bring about 	the regeneration of women. I don’t mean to suggest that men do not 	desire it, or that women would not want to have it through men’s 	help;       
 I merely wish to place before you the principle that it is only through self-help that an individual or a race can rise. This is not a new principle, but we often forget to act upon it.*
 The Samaj is at present kept going by the enthusiasm of Bhai Karsandas Chitalia. I am looking forward to a time when one of you will take his place and release him from this Samaj for other work. Having dedicated his life wholly to the service of women, he will find out some work in the same field. The Samaj will come into its own when it elects its office-bearers from among its women members and gives a better account of itself than it does today. I have close associations, as you know, with both men and women, but I find that I can do nothing in the way of service to women without help from women workers. That is why I take ever occasion to protest in no uncertain terms that, so long as women in India remain ever so little suppressed or do not have the same rights [as men], India will not make real progress. Hence it will be all to India’s honour if this Samaj succeeds completely in its aims.*
 It is necessary to understand what we mean when we talk of the regeneration of women. It presupposes degeneration and, if that is so, we should further consider what led to it and how. It is our primary duty to have some very hard thinking on these points. In travelling all over India, I have come to realize that all the existing agitation is confined to an infinitesimal section of our people who are really a mere speck in the vast firmament. Crores of people of both the sexes live in absolute ignorance of this agitation. Full eighty-five per cent of the people of this country pass their innocent days in a state of total detachment from what is going on around them. These men and women, ignorant as they are, do their bit in life well and properly. Both have the same education or, rather, the absence of education, both are helping each other as they ought to do. If their lives are in any sense incomplete, the cause can be traced to the incompleteness of the lives of the remaining fifteen per cent. If my sisters of the Bhagini Samaj will make a close study of the lives of these 85 per cent of our people, it will provide them ample material for an  excellent programme of work for the Samaj.
 In the observations that I am going to make, I will confine myself   to    the    15    percent    above    mentioned    and,    even  then, it would be out of place to discuss the disabilities that  are  common both to men and women. The point for us to consider is the
 degeneration of our women relatively to our men. Legislation has been mostly the handiwork of men; and man has not always been fair and discriminate in performing that self-appointed task. What the authors of the various smritis have said about women can in no wise be defended. Child-marriage, the restrictions on widows and such other evils owe their origin to the injunctions in the smritis. Women’s being placed on a level with Sudras has done unimaginable harm to Hindu society. These statements of mine may have verbal similarity with the occasional attacks of Christians, but, apart from this similarity, there is no other common ground between us. The Christians, in their attacks, seek to strike at the roots of Hinduism. I look upon myself as an orthodox Hindu and my attack proceeds from the desire to rid Hinduism of its defects and restore it to its pristine glory.  The  Christian critic, by demonstrating the imperfection of the smritis, tries to show that they are just ordinary books. My attempt is to show that the imperfection of the smritis comes from interpolated passages, that is to say, verses inserted by persons accepted as  smritikaraslibtech_577_footnotelibtech_578_footnotein  the period of our degeneration. It is easy to demonstrate the grandeur of the smritis minus these verses. I do not have the slightest desire to put up a weak defence of Hinduism, believing out of false pride or in ignorance, and wanting others to believe, that there is no error in the smritis or in the other accepted books of the Hindu religion. I am convinced that such an effort will not raise the Hindu religion but will degrade it rather. A religion which gives the foremost place to truth can afford no admixture of untruth.*
 The largest part of our effort in promoting the regeneration of women should be directed towards removing those blemishes which are represented in our shastras as the necessary and ingrained characteristics of women. Who will attempt this and how ? In my humble opinion, in order to make the attempt we will have to produce women, pure, firm and self-controlled as Sita, Damayanti and Draupadi. If we do produce them, such modern sisters will receive the same homage from Hindu society as is being paid to their prototypes of yore. Their words will have the same authority as the shastras. We will feel ashamed of the stray reflections on them in our smritis and will soon forget them. Such revolutions have occurred in Hinduism in the past and will still take place in the future, leading to the stability of our faith. I pray to God that this Samaj might soon produce such
 
 
 women as I have described above.
 We  have  now  discussed  the  root  cause  of  the  degeneration of  our  women  and  have  considered  the  ideals  by  the   realization of which the present condition of our women can be improved. The number of women who can realize those ideals will be necessarily very few and, therefore, we will now consider what ordinary women can accomplish if they will try. Their first attempt should be directed towards awakening in the minds of as many women as possible a proper sense of their present condition. I am not among those who believe that such an effort can be made through literary education only. To work on that basis would be to postpone indefinitely the accomplishment of our aims ; I have experienced at every step that it is not at all necessary to wait so long. We can bring home to our women the sad realities of their present condition without, in the first instance, giving them any literary education.
 I am just returning from a district of Bihar. I once met there a large group of women from respectable families of the place. They all observed purdah. In my presence, they removed the purdah as they would in the presence of a brother. These women had had no education. Just before I went to meet them, an English woman had been to see me. She had called on me where I sat surrounded by a number of men. To meet the Hindu women, on the other hand, I had to go into a room specially set apart. Half seriously, I suggested that we could go to the room where the men were sitting. All enthusiasm, they said that they would be only too happy to do so, but that the custom being what it was, they would need the men’s permission. They did not like the purdah at all [they said] and wanted me to see that the custom was ended. While there is tragedy in these words, they also bear out what I have said above. These women had realized their condition without having had any literary education. They were right in asking my help, but I wanted them to have the strength themselves to win their freedom and they admitted, too, that they had such strength. I have come away full of hope that we shall soon hear that these women have flung away the purdah. Women who would ordinarily be considered uneducated are doing excellent work in Champaran. They are waking up their extremely backward sisters to the freedom which they themselves enjoy.*
 Woman is the companion of man, gifted with equal mental capacities. She has the right to participate in the very minutest detail in
 the activities of man and she has an equal right of freedom and liberty with him. She is entitled to a supreme place in her own sphere of activity as man is in his. This ought to be the natural condition of things and not as a result only of learning to read and write. By sheer force of a vicious custom, even the most ignorant and worthless men have been enjoying a superiority over women which they do not deserve and ought not to have. Many of our movements stop half-way because of the condition of our women. Much of our work does not yield appropriate results ; our lot is like that of the penny-wise and pound-foolish trader who does not employ enough capital in his business.
 If I am right, a good many from among you, members of this Samaj, should go out to educate your ignorant sisters about their real condition. In practical terms, this means that you should spare as much time as you can to visit the most backward localities in Bombay and give the women there what you have yourselves received. If you have joined men in their religious, political and social activities, acquaint them with these. If you have gained any special knowledge about the bringing up of children, impart it to them. If you have studied and realized in your own experience the benefits of clean air, clean water, clean and simple food, and exercise, tell these women about them too. In this way, you will raise yourselves and them.*
 But although much good and useful work can be done without a knowledge of reading and writing, yet it is my firm belief that you cannot always do without a knowledge thereof. It develops and sharpens one’s intellect and it stimulates our power of doing good. I have never placed an unnecessarily high value on the knowledge of reading and writing. I am only attempting to assign its proper place to it. I have pointed out from time to time [that] there is no justification for men to deprive women or to deny to them equal rights on the grounds of their illiteracy ; but education is essential for enabling women to uphold these natural rights, to improve them and to spread them; again, the true knowledge of self is unattainable by the millions who are without such education. Many a book is full of innocent pleasure and this will be denied to us without education. It is no exaggeration to say that a human being without education is not far removed from an animal. Education, therefore, is necessary for  women as it is for men. Not that the methods of education should be identical in both cases. In the first place, our State system of education is full of error and productive of harm in many respects. It should be
 eschewed by men and women alike. Even if it were free from its present blemishes, I would not regard it as proper for women from all points of view. Man and woman are of equal rank, but they are not identical. They are a peerless pair, being supplementary  to  one another; each helps the other so that without the one the existence of the other cannot be conceived, and, therefore, it follows as a necessary corollary from these facts that anything that will impair the status of either of them will involve the equal ruin of them both. In framing any scheme of women’s education, this cardinal truth must be constantly kept in mind. Man is supreme in the outward activities of a married pair and, therefore, it is in the fitness of things that he should have a greater knowledge there of. On the other hand, home life is entirely the sphere of woman and, therefore, in domestic affairs, in the upbringing and education of children, women ought to have more knowledge. Not that knowledge should be divided into watertight compartments or that some branches of knowledge should be closed to any one ; but unless courses of instruction are based on a discriminating appreciation of these basic principles, the fullest life of man and woman cannot be developed.
 I should say a word or two as to whether English education is or is not necessary for our women. I have come to the conclusion that, in the ordinary course of our lives, neither our men nor our women need necessarily have any knowledge of English. True, English is necessary for making a living and for active association in our political movements. I do not believe in women working for a living or undertaking commercial enterprise. The few women who may require or desire to have English education can very easily have their way by joining the schools for men. Introduction of English education in schools meant for women could only lead to a prolongation of our helplessness. I have often read and heard people saying that the rich treasures of English literature should be opened alike to men and women. I submit in all humility that there is some misapprehension in assuming such an attitude. No one intends to close these treasures against women while keeping them open for men. There is none on earth able to prevent you from studying the literature of the whole world if you are fond of literary tastes. But when courses of education have been framed with the needs of a particular society in view, you cannot supply the requirements of the few who have cultivated a literary taste.
Their needs can be met, after we are fully developed, by separate
 institutions as in Europe. When, through a well-planned scheme, large numbers of men and women begin to receive education and those who remain without it are looked upon as exceptions, we shall have plenty of writers in our languages to bring to us the pleasures of other literatures. If we seek the pleasure of literature always in English our languages will remain poor, which means that we shall remain a poor people. The habit of deriving enjoyment only from a  foreign literature is, I must say, if you will pardon me the simile, like the thief’s habit of deriving pleasure from stolen goods. The pleasure which Pope found in the Iliad he placed before the people in English of superb beauty. The pleasure which Fitzgerald derived from the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam made him render it in English of such power that millions of Englishmen keep his poem with them as they do the Bible. The Bhagavad Gita filled Edwin Arnold with transports of joy ; he did not ask the people to learn Sanskrit in order that they may have the same joy, but put the work into English which would stand beside Sanskrit or Pali, pouring his very soul into the language, and thus shared his joy with his people. Our being so very backward is a reason why such work should be undertaken among us on a much larger scale. This will be possible only when a scheme such as I have suggested has been formulated and is firmly adhered to. If only we can give up our infatuation with English and our lack of confidence in ourselves or in the capacity of our languages, the task is not difficult.*
 In asking our men and women to spend less time in the study of English than they are doing now, my object is not to deprive them of the pleasure which they are likely to derive from it, but I hold that the same pleasure can be obtained at less cost and trouble if we follow a more natural method. The world is full of many a gem of priceless beauty; but then those gems are not all of English setting. Other languages can well boast of productions of similar excellence; all  these should be made available to our common people and that can only be done if our own learned men will undertake to translate them for us in our own languages.
 Merely to have outlined a scheme of education as above is not to have removed the bane of child-marriage from our society or to have conferred on our women an equality of rights. Let us now consider the case of our girls who disappear, so to say, from view after marriage. They are not likely to return to our schools. Conscious of
 the unspeakable and unthinkable sin of the child-marriage of their daughters, their mothers cannot think of educating them or of otherwise making their dry life a cheerful one. The man who marries a young girl does not do so out of any altruistic motives, but through sheer lust. Who is to rescue these girls ? A proper answer to this question will also be a solution of the woman’s problem. The answer is albeit difficult, but it is the only one. There is, of course, none to champion her cause but her husband. It is useless to expect a child- wife to be able to bring round the man who has married her. The difficult work must, therefore, for the present at least, be left to man. If I could, I would take a census of child-wives and would find the friends of their husbands and through such friends, as well as through moral and polite exhortations, I will attempt to bring home to them the enormity of their crimes in linking their fortunes with child-wives and will warn them that there is no expiation for that sin unless and until they have by education made their wives fit not only to bear children but also to bring them up properly, and unless, in the meantime, they live a life of absolute celibacy.
 Thus there are many fruitful fields of activity before the members of the Bhagini Samaj for devoting their energies to. The field for work is so vast that, if resolute application is brought to bear thereon, the wider movements for reform may, for the present, well be left to themselves and great service can be done to the cause of Home Rule without so much as even a verbal reference to it. When printing presses were non-existent and scope for speech-making very limited, when one could hardly travel twenty-four miles in the course of a day instead of a thousand miles as now, we had only one agency for propagating our ideals and that was our ‘acts’; and acts had immense potency. We are now rushing to and fro with the velocity of air, delivering speeches, writing newspaper articles, and yet we fall short of our accomplishments and the cry of despair fills the air. I for one am of opinion that, as in old days, our acts will have a more powerful influence on the public than any number of speeches and writings. It is my earnest prayer to your Association that its members should give prominence to quiet and unobtrusive work in whatever it does.

            DEAR 	MR. GHOSAL,         NADIAD,  February 	22, 1918 
  	After leaving you yesterday, I went to Naika and Nawagam. I find 	that the condition of the villagers in these two villages is 	pitiable.  I think that they are able to make out a very strong case 	for total remission. They tell me that they have had three 	successive bad seasons. I endeavour to find their anna valuation. I 	think it can be easily proved to be under four annas in every case. 	They say that their crops were inevitably damaged by the overflow of 	the Khari canal being turned on to their land. Their rabi crops 	are negligible. This is truer of Nawagam than of Naika and in 	neither case is the rabi crop on their acreage more than four 	annas and owing to the disease that    
 has overtaken wheat crops any valuation that can be put upon the small area that has been placed under rabi cultivation is problematical.  I find however that about fifteen notices of forfeitures have been served upon the villagers in Naika for failure to pay the revenue dues. The people in the surrounding villages give the same version as to their crops but I am unable as yet to make any submission on their behalf. I hope to finish my investigation in those parts very soon. May I request that the notices served on some of the inhabitants of Naika may be withdrawn and that the condition in  the  Daskroi  be thoroughly inquired into.
 I forgot to ask you, if you could, to furnish me with the names of persons by whom and villages in which undue pressure has been alleged to have been exercised upon persons selling milk to dairies.

     MY 	DEAR DEODHARlibtech_588_footnote,  February 	26, 1918 
  	I have your two letters and the report. I do feel that you have 	unconsciously injured the cause and have allowed yourself to be made 	a tool in Mr. Pratt’s hands. You have based your statement about 	the undervaluation on the part of the raiyats on totally 	insufficient data. Amritlal Thakkarlibtech_589_footnotelibtech_590_footnote, who went into details, does not think that 3_ annas 	is an undervaluation. You know that the official valuation has 	undergone manipulation.  	And how can it be said that the substantial concessions have been 	made when we know that not a single concession has yet been made? He 	was simply with us when Mr. Pratt said that postponement would be 	granted when the  rabilibtech_591_footnotewas over 25%. Do you realize that rabi does 	not include cotton, tobacco, tuvar libtech_592_footnoteand diveli libtech_593_footnote?  	Where was the necessity for publishing the report at all? When I 	entered upon the scene, you might well have left the judging of the 	moment of publication to me. Lastly, 	why think that we can only gain what the officials give ? Why 	not feel that we must get what we deserve?  	I feel that you are not doing justice to yourself or the cause you 	handle by attempting too much. You are ailing. You have more irons 	in the fire than you can handle. You should have boldly said you 	could not undertake the inquiry.  	I know you will not misunderstand my letter. I love you too well to 	do you conscious injustice. The best expression I can give to my 	regard for you is to open out the door to my heart and let you see 	what there is. No friend can do more. He who does less is so much 	the less a friend. You 	ought to listen to my prayer and give Amritlal to the work        
 in Gujarat. He will render great services to the Society because he will shine most in the work in Gujarat. The council work can be done somewhat by a man who has a head about him. The pariah work can only be done by a man with a heart to guide his head. A[mritlal] is that man.

               DEAR 	MR. GHOSAL,     SATYAGRAHA ASHRAM,  SABARMATI,  February 	26, 1918 
  	My co-workers and I have so far completed our investigation of a 	number of villages covering all the talukas. I attach hereto 	a list containing the names of such villages with the annawari found 	by us and hope shortly to send another containing the remaining 	villages. I have already explained to you the method adopted for 	finding the annawari. The rabi and the kharif now 	standing furnish tangible material enabling one to arrive at 	absolutely accurate results. I do not know that it is contended by 	any of your Talatis that the harvested kharif crops were in 	any but the rarest cases more than four annas. It is submitted that 	the crops still standing in the majority of the villages will not 	yield more than a four-anna harvest and I do hope that if you are 	not satisfied with the first-hand testimonylibtech_594_footnoteof myself and my co- workers, you will, whilst there 	is yet time, secure an independent valuation by appointing a joint 	committee of inspection.  	I observe that hundreds of villagers have paid the first instalment 	as they say under pressure brought to bear upon them. Many have been 	made, so it appears, even to pay both the instalments at once.    
 Many believe that they have been obliged to sell their cattle and other personal effects for paying the assessment. I am sure that you do not desire to collect on such terms. I hope, therefore that you will be pleased to grant full suspension in the cases of the villages in my list against which the annawari is put down at four annas or under. I am aware that half suspension has been granted in some cases.
 Mohwa trees in several localities are being destroyed on a wholesale scale, partly on account of the Mohwa Act and partly also because of the prevailing scarcity. Whatever may be the cause I am sure you will agree with me that such destruction should be prevented so far as possible and you will make it possible by granting the relief suggested by me. In this connection I wish to draw your attention to the fact that the villagers fall back, especially in times of scarcity, on the fruits of their trees for food. They should therefore be allowed at least for the current year unrestricted use of Mohwa flowers.libtech_595_footnote
 An additional and strong reason for granting suspension is to be found in the ravages being made by the plague in the Kaira District. Thousands, as you are aware, are living in sheds erected at, to them, no small cost. Many families have lost their wage-earners. The villagers’ ordinary activities have been interrupted for the time being.
 I fear there will be within a very short period great scarcity of fodder. I have no doubt that this matter has not escaped your  attention. In view of the suspense under which everybody in Kaira is living. I shall be obliged if you could let me know as early as is convenient to you your decision regarding the recommendation submitted by me. I need hardly add that I am at your service should you desire my presence. I should perhaps say that I may have to leave for Delhi first of March.
 Yours sincerely,

 LEAFLET NO. 1libtech_596_footnote
 The lock-out commenced on February 22. From that date the workers of the Weaving Department have been compelled to go without work. When the mill-owners issued notices withdrawing the Plague Bonus and there was unrest because of this, the employers resolved to get the dispute settled by arbitration and it was assumed that the workers would agree. Accordingly, the mill-owners resolved, on February 14, to appoint an arbitration board to decide what  increase in lieu of the Plague Bonus was justified by the increase in the cost of living. Mahatma Gandhi, Shri Shankarlal Banker and Shri Vallabhbhai Patel representing the workers, and Sheth Ambalal Sarabhai, Sheth Jagabhai Dalpatbhai and  Sheth  Chandulal representing the employers, with the Collector as Chairman, were appointed to arbitrate. Thereafter, workers in some of the mills struck work owing to a misunder-standing. That was a mistake and the workers were ready to rectify it. The employers, however, thought that the workers were in the wrong in striking before the Award was given by the arbitrators and that, therefore, they would be justified in cancelling their resolution regarding arbitration and this they did. They simultaneously passed a resolution to the effect that workers be paid their due wages and be discharged if they were not content with a 20 per cent increase. The weavers were not satisfied and accepted discharge, and the lock-out by the employers commenced. But the arbitrators for the workers felt it their responsibility to tell the workers, under the circumstances, what increase they could properlydemand. But before doing so, they consulted amongst themselves and, after giving full consideration to the interests of both the mill-owners and
 
 the workers and to all the other circumstances, decided  that  an  increase of 35 per cent was justified and that the workers be advised accordingly. But before doing so they intimated their intention to the mill-owners and promised to consider if they had anything to say against it. The employers did not express their view on this matter. The workers, whose demand was for a 50 per cent increase, withdrew it and resolved to ask for a 35 per cent increase.
 WORKERS’ PLEDGE
The workers have resolved:
  that 	they will 	not resume work 	until a 	35 per  cent 	increase on the July wages is secured;  that 	they will not, during the 	period of 	the lock-out, cause 	any disturbance 	or resort to 	violence or indulge 	in looting, 	nor damage 	any property 	of the 	employers or 	abuse anyone, but 	will remain peaceful. 
 How the workers can succeed in their pledge will be discussed in the next leaflet.

 February 26, 1918
 I read your letter on the Gujarat Sabha. It is the duty of all of us to do something for the people of Kheda. If the Sabha failed to discharge this duty, I think it would forfeit its right to its name.
 The responsibility for the advice that is being given  to  the  people is chiefly mine. Their case is that the crops have been less than four annas. The Government admits that, when the crop is less than four annas, no revenue can be collected from the ryots that year. If the Government does not grant the ryots’ demands, they have only one course open to them and that is to refuse to pay revenue to the Government and even let it auction their properties.
 
 Assessment is in proportion to the capacity of the land. It is quite plain that, if the land does not yield anything, no tax can be collected. The Government’s regulation permitting payment by instalments is not a favour but an absolute necessity.
 I perceive, however, that the difference of opinion between you and the Sabha on this issue is likely to remain. For public workers to tolerate such differences is but a part of their job. Both points of view may be placed before the people; it will then be for them to choose.
 It seems self-evident to me that there is nothing unlawful if, to express one’s sense of injustice, one refuses to pay a tax, in a perfectly civil manner, and lets it be collected [forcibly].
 Yours,

 Today is the fifth day of the lock-out. Some of you probably think that everything will be all right after a week or two of suffering.  I repeat that, though we may hope that our struggle will end early, we must remain firm even if that hope is not realized and  must  not resume work even if we have to die. Workers have no money but they possess a wealth superior to money—they have their hands, their courage and their fear of God. If a time comes when you have to starve, have confidence that we shall eat only after feeding you. We shall not allow you to die of starvation.libtech_600_footnote
 Some workers say that we can demand more than 35 per cent. I say you can demand even a 100 per cent increase. But it would be unjust if you do so. Be content, in the present circumstances, with what you have demanded. If you ask for more, it will pain me. We cannot
 
 demand anything unreasonable from anybody. I think that the demand for 35 per cent is quite fair.libtech_601_footnote

 I have always said that it is not only against Government that satyagraha can be employed. It can be employed in any situation, against any person or body. We see examples of this just now. In Kheda, satyagraha has been going on against the Government and in Ahmedabad against the rich and also against the scriptures on the issue of the untouchables. My feeling is that we are bound to win on all these issues. Truth is on our side. In Kheda, the Government was high-handed and we had no option but to offer satyagraha against it. If we don’t succeed, the reason will be our own limitations and not anything inherent in satyagraha. We succeeded in Bihar because there  I got very sincere co-workers. Here I don’t see the same sincerity, but  I am having more than I had expected. The situation that  has  developed in Ahmedabad is also very heart-warming. I feel like repeating to you what the Collector told me yesterday, something which I have not mentioned anywhere else. I think I can say it in the Ashram. The Collector did not mean it as mere formality ; he said what he really felt. For the first time in his life, he said, he saw here a struggle between workers and mill-owners conducted with mutual regard. I, too, don’t think I have ever observed as good relations between the parties as here. As you see, Shri Ambalallibtech_603_footnotelibtech_604_footnoteis on the other side in this struggle but he dined here yesterday. When I told him that he was to do so again today, he understood my meaning. He saw why  I wanted him to dine with me and immediately agreed. What could be more beautiful than this ? If we have the firmness and purity and display the single-minded devotion which the  circumstances require, I
 
 think we shall not fail. I am not in a position to keep you informed of all that is happening ; you will be the better able to maintain self- discipline for not being so informed. In the present situation, we have only to get ready to work, if required. All that we need to do for the purpose is to cultivate firmness and self-discipline.

 LEAFLET NO. 2
 We saw in yesterday’s leaflet what the workers’ pledge was. We have now to consider what we should do to carry out that pledge. We know that the employers have crores of rupees and the workers have nothing. If workers have no money however, they have hands and feet with which they can work, and there is no part of the world which can do without workers. Hence, if only he knows it, the worker holds the key to the situation. Wealth is unavailing without him. If he realizes this, he can be sure of success. But the worker who would wield such power must possess certain qualities of character, without which he would be at the mercy of others. Let us see what these qualities are.
  The 	worker should be 	truthful. There is 	no reason for 	him to tell 	a lie. 	Even if he tells 	a lie, 	he will 	not get the desired 	wage. The truthful 	man can be firm and a worker who is firm is never defeated.  He 	should possess courage. 	Many of 	us become permanent 	slaves through fear of what might happen to us if we lost our jobs.  He 	should have a 	sense of 	justice. If 	he asks for 	wages higher than 	his deserts, 	there will be 	hardly anyone who 	will employ him. 	The increase 	we have 	demanded in 	this struggle 	is reasonable. 	We should, 	therefore, have faith that sooner or later we are bound to get justice.  He 	will not be 	angry with his employer 	nor bear him any grudge. 	After all, when 	everything is 	over, the 	worker is 	to serve under him. 	Every human being is 	liable to 	err. We 	think the 	employers are 	in the 	wrong in 	refusing the 	increase asked for. If 	we remain 	straightforward till the 	end, the employers are 	sure to revise 	their attitude. 	At present 	they are angry. Also, 	they suspect that, 	if the 	present demands of 	the workers are granted, they will repeatedly harass them. To remove this 
 suspicion, we should do our utmost to reassure the employers by our behaviour. The first thing to that end is to harbour no grudge against them.
  Every 	worker should 	remember that the 	struggle is 	bound to 	involve suffering. But 	happiness follows 	suffering voluntarily 	undertaken. It 	is but suffering 	for the worker 	to be denied 	a wage sufficient to 	enable him 	to make 	both ends meet. 	Because of 	our ignorance, 	however, we endure 	this and 	manage to live somehow. 	Seeking a 	remedy against 	this suffering, 	we have 	told the employers 	that it 	is not possible 	for us 	to maintain ourselves 	without the 	wage increase 	demanded and that, 	if it is not 	granted to 	us and we 	are not 	saved from continuous 	starvation, we would 	rather starve right now. 	How long 	will the employers 	remain unmoved by our 	suffering ?  Lastly, 	the poor 	have their saviour in 	God. Our 	duty is 	to make the 	effort and then, 	remain fully assured that we 	are bound 	to get 	what He 	has ordained 	for us, remain 	peaceful while 	our request 	is not 	yet granted. 
 A worker who behaves in this manner will never find it difficult to keep his pledge. We shall discuss in tomorrow’s leaflet how the workers may maintain themselves during the period of the lock-out.

  	I am ashamed of myself. I am most anxious to be there. Yet the facts 	seem to have conspired against me. The strike is still on and it is 	of such a delicate nature that I dare not leave it. The Kaira 	affair, too, involving as it does the rights of several lacs of 	people, demands my attention. I know that delay about Ali brothers 	is dangerous. I  therefore stay where I am till I feel free. I know 	you will not have me do otherwise. Will you please apologize to 	Maulana Saheb ? Do please keep me informed of what goes on there.

  	I keep worrying about you these days. I detect a note of despondency 	in your letters. It seems you feel the want of education. You feel, 	too, that you have not settled down to anything. If only you were 	with me, I would take you on my lap and comfort you. In the measure 	in which I fail to make you happy, I think I must be wanting in 	something. There must be something lacking in my love. Please think 	of any wrongs I may have done as unintended and forgive me. Children 	are entitled to much from their parents, being all submission to 	them. A mistake on the part of the parents will ruin their lives. 	Our scriptures place parents on a level with God. It is not always 	that parents in this world are fit to carry such responsibility. 	Being but earthly, they pass on the legacy to their children and so 	from generation to generation mere embodiments of selfishness come 	into this world. Why should you think that you are an unworthy son? 	If you are so, don’t you see that that would prove that I was 	unworthy ?  I don’t want to be reckoned as unworthy ; how could 	you be so then? You may work for money, but you will not sacrifice 	truth for its sake and, though you have been thinking of marriage, 	you will exercise your judgement ; and hence I, for my part, will 	always think of you as 
 a worthy son.
 You need not ask my forgiveness. You have given me no reason to be unhappy. I want you to come over to me after your experiments there are over. I shall do my part to see you married. If you want to study, I shall help you. If you but train your body to be as strong as steel, we shall see to the rest. At the moment, we are scattered wide apart. You there, Manilal in Phoenix, Deva in Badharwa, Ba in Bhitiharwa, Harilal in Calcutta, and myself ever on the move from place to place. May be, in this separation lies service to the nation and the way to spiritual uplift. Whether that is so or not, let us bear with a cheerful mind what has fallen to our lot.

 There are but few to give you good advice and courage. Many will try to discourage you, and these may include even your friends. Many will advise you to accept as much as you can get and  be thankful to God for it. This sounds sweet but really it is very bitter advice. We must not admit helplessness except before God. Do not feel helpless even if you have no money, since, in any case, we have hands and feet, all of us. We shall be masters of our own affairs only if we use our hands and feet. We have to be firm, moreover, in order that we may have good standing with the mill-owners. In the circumstances in which we are placed, we should tell them that we are not prepared to submit to such pressure from them. You may seek my advice or that of somebody else ; in this matter, however, you can succeed without help from anyone. I and a hundred thousand more cannot bring you success. Your success depends on yourselves, upon your sincerity, upon your faith in God and upon your courage. We are merely your helpers. You have to stand on your own strength. Stand by your unwritten and unspoken pledge and success is yours.libtech_608_footnote
 
 
 If you had accepted defeat from the beginning, I would not have come to you, nor would have Anasuyabehn ; but you decided to put up a fight. The news has spread all over India. In due course, the world will know that Ahmedabad workers have taken a pledge, with God as their witness, that they will not resume work until they have achieved their object. In future, your children will look at this tree and say that their fathers took a solemn pledge under it, with God as their witness. If you do not fulfil that pledge, what will your children think of you ? The future of your posterity depends on you. I urge you all, do not allow yourselves to be dissuaded by anyone and give up the pledge ; stand by it firmly. You may have to starve to death. Even so, you should declare that you have taken the pledge with God as your witness ; you have taken it not because Gandhi wanted you to do so, but in the name of God. Stand by your pledge faithfully and continue the struggle. India will then see that you were prepared to be ruined but did not give up your pledge. Remember each word in  these leaflets and keep the pledge conscientiously. There is no point in knowing them by heart mechanically. Many can repeat parrot-like the Holy Koran or the Gita; some can recite both the Gita and the Tulsi Ramayana. It is not enough, though, that one knows them by heart. If, having learnt them by heart, you put the teaching into practice, rest assured that none can whittle down your 35 per cent even by a quarter per cent.libtech_609_footnote

 LEAFLET NO. 3
 We have stated what the workers’ pledge is and considered how best they may fulfil it. Today we shall discuss how the workers may keep themselves occupied during the lock-out. There is a proverb among us that an idle man busies himself with mischief. And so it is not at all good that ten thousand men should remain idle here in Ahmedabad. A man who has been working all day feels quite lost if he suddenly finds himself without work. The subject of this leaflet, therefore, is very important to us if we are to succeed in our aim. Let us start by saying what the workers ought not to do:
 They 	should not waste 	time in gambling. They 	should not 	spend it 	sleeping during the day.  They 	should not 	keep talking, all 	the time, of the 	employers and 	the lock-out.  Many 	are in 	the habit 	of frequenting 	tea-stalls and idling 	away their 	time in 	gossip or 	eating and 	drinking when 	they don’t need 	to. Workers 	should keep away from such tea-stalls.  They 	should not go 	to the mills 	while the lock-out 	continues. Now 	about what the 	workers should do: 
  Many 	workers’ dwellings and 	their surroundings 	are generally 	dirty. They are 	unable to 	attend to 	this when they are 	at work. 	Now that 	they will have an 	enforced holiday, they 	should utilize some of 	the time 	in cleaning 	and repairing 	their houses and compounds.  Those 	who are literate should 	spend their time in 	reading books 	and increasing 	their knowledge. They can 	also teach the 	illiterate. This 	way, they will learn to 	help each other. Those 	who are fond 	of reading 	should go to the Dadabhai Library and Reading-Room or other free 
 reading-rooms.
  Those 	who know skilled 	work, such as 	tailoring, 	cabinet-making or 	wood-carving and 	engraving, can 	seek work for 	themselves. If 	they fail 	to find 	any, they may approach 	us for help.  Every 	person ought to have 	some knowledge 	of a 	subsidiary occupation 	besides the one 	from which 	he earns his 	livelihood. Workers, 	therefore, can 	spend their time 	in learning 	some new and 	easy work. They will 	have our help 	in this. 
 In India, a person in one occupation thinks it below his dignity to follow any other. Besides, some occupations are considered low and degrading in themselves. Both these ideas are wrong. There is no question of inferiority or superiority among occupations which are essential for man’s existence. Nor should we be ashamed of taking up an occupation other than the one we are used to. We believe that weaving cloth, breaking stones, sawing or splitting wood or working on a farm are all necessary and honourable occupations. We hope, therefore, that instead of wasting their time in doing nothing, workers will utilize it in some such useful work.
 Having considered what workers should do, it is necessary to say what they may expect of me. We shall say this in the next leaflet.

          SABARMATI, 
     DEAR 	MR. PRATT,  February 	28, 1918 
   letter. Your 	frank talk of yesterdaylibtech_611_footnotelibtech_612_footnoteencourages me to send you this   The following is the 	position throughout India. A new order of 
  	things is replacing the old. It can be established peacefully or it 	must be preceded by some painful disturbances. What it will be lies 	largely in the hands of civil servants like yourself, more than in 	those of the King’s representatives quite at the top. You desire 	to do good, but you rule not by right of love, but by the force of 	fear. The sum total of the    
 energy of the civil service represents to the people the British Constitution. You have failed, probably not through any fault of your own, to interpret it to the people as fully as you might have. The result is the people dread your power to punish and they miss the good you desire to do. The home-rulers so named have become impatient of your authority. They are a rapidly increasing power. They find no difficulty in showing to the people the dreadful side of  the  civil  service rule. The people welcome them as their deliverers. With  nothing but love of the land and distrust of the officials to guide them, they spread ill will. The order you represent knows this only too well and it naturally resents this insult. And so the gulf widens. I presumptuously believe that I can step into the breach and  may succeed in stopping harmful disturbances during our passage to the new state of things. I want, at the end of it, to see established not mutual distrust and the law of force, but mutual trust and the law of love. I can only do so if I can show the people a better and more expeditious way of righting wrongs. It is obviously bad if they submit to your order through fear and harbour ill will. It is worse if, misguided, they resort to violence. The only dignified and truly loyal and uplifting course for them is to show disapproval by disobeying your orders which they may consider to be unjust, and by knowingly and respectfully suffering the penalty of their breach. I venture to think that advice to do so can be safely tendered in almost every conceivable case of a felt wrong, provided that all other recognized remedies have been previously tried. I wish you could see the viewpoint submitted by me. You will, I know, forgive me for my presumption in writing this letter. Of course, I have written this irrespective of the Kaira trouble. It is highly likely that I shall have the privilege of working with you on a more non-contentious platform. But I feel that it is better that you should know me with all my limitations.
 Yours,

 LEAFLET NO. 4
 We have said how workers can fulfil their pledge and what they should do during the lock-out. In this leaflet we shall explain how we propose to help them. It is our duty to do this.
 LET US STATE, FIRST, WHAT WE CANNOT DO:
 We shall not help the workers in doing anything which is wrong.  We 	shall have 	to abandon 	the workers 	and cease 	helping them if 	they do 	anything wrong 	or make inflated 	demands or 	 commit violence.  We 	can never 	wish ill to 	the employers 	; in all 	that we 	do, we 	are bound 	to consider 	their interests. 	We shall 	promote the 	workers’ interest 	while duly safeguarding the employers. 
 NOW ABOUT WHAT WE SHALL DO FOR THE WORKERS:
  We 	are with the 	workers so 	long as 	they conduct themselves 	well, as 	they have done so far.  We 	shall do 	all we 	can to 	obtain for 	them 35 per 	cent increase in 	wages.  We 	are, as 	yet, only entreating the 	employers. We 	have not 	tried so 	far to 	win public 	sympathy or educate 	public opinion. But we 	shall be 	prepared, if 	the situation 	demands it, to 	acquaint the 	whole of 	India with the workers’ 	plight and hope that we 	shall succeed 	in obtaining 	public sympathy for 	our cause. 
 
  We shall not rest till the workers get what they are entitled to.  We 	are making 	an effort 	to inform 	ourselves of the 	condition of 	the workers 	in its 	economic, moral 	and educational aspects. 	We shall 	show the 	workers how 	they may 	improve their 	economic condition ; 	we shall 	strive to raise 	their moral level; we 	shall think out 	and teach them ways and 	means of 	living in 	cleanliness and 	we shall 	work for the intellectual improvement of such of them as live in ignorance.  We 	shall not ourselves 	eat or 	dress without 	providing food and 	clothing to 	such of 	the workers 	as are 	reduced to 	destitution in 	the course of the struggle.libtech_614_footnote  We 	shall nurse 	the sick among 	them and 	get for 	them the 	 services of vaids 	and doctors. 
 We have undertaken this task with a full sense of our responsi- bility. We consider the workers’ demand to be entirely reasonable and it is because we believe that satisfaction of their demand will even- tually serve rather than harm the employers’ interests that we have taken up this cause.libtech_615_footnote

SABARMATI,
     DEAR 	FRIEND,  March 	1, 1918 
  	Early this morning as I got up, I fell thinking what we were after. 	What would be the issue of what I had been doing ? And of what you 	had been doing ? I suppose, if I succeeded, you would accept the 	workers’ demands; alternatively, if you hold firm till the last, 	the mill- hands will take to other occupations. If they go back on 	their resolve and accept the wages proposed by you, my efforts will 	have ended in nothing. These results, however, have no serious 	consequences for the people.  	What about your efforts, though? If you succeed, the poor, already 	suppressed, will be suppressed still more, will be more abject than 	ever and the impression will have been confirmed that money can 	subdue everyone. If, despite your efforts, the workers succeed in 	securing the increase, you, and others with you, will regard the 	result as your failure. Can I possibly wish you success in so far as 	the first result is concerned ? Is it your desire that the arrogance 	of money should increase ? Or that the workers be reduced to utter 	submission ? Would you be so unkindly disposed to them as to see no 	success for you in their getting what they are entitled to, may be 	even a few pice more ? Do you not see that in your failure lies your 	success, that your success is fraught with danger for you ? How if 	Ravana had succeeded  	? Do you not see that your success will have serious consequences 	for the whole society ? Your efforts are of the nature of  	duragrahalibtech_620_footnote. 	My success everyone will accept as success. My failure, too, will 	not harm anyone ; it will only prove that the workers were not 	prepared to go farther than they did. An effort like mine is 	satyagraha. Kindly look deep into your heart, listen to the still 	small voice within and obey it, I pray you. Will you dine with me?

 We have so far considered the situation from our point of view. It is rather difficult to do so from that of the employers Workers’ efforts may have one of these two results:
 They may get a 35 per cent increase in wages, or They 	may have 	to resume 	work without getting such increase. 
 If the workers get an increase, they will be benefited and the employers will have earned credit. If they have to resume work without any increase, they will be demoralized and obliged to bow before the employers as so many slaves. It is, therefore, in the interests of both sides that the workers get an increase. At any rate, a defeat will cost the workers very much indeed.
Employers’ efforts too may have one of these two results:
 They 	may concede 	the workers 	an increase. They 	may not do so. 
 If the employers concede it, the workers will be contented and justice will have been done to them. The employers are afraid that, if the workers’ demands are conceded, they will become overbearing. This fear is baseless. Even if workers are suppressed today, it is not impossible that, when opportunity arises, they will take to such ways. It
 
 is even possible that the workers, on being suppressed, will become vindictive. The history of the world shows that, wherever the workers have been suppressed, they have risen in revolt later when they got an opportunity. The employers feel that conceding the workers’ demand will strengthen their advisers’ influence on them. If the advisers are right in their stand, if they are devoted to the cause, the workers will never leave them whether they are defeated or victorious, and be it noted that the advisers also will not abandon the workers. Those who have dedicated themselves to service of others will not forsake it even if they have to incur the displeasure of those whom they oppose. The more cause for disappointment they have, the more devoted will they become in their service. Strive as they may, the employers will never succeed in dividing the advisers from the workers. What, then, will they get by defeating the workers ? The only reply can be: nothing but the workers’ discontent. The employers will always distrust the suppressed workers.
 By granting the increase as demanded, the employers will have contented workers. If the latter fail in their duty, the employers can always rely on the help of the advisers ; this way, they can end the loss now being caused to both sides. The workers, on their part, will ever remain grateful if their demand is met and there will be increased goodwill between them and the employers. Thus, the employers’ success lies in that of the workers ; and the latter’s defeat, likewise, will be their defeat. As against this way of pure justice, the employers have adopted the Western, or the modern, Satanic notion of justice.

 LEAFLET NO. 6
 Pure justice is that which is inspired by fellow-feeling and compassion. We in India call it the Eastern or the ancient way of justice. That way of justice which has no place in it for fellow feeling
 
 or compassion is known as Satanic, Western or modern justice. Out of compassion or regard, son and father concede many things to each other to the eventual benefit of both. One takes pride in giving up a claim and thinks of one’s action as proceeding from strength, not weakness. There was a time in India when servants, passing from  father to son, used to serve in the same family for generations. They were regarded and treated as members of the family. They suffered with the employers in their misfortunes and the latter shared the servants’ joys and sorrows. In those days, India was reputed for a social order free from friction, and this order endured for thousands of years on that basis. Even now this sense of fellow-feeling is not altogether absent in our country. Where such an arrangement exists, there is hardly any need for a third party or an arbitrator. Disputes between a master and a servant are settled between themselves amicably. There was no room in this arrangement for increase or reduction in wages according as the changing needs of the two might dictate. Servants did not ask for higher wages when there was a dearth of servants and masters did not reduce wages when servants were available in plenty. This arrangement was based primarily on considerations of mutual regard, propriety, decorum and affection. This sense of mutual obligation was not then, as it is now, considered unpractical but ruled us in most of our affairs. History records that many great things have been achieved by our people because they had made this pure justice the law of their life. This is the Eastern or ancient justice.libtech_624_footnote
 A totally different way of life prevails in the West today. It is not to be supposed that all persons in the West approve of the modern idea of justice. There are many saintly persons in the West who lead a blameless life, adopting the ancient standard. But in most public activities of the West at present, there is no place for fellow-feeling or compassion. It is considered just that a master pays his servant what he thinks fit. It is not considered necessary to think of the servants’ needs. So also the worker can make his own demand, irrespective of the employer’s financial condition and this is considered just. It is
 
 H.S.L. Polak”, 14-10-1909.
 just, they think, that everyone should look after his own interests and expect others to take these into account. The present war in Europe is fought on the same principle. No means is considered improper for defeating the enemy. Wars must have been fought even in the past, but the vast masses of the people were not involved in them. We would do well not to introduce into India this despicable idea of justice. When workers make a demand merely because they think themselves strong enough to do so, regardless of the employers’ condition, they will have succumbed to the modern, Satanic idea of justice.  The  employers, in refusing to consider the workers’ demands, have accepted this Satanic principle of justice, may be unintentionally or in ignorance. The employers ganging up against the workers is like raising an army of elephants against ants. If they had any regard for dharma, the employers would hesitate to oppose the workers. You will never find in ancient India that a situation in  which  the  workers starved was regarded as the employers’ opportunity. That action alone is just which does not harm either party to a dispute. We had confidently hoped that the Jain and Vaishnava employers in the capital city of this worthy land of Gujarat would never consider it a victory to bear down the workers or deliberately to give them less than their due. We are sure this wind from the West will pass as quickly as it has come. At any rate, we do not want to teach the workers what they do in the West these days. We wish to follow, and to make the workers follow, our ancient idea of justice as we have known it and to help them in that manner to secure their rights.
 We shall consider, in the next leaflet, some of the evil consequences of the policy followed in the West in modern times.libtech_625_footnote

 LEAFLET. NO. 7
 South Africa is a large British Colony. The Europeans have been settled there for over four hundred years. They enjoy autonomy. Many European workers are employed in the railways of that country. These workers felt that they did not receive just wages. Instead of merely trying to get their wages increased, they thought of capturing the Government. That was unjust; it was Satanic justice. It increased the bitterness between the Government and the labour, and the whole of South Africa was in the grip of fear. Nobody felt secure. Ultimately, there was even open fighting between the parties and some innocent persons were killed. The military took over control everywhere. Both parties suffered heavily. Each desired to defeat the other. Neither cared for justice as such. Each side magnified  the other’s misdeeds. Neither had regard for the feelings of the other.
 While this was going on, our workers behaved justly. When the railway strike was launched, a strike involving 20,000 Indian workers had already begun. We were fighting the Government of that country for justice, pure and simple. The weapon our workers employed was satyagraha. They did not wish to spite the Government, nor did they
 
 wish it ill. They had no desire to dislodge it. The European workers wanted to exploit the strike of the Indians. Our workers refused to be exploited. They said, “Ours is a satyagraha struggle. We do not desire to harass the Government. We will, therefore, suspend our struggle while you are fighting.” Accordingly, they called off the strike.libtech_630_footnoteWe may call this true justice. Eventually, our workers succeeded and the Government, too, got credit because it did justice by accepting our demands. Our workers obeyed sentiment and did not seek to take advantage of the opponent’s embarrassment. The end of the struggle saw better mutual regard between the Government and the people and we came to be treated with more respect. Thus, a struggle fought on the basis of true justice benefits both sides.
 If we conduct our struggle on the same basis, with a sense of justice, if we bear no malice towards the employers and ask only or what is our right, not only shall we win but there will also be increased goodwill between the workers and the employers.
 Another thing to observe from this instance is that,  in  satyagraha, both the sides need not be followers of truth. Even if one side alone follows it, satyagraha will finally succeed. The party, moreover, which fights with bitterness will lose its bitterness when this  is not returned by the other side. If a man violently swings his hand in the air, he only strains it thereby. Similarly, bitterness is fed only by bitterness.
 We may, therefore, rest assured that, if we fight on with firmness and courage, we are bound to win in the end.
 Tomorrow we shall consider some instances of satyagraha. [From Gujarati]

 LEAFLET NO. 8
 In this leaflet, we are not going to talk about satyagrahis who have won fame in the world. It would be more profitable for us and inspire us with strength to know what suffering common men like ourselves have found it possible to go through. Imam Hassan and Hussain were bold and resolute satyagrahis. We revere their names, but merely calling their examples to mind does not help us to become satyagrahis. We feel that there can be no comparison between our capacity and theirs. An equally memorable name is that of the devotee Prahlad. But we think that we are not capable of such devotion, resoluteness, love for truth and courage and so, in the end, we remain what we have been. Therefore, let us on this occasion think of what other persons like ourselves have done. Such a satyagrahi was Hurbatsinghlibtech_633_footnote. He was an old man of 75 years. He had gone to South Africa on a five-year contract to work on an agricultural farm on a monthly wage of seven rupees. When the strike of 20,000 Indians, referred to in the last leaflet, commenced, he also joined it. Some strikers were jailed, and Hurbatsingh was among them. His compani- ons pleaded with him and said, “It is not for you to plunge into this sea of suffering. Jail is not the place for you. No one can blame you if you do not join such a struggle.” Hurbatsingh replied: “When all of you suffer so much for our honour, what shall I do by remaining outside? What does it matter even if I die in jail?” And, verily, Hurbatsingh died in jail and won undying fame. Had he died outside, no one would have noticed his death. But, as he died in jail, the Indian community asked for his dead body and hundreds of Indians joined his funeral procession.
 
 Like Hurbatsingh, was the Transvaal businessman Ahmed Mahomed Cachalia. By the grace of God he is still alive, and lives in South Africa where he looks after the Indian community and safeguards its honour. During the struggle in which Hurbatsingh sacrificed his life, Cachalia went to prison several times. He allowed his business to be ruined and, though he now lives in poverty, is respected everywhere. He saved his honour, though he had to pay heavily for it.
 Just as an old labourer and a  middle-aged  businessman  of repute stood by their word and suffered, so also did a girl of seventeen years. Her name was Valliamah libtech_634_footnote. She also went to jail for the honour of the community during that same struggle. She had been suffering from fever when she was imprisoned. In jail, the fever became worse. The jailer advised her to leave the jail, but Valliamah refused and with an unflinching mind completed her term of imprisonment. She died on the fourth or the fifth day after her release from jail.
 The satyagraha of all the three was pure. All of them suffered hardships, went to jail but kept their pledge. There is no such cloud hanging over us. The utmost we have to suffer by keeping our pledge is to give up some of our luxuries and pull on somehow without the wages we earned. This is no very great task. It should not be difficult for us to do what our own brothers and sisters in our own time have done.
 We shall consider this matter a little further in the next leaflet. [From Gujarati]

 In going to jail and defying the Government, these three sought nothing for themselves. These sisters and brothers of ours did not have to pay the tax. Cachalia was a big merchant and did not have to pay it. Hurbatsingh had migrated before the tax was imposed, so he, too, did not have to pay it. The law imposing the tax had not been
 
 brought into force at the place where Valliamah lived. And yet all these joined the struggle with the rest for the sake of the honour of Indians in South Africa. Your struggle, on the other hand, is for your own good. It should, therefore, be easier for you to remain firm. May their example strengthen you and make you resolute.

 LEAFLET NO. 9
 Yesterday we discussed the examples of three satyagrahis; they were not the only satyagrahis in that struggle. Twenty thousand workers were out of work at a time, and the trouble was not over within twelve days. The entire struggle lasted for seven years and during that period hundreds of men lived under great suspense and anxiety and stuck to their resolve. Twenty thousand workers lived homeless and without wages for three months. Many sold whatever goods they had. They left their huts, sold their beds and mattresses and cattle and marched forth. Hundreds of them marched 20 miles a day for several days, each getting on only on libtech_636_footnote/4 lb. of flour and an ounce of sugar. There were Muslims as well as Hindus among them. One of them is the son of the Muezzin of the Jumma Masjid of Bombay. His name is Imam Saheb Abdul Kadir Bawazeerlibtech_637_footnotelibtech_638_footnote. He who had never suffered any hardship before endured the rigours of jail life, labouring, during his terms of imprisonment, on cleaning roads, breaking stones, etc., and for months lived on tasteless and simple food. At present he has not a pie with him. The same is true of Dadamiya Kaji of Surat. Two seventeen-year-old youngsters from Madras,  Narayansamylibtech_639_footnotelibtech_640_footnoteand  Nagappen  suffered  to  the  utmost   and sacrificed their lives, but did not give in. In this same struggle, we may note, women who had never done any manual  work  before  went round hawking and laboured as washerwomen in jails.
Remembering these examples, will any worker among us not be
 
 
 prepared to suffer some inconvenience to keep his pledge?
 In the leaflets issued by the employers, we find that, in their anger, they have said many unworthy things; many things have been exaggerated, maybe unintentionally, and a few twisted. We may not meet anger with anger. It does not seem right even to correct the mis- statements in them. It is enough to say that we should not allow ourselves either to be misled or provoked by such statements. If the allegations made against the advisers of the workers are true, merely contradicting them here will not prove them false. We know that they are untrue but, rather than attempt to prove them so here, we shall rely on our future behaviour to furnish the proof.
 Tomorrow we shall say something which has a bearing on this point.

 LEAFLET NO. 10
 In the situation in which we are placed, it is quite necessary to examine the point mentioned in the preceding leaflet. It is just about a fortnight since the lock-out commenced, and yet some say that they have no food, others that they cannot even pay rent. The houses of most of the workers are found to be  in  a  very  unsatisfactory condition. They are without proper ventilation. The structures are very old. The surroundings are filthy. The clothes of the workers are dirty. Some wear such clothes because they cannot afford to pay the washerman, others say that they cannot afford soap. The workers’ children just play about in the streets. They go without schooling. Some of the workers even set their tender children to work for money. Such extreme poverty is a painful thing indeed. But a 35 per cent increase will not by itself cure it. Even if wages were to be doubled, in all likelihood the abject poverty would remain unless other measures were also adopted. There are many causes for this poverty. We shall consider some of them today. Questioning the workers, we learn that when they are short of money they pay interest ranging from one anna to four annas per rupee per month. The very thought of this makes one shudder. Anyone who agrees to pay such interest even once will find it extremely difficult to extricate himself. Let us  consider this a little. Interest on sixteen rupees at one anna per rupee
 
 is one rupee. People who pay interest at this rate pay an amount equivalent to the principal in one year and four months. This amounts to 75 per cent interest. Even twelve to sixteen per cent interest is considered exorbitant; how, then, can a man paying 75 per  cent interest survive at all? Then, what shall we say of a man who pays four annas a month on a rupee? Such a person pays an amount equal to the principal in four months. This amounts to 300 per cent interest. People who pay interest at such rates are always in debt and are never able to extricate themselves. Prophet Mahomed had realized the crushing burden of interest and so it is that we find in the Holy Koran strict injunctions against charging interest. For similar reasons, the rule of damdupatlibtech_647_footnotelibtech_648_footnotemust have been prescribed in the Hindu scriptures. If, as part of the present struggle all workers take an oath not to pay such excessive interest, they will have an unbearable burden lifted from them. Nobody should pay interest at a rate higher than twelve per cent. Some may say: “It is all right for the future, but how shall we pay back what we have already borrowed on interest? We have this thing with us for a lifetime now.” The best way out of this situation is to start co-operative credit societies of workers. We found some workers in a position to rescue their brethren who were being crushed under the weight of interest. Outsiders are not likely to take a hand in this. Only those who trust us will help us. The workers should risk everything to free themselves from this scourge. Paying such high rates of interest is a major cause of poverty. Probably all other causes count for less. We shall discuss this point later.

It is not either that I have not thought about it. I have decided to leave it alone after full deliberation. Possibly, it is weakness on my part to have done so. In that case, I need strength

BHAI PRANJIVAN,
 Be the outcome in the Kheda District what it may, the officials and the people are having a good education. There has been a tremendous awakening among the people. It was disloyalty even to talk of non-payment of taxes, but now people speak of it without fear. Those among the educated, who have been working as volunteers, have also immensely benefited. Men who had never seen a village got an opportunity now and went round nearly 600 villages. The Kheda matter is still not off our hands. Something of the same kind is going on between the workers and the mill-owners. I find myself being drawn into every field of Indian life. It is no small thing that, without our having to spend a single rupee, 10,000 labourers have remained peaceful; this is a fact. People have realized that there is nothing like self help. In both these matters, success lies along the lines summed up in these two slogans: “You will win by your own strength, not ours”, and “You will not win except through suffering deliberately endured.”

209,"March 	9, 1918",LETTER TO J. GHOSAL,"
             DEAR 	MR. GHOSAL,          SABARMATI,  March 	9, 1918 
  	I had a visit early this morning from some of the Kathana 	cultivators. They brought with them a batch of chothai notices. 	I was somewhat taken aback as I had felt that even though you might 	insist upon collection, no chothai or khalsa orders 	would be issued. I have no justification for this except the feeling 	that as you permitted me to continue my negotiations about the crops 	in  Kaira  District  no coercion would be used even it finally 	collection was decided upon where postponement was urged. I have 	therefore telegraphed appealing for cancellation of the orders above 	referred to. I hope my    
 appeal will have a favourable reception from you. I have taken the liberty, too, as the matter is so very important, of sending a telegram to the Secretariat at Bombay.
 I now come to Wadthal. I thank you for your letter in reply to my query as to the deduction of double-cropped area. If for a field which normally grew a kharif as well as a rabi crop the assessment was based on this fact, in my opinion the crop would be only 16 annas for that field or a group of similar fields in a village, if it gave 16 annas both of kharif and rabi.
 The process of deducting the double-cropped area could only be justified if you held that the field that gave 16 annas of kharif crop should be estimated to have given more than 16 annas to the extent of its rabi crop thus leading to the reductio ad absurdum suggested by my letter of the 6th instant.
 I wholly accept the argument that in finding the annawari there can be no fieldwise calculation except as a sample. And  on  that ground I venture to suggest that the rabi crop as a rule ought not to be taken into consideration, because it is not a general crop. If 90 fields of every 100 grow only a kharif crop and have no rabi and if the rabi crop, where grown be 16 annas, it would be a false average annawari for the hundred fields if the rabi crop for the purpose of annawari is a negligible quantity. The staple crops are undoubtedly kharif crops and in my humble opinion, agriculturists get less than justice when in order to collect revenue assessments annawari is forced up by taking the rabi into account. Indeed my observations supported by my fellow-workers now cover nearly 350 villages and they lead me to think that the cultivators pay their assessment from the kharif crops and not out of the rabi. No intelligent observer can escape noticing as he passes from field to field that the rabi crops are like an oasis in a big desert.
 It may be added that not all the fields of individual cultivators can be laid under rabi cultivation. The season and crop report for the year 1914-15 shows that the rabi crop was only a twelfth and for 1915-16 twentieth of all the other crops. I would venture to suggest too that crops such as spices, vegetables, variali, etc., which are grown only by a few cultivators ought not to be taken into account. I would put cotton, too, in the same category until it becomes a general crop among the agriculturists. It would be obviously unfair to put up the annawari of the village because a big land-holder carrying on bold
 experiments has succeeded in growing special crops. I desire, too, to protest against the strip grass being included in the calculation. I am told that it is not usual to sell this grass, but that people have as a matter of necessity to keep the borders to allow their cattle to turn about at the end of every journey from one direction to the other. If the object of arriving at the annawari, viz., relief to the average cultivator if his crops have not yielded . . .libtech_651_footnotelibtech_652_footnotebe kept steadily in view, I submit that this argument would appear to be unanswerable.
 I had indeed begged of you to visit Wadhal and  test  the valuation for yourself. But I had at the same time begged that I should accompany you. I would then have been able to place before you the cultivators’ standpoint as I had seen it. For instance, I would certainly have matched Mr. Muljibhai Amin’s testimony and shown that his could well be treated as biased. I would have brought you face to face with the... who would have told you that the annawari arrived at by them was 3 during the month of December last. I would have got the people to produce for your inspection juvar pods in abundance to show you that they were not only eaten up by rats but that they were attacked by some serious disease. The juvar in some of the fields does indeed look tall and majestic, but an examination of the pods tells a different tale.
 It gives me pleasure to confess that you have bestowed much pains on the production of your report. But I respectfully submit that based as it is originally upon the Mamlatdar’s figure its does [not] do sufficient justice to the cultivators. In my humble opinion the mamlatdar’s annawari is totally at variance with the almost universal testimony of the villagers some of whom have a reputation to lose. It is impossible for me to impute either untrustworthiness to them or thoughtlessness. I am strongly supported in my view by Mr. Batukshanker of Nadiad who is himself a considerable land-holder and who is one of the most respectable straightforward men in the Kaira District. He has not said anything about Wadthal but his land is in a condition no less advantageous than the best in Wadthal and yet his annawari brings him under the suspension rules. I cannot help remarking that your annawari of tuwar, kodra, rice, bavte, sherian tobacco, divela and gram is too high. I venture to suggest they are. . .libtech_653_footnote4, 2, 2, 5, 4, 6, 5, 2, 4. Acceptance of my figures brings the annawari
 
 under the suspension rules. And if you accept my submission that only the staple crops should be values retention of your annawari in respect of them brings the average to less than 6. Again if the double-cropped area were not deducted the annawari would be less than  6  retaining.  .  .libtech_654_footnotefigures.  Thirdly,  if   the   rabi   crops   and   the uncommon crops were exempted from the calculation as submitted by me the annawari would be under 6. I have before me a list carefully prepared in consultation with the villagers giving the actual yield of all the crops and the normal yield. It will be admitted that if the figures are correct it will be the most absolute test. The annawari for this village arrived at by this process is 2.7. I adhere to my suggestion that the rabi crop including the other standing crop can be easily utilized for testing the accuracy of the figures given by the cultivators. I have suggested to the people of Wadthal that they should not remove the standing crops from the threshing-floors except after duly weighing them in the presence of independent witnesses. I venture to submit that it is worth while your testing the Wadthal crops in this fashion.
 Might I also draw your attention to the fact that the annawari for the kharif crops arrived at by the Ho. Messrsn. Gokuldas Parekh and Patel and also Mr. Deolker and his party was under 4 annas. So that if my contention about the kharif crops be accepted for purposes of inding the true annawari, you have the results of my investigation for nearly 350 villages corroborated by two other independent investiga- tions. You will observe that my investigation embraces all the talukas and covers a large number of villages in each taluka, and I have no hesitation in asking for full suspension in respect of all but a few of . .
 .libtech_655_footnotelibtech_656_footnotecases the first instalment have already been paid and here I wish parenthetically to draw attention to the fact that in some villages even though half-suspension orders were issued both instalments were collected from small holders. I therefore suggest that the  villages where the first instalment had already been received, suspension order should be issued for the second instalment. Though you may be precluded from considering any cause for granting suspension other than the failure of crops to the extent of 12 annas I would suggest for the consideration of the Government the fact that the people of the District have been hardest hit perhaps by the plague which is raginlg furiously in it, which has decimated many  a  home  and  which  has
 
 driven many people from their houses on to temporary grass structures, built at, for them, considerable expense. In my humble opinion, your argument about the high prices is not fair to the people. It is common cause between us that last year has been very poor for the cultivators. They have not certainly had much grain for sale.  Whilst therefore they have been considerably disadvantaged by them as they had to buy food and clothing. Taking therefore everything into consideration even if full suspension be not granted I hope that the Government will be pleased to grant at least half suspension in every case, and if these orders are passed I shall try my utmost to secure without coercion payment of the first instalment from the villages which have hitherto held out.
 There still remains the case of the Daskroi villages. There can be no doubt whatsoever that flood did an irreparable damage to their crops and they are entitled to relief under the  Local  Calamities section. You were pleased to tell me that you were not inclined to grant suspension where the cultivators had grown rabi crops. I repeat what I submitted to you at the interview that if you exempt from suspension orders those who have grown rabi crops you would be punishing industry. They have told me and I believe their statement that those who have grown rabi are actually out of pocket and are therefore worse off than those who never grow it at all. I  have inspected the rabi crop and I have no hesitation in saying that though the patches of green look tempting to the eye, closer inspection shows that the crops are diseased and will yield very little and in any case I presume you will admit that it is only on limited areas that the occupants have grown rabi crop on their fields.
 I admit that the Kaira District is naturally “rich  and prosperous”, its cattle are in a good condition, it has great wealth in its majestic trees. But I fear very much that the District has been progressively going down in prosperity. Their ill-kept, dilapidated houses, their empty barns, and probably the awful destruction that is going on of trees and evidence I possess of the sale of their cattle unmistakably point to the decline in their prosperity. A few more lean years can certainly undo this fair land.
 I do not know how far the failure of crops is responsible for the destruction of mohwa trees and how far it is due to the Mohwa Act and how far it is due to the greed to get high prices for coal and wood, for both of which the Mohwa tree is so handy. Whatever may be the
 
 cause I do hope that the Government will remove from the people at least for the time being the fear of the Mohwa Act. I wish further to suggest that during the summer season and during the monsoon hundreds of people in the District would be hard put to it for food and it would be an act of simple justice to permit the fullest use of Mohwa flowers for their food. It would be cruelty to enforce the Act during this year. To recapitulate,
  In 	my opinion by 	a variety 	of ways 	your minimum annawari 	for Wadthal has 	been successfully 	challenged and it 	is less than 	4 annas; 	the case for the large 	majority of 	the villages 	in the 	District is 	similar to Wadthal 	and therefore 	the cultivators 	are entitled to full 	suspension;  If 	however my 	suggestion as 	to annawari be 	not accepted 	l pray 	that the Government may 	be pleased 	to grant 	half-suspension all 	round in 	view (1) of 	the admittedly 	partial failure of crops 	and (2) of the distress 	caused amongst the 	people by 	the plague 	and the high 	prices, and 	if this 	relief is 	granted I 	am prepared 	to advise 	holders of sanadia lands 	and others 	who are well off to 	pay both the instalments 	voluntarily. This will 	confine the relief 	only to those 	who are in 	actual distress;  For 	Daskroi villages over 	and above 	the relief 	by way 	of suspension, 	the Local 	Calamities section 	should be fully 	applied to them;  The 	operation of 	the known 	Act should 	be suspended 	and the 	fact widely made known 	to the people 	so that 	in so far as the Act is 	an inducement 	to cut 	down the 	trees they may 	be saved, 	and so 	that they may be enabled to make use of Mohwa flowers for food. 
 May I request you to pass this letter on to the Government with, if possible, favourable recommendation from you.libtech_657_footnote

  	A correspondent has sent from Borsad a printed form which purports 	to be an admission as to the estimate of standing crops and an 	admission that the crop is enough to pay the Government dues. I 	cannot help saying that the form is most unfair to the people. They 	ought not to be called upon to sign any such document. I 	respectfully suggest that the document be withdrawn.

            DEAR 	MR. CRERAR,           SABARMATI,  March 	10, 1918 
  	In the hope that His excellency is now able to attend to public 	business with undue strain on him, I am addressing  this 	communication to you. I do however feel ashamed that I should be at 	all a cause of adding to His Excellency’s many anxieties. I would 	certainly have refrained if I could have helped it. I beg to enclose 	herewith a copy of my letter to the Collector of Kaira District. I 	am awaiting his reply. I have personally visited over thirty 	villages in the various talukas and I must confess that the 	universal cry is that the crops have been largely a failure. It is 	impossible therefore to think that all the men are determined to 	tell an untruth. What is more, the crops still standing confirm the 	popular view. If they yield a poor return the kharif crops 	already cut must have been poorer still. For it is admitted that the 	rabi crops and the longer-living kharif are better    
 than the crops already harvested. In the circumstances I have not hesitated to tell the people that they need not voluntarily pay their vigoti but should allow the officials to sell their belongings. I have been invited to make a public statement but have declined to do so pending negotiations with the Government for a settlement. I have declined too to issue notices to the people giving general advice. And I am hoping that if the evidence of my colleagues and myself is not accepted, if even the prevalence of the plague is not accepted as in itself a sufficient excuse for postponing collection as required by me, a joint inquiry might be held. But [if] even the last request is rejected there is for me no recourse left open but to generally advise the cultivators  to  refuse  to  pay  the  revenue  dueslibtech_659_footnotelibtech_660_footnoteand   to   allow  their belongings to be sold or confiscated and to issue a public appeal for support of their attitude. In my humble opinion it is better that the people in a dignified and respectful manner disobey the Government orders and knowingly suffer in their own person the consequences of their disobedience than that disappointment should deepen into secretdiscontent. I had promised that I would humbly lay before His Excellency my view on the situation before taking any extreme steps. I hope that my submission will receive His Excellency’s due consideration. I shall gladly wait on His Excellency should my presence be desired.

If   you  	 think it proper to name the library after me, you may do so.

It is also rumoured that the lock-out is to be lifted on Tuesday, 	and that those workers who return will be taken back. We  hear, 	besides, that any worker who persuades five or more other workers to 	go with him will be given a reward. Nothing needs to be done to 	counter these tactics. Employers are entitled to get the workers 	back to work by employing others to persuade them. But what is the 	workers’ duty? They have stated that an increase of 20 per cent is 	not adequate and have given notices accordingly. They have taken an 	oath not to accept anything less than 35 per cent. Placed in this 	predicament, unless a 35 per cent increase is granted, the workers 	cannot return to work except by violating their pledge, their honour 	 and their manliness. It is possible, however, that every worker may 	not have such a sense of honour. Some may not even have taken such a 	pledge. A few hail from outside Gujarat and they may not even be 	attending meetings. It would be wrong even for such workers to go 	back to work with a 20 per cent increase. Our duty merely is to find 	out such unthinking workers and acquaint them with the true state of 	affairs.    
 But let it be remembered that even they are not to be coerced in any way.
 Tomorrow, i.e.,  on  Tuesdaylibtech_662_footnote,  we  are  to  meet  at  7.30  in  the morning at the usual place. The best way not to be tempted by the employers’ reopening the mills is to attend the meeting as usual at
 7.30 in the morning. You should also search out the workers from other parts of the country who live as strangers to you and who have hitherto not attended these meetings, and see that they attend them. In these days, when you are facing a temptation, all manner of thoughts will occur to you. It is a miserable thing for a working man to be without a job. The meetings will keep up the patience of all workers who feel so. For those who know their strength, there can be no enforced unemployment. In reality the worker can be so independent that, if he realizes his true worth, he will never worry about losing a job. The wealth of a rich person may disappear or be stolen or be lost in a moment by mismanagement. Thanks to miscalculation, a rich man may have to face bankruptcy. But a worker’s capital is inexhaustible, incapable of being stolen, and bound to pay him a generous dividend all the time. His hands and feet, the energy which enables him to work, constitute this inexhaustible capital of his and the wages constitute his dividends. The worker who invests more of his energy in work can easily earn more interest. An idle worker will certainly starve. Such a one may have reason for despair. The industrious has no reason to worry even for a moment. Let everyone be at the usual place in time on Tuesday and there you will learn better yet how independent you really are.

  [Before 	March 12, 1918]  	Many friends come to me and try to persuade me that I should somehow 	bring to an end the struggle between the workers and the 	mill-owners. I would certainly do so if I could, even at the cost of 	my life. But that is not possible. It is in the hands of the 	mill-owners to bring it to an end. Why make it a point of prestige 	not to give 35 per cent because the workers have asked for it? Why 	is it taken for granted that I can get the workers to accept 	anything I want? I claim that the workers are under my control 	because of the means I have adopted.      
 Shall I now see to it that they break their pledge? If I do so, why should they not sever my head from my shoulders? I hear that the mill-owners find fault with me. I am unconcerned. Some day they themselves will admit that I was not in the wrong. There can be no bitterness between them and me, since I am not going to be a party to any bitterness. Even bitterness needs encouragement; it won’t get any from me. But why don’t you participate in this? It does not become you merely to watch this great struggle unconcernedly.

 LEAFLET NO. 12
 Today a new chapter begins. The employers have decided to withdraw the lock-out and have expressed their willingness to take back those who are ready to accept a 20 per cent increase. This means that today the employers’ lock-out. is at an end and a workers’ strike has commenced. You have all seen the announce-ment of the employers’ resolution to this effect. They say in it that many workers are ready to resume work but could not do so owing to the lock-out. The information which the employers have received ill accords with the daily meetings of the workers and the oath they have taken. Either their information is true or the presence of the workers in the daily meetings and the oath they have taken are a fact. The workers bore all these things in mind before taking the pledge and now they cannot resume work without securing a 35 per cent increase, whatever the inducement held out and whatever the suffering they may have to go through. Their honour is at stake in this. If you weigh a pledge  against a sum of hundreds of thousands, the pledge will be seen to be of greater consequence. We are sure the workers will never forget this. They have no other way to advance themselves except to stand by their oath and it is our conviction that, if only the employers realize it, their welfare too lies in the workers’ keeping their oath. Eventually, even the employers will not gain by taking work from workers who are too weak to keep their oath. A religiously-minded person will
 
 never feel happy in forcing a person to break his  pledge  or associating himself with such an effort. We have, however, no time now to think of the employers’ duty. They know it all right. We can only entreat them. But the workers must think seriously what their duty is at this time. Never again will they get an opportunity like the present one.
 Let us consider what the workers are likely to gain by breaking their oath. These days, any honest person in India can earn twenty to twenty-five rupees a month by intelligent work. The worst that can happen to a worker is that his employers may dismiss him and he will have to look for other work. A thoughtful worker should realize that he will get work anywhere after a few days’ search. We are sure, however, that the employers do not want to take this extreme step. If workers are firm in their resolve, even the hardest of hearts will relent.
 It is possible that the workers from outside Gujarat (i.e., those from the North or the South) are not well informed about this  struggle. In public work we do not, and do not wish to, make distinctions of Hindu, Muslim, Gujarati, Madrasi, Punjabi, etc. We are all one or wish to be one. We should, therefore, approach these  workers with understanding and enlighten them about the struggle and make them see that it is to their advantage, too, to identify themselves with the rest of us.

 I got your letter. I have destroyed it after reading it. I never wished that there should be any pressure on the workers. If you send more details about who is bringing it on them, I will certainly look into the matter. It is all the same to me whether the mill-hands resume work or not. I have always given instructions not to use force to prevent any worker from going to his mill. I have certainly no desire that a labourer should be forced against his will to keep away from it.
 
 I am even ready, myself, to escort any worker who says he wants to attend the mill. I am altogether indifferent whether a labourer joins or does not join.
 In view of the task you have set me, how can I accept the pleasure of staying with you? I should very much like to see your children. How is that possible at present, though? Let us leave it to the future.

 LEAFLET NO. 13 libtech_669_footnote
 Rumours are afloat that many workers are willing to resume work, but that others prevent them by coercion and threats of physical assault. Workers should remember our pledge that, if they bring pressure to bear on their fellows and use threats to stop them from going to work, we shall not find it possible to help them. In this struggle, he alone will win who keeps his pledge. No one can be forced to do this. It is essentially a voluntary matter. We want to be faithful to our pledge and go ahead. If a man, being afraid, ventures nothing, he can never advance. Such a one has lost everything. Let every worker, therefore, bear in mind that he is not to use pressure on others in any form or manner. If coercion is used, the whole struggle is likely to be weakened and will collapse. For the success of their struggle, the workers are to rely solely on the  rightness  of  their demand and of their conduct. If their demand is unjust, they cannot succeed. The demand may be just. But even then the worker will lose his case despite all his suffering if, in securing it, he resorts to untruth or falsehood, to violence or coercion, or is apathetic. It is  very essential in this struggle that workers do not resort to coercion and that they provide for their maintenance by putting in physical labour.

 I cannot do full justice, nor can anyone else for that matter, I am sure, to the task of introducing Mrs. Besant. I have known her for thirty years, having followed her activities since my youth, though of course I cannot claim that she has known me so long. “Home Rule” has become a household word all over India, in places big and small; the credit for this goes to this lady. I have often said that there have been, and there may still be, differences between her and me; there are quite a few even today. If I had the Home Rule movement under my charge, I would go to work differently. Having said this, I admit I cannot but look up to her with reverence, honour her, pay tribute to her for her excellent qualities, for she has dedicated her very soul to India. She lives only for India to live thus is her sole aspiration. No matter if she commits hundreds of mistakes, we shall honour her. In my view, Ahmedabad has covered itself with unsurpassed honour by honouring one who has rendered such great services as she has. With regard to the subject of today’s address, it seems the present audience is not likely to be much interested in it. Mrs. Besant told me a moment ago that she might manage to speak on swaraj before you, but that she wondered what she could say on national education. There are not enough educated people in the audience. She will speak, all the same. I have her permission for speaking in Gujarati. Whatever I wish to tell you, I can say only in Gujarati. Her speech will later be summarized for you in Gujarati. The agitation she has launched in the present circumstances has been useful in several ways. India has benefited from her work, her organizing ability and her eloquence; to honour her, the first thing to do is to hear her in silence.

 Gandhiji  started  by  requesting  the  people  to   maintain   silence   and  stressed  the  importance of  being  punctual  at  a  meeting.  He  suggested  that anyone who turned up from that time onwards should remain outside the gate.
 The subject of today’s speech concerns our own interest; it is about swaraj. Wealth, honour, strength—all these follow from swaraj. One statement of this lady deserves to be engraved in our hearts and in the Government’s, that India would have Home Rule or go on hunger-strike. Everyone should ponder over this. Being without political power, India is growing poorer and so abject is this poverty that thousands have been driven by it to inhuman crimes. The idea of hunger-strike is intended to bring home to us that a man who has been starving for some days would stop at nothing. She is speaking today to explain this point. If some of Mrs. Besant’s detractors succeed against her, that is only because she believes in action and has no interest except in her work. She has dedicated herself, body and soul, and all she has, to her mission. She has put before us what she had to say but it is not by following her way that we shall succeed in swimming across to the other side, we shall do so only by following our own. If the honour Ahmedabad has accorded her today is sincere, you should pray to God that He may grant the strength she has to us as well. And, with the same regard for her listen to her in silence. Those who cannot follow English may read a translation tomorrow.
 Concluding the proceedings, Shri Gandhi suggested that her speech should be translated into Gujarati and copies of the translation distributed  among  the  people. He described the speech as historic. He then read out the names of those who had presented Mrs. Besant with purses and thanked them. He advised everyone to ponder over her speech.

 As the weapon of the rich is money, that of the workers is their labour. Just as a rich man would starve if he did not employ his wealth, even so if the worker did not employ his wealth— did not work—he would also starve. One who does not work is not a worker. A worker who is ashamed of working has no right to eat. If, therefore, the workers desire to fulfil their pledge in this great struggle, they should learn to do some work or other. Those who collect funds and, remaining idle, maintain themselves out of them do not deserve to win. Workers are fighting for their pledge. Those who want food without working for it do not, it may be said, understand what a pledge means. He alone can keep his pledge who can feel shame or has self-respect. Is there anyone who will not look down on those who desire to be maintained on public funds without doing any work? It behoves us, therefore, that we maintain ourselves by doing some work. If a worker does not work, he is like sugar which has lost its sweetness. If the sea water lost its salt, where would we get our salt from? If the worker did not work, the world would come to an end.
 This struggle is not merely for a 35 per cent increase; it is to show that workers are prepared to suffer for their rights. We are fighting to uphold our honour. We have launched on this struggle in order to better ourselves. If we start using public funds improperly, we shall grow worse and not better. Consider the matter from any angle you choose, you will see that we must maintain ourselves by our own labour. Farhadlibtech_678_footnotebroke stones for the sake of Shirin, his beloved. For the workers, their pledge is their Shirin. Why should they not break stones for its sake? For the sake of truth, Harishchandralibtech_679_footnotesold himself; why should workers not suffer hardships for upholding their pledge ? For the sake of their honour, Imam Hassan and Hussain suffered greatly. Should we not be prepared even to die for our honour? If we get money while we remain idle at home and fight with that money, it would be untrue to say that we are fighting.
 
         truth      
 We hope, therefore, that every worker will work to maintain himself so that he may be able to keep his oath and remain firm. If the struggle lengthens, it will be because of weakness on our part. So long as the mill-owners believe that workers will not take to  any  labour and, therefore, will eventually succumb, they will have no compassion and will continue to resist [the demand]. So long as they are not convinced that workers will never give in, they will not be moved by compassion and will continue to oppose the workers even at the sacrifice of their own profits. When, however, they feel certain that the workers will, under no circumstances, give up their resolve, they will show compassion enough and welcome the workers back. Today the employers believe that the workers will not do any manual labour and so are bound to succumb soon. If the workers depend on others’ money for their maintenance, the mill-owners will think  that  the source is bound to be exhausted sooner or later, and so will not take the workers seriously. If, on the other hand, workers who have no [other] means of subsistence begin to do manual work, the employers will see that they will lose their workers unless they grant the 35 per cent increase forthwith. Thus, it is for us to shorten or lengthen the struggle. We shall be free the sooner by enduring greater suffering just now. If we flinch from suffering, the struggle is bound to be protracted. Those who have weakened will, we hope, consider all these points and become strong again.
 SPECIAL INSTRUCTION
 Some workers are inclined to believe that those who have weakened cannot be persuaded to become strong. This is a wrong impression altogether. It is the duty of us all—yours and ours—to try, with gentleness, to persuade those who have weakened for one reason or another. It is also our duty to educate those who do not know what the struggle means. What we have been saying is that we may not use threats, tell lies, or resort to violence, or exert pressure in any manner to keep anyone away from work. If, despite persuasion, anyone resumes work, that is no reason for us to lose heart. Even if only one person holds out, we shall never forsake him.

 You must have heard what happened this morning. Some were shocked, others wept. I do not feel that there was anything wrong, or anything of which I need be ashamed, in this morning’s development.  I do not feel angry at the criticism made by the residents of Jugaldas Chawl.libtech_681_footnotelibtech_682_footnoteRather, I, and others as well who want to serve India,  have much to learn from it. I have always believed that, if our capacity for tapascharya or voluntary suffering is real enough, we are bound to reap the fruit. You took an oath relying on my advice. In this age the oath has lost its value. Men break their oath at any time and for any reason and I am grieved to have been instrumental in thus lowering the value of an oath. There is nothing else that will bind a man as effectively as an oath does. The meaning of an oath is that we decide to do a particular thing with God in whom we believe as our witness. People who are on a higher plane can perhaps do without oaths, but we who are on a lower one cannot. We who fall a thousand times cannot raise ourselves without oaths. You will admit that, had we not taken the oath and repeated it daily, many of us would have fallen long ago. You yourselves have said that never before have you known a strike as peaceful as this. The reason why some have fallen is that they are faced with starvation. I would advice you to keep your oath even if you have to starve, though it is our pledge, mine and my co- workers’, that we will not allow you to starve. If we look on unconcernedly while you are starving, you may give up your pledge by all means. There is one more thing we should have mentioned along with these two. It is that if, while not allowing you to starve, we ask you to beg, we would be guilty in the eyes of God and would prove no better than thieves. But what should I do to persuade you to maintain yourselves with manual labour? I can do manual work, I have been doing it, and would do so even now; but I do not get the opportunity for it. I have a number of things to attend to, and can,
 
 therefore, do some manual work only by way of exercise. Will it behove you to tell me that you have worked on looms, but cannot do other physical labour ? This notion has taken deep root in India. It is good as a principle that a man should specialize in one type of work only; but it would be improper to use this as an excuse. I have thought much about this. When I came to know of your bitter criticism of me,  I felt that, if I wanted to keep you to the path of dharma and show you the worth of an oath and the value of labour, I must set a concrete example before you. We are not out to have fun at your cost or to act a play. How can I prove to you that we are prepared to carry out whatever we tell you? I am not God that I can demonstrate this to you in some way [other than by fasting]. I should very much like to do something which would convince you that you would have to be plain with me, that it would not do for you merely to act a part. Nobody can be induced or coerced to keep his oath. Love is the only inducement that can be offered. You must understand that he alone, who loves his religion, loves his honour and country, will refuse to give up his resolve ....
 I am used to taking such pledges. For fear that people may wrongly imitate me, I would rather not take one at all. But I am dealing with hundreds of thousands of workers. I must, therefore, see that my conscience is clean. I wanted to show you that I was not playing with you.
 I have attempted to show you by example that you should value your oath in the same manner as I have done. You have already done one thing. You could have said: “What have we to do with your oath, we cannot continue the fight, we must go back’’; but you did not do so. You decided to accept our service. And I thought of you the more highly for that. It seemed a beautiful thing to me to sink or swim with you.libtech_683_footnote

If the fast were conceived in that spirit, it would harm our struggle and bring us dishonour. We want justice from the employers, not pity for us. If there is to be any pity, let it be for the workers. We believe that it is but the employers’ duty to have pity for the workers. But we shall be ridiculed if we accept 35 per cent granted out of pity for Gandhiji. Workers cannot accept it on that basis. If Gandhiji exploited his relations with the employers or the people in general in this manner, he would be misusing his position and would lose his good name. What connection could there possibly be between Gandhiji’s fast and the issue of workers’ wages? Even if fifty persons resolve to starve themselves to death on the employers’ premises, how can the employers, for that reason, give the workers a 35 per cent increase if they have no right to it? If this becomes a common practice for securing rights, it would be impossible to carry on the affairs of society. Employers cannot and  need not pay attention to this fast of Gandhiji, though it  is  impossible  that Gandhiji’s action will have no effect on them.
 We shall be sorry to the extent the employers are influenced by this action. But, at the same time, we cannot sacrifice other far- reaching results that the fast may possibly bring about.  Let  us  examine the purpose for which the fast has been undertaken. Gandhiji saw that the oath was losing its force with the workers. Some of them were ready to break their pledge out of fear of what they thought would be starvation. It is intolerable that ten thousand men should give up their oath. A man becomes weak by not keeping a vow and ultimately loses his dignity as man. It is, therefore, our duty to do our utmost to help the workers to keep their oath. Gandhiji felt that, if he fasted, he would show through this how much he himself valued a pledge. Moreover, the workers talked of starvation. ‘Starve but keep your oath’ was Gandhiji’s message to them. He at any rate must live
 
 up to it. That he could do only if he himself was prepared to die fasting. Besides, workers said they would not do manual labour, but said, all the same, they stood in need of financial help. This seemed a terrible thing. If the workers took up such an attitude, there would be utter chaos in the country. There was only one way in which Gandhiji could effectively teach the people to submit to the hardships of physical labour and this was that he himself should suffer. He did manual work, of course, but that was not enough. A fast, he thought, would serve many purposes, and so commenced one. He would break it only when the workers got 35 per cent or if they simply repudiated their pledge. The result was as expected. Those who were present when he took the vow saw this well enough. The workers were roused; they started manual labour and were saved from betraying what was for them a matter of religion.
 The workers have now realized that they will secure justice at the hands of the employers only if they remain firm in their oath. Gandhiji’s fast has buoyed them up. But they must rely on their own strength to fight. They alone can save themselves.

 I hope that on the basis of facts ascertained by me and my friends, and having regard to the hardships caused by the epidemic and plague and enhanced cost of living, either the recovery of land revenue would be postponed or an inquiry by an independent board would be made, such as the one I had originally asked for. But if this last request of mine is ignored and properties are confiscated or sold, or land forfeited, I shall be compelled to advise the peasants openly not to pay up land revenue.libtech_685_footnote

ASHRAMlibtech_687_footnote","
    
 March 17, 1918
 The step I have just now taken is a very grave one, but at the back of it there stands a great idea. It is grave because, on hearing of this all those who know me in India will be very much pained, be almost in an agony of grief. But, at the same time, I have here an opportunity to convey to them a beautiful idea, and I should not miss it. This is the motive behind my action. I have been getting quite impatient for the last two days to explain it to you but I could not get enough quiet time for that. It would make me very unhappy to miss the morning and evening prayers in the Ashram. And, besides, yesterday the music maestro dropped in and so I just would not forgo the pleasure of hearing his strains. I have swum past many a lure but many hungers still persist in me. At present I get here all that I long for by way of music and, therefore, although it was Anasuyabehn’s express wish yesterday that I should stay on there, I  insisted  on coming over to the Ashram. At a time like this, the music here has a very soothing effect on me. This is indeed the best occasion for me to unburden my soul to you. At other hours, you are likely to be busy with your work and to make you leave that and assemble here—that won’t be proper either.
 From the ancient culture of India, I have gleaned a truth which, even if it is mastered by the few persons here at the moment, would give these few a mastery over the world. Before telling you of it, however, I should like to say another thing. At present, there is only one person in India over whom millions are crazy, for whom millions of our countrymen would lay down their lives. That person is Tilak
 
 Maharaj. I often feel that this is a great asset of his, his great treasure. He has written on the inner meaning of the  Gitalibtech_688_footnotelibtech_689_footnote. But I have always felt that he has not understood the age-old spirit of India, has not understood her soul and that is the reason why the nation has come to this pass. Deep down in his heart, he would like us all to be what the Europeans are. As Europe stands on top at present, as it seems, that is, to those whose minds are steeped in European notions—he  wants India to be in the same position. He underwent six years’ internment but only to display a courage of the European variety, with the idea that these people who are tyrannizing over us now may learn how, if it came to that, we too could stand such long terms of internment, be it five years or twenty-five. In the prisons of Siberia, many great men of Russia are wasting their whole lives, but these men did not go to prison in obedience to any spiritual promptings. To be thus  prodigal  of one’s life is to expend our highest treasure to no purpose. If Tilakji had undergone the sufferings of internment with a spiritual motive, things would not have been as they are and the results of his  internment would have been far different. This is what I should like to explain to him. I have often, with great respect, spoken about this to him, as much as I could, though I have not put the thing in so many words orally or in writing. I might have, in what I wrote, watered down my meaning, but Tilak Maharaj has so penetrating an intellect that he would understand. This is, however, no matter to be explained orally or in writing. To give him first-hand experience of it, I must furnish a living example. Indirectly, I have spoken to him often enough but, should I get an opportunity of providing a direct demonstration, I should not miss it, and here is one.
 Another such person is Madan Mohan Malaviya. Amongst the present leaders of India, he is a man of the holiest character —that is, amongst political personages and amongst those whom we know. Unknown to us, there may be many such indeed. But although he is so holy in his life and so well informed on points of dharma, he has not,  it  seems  to  me,  properly  understood  the   soul   of   India   in all its grandeur. I am afraid I have said too much. If he were to hear this, Malaviyaji might get angry with me, even think of me as a swollen-headed man and take a dislike to me. But I feel no hesitation in saying what I do because it is quite true. I have spoken to him many times. I am bound to him by ties of affection and hence I have
 
 
 even indulged in frequent wranglings with him. At the end of all my arguments, however, he would merely say that all I had said might be true but that he was not convinced of it. I have this opportunity to provide him, too, with a direct demonstration. I owe it to both to show now what India’s soul is.
 For the last twenty days, I have been mixing with ten thousand mill-hands. In my presence, they took a pledge in the name of God. At the time, they did so with great enthusiasm. Whatever type of  people they are, they all believe at any rate that God exists.
 They thought that, when they had observed the pledge  for twenty days, God was bound to come to their help. When that did not happen and God prolonged the test, their faith faltered. They felt that, led by this one man, they had suffered all these days but gained nothing whatever, that if they had not allowed themselves to be prevailed upon by him but had turned militant, they would have had their 35 per cent, or even more, in a much shorter time. This is my analysis of how their minds work. I can never bear to be in such a situation. That a pledge once taken, at my instance, should be so lightly broken and that faith in God should decline means certain annihilation of dharma. I simply cannot live to be a witness to this in any activity to which I am a party. I must impress upon the minds of the mill-hands what it is to take a pledge. I must show to them what I can do for a pledge; if I did not, I would be a coward. For a man who brags of clearing seven feet, not to clear even one is impotence. Well, then, to keep those ten thousand men from falling, I took this step. This was why I took the vow and its impact was electrifying. I had never expected this. The thousands of men present there shed tears from their eyes. They awoke to the reality of their soul, a new consciousness stirred in them and they got strength to stand by their pledge. I was instantly persuaded that dharma had not vanished from India, that people do respond to an appeal to their soul. If Tilak Maharaj and Malaviyaji would but see this, great things could be done in India.
 I am at present overflowing with joy. When, on a former occasion, I took such a vow, my mind did not enjoy the peace it does today. I also felt at that time the pull of the body. This time I experience nothing of the kind. My mind is filled with profound peace. I feel like pouring forth my soul to you all but I am beside myself with joy.
 My pledge is directed to making the mill-hands honour theirs and teaching them what value to attach to a pledge. For people in our country to take pledges whenever they fancy and break them at any moment betrays their degraded state. And for ten thousand mill-hands to break faith with themselves would spell ruin for the nation. It would never again be possible to raise the workers’ issues. At every turn they would quote this as an example and say that ten thousand mill-hands endured suffering for twenty days with a man like Gandhi to lead them and still they did not win. I was thus forced to consider by what means the mill-hands could be made to remain firm. How could I do this without suffering myself? I saw that it was necessary to show them by example how, for the sake of one’s pledge, one had to undergo suffering. So it was that I took this pledge. I am aware that it carries a taint. It is likely that, because of my vow, the mill-owners may be moved by consideration for me and come to grant the workers’ [demand for] thirty-five per cent increase. My desire is that they should grant the demand only if they see its justice and not out of charity. But the natural result would be that they would do so out of charity and to that extent this pledge is one which cannot but fill me with shame. I weighed the two things, however, against each other: my sense of shame and the mill-hands’ pledge. The balance tilted in favour of the latter and I resolved, for the sake of the mill-hands, to take no thought of my shame. In doing public work, a man must be prepared to put up even with such loss of face. Thus, my pledge is not at all by way of a threat to the mill-owners; on the contrary, I wish they clearly understand this and grant the 35 per cent to the mill- hands only if they think it just to do so. To the mill-hands, too, I would say that they should go to the owners and tell them as much.

 [March 17, 1918]
 Be guided by your sense of justice rather than your desire to see that I break my fast. The latter gives me immense pleasure and, therefore, need not cause pain to anyone. The workers will profit more from what they get as a matter of justice—they will enjoy the
 
 benefit longer. Ordinary men prefer things to be plain. 35 per cent, 20 per cent, and arbitrator—we may go in for such foolishness, put up with it, to satisfy our conscience or our pride. The workers, being simple-minded, will look upon the thing as calculated deception. I should, therefore, prefer some other way, if we can find any. If you want me to accept this, I will, but I won’t have you decide the matter in haste. Let the arbitrator meet us and come to a decision right now, and let us announce the wage fixed by him; that is, 35 per cent on the first day, 20 on the second and, on the third, what the arbitrator decides. There is foolishness even in this, but things will be left in no doubt. The wage for the third day should be announced this very day.

     DEAR 	JAMNALALJI,  Magh Krishna [Before March 18, 1918]libtech_691_footnote "
231,"March 	18, 1918",ADDRESS TO ASHRAM INMATES libtech_692_footnote,"
  	I have your letter. My visit to Nagpur has been postponed. At 	present the work here is taking every moment of my time. The 	workers’ strike is going on and so is Government’s tyranny over 	the peasants in Kheda. Both are mighty tasks.  Yours,  MOHANDAS 	GANDHI  From 	a photostat of the Hindi original in Gandhiji’s hand: G.N. 2839         March 	18, 1918  	Most probably, we shall have a settlement today before ten. I am 	quite clear in my mind what it means and I see that it is something 	which should be quite unacceptable to me. It is my vow of fasting 	which is to blame. The vow is open to criticism from many points of 	view.  	This does not mean, of course, that it had very little in its favour 	and much against it; it means that, if there was much in its favour, 	there was much against it too. In so far as it affected the workers 	there was much in its favour and the results have been 	correspondingly wholesome. In so far as it bore on the mill-owners, 	it was open to objection and, to that extent, I have had to give in. 	Deny it as emphatically as I may, the people cannot but feel that 	the mill-owners have acted under pressure of my fast and the world 	at large will not believe what I say. My weak condition left the  	mill-owners  no freedom. It is against the principles of justice to 	get anything  in writing from a person or make him agree to any 	condition or obtain anything whatever under duress. A satyagrahi 	will never do so. I have had, therefore, to give in on this matter. 	A man overpowered by a sense of shame, how much, after all, can he 	do ? I put forward one modest demand after another and had to be 	content with what they     
 accepted gracefully. If I had insisted on our demand in full, they would have met it. But I could not at all bring myself to secure anything from them by putting them in such a position. If I had done anything of the kind, I would have felt that I was breaking my fast by swallowing something most repulsive; how could I, who would not take even amritlibtech_693_footnoteexcept at the proper hour, swallow such a thing?
 I feel that some of the teachings of our sacred books are the result of profound experience. Thoreau has said that, where injustice prevails, an upright man simply cannot prosper and that, where justice prevails, such a one would experience no want. Our sacred books go even further and say that, where injustice prevails, an upright man just cannot live. That is why some amongst us withdraw from all activity. They do so not because they have grown weary of active life but simply because they find it impossible to take up any activity. They see so much of hypocrisy in the world that they cannot live in it. If an honest man finds himself surrounded on all sides by  crooks,  he should either turn his back on them or be as they are. In our world, some good men take to the Himalayas or the Vindhya mountains and mortify their bodies. Some think this body to be unreal; some, believing in the immortality and omnipresence of the soul, give up their bodies on the instant and attain moksha. Some do return but only after having so purified themselves that, thereafter, even while living in the midst of the world’s hypocrisies, they can follow their own dictates. When I compare my state with that of these illuminated souls, I am such a mere pigmy that I don’t know what to say. To be sure, it is not as if I did not know the measure of my strength. But in the outside world, it is esteemed much higher than it ought to be. Every day I discover so much of hypocrisy in the world that many times I feel I just cannot go on being here. At Phoenix, I often told you that, if one day you did not find me in your midst, you should not be surprised. If this feeling comes over me, I will go where you will never be able to seek me out. In that hour, do not feel bewildered, but go on with the tasks on hand as if I were with you all the time.

 [March 18, I 918]libtech_694_footnote
 The settlement which I place before you merely upholds the workers’ pledge. There is nothing more in it. I pleaded with the mill- owners as well as I could. I asked them to grant a permanent increase of 35 per cent. They felt, however, that that would be too much. Let me say one thing. Our demand, too, was onesided. Before the struggle commenced, we had tried to ascertain their point of view, but they did not respond to our request. The mill-owners now accept the principle of arbitration. I have agreed that the matter be entrusted to an arbitratorlibtech_695_footnotelibtech_696_footnote. I shall succeed in getting 35 per cent from the arbitrator. If the arbitrator decides on something less, I will own that we had been wrong in making our demand. The mill-owners said that they had their pledge to abide by just as we had ours. I told them that they had no right to take any such pledge, but they insisted that theirs too was equally valid. I thought over the pledges of both. My fast stood in the way. I could not tell them: “I will break my fast only if you concede my demand.” I felt that this would have been cowardice on my part. I, therefore, agreed that for the present both may maintain their pledges, and what the arbitrator decides should finally prevail. Our settlement, therefore, is briefly this:
 On the first day, an increase of 35 per cent will be given in keeping with our pledge; on the second day, we get 20 per cent in keeping with the mill-owners’. From the third day till the date of the arbitrator’s award, an increase of 27_ per cent will be paid and subsequently, if the arbitrator decides on 35 per cent, the mill-owners will give us 7_ per cent more and, if he decides on 20 per cent, we shall refund 7_ per cent.
 What I have brought for you is enough to fulfil the letter of the pledge, but not its spirit. Spirit does not mean much to us and so we must rest content with the letter.
 We have taken counsel together in this struggle; therefore, do not take an oath hereafter without consulting us. He who has no
 
 experience, and has attempted nothing big, has no right to take an oath. After twenty years’ experience, I have come to the conclusion that I am qualified to take a pledge. I see that you are not yet so qualified. Do not, therefore, take an oath without consulting your seniors. If the occasion demands one, come to us, assured that we shall be prepared to die for you, as we now are. But remember that we shall help you only in respect of a pledge you have taken with our concurrence. A pledge taken in error can certainly be ignored. You have yet to learn how and when to take a pledge.libtech_697_footnote

 It appears to me that as days pass, not only Ahmedabad but the whole of India will be proud of this twenty-two days’ struggle and India will see that we can hope much from a struggle conducted in this manner. There has been no bitterness in it. I have never come across the like of it. I have had experience of many such conflicts or heard of them, but have not known any in which there was so little ill- will or bitterness as in this. I hope you will always maintain peace in the same way as you did during the strike.
 I  must  apologize to  the  employers. I  have   pained   them very  much.  My  vow  [to  fast]  was  aimed  at  you,  but   everything in  this  world  has  two  sides.  Thus,   the   vow  had   an   effect   on the employers as well, I apologize to them humbly for this, I am as much their servant as the workers’.

 LEAFLET NO. 17 VICTORY FOR BOTH
We have said in earlier leaflets that in satyagraha both the parties
 invariably succeed. He who fought for truth and attained his object would of course have won. But even he who first opposed the truth and subsequently recognized it as such and conceded it should also be considered to have won. From this point of view, because the workers’ pledge has been fulfilled, both the parties have won. The employers had taken an oath that they would not give more than 20 per cent. We have respected their oath, too. Thus the honour of both has been upheld. Let us now see what the settlement is:
  Workers 	are to 	resume work tomorrow, 	i.e., on 	the 20th; 	for that 	day they 	will get a 	35 per cent 	increase; and for the 	21st, a 	20 per cent increase.  From 	the 22nd, 	they will get an 	increase not 	exceeding 35 	per cent, 	as the arbitrator 	may decide.  Prof. 	Anandshankar Bapubhai 	Dhruva, M.A., LL.B., a 	prominent man 	of letters 	of Gujarat 	and a 	man of 	saintly character, a 	professor in 	Gujarat College 	and its 	Vice-Principal, will be the arbitrator.  The 	arbitrator should 	give his 	award within three 	months. During the 	period, workers will 	be paid 	an increase 	of 27_ 	per cent, i.e., the workers give up half of their demand and the employers half 
 
 of theirs.
  Whatever 	amount is decided 	by the 	arbitrator will be 	adjusted against 	the 27_ per cent, 	i.e., if the 	arbitrator awards 	more than 27_ per cent, 	the employers 	will give that increase 	and, if 	he awards less 	than 27_ 	per cent, the 	workers will refund the excess. 
 Two things have been accomplished by this settlement. First, the honour of the workers has been upheld; secondly, it has been accepted as a principle that any serious dispute between the two parties should be settled not by resort to a strike but by arbitration. It is not one of the terms of the settlement that in future the parties will settle their differences by arbitration; but, as the settlement has come about through arbitration, it is presumed that on a similar occasion in future also an arbitrator will be appointed. It should not be understood from this that an arbitrator will be appointed even for trifling differences. It will be humiliating to both parties if a third party has to intervene every time there is a difference between the employers and  the workers. Employers cannot tolerate that. They will not do  their business under such conditions. The world has always respected wealth and it will always demand respect. Consequently, if workers harass the employers for trifles, the relations that now obtain between them will break. We believe workers will not do anything of the kind. We must also advise them that they should never resort to a strike in thoughtless haste. We can give them no help if they go on strike without consulting us. Doubt has been raised whether we are right in claiming that our pledge has been fulfilled, since we have secured an increase of 35 per cent for one day only. This seems very much like pacifying children. This has certainly happened on some occasions but not in this case. We have accepted 35 per cent for one day deliberately as the best thing to do in the circumstances. “We will not resume work without securing a 35 per cent increase” may mean one of two things; one, that we will not accept anything less than a 35 per cent increase at any time and, two, that we will resume work with a 35 per cent increase, it being enough even if we get it just for a day. Those who may have decided that it is just to demand a permanent increase of 35 per cent and feel sure that they have strength in plenty to fight till they get it will consider their pledge fulfilled only when they get what they want. But that was not what we had resolved. We were always ready to accept an arbitrator’s decision. The figure of 35 per cent was fixed unilaterally. Before we advised workers to demand 35 per cent, we wanted to hear from the employers themselves their
 view of the matter. Unfortunately, we did not succeed. So we examined their side as best we could and advised a demand for 35 per cent. But we cannot claim that the figure of 35 per cent was not open to question. We have never said so. If the employers prove that we are mistaken, we may certainly advise workers to accept less. Hence, if the arbitrator decides in favour of a smaller increase and we abide by his decision, our pledge will not have been violated. We always accepted the principle of arbitration. We think we were not wrong in deciding upon a 35 per cent increase; we hope, therefore, that this increase will be granted. If, however, we discover that the figure was wrong, we should willingly accept less.
 We ourselves have asked for three months’ time. Employers were willing to accept a fortnight’s time-limit. We have, however, to make some inquiries in Bombay to prove the justice of our demand. It is also very necessary to show to the arbitrator the conditions prevailing here and to acquaint him fully with the living conditions of workers. Without such information, he cannot have a complete idea. Such detailed work cannot be completed in a few days. We shall see, however, that the work is completed as speedily as possible.
 Some workers wanted to be paid for the period of the lock-out. We must say that we are not entitled to ask for this. Since we did not accept the 20 per cent increase, either a strike or a lock-out became necessary. In suffering for 22 days, we did what was merely our duty and was in our own interest. We have had our reward for  that  suffering, namely, this settlement. How can we now ask for wages for the period of the lock-out? Such demand [if accepted] would amount to our having fought the struggle with the employers’ money. The workers should be ashamed to entertain such an idea. A warrior must fight on his own strength. Again, the employers had paid all wages due to the workmen before the lock-out, so that it can be said that workers now begin a new term of employment. They should consider all these points and give up the idea of asking for wages for the period of the lock-out.
 The wages will be due only after twenty days. What will be the workers’ condition in the meantime? Many may not have a pie left with them. Those who are in need of assistance before the date of payment should politely request their employers for it and we are sure they will make some provision.
The workers should note that their condition hereafter will
 
 depend on the quality of their work. If they work  sincerely, obediently and with energy, they will win the employers’ goodwill and be helped by them in a great many ways. It would be a mistake to believe that anything could be secured only through us. We are prepared to serve labour in their time of difficulty, but their interests will be best served if they look upon the employers as their parents and approach them for all that they want.
 The need now is for peace. Small inconveniences should be tolerated.
 If you permit us, we should like to help some of you to overcome your bad habits. We want to provide facilities for your and your children’s education. We want to see all-round improvement in you, in your morals, in your and your children’s health, and in your economic condition. If you permit us, we will work amongst you towards this end.
 The greatest victory for the workers lies in this—God has kept their honour inviolate. He whose honour is preserved has secured all else. Even imperial rule over the world is as dust, if gained at the sacrifice of one’s honour.

I don’t say this in anger 	but because I think it right. You are incapable of remembering what 	you might have said earlier. I feel, therefore, that for the present 	you should follow your own independent way. Only so will you 	prosper. You will sink low if you treat even my advice as an order 	and believe that you must not depart from it ever so little. The 	best course for you, it seems to me, is to be engrossed in your Home 	Rule work, and I 
 hope that is the course you will adopt. Rest assured I shall not be angry with you for being occupied with conferences, etc. You may also approach me for advice when you know the difference between my advice and my order. I write this letter entirely for your peace of mind, not to make you unhappy.

            DEAR 	MR. PRATT,          MIRZAPUR,  March 	20, 1918 
  	Messages have been coming to me, and one has arrived just this very 	moment, to the effect that in several villages Talatis are putting 	undue pressure upon the villagers to pay the dues. Representations 	have come from Matar Taluka asking me to go over to the District and 	speak to the people. From everywhere in the Kaira District people 	have been coming in and asking for some public pronouncement. As you 	are aware beyond speaking to the people as to what they ought to do 	I have scrupulously refrained from making any public announcement or 	inviting public agitation. Indeed I have gone so far as to tell 	friends on whom I exercise any influence to avoid discussion in the 	press. Before making public declaration and holding meetings, etc., 	I do want to make a final appeal to you. Is it impossible to anounce 	a general suspension of the collection of the second instalment, 	practically for the whole District, coupled with a  declaration to 	the effect that the Government would  still  expect holders of 	sanadia land to pay the dues in full? This will avoid a 	ferment and it will be a graceful concession which I verily believe 	is demanded by the circumstances of the case.libtech_700_footnote I 	am at your service should you want it.

 I have had occasion before now to introduce Mr. Andrews to you. He can best be described as a rishi for he has all the qualities of a holy sage. He has recently returned from Fiji, where he went on a mission that concerns us. While in Fiji, he did not put up in any hotel or with any well-to-do person; he lived among the labourers, in their own houses, and studied their manner of living. We have, at present, the Kheda affair on hand. I am now in a position to tell you on the basis of my own investigation that, in some of the talukas of that district, the crop has been less than four annas. On the other hand, I am in a great hurry to leave for Delhi, the occasion being  quite  urgent. I should not, however, like the work in Kheda district to be delayed and I am sure you will be glad to hear that Mr. Andrews has taken it up as his own for the time being. He is leaving today for Bombay to see His Excellency the Governor. He will, on my behalf, place certain facts before him and also convey my request. If anything comes of this, all right; otherwise he will be in Nadiad on Sunday next. Thus, he has started working for our cause as well.libtech_702_footnote
 I was happy to hear Mr. Andrews speak in Hindi. I was not responsible for that, however. He speaks very well in English also; what need one say of a Cambridge don’s English? If he were addressing a meeting of students on Milton or Shakespeare, it would be quite right for him to speak in English. The first time Mr. Andrews went to Fiji,libtech_703_footnotelibtech_704_footnotehe was accompanied by Mr. Pearson and on the second occasion he went alone. It was I who advised him to go there to observe things, lest a system as harmful as indenture came to replace it. The hospitals Mr. Andrews mentioned are in fact no hospitals but engines of oppression, as one might say, for the plight of Indian women in these hospitals is miserable indeed. When Mr. Andrews asked the Government to open hospitals for women in that country, it replied that it was for the planters to do so and the latter, on their part, said that the Government would attend to the matter when the system
 
 of indenture had ended. In schools, children receive instruction in the Christian faith from the very start. This is not good for Hindu and Muslim children. Moreover, the education is through the medium of English and, therefore, our people gain little from it. The same thing obtains in Natal. Indian teachers are not available there, nor in Fiji. We can be of help in this matter. If a few men who will be satisfied with a small income go over to these places as teachers, that will be of some help. One may also help by giving anything from a pie to a hundred thousand rupees. The expenses on the Australian lady who has volunteered to go to Fiji will, for the time being, be borne by Mr. Andrews. He will get some assistance from the Imperial Citizenship Association, but further help will be needed. I don’t know how to estimate the value of all these services of Mr. Andrews. He is a man of retiring disposition and service of others is his one mission in life. I have deliberately called him a rishi. A great man like him, given to serving others, we cannot thank enough.

 March 22, 1918
 The occasion which has brought us here is so important that it will be enshrined in your memory for ever. For some months past, an agitation has been going on in this district for securing the suspension of land revenue. The crops have been generally less than four annas this year and so the collection of revenue ought to be suspended.
 In compliance with the Resolution of the Gujarat Sabha, I toured a number of villages and inquired personally into the matter. My co- workers did the same. The available evidence goes to show that the crops do not exceed four annas in the district as a whole. The Government, too, claims to have made an inquiry, but it is  not  prepared to give the needed relief to the farmers. It has decided to collect the dues. If people do not pay, it has threatened to adopt coercive measures. Notices have been issued for the collection of
 
 chothailibtech_706_footnotelibtech_707_footnoteand   for   the   confiscation   of   holdings.   Complaints   of oppression by Talatis are also being received. I have only this to say to the Talatis and chiefs of villages who are present at this meeting: “Let them by all means be loyal to the Government but that loyalty does not lie in oppressing [the people].” The land revenue must be realized, as ordered, but the Government certainly would not ask them to beat the people. Surely, the law can never authorize such an order. If there should be any such order, the Talatis are not bound to obey it. Anyone acting in this manner will be committing treason against the country, the State and God. They may execute the orders of superiors loyally, but they have no right to molest the people.
 If they are convinced that the crop is below four annas they should say so boldly to their superior officers. There are two reasons why I give you this advice. It has been the system of Government to assert that what they have said is true. In a talk with Lord Willingdon I came to know his opinion that the people of India do not give out their correct views; they are not bold enough to say what they mean; they say anything which pleases the other party; they are lacking in moral courage.libtech_708_footnote
 What are the people to do in this situation? Those whose crops are less than four annas should tell the Government politely: “It is not possible for us to submit to this injustice; when the crops have, in fact, failed, we cannot pay up our dues and thereby prove ourselves liars. You may realize the dues by force if you choose.” It is to give you this advice that this meeting has been called.
 This is a very beautiful district. Its people has delightful trees, the like of which I have in this country except in Bihar.
 But Bihar has natural beauty, while in this district beauty has been achieved by hard work and perseverance. This is the only district which can boast of intelligent and industrious agriculturists.  They  have turned their land into a lovely orchard. They can be justly proud of their achievement. It does not, however, follow that they may be called upon to pay land revenue even when their crops have failed. This industrious section of the district’s population is steadily growing poorer and many have been compelled to give up agriculture and take to daily labour. This is a distressing thing for anyone to have to do. A country in which the farmers find this necessary is in for a bad time.
 
 In fact revenue should be paid from the sale value of the crops; it is intolerable, when the crops have failed, that  the  Government should recover it forcibly. But, in this country, it has become  a  practice with the Government to insist that it is always in the right. It is intolerable that, however just the people’s case,  the  Government should have its own way. Justice must prevail and injustice yield. The agriculturists claim, and the evidence collected by  those  who conducted the inquiry bears them out, that the crops have failed and yet the Government insists that they have been plentiful. In the circumstances, the people have every right to tell the Government that, surely, they could see and judge things as well as the Government, and that they would not submit to injustice done by the officers. That people would tell lies, for the sake of saving at the most a year’s interest by asking for a postponement of the assessment, is inconceivable. That the officers should suggest anything of the kind is intolerable. We must show, therefore, that our case is just; placed in the situation that we are, I would tell you that, if the Government does not accept our request, we should declare plainly that we shall not pay land revenue and will be prepared to take the consequences.
 All nations which have risen have done so through suffering. If the people have to sacrifice their land, they should be ready to do so and suffer. Some will even argue that this is treason or rebellion; it is nothing of the kind. It means suffering ourselves, no treason. When the crops have failed, to pay up the dues out of fear is cowardice. We are human beings, not animals. To refuse a thing firmly and plainly in the name of truth—that is satyagraha.
 We have assembled today to do the spade-work for satyagraha. We don’t propose to pay up the revenue to the Government; we want to fight it out. We have to prepare ourselves, then, for the suffering that may follow. We must visualize what we shall have to face:
  The 	Government may 	recover the 	assessment by 	selling our 	cattle and our movable property. It 	may impose fines. It 	may confiscate jagirs.  It 	may even put people 	in jail 	on the 	ground that 	they are defiantlibtech_709_footnotelibtech_710_footnote. 
The word has been used by the Government and I don’t like it.
 
 How can they say that you are defiant merely because you speak the truth? Indeed, such a person is brave, not defiant. It is an act of bravery, and no defiance, for a man who, though he can afford to pay, refuses to do so in the interests of the poor. If in the process this man has to leave the village for ever, he will do so; he alone may take the pledge today who is ready for this.
 It is very difficult to take the pledge of satyagraha; it is still more difficult to carry out one. I cannot bear to think of any one breaking a pledge once taken, forsaking his God. It would cause me very great pain, indeed, if you took a pledge which you did not mean to keep. In the intensity of my suffering, I may take an extreme step. I may have to fast. I don’t suffer when I fast; fasting hurts me less than that people should deceive me by breaking their  pledge.  In satyagraha, a pledge is the most valuable thing of all; it must be kept up to the very end. A pledge taken in God’s name must never be broken. I would not hesitate to sacrifice my life if that might ensure that thousands would keep their pledge. Those who want to fight must make up their minds once for all. I would not mind very much if people just said that they would hold out as long as possible but that they were not sure of themselves in case of severe repression. I would far rather that they cut my throat than that they break my heart by betraying their pledge. The man who cuts my throat, I would pray to God to forgive, but I would not forgive the other man.
 I would tell you, therefore, in all humility, whatever you decide, do so with full thought and consideration. Only those who are determined to carry their decision through  are able to raise  themselves. When you have so raised yourselves, the Government will respect you, for it will know then, that it was dealing with men who would honour their plighted word and not betray it. A man who breaks his word can do no service to his country,  or  to  his Government or to God.
 I want, therefore, to know whether you agree; I ask you: “Are you ready to fight ?” I shall prepare a written pledge. Those friends who wish to take it should come to the Ashram and give their signatures. I have only one request: “Suffer everything and honour the pledge; refuse to pay the revenue and prove to the Government thereby that you are prepared for sacrifices.” The Government cannot use force against everyone.libtech_711_footnote
 
 I advise those who have sanadia lands to pay the assessment. Mr. Andrews, who has gone to interview the Governor, sends me a wire to go to Delhi to see him. Mr. Andrews and Mr. Vallabhbhai (Patel) will carry on further work here. I am going to Delhi in connection with the work of Mahomed Ali and Shaukat Ali.

 Our village has had crops under four annas. We therefore requested the Government to postpone collection to the next year, but they did not do so. We the undersigned therefore solemnly declare that we shall not pay the assessment for the year whether it be wholly or in part; we shall leave it to the Government to take any legal steps they choose to enforce recovery of the same and we shall undergo all the sufferings that this may involve. We shall also allow our lands to be confiscated should they do so. But we shall not by voluntary payment allow ourselves to be regarded as liars and thus lose our self- respect. If the Government would graciously postpone for all the remaining villages collection of the balance of the revenue, we, who can afford it, would be prepared to pay up revenue, whether it be in full or in part. The reason why the well-to-do amongst us would not pay is that, if they do, the needy ones would, out of fright, sell their chattels or incur debts and pay the revenue and thus suffer. We believe that it is the duty of the well-to-do to protect the needy against such a plight.

 TO
 THE PRIVATE SECRETARY TO
 HIS EXCELLENCY THE VICEROY
 I can’t describe to you how much disturbed I have been over this affair of Ali brothers, but our talk of this morning has given me much comfort and relief. It was a pleasure to see that you had grasped my point in a moment. It would be a wonderful act on the part of the Government if, without the knowledge of anybody, an order was sent for their discharge. Such a manner of discharging them would avoid all delirious demonstration that would otherwise inevitably take place to receive them.
These are some of the reasons for their discharge:
  If 	they are 	kept interned 	in order 	that they may not do 	anything hostile 	to the 	Government, the 	idea is 	frustrated because 	they do 	correspond with, 	and otherwise 	send messages to, whomsoever they choose.  Their 	detention only increases 	their influence 	 day  after 	day.  Their 	detention embitters the 	feelings of 	their friends 	and deepens 	the discontent 	of Mahomedans 	in general, 	which the 	Hindus too 	share to 	a certain extent.  Moulana 	Abdul Bari Saheb is 	a man 	wielding tremendous 	power over thousands 	of Mussalmans. 	He is their 	spiritual adviser and 	the Government would 	make him theirs 	by releasing the brothers.  The 	brothers are, 	so far 	as I 	am aware, 	men with 	a strong 	will, of 	noble birth, men 	of culture and 	learning, possessing 	great influence over the 	educated Mahomedans, 	open- minded 	and straightforward. 	It was 	a great 	mistake to have 	interned them. Surely 	the Government 	have ever need of 	such men 	on their side. 	Lastly in my humble 	opinion nothing 	can possibly 	be gained 	by keeping them 	under detention. 
 It will be worthy of a great Government to discharge them whilst all the clamour and agitation for their release are under suspense.
 If my presence is wanted I shall be at His Excellency’s service any momentlibtech_713_footnoteI am required.
 Please favour me with a reply. Between the 29th and 31st I shall be in Indore presiding over the deliberations of the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan. Thereafter at Ahmedabad.

THE DUTY OF THE RYOTS OF KAIRA DISTRICT
 As the crops in the Kaira district have been poor, that is to say, below 4 annas in most of the villages, the Government rule is that the collection of Land Revenue this year should be postponed. Repeated appeals have been made to the Government on behalf of the ryots to make this postponement. On behalf of the people the Gujarat Sabha, the honourable Messrs G. K. Parekh and V. J. Patel and Messrs Deodhar, Amritlal Thakkar and Joshi of the Servants of India Society made inquiries about the crops and all came to the conclusions that the Kharif crop practically came to nothing. With the help of many responsible and respectable assistants, I also made minute inquiries into the crops of about 400 villages and found the same thing that, in almost all the villages the anna valuation was below four annas. I also saw that many of the ryots had no money, and that the granaries of many were empty; further that many poor people were importing maize whole-sale from outside in place of grain grown in this district and living on that. I evensaw this, that wherever the people had paid
 
 
 up the Land Revenue they had done so through fear of the Talati, etc. At several places people had paid the land revenue by selling their trees, etc. It also came to my notice that the people were groaning under the burden of extremely high prices. Further the people, through fear of plague, are living in huts in a state of anxiety.libtech_715_footnoteAll these facts have been explained to the Collector and the Commissioner; they have made certain concessions but these are of no account in comparison with the necessities of the people. In such circumstances, only one piece of advice can be given to the people, and it is this that in order to prove their truthfulness, they should not pay the land revenue but let Government collect the land revenue by selling their property if it so desires. It is more advisable to lose all by not paying the land revenue than to pay it up through fear and so prove false. At any rate, this is my definite advice to the people, they should certainly not pay the land revenue and they should bear all the suffering and oppressions (zulum) that may result. Government is bound to respect popular opinion, and it is only if people act in this way that Government will learn to respect it. Many leading gentlemen are ready to assist the people in this struggle, and even if anyone is turned out of house and home, arrangements have been made for his food and lodging. Forms of pledge for the signatures of those who have courage enough not to pay the assessment have already been issued, and it is hoped that all agriculturists who have not paid will sign it. My advice is to think well before signing, but it should be remembered that after signing whatever may happen there can be no going back.

243,,LETTER TO THE PRESSlibtech_716_footnote,"
    
 
 
NADIAD
 
  	Perhaps I owe an explanation to the public with regard to my recent 	fast. Some friends consider the action to have been silly, others 	cowardly and some others still worse. In my opinion, I would have 	been untrue to my Maker and to the cause I was espousing, if I had 	acted otherwise.  	When over a month ago I reached Bombay, I was told that Ahmedabad 	mill-hands had threatened a strike and violence if the bonus that 	was given to them during the plague was withdrawn. I was asked to 	intervene and I consented. Owing to the plague the men were getting 	as much as 70 per cent bonus since August last. An attempt to recall 	that bonus had resulted in grave dissatisfaction among the 	labourers. When it was almost too late, the mill-owners offered in 	the place of the plague bonus and for the sake of the high prices a 	rise of 20 percent. The labourers were unsatisfied. The matter was 	referred to arbitration, Mr. Chatfield, the collector, being the 	umpire. The men in some mills however struck work. The owners, 	thinking that they had done so without just cause, withdrew from the 	arbitration and declared a general lock-out to be continued till the 	labourers were exhausted into accepting 20 per cent increase they 	had offered.  Messrs Shankarlal Banker, V. J. Patel and I, the 	arbitrators appointed on behalf of the labourers thought that they 	were to be demoralized if we did not act promptly and decisively. 	We, therefore, investigated the question of increase they had 	offered. We sought the mill-owners’ assistance. They would not 	give it. Their one purpose was to organize themselves into a 	combination that could fight a similar combination of their 	employees. One-sided technically though our investigation was, we 	endeavoured to examine the mill-owners’ side and came to the 	conclusion that a 35 percent increase was fair. Before announcing 	the figure to the mill-hands, we informed the employers of the 	result    
 of our inquiry and told them that we would correct ourselves if they could show any error. The latter would not co-operate. They sent a reply saying as much, but they pointed out in it that the rate of increase granted by the Government as also the employers in Bombay was much less than the one contemplated by us. I felt that the addendum was beside the point and at a huge meetinglibtech_717_footnoteannounced 35 per cent for the mill-hands’ acceptance. Be it noted that the plague bonus amounted to 70 per cent of their wages and they had declared their intention of accepting not less than 50 per cent as high prices increase. They were now called upon to accept the mean (the fixing of the mean was quite an accident) between the mill-owners 20 per cent, and their own 50 per cent. After some grumbling, the  meeting accepted the 35 per cent increase, it always being understood that they would recognize, at the same time, the principle of arbitration whenever the mill-owners’ did so. From that time forward, i.e., 26th February last, day after day thousands of people gathered together under the shade of a tree outside the city walls, people walking long distances in many cases, and solemnly repeated their determination in the name of God not to accept anything less than 35 per cent. No pecuniary assistance was given to them. It was easy enough to understand that many must suffer from the pangs of starvation and that they could not, while they were without employment, get any credit. We who were helping them came, on the other hand, to the conclusion that we would only spoil them if we collected public funds and utilized them for feeding them unless the able-bodied among them were ready to perform bread labour. It was a difficult task to persuade men, who have worked at machines, to shoulder baskets of sand or bricks. They came but they did so grudgingly. The mill- owners hardened their hearts. They were equally determined not to go beyond 20 per cent and they appointed emissaries to persuade the men to give in. Even during the early part of the lock-out, whilst we had declined to help those who would not work, we had assured them that we would feed and clothe ourselves after feeding and clothing them. Twenty-two days had passed by. Hunger and the mill-owners’ emissaries were producing their effect and Satan was whispering to the men that there was no such thing as God on earth who would help them and that vows were dodges resorted to by weaklings. One morning instead of an eager and enthusiastic crowd of 5 to 10
 
 thousand men with determination written on their faces, I met a body of 2000 men with despair written on their faces. We had just heard that mill-hands living in a particular chawl had declined to attend the meeting, were preparing to go to work and accept 20 per cent increase and were taunting us (I think very properly) that it was very well for us who had motors at our disposal and plenty of food, to attend their meetings and advise staunchness even unto death. What was I to do? I held the cause to be just. I believe in God as I believe that I am writing this letter. I believe in the necessity of the performance of one’s promise at all costs. I knew that the men before us were God-fearing men, but that the long-drawn-out lock-out or strike was putting an undue strain upon them. I had the knowledge before me during my extensive travels in India, hundreds of people were found who as readily broke a promise as they made them. I knew, too, that the best of us have but a vague and indistinct belief in soul-force and in God. I felt that it was a sacred moment for me, my faith was on the anvil, and   I had no hesitation to rising and declaring to the men that a breach of their vow so solemnly taken was unendurable by me and that I would not take any food until they had the 35 per cent increase given or until they had fallen. A meeting that was up to now unlike the former meetings, totally unresponsive, woke up as if by magic. Tears trickled down the cheeks of every one of them and men after men rose up saying that they would never go to the mills unless they got the increase and that they would go about the city and steal the hearts of those who had not attended the meeting. It was a privilege to witness the demonstration of the efficacy of truth and love. Every one immediately realized that the protecting power of God was as much with us today as it used to be in the days of yore. I am not sorry for the vow but with the belief that I have, I would have been unworthy of the trust undertaken by me, if I had done anything less. Before I took the vow I knew that there were serious defects about it. For me to take such a vow in order to affect in any shape or form the decision of the mill-owners would be cowardly injustice done to them and that  I would prove myself unfit for the friendship which I had the privilege of enjoying with some of them. I knew that I ran the risk of being misunderstood. I could not prevent my fast from affecting their decision. Their knowledge, moreover, put a responsibility  on  me which I was ill able to bear. From now I disabled myself from gaining concessions for the men, which ordinarily, in a struggle such as this, I would be entirely justified in securing. I knew, too, that I would have
 to be satisfied with the minimum I could get from the mill-owners and with a fulfilment of the letter of the men’s vow rather than its spirit and so hath it happened. I put the effect of my vow in one scale and the merits of it in the other. There are hardly any acts of human beings which are free from all taint. Mine, I know, was exceptionally tainted but I preferred the ignominy of having unworthily compromised by my vow the position and independence of the mill- owners rather than that it should be said by posterity that 10,000 men had suddenly broken a vow which they had for over twenty days solemnly taken and repeated in the name of God. I  am  fully convinced that no body of men can make themselves into a nation or perform great tasks unless they become as true as steel and unless their promises come to be regarded by the world like the law of the Medes and Persians, inflexible and unbreakable, and whatever may be the verdict of friends, so far as I can think at present,  on  given occasions I should not hesitate in future to repeat the humble performance which I have taken the liberty of describing in this communication.
 I cannot conclude this letter without mentioning two names of whom India has every reason to be proud. The mill-owners were represented by Mr. Ambalal Sarabhai who is a gentlemen in every sense of the term. He is a man of culture and equally great abilities. He adds to these qualities a resolute will. The mill-hands were represented by his sister Anasuyabehn. She possesses a heart of gold. She is full of pity for the poor. The mill-hands adore her. Her word is law with them. I have not known a struggle fought with so little bitterness and such courtesy on either side. This happy result is principally due to the connections with it of Mr. Ambalal Sarabhai and Anasuyabehn.

 NADIAD,
 March 28, 1918
 
 In the district of Kheda, the crops for the year 1917-18 have, by common admission, proved a partial failure. Under the  Revenue rules
 
 if the crops are under four annas, the cultivators are entitled to full suspension of the Revenue assessment for the year; if the crops are under six annas, half the amount of assessment is suspended. So far as I am aware, the Government have been pleased to grant  full suspension with regard to one village out of every 600, and half- suspension in the case of over 103 villages. It is claimed on behalf of the ryots that the suspension is not at all adequate to the actuality. The government contended that in the vast majority of villages, crops have been over six annas. The only question before at issue is, whether the crops have been under four annas or six annas, as the case may be, or over the latter figure. Government valuation is in the first instance made by the Talatis assisted by the chief men of the villages concerned. As a rule, no check on thier figures is  considered necessary, for it is only during partial failure that Government valuation of crops may have been challenged. The Talatis are as a class obsequious, unscrupulous and tyrannical. The chief men are especially selected for their docility. The Talatis’ one aim is naturally to collect full assessment as promptly as possible. We sometimes read accounts of assiduous Talatis having been awarded pugree for making full collection. In applying to the Talatis the adjectives I have given, I wish to cast no reflections on them as men. I merely state the fact. The Talatis are not born; they are made; and rent-collectors all the world over have to cultivate a callousness without which they could not do their work to the satisfaction of their masters. It is impossible for me to reproduce the graphic description given by the ryots of the rent collectors which the Talatis chiefly are. My purpose in dealing with the Talatis is to show that the Governments valuation of the crops is derived in the first instance from the tainted source and is presumably biased against the ryots. As against their valuation, we have the universal testimony of ryots, high and low, some of whom are men of position and considerable wealth, who have a reputation to lose and who have nothing to gain by exaggeration except the  odium  of Talatis and possibly higher officials. I wish to state at once that behind this movement there is no desire to discredit the Government, or an individual official. The movement is intended to assert the right of the people to be effectively heard in matters concerning themselves.
 It is known to the public that the Hon’ble Mr. G. K. Parekh and Mr. V. J. Patel, invited and assisted by the Gujarat Sabha, carried on investigations as also Messrs Deodhar, Joshi and Thakkar of the Servants of India Society. Their investigation was necessary
 preliminary and brief and therefore confined to a few villages only. But the result of their inquiry went to show that the crops in the majority of cases was under four annas. As their investigation, not being extensive enough, was capable of being challenged, and it was challenged. I undertook a full inquiry with the assistance of over 20 capable, experienced and impartial men of influence and status. I personally visited over 50 villages and met as many men  in  the villages as I could, inspected in these villages most of the fields belonging to them and after a searching cross-examination of the villagers, came to the conclusion that their crops were under four annas. I found that among the men who surrounded me, there were present those who were ready to check exaggerations and wild statements. Men knew what was at stake if they departed from the truth. As to the rabi crops and the still standing Kharif crops, I was able by the evidence of my own eyes to check the statements of the agriculturists. The method adopted by my co-workers were exactly the same. In this manner nearly 400 villages were examined and with but a few exceptions, crops were found to be under four annas, and only in three cases they were found to be over six annas. The method adopted by us was, so far as the Kharif crops were concerned, to ascertain the actual yield of the whole of the crops of individual villages and the possible yield of the same village in a normal year. Assuming the truth of the statements made by them, this is admittedly an absolute test, and any other method that would bring about the same result must be rejected as untrue and unscientific; and as I have already remarked, all probability of exaggeration was avoided in the above-named investigation. As to the standing rabi crops, there was the eye estimate and it was tested by the method above mentioned. The Government method is an eye estimate and therefore a matter largely of guess-work. It is moreover open to fundamental objections which I have endeavoured to set forth in a letter to the Collector of the District. I request him to treat Vadthal--a well-known and ordinary well-to-do village of the district with the railway line passing by it and which is near a trade centre--as a test case and I suggest that if the crops were in that village proved to be under four annas, as I hold they were, it might be assumed that in other villages less fortunately situated, crops were not likely to be more than four annas. I have added to my request a suggestion that I should be permitted to be present at the inquiry. He made the inquiry but rejected  my suggestion and therefore it proved to be one-sided. The Collector has made an elaborate report on the crops of that village which, in my opinion, I have successfully challenged. The original Government valuation, I understand, was twelve annas, the Collector’s minimum
 valuation is seven annas. If the probably wrong methods of valuation to which I have drawn attention and which have been adopted by the Collector are allowed for, the valuation according  to  his  own reckoning would come under six annas and according to the agriculturists it would be under four annas. Both the report and my answer are too technical to be of value to the public. But I have suggested that, as both the Government and agriculturists hold themselves in the right, if the Government have  any  regard  for popular opinion, they should appoint an impartial committee  of inquiry with the cultivators’ representatives upon it, or gracefully accept the popular view. The Government have rejected both the suggestions and insist upon  applying coercive measures for the collection of revenue. It may be mentioned that these measures have never been totally suspended and in many cases the ryots have paid simply under pressure. The Talatis have taken away cattle and have returned them only after the payment of assessment. In one case, I witnessed a painful incident. A man having a milch buffalo taken away from him and it was only on my happening to go to the village that the buffalo was released; this buffalo was the most valuable property the man possessed and a source of daily bread for him. Scores of such cases have already happened and many more will no doubt happen hereafter if the public opinion is not ranged on the side of the people. Every means of seeking redress by prayers has been exhausted. Interviews with Collector, the Commissioner and His Excellency have taken place. The final suggestion that was made is this; Although in the majority of cases, people are entitled to full suspension, half suspension should be granted throughout the district except for villages which show, by common consent, crops over six annas. Such a gracious concession may be accompanied by a declaration that the Government would expect those who have ready means voluntarily to pay the dues, we the workers on our part undertaking to persuade such people to pay up the Government dues. This will leave only the poorest people untouched. I venture to submit that acceptance of this suggestion can only bring credit and strength to the Government. Resistance of popular will can only produce discontent which, in the case of fear-stricken peasantry such as of Kaira, can only find an underground passage and thus demoralize them. The present movement is an attempt to get out of such a false position, humiliating alike for the Government and the people. And how do the Government propose to assert their position and so-called prestige? They have a Revenue Code giving them unlimited powers without a right of appeal to the ryots against the decisions of the Revenue Authorities. Exercise of these powers in a case like the one
 before us, in which the ryots are fighting for a principle and the authorities for prestige, would be a prostitution of justice, of a disavowal of all fair play. These powers are:
   Right 			of summary execution.  Right 			of exacting a 			quarter of 			the assessment as 			punishment.  Right 			of confiscation 			of land, 			not merely 			rayatwari but 			even inami or 			sanadia, 			and the right 			of keeping 			a man 			under hajat.   
 Those remedies may be applied singly or all together, and unbelievable though it may seem to the public, it may be mentioned that the notices of the application of all these remedies but the last have been issued. Thus a man owning two hundred acres of land in perpetuity and valued at thousands of rupees, paying a small assessment rate, may at will of the authority lose the whole of it, because for the sake of principal he respectfully refuses voluntarily to pay the assessment himself and is prepared meekly but under strong protest to penalties that may be inflicted by law. Surely vindictive confiscation of property ought not to be the reward for orderly disobedience which, properly handled, can only result in progress all roung and in giving the Government a bold and frank peasantry with  a will of its own.
 I venture to invite the Press and the public to assist these cultivators of Kaira who have dared to enter up a fight for what they consider is just and right. Let the public remember this also that unprecedentedly severe plague has decimated the population of Kaira. People are living outside their homes in specially prepared thatched cottages at considerable expense to themselves. In some villages mortality has been tremendous. Prices areruling high of which, owing to the failure of crops, they can but take little advantage and have to suffer all the disadvantages thereof. It is not money they want so much as the voice of a strong unanimous and emphatic public opinion.libtech_720_footnote

[INDORE,
     BROTHERS 	AND SISTERS,  March 	29, 1918] 
  	Our most venerable and selfless leader Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya 	has not found it possible to attend this conference. I had requested 	him to come if he could and he promised to do so. But though he has 	not been able to come he has sent us a letter. I was sure that in 	case he did not come, he would send a letter stating his views, and 	it would be possible for me to read it out to you. I have received 	the letter today. I had asked the reception committee to secure 	views of scholars on two questions in regard to Hindi. Panditji in 	his letter has replied to these two questions.libtech_722_footnote  	The question of language presents a big and indeed a very important 	problem. Even if all the leaders were to devote themselves entirely 	to this task turning away from everything else, they well may. If on 	the other hand, we were to regard it as of secondary importance only 	and to direct our attention away from it then all the enthusiasm 	which people now feel for it and the keen interest they are taking 	in it at present would be in vain.  	Language is like our mother. In fact I have no real interest in this 	sort of a conference. It will be a three days’ pageant after which 	we shall disperse, go away to our respective places and forget all 	that we said or heard. What is needed is the urge and the resolve to 	do things. The president’s speech cannot give you that urge. It is 	something which you have to create for yourselves. One  of  the  	charges made against us is that our language lacks spirit. Where 	there is no knowledge there is no spirit. We have neither the urge 	to know nor to do things. It is only when we acquire dynamic energy 	that our people and our language also will acquire it. We cannot get 	the freedom we want through a foreign language for the simple reason 	that we are not able to use it effectively. I am pleased to know 	that in Indore you carry on all your dealings through Hindi. But – 	excuse me please –the letter I have received from your Chief 	Minister is in     
 English. The people of Indore perhaps do not know—but I will tell them—that here the courts entertain petitions written in English. I ask why it should be so in Indore. I admit that this movement—the movement for the adoption of Hindi—cannot yet succeed in British India, but there is no reason why it should not succeed in the Indian States. The educated classes, as Pandit Malaviyaji has pointed out in his letter, have unfortunately fallen under the spell of English and have developed a distaste for their own mother tongue,. The milk one gets from the former is adulterated with water and contaminated with poison, while that from the latter is pure. It is impossible to make any advance without this pure milk. But a blind person cannot see and a slave does not know how to break his fetters. We have been living under the spell of the English now for the past fifty years. In the result our people have remained steeped in ignorance. The conference must give special attention to this part of the problem. We should see that within a year conditions are created when not a word of English will be heard in any of our political or social conferences, in the Congress, in the provincial assemblies and the like. Let us abandon the use of English entirely. English has attained the position of a universal language. But that is because the English have spread and established themselves throughout the world. As soon as they lose that position, English will shrink in its extent. We should no more neglect and thus destroy our own language. The English insist on  speaking their mother tongue and using it for all their purposes. Let us do the same and thus raise Hindi to the high status of a national language. Only thus shall we discharge our duty to it. Now I will read out my written speech.
 
 MR. PRESIDENT, DELEGATES, BROTHERS AND SISTERS,
 You have done me great honour in conferring on me the presidentship of this conference. I know only too well that from the point of view of the knowledge of Hindi, my qualifications for this honour are almost nil. The only thing which may be said to qualify me for it is my boundless love of Hindi. I hope that I would always be able to pass this test of love.
 The extent of a particular literature can only be reckoned on the basis of the region where that language is spoken. If the region of Hindi remains confined to the Northern part of India, the extent of its literature must remain limited. But in case it becomes a national language, the expanse of its literature will become as wide as the
 
 country. As the people speaking a particular language,  so  the language. If we want that high-souled men from the East and the West, from the North and the South, should come to take a dip in the sea of this language, it is obvious that the sea must acquire sufficient importance. Therefore the place of Hindi from the point of view of developing a national literature needs to be considered.
 It is necessary to give some thought to the definition of the Hindi language. I have often said that Hindi is that language which is spoken in the North by both Hindus and Muslims and which is written either in the Nagari or the Persian script. This Hindi is neither too Sanskritized nor too Persianized. The sweetness which I find in the village Hindi is found neither in the speech of the Muslims of Lucknow nor in that of the Hindu pundits of Prayag. The language which is easily understood by the masses is the best. All can easily follow the village Hindi. The source of the river of language lies in the Himalayas of the people. It will always be so. The Ganga arising with the village Hindi which will flow on for ever, while the Sanskritized and Persianized Hindi will dry up and fade away, as does a rivulet springing from a small hillock.
 The distinction made between Hindus and Muslims is unreal. The same unreality is found in the distinction between Hindi and Urdu. It is unnecessary for Hindus to reject Persian words and for Muslims to reject Sanskrit words from their speech. A harmonious blend of the two will be as beautiful as the confluence of the Ganga and Yamuna and last for ever. I hope that we will not waste our energy and weaken our strength by entering into the Hindi-Urdu controversy. There is, no doubt, difficulty in regard to script. As things  are, Muslims will patronize the Arabic script, while Hindus will mostly use the Nagari script. Both scripts will therefore have to be accorded their due places. Officials must know both scripts. There is no difficulty in this. In the end, the script which is theeasier of the two will prevail. There is no doubt that there ought to be a common language for mutual intercourse between the different parts of India.  Once we forget the Hindi-Urdu controversy, we shall realize that for Muslims throughout India Urdu is the lingua franca. This proves that since Moghul times, Hindi or Urdu was well on its way to becoming the national language of India.
 Even today, there is no language to rival Hindi in this respect. The question of national language becomes quite easy of solution
 once we give up the Hindi-Urdu controversy. Hindus will have to learn some Persian words while Muslims will have to learn some Sanskrit words. This exchange will enrich and strengthen the Islamic language and provide a very fruitful means for bringing Hindus and Muslims closer together. in fact we have to work so hard for dispelling the present fascination for the English language that we must not raise the Hindu-Urdu controversy. Nor must we fight over the script.
 Why English cannot become our national language, what harm results from the imposition of English on our people, how our people have suffered and their development has been retarded by the  adoption of English as the medium of education--I have dealt with in my speeches at Broach and Bhagalpur. I will not therefore repeat myself here. Indeed there is no doubt that Sir Rabindranath Tagore, Smt. Besant, Lokamanya Tilak and other respected and influential persons entertain similar views regarding this question. There will certainly be difficulties in the way of the achievement of our purpose but it will be for this body to tackle them. Lokamanya Tilak has indeed expressed his views in this regard not only in words but also in action by starting a Hindi section in his papers the Kesari and The Mahratta. The views of Bharat-ratna Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya on this question are well known. Still, unfortunately, some of our learned leaders hold that for atleast some years to come English must remain the national language. We will respectfully request these  leaders to consider that this unreasonable attraction for English is causing much hardship to our people, as they get little benefit out of the knowledge of their English-educated countrymen between whom and them a wide gulf has been created through English.
 It is unnecessary to say that I do not hate the English language. I myself have benefited from many of the precious gems of the great treasure of English Literature. We have also to acquire a knowledge of science and suchlike through the English Language. Knowledge of English is therefore necessary for us. But it is one thing to give it its due place and quite another to make a fetish of it.
 It is clear that our purpose will not be achieved merely by accepting that Hindi-Urdu should be our national language. We have to consider how we may achieve this goal. The scholars who have graced this assembly by their presence will certainly have something to say on this point. I will make a few suggestions on how we may spread this language. There must first be a handy book--sort of a
 “Hindi Teacher” which will meet the needs of those who want to learn Hindi. I have seen a small book of this type for those who want to learn Hindi through Bengali. There is one in Marathi also. But I have not seen any such books for other regional languages. This is as easy to do as it is necessary. I hope that this Sammelan will soon take up this work. Of course, these books should be written by learned and experienced writers.
 The greatest difficulty will be felt in the case of the Southern languages. No effort whatever in this direction has yet been made there. We must train good Hindi teachers to take up the work. There is  a great scarcity of such teachers. I have secured one such teacher from Prayag through your popular secretary, Bhai Purushottamdasji Tandon.
 Similarly, I have not yet seen a single complete grammar of the Hindi language. Such as exist in English and have been written by foreigners. One of these grammars is by Dr. Kellog. There must be a good Hindi grammar which can compare favourably with similar grammars of other Indian languages. It is my humble request to scholars who love Hindi to make up this deficiency.
 In our national Councils Hindi alone should be used. Congress workers and leaders can and should do much in this respect. I would suggest that this Conference should make a request to this effect to the Congress at its next session.
 In our legislative bodies too the entire proceedings should be conducted through the national language. Our people cannot have training in political affairs so long as this is not done. Our Hindi newspapers are doing something in this respect but the education we want to be imparted to our people cannot be given through translations. Similarly in our courts too the national and provincial languages must be used. Under the existing set-up people are being deprived of the education which they can easily receive from those who administer justice.
 The Princes can promote the national language in a way in which the English Government cannot. In the Holkar State, for example, in the Council and in the courts, Hindi and the provincial language alone can be used. The encouragement they thus give to the national language will go a long way in helping it progress. In the schools of this State the entire education from the beginning to the end should be imparted through the mother tongue. In this way our
 Princes can render much service to the language. I hope that Maharaja Holkar and his officials will take up this work enthusiastically.libtech_723_footnote
 It will be a sad delusion to think that we can achieve our objective merely through conferences. Single-minded devotion and constant application alone will bring success. Only when hundreds of selfless scholars regard this work as their own can it be accomplished.
 What I regret is that even the provinces which have Hindi for their mother tongue do not seem to show any enthusiasm for its promotion and propagation. The educated classes in these provinces continue to use English for purposes of conversation and correspondence. A friend has written to me that our newspaper proprietors do all their work in English; they keep their accounts, too, in English. Englishmen living in France use their mother tongue in all their dealings. Is it not a pity that we carry on even some of our most important activities in English? It is my humble but firm opinion that unless we give Hindi its national status and the provincial languages their due place in life of the people, all the talk of swaraj is useless. It is my fervent hope and prayer to God almighty that this Sammelan may be an instrument for the solution of this great question confronting India.
 Thoughts on National Language
 "
247,"March 30, 1918",SPEECH ON INDIAN CIVILIZATION,"
          INDORE, 
  March 30, 1918libtech_724_footnote  	We often think that changes of the kind that take place  in  Europe 	will also occur in India; that when some big transformation comes 	about, people who know beforehand how to prepare themselves for it 	win through and those who fail to take account of this are 	destroyed; that mere movement is progress and that our advancement 	lies in it. We think that we shall be able to progress through the 	great discoveries that have been made in the continent of Europe. 	But this is an illusion. We are inhabitants of a country which has 	so long survived with its own civilization. Many a civilization of 	Europe is destroyed,     
 but India, our country, survives as a witness to its own civilization. All scholars agree in testifying that the civilization of India is the same today as it was thousands of years ago. But, now, there is reason to suspect that we no longer have faith in our civilization. Every morning we do our worship and prayer, recite the verses composed by our forbears, but we do not understand their significance. Our faith is turning in another direction.
 So long as the world goes on, the war between the Pandavas and the Kauravas will also continue. The books of almost all the religions say that the war between the gods and Satan goes on for ever. The question is how we are to make our preparations. I have come here to tell you that you should have faith in your civilization and keep to it steadfastly. If you do this, India will one day hold sway over the entire world. (Applause.)
 Our leaders say that, in order to fight the West, we have to adopt the ways of the West. But please rest assured that it will mean the end of Indian civilization. India’s face is turned away from your modern trend; that India you do not know. I have travelled much and so come to know the mind of India and I have discovered that it has preserved its faith in its ancient civilization. The swaraj of which we hear will not be achieved the way we are working for it. The Congress-League Scheme, or any other scheme which is even better, will not get us swaraj. We shall get swaraj through the way in which we live our lives. It cannot be had for the asking. We can never gain it through copying Europe.
 That European civilization is Satanic we see for ourselves. An obvious proof of this is the fierce war that is going on at present. It is so terrible that the Mahabharata War was nothing in comparison. This should be a warning to us and we should remember that our sages have given us the immutable and inviolate principles that our conduct should be godly and that it should be rooted in dharma. We should follow these principles alone. So long as we do not follow dharma, our wish will not be fulfilled, notwithstanding all the grandiose schemes we may devise. Even if Mr. Montagu offers us swaraj today we can in no way benefit from that swaraj. We must make use of the legacy left us by our rishis and munis.
 The whole world knows that the tapasya that was practised in ancient India is found nowhere else. Even if we want an empire for India, we can get it through no other method but that of self-
 discipline. We can be certain that once the spirit of discipline comes to pervade our lives, we shall be able to get anything we may want.
 Truth and non-violence are our goal. Non-violence is the supreme dharma, there is no discovery of greater import than this. So long as we engage in mundane actions, so long as soul and body are together, some violence will continue to occur through our agency. But we must renounce at least the violence that it is possible for us to renounce. We should understand that the less violence a religion permits, the more is the truth contained in it. If we can ensure the deliverance of India, it is only through truth and non-violence. Lord Willingdon, the Governor of Bombay, has said that he feels greatly disappointed when he meets Indians for they do not express what is in their minds but only what would be agreeable to him, so that he never knows the real position. Many people have this habit of hiding their own sentiments while in the presence of an important person and suiting their talk to his pleasure. They do not realize how cruelly they deceive themselves and harm the truth. One must say what one feels. It is impertinence to go against one’s reason. One must not hesitate the least to tell what one feels to anyone, be he a Minister of the Government or even a more exalted person. Deal with all with truth and non-violence.
 Love is a rare herb that makes a friend even of a sworn enemy and this herb grows out of non-violence. What in a dormant state is non-violence becomes love in the waking state. Love destroys ill will. We should love all—whether Englishmen or Muslims. No doubt, we should protect the cow. But we cannot do so by  fighting  with Muslims. We cannot save the cow by killing Muslims.. We should act only through love; thus alone shall we succeed. So long as we do not have unshakeable faith in truth, love and non-violence, we can make no progress. If we give up these and imitate European civilisation, we shall be doomed. I pray to Suryanarayanlibtech_725_footnotelibtech_726_footnotethat India may not turn away from her civilization. Be fearless. So long as you live under various kinds of fears, you can never progress, you can never succeed. Please do not forget our ancient civilization. Never, never give up truth and love. Treat all enemies and friends with love. If you wish to make Hindi the national language, you can do so in a short time through the principles of truth and non-violence.

 INDORE,
 March 31,1918
 At the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan, just closing, a committee consisting of the Hon’ble Rai Bahadur Bishen Dutta Shukla, Rai Bahadur Saryoo Prasad, Babu Shiva Prasad Gupta, Babu Purushottam Das Tandon, Babu Gauri Shanker Prasad, Pandit Venkatesha Narayan Tiwari and myself were appointed as a special committee to give effect to certain resolutions of the Sammelan. One of the instructions given to the committee is to find out six Tamil and Telugu  youths  of promise and good character who would undertake to learn Hindi with a view to ultimately becoming missionaries for the propagation of Hindi among the Tamil and the Telugu people. It has been proposed to locate them either at Allahabad or at Benares, and to teach them Hindi. Expenses of their board and lodging as well as instruction will be paid for by the committee. It is expected that the course will not take longer than a year at the most and, as soon as they have attained a certain standard of knowledge of Hindi, they would be entrusted with the missionary work, that is, the work of teaching Hindi to the Tamil or the Telugu people, as the case may be, for which they would get a salary to maintain themselves suitably. The committee will guarantee such service for at least a period of three years, and will expect applicants to enter into a Contract with the committee to render the stipulated service faithfully and well for that period. The committee expects that the services of these youths will be indefinitely prolonged and that they will be able to serve themselves as well as the country. The desire of the committee is to offer liberal payment and expect in return absolute faithfulness and steadfastness. I trust that you agree with the Sammelan that Hindi and Hindi alone, whether in Sanskrit form or as Urdu, can become the language of intercourse between the different provinces. It is already that amongst the Mahomedans all over India, as also amongst the Hindus except in the Madras Presidency. I exclude the English-educated Indians who have made English, in my humble opinion, much to the detriment of the country, the language of mutual intercourse. If we are to realize the swaraj ideal, we must find a common language that can be easily learnt and that can be understood by the vast masses. This has always been Hindi or Urdu and is so even now, as I can say from personal experience. I have faith enough in the patriotism, selflessness and the sagacity of the people of the Madras Presidency to know that those, who at all want to render national service or to come in touch with the other Provinces, will undergo the sacrifice, if it is one, of learning Hindi. I suggest that they should consider it a privilege to be able to learn a language that
 will enable them to enter into the hearts of millions of their countrymen. The proposal set forth is a temporary makeshift. An agitation of great potency must arise in the country that would compel the educational authorities to introduce Hindi as the second language in the public schools. But it was felt by the Sammelan that no time should be lost in popularizing Hindi in the Madras Presidency. Hence the above-mentioned proposal which, I hope, you will be able to commend to your readers. I may add that the committee proposes to send Hindi teachers to the Tamil as also to the Andhra districts in order to teach Hindi free of charge to those who would care to learn it. I hope that many will take advantage of the proffered tuition. Those youths who wish to apply for the training above mentioned should do so under cover addressed to me care of Hindi Sahitya Sammelan, Allahabad, before the end of April.

 The Government says it is determined to collect the  revenue. I say: “Recover  it  from  our  lands,  seize  our  goods  or take  us  into custody, but we do not wish to contradict ourselves by paying up the dues of our own accord.”  In  this  fight,  those  who  have justice on their side shall win. As long as I  am  alive,  I  will  fight  for you. There is no talk yet of confiscating lands; they have their eye only on jewellery, buffaloes or movable property. There will be no great loss in this. If the Government, for recovering ten rupees, takes away land worth a thousand rupees through confiscation, even God will not bear it.libtech_732_footnote

 I got the news of the auction of your goods. I can very well understand that you will not find it easy to bear your losses. I feel, all the same, that this is the only way for us to rise. I should like you to bear your grief over your losses patiently and cheerfully. If the Government has inflicted the chothai, we shall fight it out and I am confident that we shall get the amounts back. I congratulate you on the courage you have shown in letting your goods be auctioned. I am sure your sacrifice will be duly rewarded. I hope all friends will boldly adhere to their word.

  	I returned from Indore yesterday. 1 am passing the day at Limbasi. I 	observe that the whole of the crops of this Division has been placed 	under distraint. This seems to me to be a cruel procedure. Again 	complaints are being made that violence is being used against the 	people in other parts. This, I know, can have no countenance from 	the higher officials. The Government resist the people, and the 	latter the former on a matter of principle. I think that the fight 	can be fought without bitterness. Both will have gained in the end 	if none but the fairest means be adopted by the parties to gain 	their respective ends.

            DEAR 	MR. GHOSAL,           LIMBASI,  April 	2, 1918 
  	I arrived at Nadiad yesterday morning and have come here today. I 	must say that the notice distraining the whole of the crops of the 	people is a cruel proceeding. The villages are sending a petition 	seeking relief. I am anxious that this should be and remain a fair 	fight between the Government and the people. Then at the end of it 	both will have gained, for there will be no bitterness left behind. 	I hear that in some cases even physical violence has been used. 	This, I know, can only be unauthorized. But it can be avoided if the 	officials at the lowest rung know and feel that the Government has 	no desire to be harsh.  Yours sincerely,  M. K. GANDHI My 	permanent address is Nadiad.

 We call the fight satyagraha. We have made truth our weapon; hence, if you tell lies and deceive me, we shall go down and all over the country they will say that ours was a cowardly fight. Let those who have not paid the full amount of the Government dues raise their   hands;libtech_733_footnotelibtech_734_footnoteand   those   who   have   paid   the   full    amount   raise theirs.libtech_735_footnotelibtech_736_footnoteThis proves that most of the farmers have not paid the dues. Indeed, this is a matter for joy. If such a large number of people remain firm, victory is ours. We should know what we mean by “victory”. What are we fighting for? We are fighting so that the Government may suspend the collection of revenue. Where crops are less than four annas, the full amount of the assessment should be suspended and, where they have been between four and six annas, half the amount should be suspended; that is the law. Many have had less than four annas yield, but some of them have paid up  half the amount. Our fight is to see that they don’t have to pay the remainder. The Government says that, in most places, crops have been more than six annas; that being its view, we request the Government, in the interests o f justice, to appoint a committee of inquiry; this the Government refuses to do. The question, here, is not merely one of land revenue. I am pained to see that the Government should always insist that it is in the right and the people are in the wrong. This bespeaks a state of slavery [for us]. We shall endure it no longer; of course, you won’t. That is how you should feel. We are fighting that you may taste the joy of freedom. The people’s will is pitted against the Government’s. Our stubbornness is in a right cause, hence we call it satyagraha. If, in the fight, the Government attaches all our property and even then we do not pay the revenue, the victory will be ours. Let the women give the same advice to their husbands. If our crops have been less than what the Government says they are, we should stand firm in the truth we have stated. If, out of fear of others, a man does what he ought not to, he will be ruined in his soul. The true end of human effort, real manliness, consists in not acting thus. We are not slaves; we are free. The Government says that, if the people  are allowed to raise their heads once, they will always hold them high. But
 
 people have no time to go about unnecessarily raising their heads in defiance. So much of their time is taken up in earning their bread. We fight through voluntary suffering. If any millionaire should offer to pay up the land revenue for you, you should flatly refuse the offer. Such help brings us down. People should fight with their own  strength. They should find their happiness in their suffering. All the help I can give is to share in your suffering, give you my experience and advise you; more than this, I cannot do. It is for you to fight. If you don’t have peace or are not happy, we can share in all that you suffer. If you are caught in a fire, how can we be happy ? You may possibly be frightened by the notices and may shake with fear because the crops have been attached but, if you face the situation calmly and smilingly, the Government will find it impossible to act in this manner again. The Government is doing all this to terrorize you. Our Hindu scriptures speak of many examples of sacrifice for the sake of truth.
 If the farmers of Limbasi allow themselves to be ruined for the sake of truth, we shall say that the story of Nalaraja was true, that we have today hundreds of Nalarajas in Limbasi. Don’t mind if they have attached the barns. Let them confiscate the lands. It will be a golden day for us when, deprived of our lands, we issue forth from our villages with drums joyfully beating before us, for then it will be proved that you had fulfilled your pledge. We shall not permit those who lose their all to starve. If you have to go without food, I and hundreds like me will starve with you. If you submit to suffering, happiness will come seeking you. This is a law of nature.
 When people have to submit to oppression by the Talati, the village   chiefs   and   ravaniaslibtech_737_footnote,  what  else   can   we  expect   from   the mamlatdar? And the Collector: how dare one set one’s eyes on him? This is a mistaken notion under which you are labouring. There is no law requiring you to live in fear of the officers. If we are not afraid, the law cannot punish us either. We should fear only God.
 Those who become the victims of oppression need not get frightened. This is the first time we are fighting the Government. Ours is a fight for truth.

 handwritten leaflets every day, in which we shall report the developments from day to day. This will assure you that we do not waste a single second, but spend all our time in your cause.

The Kheda district has shown the way for the good of the whole of India. When the farmers declare that they are men and have courage enough, that they are prepared for sacrifices for the sake of truth, I shall say they are not men, but gods. I wish you victory.

          NADIAD, 
     DEAR 	SIR JAMES DUBOULAY,  April 	4, 1918 
  	Although the Kaira matter is not under your Department, I feel that 	as you are a member of the Executive Council and as perhaps of all 	the members you know me best, I would not hesitate to place the 	position before you.  	The situation is not of my seeking nor is it the work of the Home 	Rule party in any shape or form. The initiative entirely belongs to 	the Kaira people. Even at the present moment I am endeavouring as 	much as possible to keep it outside the political view. The people 	have tried every means at their disposal of serving what they 	believe to be justice and they have failed. What was I to advise? 	Were they quietly to sell their treasured belongings or incur debts 	to pay the Government dues and be noted liars in the bragain? For be 	it remembered that the local officials think that their figures are 	absolutely right and the people’s wrong. The people naturally look 	up to public workers for advice. For me to have advised them to 	suffer the wrong would have been to increase their weakness and send 	 their  discontent underground. What I have done enables the people 	to state their case boldly and if they are in the wrong or the 	Government unbending to suffer their property to be sold. This is at 	best a striking and orderly demonstration of their grief and of 	their faith in the ultimate triumph    
 of truth and in the desire of the Government to do justice. I cannot help saying that the doctrine of infallibility of the officials is alike dangerous and intolerable. I can see nothing wrong  in  the Government adopting the principle of arbitration as between themselves and the ryots. They can only gain in prestige. The Talati and Mukhi rule which is the rule of fear must give place to the rule of law. Anyway that is what I am striving for throughout India. Will you not assist?
 For the facts of the case I enclose herewith my letter to the Presslibtech_740_footnote. If you wish to see me I am at your service.

 When we met in Nadiad a few days ago and resolved on satyagraha, I said that I would have to go to Delhi for the sake of Mahomed Ali and Shaukat Ali. It may seem that I take but a casual interest in this issue but I alone know how much, in fact, I am occupied with it. Of the guests present here, Shri Shuaiblibtech_741_footnoteis among the same class of persons as the two brothers. I said at the meeting of the Muslim League that, wherever I move in India, I embrace with love all Muslims who have their minds fixed on Allah and who recognize the truth. My friends Mahomed Ali and Shaukat Ali are in this class. It was in the course of my efforts to get to know these brotherslibtech_742_footnotethat  I encountered Shri Shuaib. He has come here at my instance. He is a man of learning and a friend of truth. He has spared himself no sacrifice.
 In what terms shall I introduce to you the other friends ? My own brothers are dead; but we have here  Shri  Rajendra  Babulibtech_743_footnote,  on seeing whom I forget their loss. He has given me love such as I can never forget. Shri Badrinath Verma also belongs to Bihar, the land of King Janak. Sister Anandibai has made up for my want of a daughter. She is a widow. She is still studying. In Champaran, when I felt the
 
 need for women workers, Dr. Dev made me a present of Anandibai. Let us plan our satyagraha in the presence of these witnesses.
 Bombay is the abode of the rich. It is difficult to explain to them the meaning of satyagraha, and more difficult still to explain it to the Bombay Government, for it always confronts us with some legal point or other. However, as a result of the recent deliberations, a committee has been appointed. They will wait on the Government. The idea of a public meeting in Bombay has been put off for some time. I don’t like to leave you and go to Bombay. I can bring myself to go nowhere, leaving you. It is not with Bombay’s help that we want to win this fight. If the farmers of Kheda should drop off one by one, out of fear of Government, how will help from Bombay avail ? Tell them the confidently that yours is a struggle in a just cause and that you are prepared for any sacrifice for it.
 It was indeed good that I brought with me these guests. This is Vallabhbhai’s native place. Vallabhbhai is still in the fire and will have to endure a good deal of heat, but I think out of this all we shall have gold in the end. Let your good wishes go with him. It was good of you to have treated him to a dinner of  laduslibtech_744_footnotelibtech_745_footnotebut, to crown it all, you need to offer  dakshinalibtech_746_footnotelibtech_747_footnote;  this  can  only  be  that  you  do  not  pay  the Government a single pie; let it, if it will, drown you in that lake or throw you into fire.
 It is a very good thing that this meeting is being attended by agriculturists from the Baroda State. If we lose our  lands  in satyagraha, I hope they will offer theirs to us. If we say that the crops have been less than four annas, how can we bear that the Government should exact from us a single pie? There is also another issue in this struggle, and that is whether the Government’s view should prevail or the people’s. The subjects’ loyalty to their Government consists in resisting the obduracy of officers. We have to be men. Now that we have woken up, we must take thought what we do. Great changes are taking place in the country. Abroad, terrible bloodshed is going on. In the war in Europe, the British have proved themselves a brave people. We want to be partners of these heroes. We shall command respect as such only if, in company with them, we make ourselves a heroic people. If we do not, we shall affect them as well with unmanliness. If we become abject, we shall make them so. We are
 
 waging this fight in order to awaken the country and teach the people the lesson of satyagraha.
 In a fight, one does not become brave by taking up arms. Arms may be there, but they will be useless to those who are cowards in their hearts. Heroism-fearlessness-lies in a man bearing sword-cuts without shrinking. This kind of heroism is possible to all men, women and children. I want the agriculturists of Kheda to have it. Our weapon is an uncompromising insistence on truth. Let  the  agriculturists  of Kheda sacrifice their all rather than pay the land revenue. I am confident the agriculturists here, at Karamsad, will never turn their backs. We are to submit to suffering, to sacrifice our possessions. To be sure, we may feel concerned what we shall have for food. He who has given us teethwill provide the food.libtech_748_footnote
 We are to sacrifice our all in this struggle. All the same, those who, with motives none too clean, lay their hands on our lands will not be happy with them. If the Government does so, we shall turn ourselves outlaws in defiance. If, to recover revenue of a hundred rupees, they seize land worth ten thousand, the man who bids for it will not profit from it. This Government is not based on robbery, but justice. The day I learn that it is deliberately run for plunder, be sure I shall turn disloyal to it. Why have this fear, what you would do if deprived of your lands? Nobody will ever find it profitable to appropriate our lands.

258,"April 5, 1918",LETTER TO K. NATARAJAN,"
    
 [Before April 5, 1918]
 DEAR MR. NATARAJAN libtech_749_footnote,
 It grieves me to find that sometimes you jump to hurried conclusions and will not have the patience to hear the other side. This, I venture to think, adversely affects your capacity for national service which I know you always want to render. Take this Kaira affair. I do not mind your differing from me. On the contrary, I honour you for your stating your convictions even though it may hurt you to have to
 
 hold them in opposition to your friends. My complaint however is against the haste with which you form your conclusions. You do not know the inwardness of the Kaira struggle and you have no time to study it. There was the Godhra Conferencelibtech_750_footnotelibtech_751_footnotein which the masses for the first time took an active part. Some of these men, at the end of the Conference, twitted the leaders with these remarks: “What is the use of your holding Conferences and inviting us? Kaira is face to face with practically a failure of crops. The raiyats are entitled to suspension. What are you people doing in the matter?” Some of the listeners accepted the rebuke as well deserved and undertook to move in the matter. Hence the petitionlibtech_752_footnotelibtech_753_footnotesigned by thousands for suspension. This petition alone should have been sufficient to warrant suspension which would have meant merely loss of interest to the Government, but the gaining of goodwill in return. The officials, however, took a dubious and a devious course. They set about getting  annawari patrakslibtech_754_footnotelibtech_755_footnoteof which I can say that most of them will not bear a close scrutiny. The raiyats have exhausted every means at their disposal for getting relief. Each time these faulty documents are flung in their faces. What are they to do ? To sell their cattle, trees or other belongings and to quietly pay the revenue? I would defy you to be on the scene as I have been and to advise the raiyats to do so. You must know the methods that are employed in order to exact payment from raiyats when they have no crops. I could not calmly contemplate an emasculation of the raiyats taking place in front of me. Nor could you. I hold that it is a perfectly constitutional, just and righteous thing for a people to say, “Since you reject our petitions and if we have to pay, we can only pay by borrowing or selling our belongings.” You have only to come and see with what perfectly good humour the fight is being carried on, how the people are steeling their hearts for any kind of loss and how elderly men and women, too, are taking part in the demonstration. You at least ought to see that this self-inflicted suffering must exalt the nation, whereas the same  suffering  unwillingly undergone hitherto has only degraded the nation. This is a bread-agitation. What is the use of a thousand meetings in India, praying for redress if they are to tell the people calmly to denude
 
 
 themselves of their trees or their cattle or their ornaments whilst a constitutional agitation is being carried on? It is like giving them stone when they asked for bread.
 I wish this letter would prick your conscience, stimulate your inquiring spirit, bring you to Kaira and see the campaign in working. I would then not only be prepared to submit to, but would invite, your report no matter how adverse it may be to the cause. I shall have the satisfaction of knowing that you have at least studied the question. You owe this to yourself, to a friend, and to the nation. If you cannot give this much time to the cause, you must have no business to hold any opinion on the Kaira affair.
 I hope you will pardon me for my presumption in writing to you as I have done. As I have told you so often, I always endeavour to secure your co-operation and help in my work and I should be  satisfied not to have it if you withhold it after full consideration. You ought not to be led astray by the term “passive resistance”. You have got a concrete case. Judge it on its merits.libtech_756_footnote

 "
261,"April 	5, 1918",SPEECH AT VADATHAL,"
  	I have just heard that Agarpura, Od and Nasar cattle have been 	distrained and in one case a milch buffalo actually removed. The 	owner writes bitterly complaining that although he pointed out other 	goods, the distraint upon his animal was insisted on. In some cases 	officials, so the people say, have entered their cottages including 	kitchens without putting off shoes.  	If you would rob your process of distraint of all tyranny, it is 	absolutely necessary to stop distraint of cattle, to recall all 	chothai orders and forfeiture notices and to respect popular 	prejudices when entering their homes.  From 	a copy: C.W. 10666. Courtesy: Chhaganlal Gandhi         April 	5, 1918  	From the very beginning, the village of Vadathal has taken a leading 	part in this struggle. I have moved from farm to farm here and 	assured myself that on the average the crop in this village is less 	than four annas. The Collector came over for a fresh inquiry. I 	wrote to him that I had ascertained the facts myself and found that 	the crop was less than four annas, but he did not agree with me.  	I have told him that ours is a struggle through self-suffering. I 	have seen people suffer in satyagraha much more than you do. I shall 	have you swallow bitter draughts. You should celebrate the days on 	which they sell your buffaloes here, auction away your things and 	confiscate your belongings. If anyone in Vadathal is jailed, the 	prison will have been sanctified. Especially the women should have a 	feast when their husbands go to jail.  	Notices of confiscation have been issued, by way of threats; in 	spite of them, we remain the owners of our lands. Whatever the value 	of these lands, we should not falter ever so little in our duty. In 	case you should lose your all in this struggle, not one of you will 	be allowed to starve. We shall go and beg but provide for you. Bear 	your sufferings for the sake of your pledge. 
 If I pay you money for the buffaloes, I and all of you will have deceived the people. It will be wrong if we help you financially so that you may join the satyagraha. We can stand by you, keep up your courage and give you our moral support when the Government takes repressive measures against you. I want to rid you of the unmanliness that has come to possess you. I want to bring back the olden days in India.
 If in ancient times we had a Sita, this age, too, I believe, should produce one. If at one time we had a Ramachandra, such a one as flowers but once in an age, the modern age, too, should produce another like him in this country. This should be a part of our heritage. You know the stories of Harishchandra and Dhruva. We may not be able to do all that Harishchandra did, but something of him is bound to have come down to us. Let the women here, too, understand the utmost importance of a pledge. If they are not firm enough to hold to a pledge once taken, their children, too, will grow up to have no spirit in them. The God who has created us will have justice done to us. If, moreover, we stand firm in this struggle, we shall by and by be able to secure the reins of Government as well in our hands. If I should have to die for saving the agriculturists of Vadathal, I would be only too happy to do so.
 I am not unaware that  at  present  your  buffaloes are  being sold against land revenue dues. There have been many other cases in which people have paid land revenue by selling off their buffaloes. That you may not have to endure such misery year after year, you may let the Government sell the buffaloes for this once. It is welcome to do so, this year. Next year, rest assured, it will not find it possible to sell your buffaloes or subject you to any other hardships.
 Even the birds and beasts have a sense of self-respect and you are human beings. See, therefore, that you do not fail in your pledge. Things were explained to you so very clearly before you took it. Though we have the help of the rich in this struggle, to fight with their help is much like a man looking stout because of swellings on his person. Have faith in God; if we tread the path of right and justice, God will protect us. Be it justice or money, we can have it from none but Him.
 Consider, now, the condition of those who are working among you. There is not a single moment in the twenty-four hours when I am not thinking of the satyagraha in Kheda. Dr. Hariprasad has made his
 home here. There was no dearth of public work for him in Ahmedabad. He has left aside all these things and has come here to take up the work and live in your midst. As you see, Shri Vallabhbhai and Shri Keshavprasad have just arrived from Mahudha.
 Two friends have come all the way from Champaran. They have come from the land of King Janak, eager to see you. I hope you will not forget all these things and bring discredit to Vadathal.

 It was my hope that women also would be present at  this meeting. In this work there is as much need of women as of men. If women join our struggle and share our sufferings, we can do fine work.
 I see that people’s enthusiasm is mounting. This is a people’s fight and, once the people have come to understand things, the Government may fight on as long as it chooses, we shall not be defeated. Now at last the time has come when we can see if people have courage. Our goods are being attached and buffaloes taken  away; hardships such as these purify us as fire purifies gold. In this struggle, you are being taught courage, firmness and patience.
 The Government has resorted to every possible repressive measure in this town. But we want to show to the world that we have some mettle in us, have the strength to suffer and that, in fulfilling our pledge, we shall spare ourselves nothing. Uttarsanda is all Patidars and, if this fight is to be won, it is only your community that will do so. They have seen good days as well as bad. I should like to see you go bravely through this struggle. It bespeaks your sense of honour that you have joined this struggle.
 Some may advise you to try your strength with weapons, but remember that he who can wield a stick can also ward off a blow with one. I want you to use your strength well and in a right cause. It is very much to be desired that a ‘satyagrahi army’ is formed, ever ready to fight for the honour of India. The nation is entitled to expect much from your town, inhabited by so many strong and brave men.
 I am having these days a wonderful experience of the amazing strength the people of Kheda District possess. If all friends abide by the sacred pledge they have taken in this struggle, there is not the least doubt that we should have swaraj in twenty-four hours.
 And so I have but one request to make to you all. Let the Government auction your household utensils, your bedsteads, your cattle; but don’t be shaken in your purpose, ever. I want this promise from you. I crave this gift. You will please me if you give it. To
 
 honour your pledge, you have to fight on with love in your heart to sustain you. I have drawn you into satyagraha because I have recognized your strength. Do reassure me gladly and unreservedly, with a cheerful face.

 We are coming here straight from Torana. The agriculturists there are holding out quite as well as those in Navagam and elsewhere in Dasakosi [taluka]. I am sure that despite the heavy assault on it, Torana will not fall. Keep up this struggle which is based on truth. See that the women go with you in all that you do. Their courage and fortitude will serve us well. If we have to yield, because they are afraid of losing their buffaloes, we shall have no place to stand on. If they give us courage, we shall win. The first step towards swaraj is to abide by the sacred pledge we have taken. Swaraj consists in the very fact of having acquired such strength. It is our duty to know and to safeguard our rights. This is a struggle to compel the Government to respect popular feeling and acknowledge our rights.
 We should not cross the bounds of common decency in this struggle. Complaints have been received about some of us having harassed the officers. Untruth, discourtesy and arrogant harassment of others are unbecoming of us. They betray lack of discipline. Through this struggle, we have to learn to behave with respect and courtesy towards others. Satyagraha must display the qualities of truthfulness and courtesy.
 Truthfulness, courage and zeal are indispensable in this fight. Again, one cannot hold out unless one puts all one’s heart into it. These qualities will not spill over if we cover them with the lid of courtesy.
 Our pledge is not for a few months only, but for an indefinite period. So long as the Government does not accede to our request, we shall not retreat a single inch but lose all that we have. You ought to
 
 have immovable faith, not in me or anyone else, but in yourselves. This is not a struggle merely to secure suspension of land revenue, but to see that the pledge behind it is honoured. We are to show through this fight who will have the last word, the Government or we. So long as the Government has not the support of the people, it will not find it possible to hold out. The satisfaction you would derive from having honoured your pledge, you will not get from your lands. Minstrels and bards will sing of your prowess and their songs will inspire your children too to heroism. You will pass on to them, as a priceless legacy, the temper which regards a pledge as a sacred obligation. Fight like brave ones to honour the pledge you have taken. The key to swaraj for India lies in this.
 To suffer for the sake of truth and win immortal fame, that is your truest duty today; in that lies your honour and that of India.

 DEAR ESTHER,
 I seem to have been cruelly neglectful in my correspondence with you. I could not be satisfied with giving only a line to you. I wanted to give you a long love-letter. I have not the quiet for framing such a letter. And I dare not wait any longer.
 I do not know how I can describe my activities not one of which is of my own seeking. They have all come to me with a persistence I dare not oppose. What is a soldier to do if he is hemmed in on all sides ? Is he to concentrate his effort on dealing with one attack only and to court extinction by ignoring the other attacks that are being simultaneously delivered? Obviously safety lies in dealing with all in the best way he can. Such is almost my position. Distress  pleads before me from all sides. I dare not refuse help where I know the remedy.
 The Ahmedabad strike provided the richest lessons of life. The power of love was never so effectively demonstrated to me as it was during the lock-out. The existence of God was realized by the mass of
 men before me as soon as the fast was declared. Your telegram was the most-touching and the truest of all. Those four days were to me days of peace, blessing and spiritual uplifting. There never was the slightest desire to eat during those days.
 The Kaira affair you must have understood from my letter to the Press.libtech_768_footnoteI wrote one on the fast too.libtech_769_footnoteIf you have not seen the letters, please let me know.
 I hope you are keeping well. In liver complaints  nothing answers so well as fasting.

  	Even if you have forgotten me, I have not forgotten you. Anandibehn 	gave me news of you. You have been separated from Mahadev longer 	than I thought. I have told him that he can go there whenever he 	likes; but if you so wish, I am prepared to send him at once. I 	should tell you, all the same; that Mahadev has been passing through 	experiences which will mean so much to him. You will also share in 	his gain. If you can take comfort in this thought and get over your 	sadness at separation, he may stay on. But there is one danger in 	this. If I should get busy with a struggle even greater than the 	present one, he would not be in a position to go, much as you might 	desire. This is, therefore, the right time for him to go and see 	you.

    DEAR FRIEND,  	I thought of  writing  to  you  many  days  ago  but could  not  get 	time; the idea also went  out of my mind.  I  hope  you  will 	forgive me.  	I beg leave to say that you have committed no  mistake  in sending 	over Mahadev to me. This experience was necessary for his growth in 	life. Money is not always the only thing necessary for one’s 	happiness. It is not in Mahadev’s nature to find his happiness in 	money. I think what is true of him will also be so with Durga, by 	and by. Mahadev has been passing through invaluable experiences.  	So far as I am concerned, the coming over of both has been nothing 	but a gain. Mahadev has relieved me of many of my worries.  I was in 	search of a loving helpmate of his character and learning. Having 	got Mahadev, I have succeeded in the search. I did not think even in 	my dreams that it would be possible for me to find such good use for 	Chi. Durga’s services. Inscrutable are the ways of God.  	I wish, I beg of you, that you will not worry yourself on account of 	these two but give them your full blessings.

 NADIAD,
 April 9, 1918
 
 DEAR SIR JAMES DUBOULAY,
 I thank you for your kind letter. I know that we can have honest difference of opinion without questioning one another’s motives. I promise not to misunderstand you in anything you say.
 When I entered on the Kaira struggle I had no notion that I was attacking the whole revenue system. I felt that I was attacking what in my opinion was a grave injustice to the people. At the same time I confess that I would not have hesitated to enter upon the struggle even if it had meant an attack on the whole revenue system. War had ever been present before me and I know that as a law-abiding citizen and still more as a lover of the British Constitution I should at least hesitate
 
 to embarrass the Government if I cannot actively co-operate in the prosecution of War. I have tried to do the latter so far as as I could. But should anybody allow the War to cover injustice? Should not the Government refrain from defying honest public opinion? I do not say the people’s verdict be accepted in the Kaira matter. But I do say that where there is a sharp difference of opinion, arbitration should be resorted to. It is no pleasure to me to use adjectives for Talatis or for that matter anybody, but I know that it would be prudery in private matters, and a shirking of a painful duty in public matters, to shun adjectives where they describe material facts. I wish you really knew them as I have come to know them. You will then probably use stronger language than I have done. Give me the committee I have asked for and I will show you what their estimates are worth and incidentally show you also what they are. But here the fault is not theirs; the system under which they are working makes them so. This however is much too large a question for me to discuss in the course of a letter.
 The choice before me is quite clear. I must either see discontent going deeper but being kept secret out of fear, or assist in making it publicly known in a disciplined manner and without fear of consequences.
 No government, I agree, can afford to concede to popular clamour, nor can any government afford to ignore a strong public opinion even though the matter may be unreasonable so long as it is not immoral or destructive of the government itself. In this case you may ignore New India but you may not ignore the opinion of the Kaira ryot in a matter concerning itself. A government that will not yield to such public opinion deserves to be destroyed. Indeed it courts destruction. I am endeavouring to show both the Government and the people that all force is utterly useless before the force of the public opinion which disdains to use violence, and is based only on truth as it is apprehended by the people who are prepared to suffer to the uttermost. The people of Kaira are receiving the richest education of their lives. They are being taught not to strike for the right but to suffer for it with quiet but steadfast resignation, and whatever the consequences, they will have gained to the extent of their adherence to the principle I have ventured to enunciate.
 I hope to run down to Bombay on Saturday. Will you kindly let me know, either by letter or by wire, whether I could wait on you that
 day, and if so at what hour?

 regarding Ali brothers. Their internment has soured the Muslim section. As a Hindu I feel that I must not stand aloof from them. I must assist in securing the release of the brothers, if I cannot justify the Government’s action by producing before the public a case  against them. If therefore the Government have a real case against the brothers, it should be produced and the atmosphere cleared. If there is no producible cases I cannot help saying that the brothers should be discharged.
 If Lord Chelmsford is of opinion that they ought not to be released, the Government must prepare for facing an agitation which must result in the incarceration of the leaders of it. But I plead their discharge with all my strength. The Government can only gain in prestige by responding to public opinion, and so far as danger to the State is concerned I can only say that I should lay down my life for it, if their release should mean any betrayal of trust.

  	Your letter made me so very happy indeed. It was  such  a surprise 	to me to learn that I am never out of your mind. You, Gomatibehn, 	and a third person of your own choice—what more  could one want? 	Mahadev will write to you about the rest.  Vandemataram 	from  MOHANDAS [From 	Gujarati]  Mahadevbhaini 	Diary, Vol. IV         April 	10, 1918  	Some of the boys here are waving flags. Among these I see one 	adopted by the mill-hands of Ahmedabad, bearing the words: “A 	pledge is a pledge”. They alone are entitled to raise this flag 	who have that motto engraved in their hearts.  	At  present,  all  over  India  people’s  eyes  are  fixed   on   	Kheda district. If it goes under in this struggle, then for a long 	time the people of India will not be able to stand up. There  is  	wisdom in pausing for reflection before undertaking anything; but, 	having embarked on a thing, if we give it up, we only earn the title 	 of cowards. When the people lose their manliness, the country as a 	whole grows poor in spirit. This struggle in Kheda is to secure 	suspension of land revenue. There is a very important idea behind 	it. That the Government is always in the right and the subjects are 	wrong: how can    
 we tolerate this? The Government says that authority must be respected. Authority is blind and unjust. A Government that says that such authority must be respected cannot last. Under this British rule, we are taught from our childhood that theirs is a rule of justice. This is their ideal. It seems to me that, in place of this ideal, we have these days the rule of despotism. That is why I say that we should rise against this Government. I came over to Kheda district. When we investigated the state of the crops, you proved to me and my co- workers that they have been less than four annas. If what you say is true, it is the duty of the Government to concede our demand. And after all, what is it we have asked for? Merely that collection of land revenue be suspended for a year and that, if they announce the suspension, those of us who have the means are ready to pay up.
 If the Government does not concede even such a reasonable demand, what is the duty of the people? The scriptures, too, enjoin that, if a king goes wrong, the people should point out his error to him. Authority is blind and cannot readily see its own mistakes. In this case, the Government is violating truth and doing injustice to the people, whereas we, speaking the truth, are asking for justice. Truth ever prevails. You ought to have this confidence that, if, for the sake of truth, we just abide by our pledge, there is no Government which will ruin its subjects for nothing.libtech_781_footnotelibtech_782_footnoteI hear people say that they are in misery. But I have come here to tell you that, if we suffer voluntarily, we shall come through in the end. I have placed my trust in the people of Kheda district. Some have gone back on their pledge; to that extent the responsibility of the rest of us has increased. If, of two or three carts one breaks down during a journey, the others will have a heavier load to carry. I want you to bring lustre to the name of Kheda, famous as it is. It is for you to fulfil my wish. The day after tomorrow, you have been called by the Commissioner, to Nadiad. He wants to talk, not to those who have paid up the land revenue, but to those specially who have not done so. These should go positively. Shed all fear, tell him of your pledge and say what you want. The Commissioner will tell you that I am misleading you, that I have not advised you for your good. He may perhaps say that I am a good man but that in this matter I have gone wrong. But it was from you I collected the figures
 
 and the crops turned out to have been four annas. That was the correct estimate and, therefore, you should corroborate it before Mr. Pratt. None of you need be awed by him. Our salvation lies in clinging to truth. We are fighting for freedom.libtech_783_footnoteI would tell the women that they, too, must ask their husbands not to pay the Government’s dues, whatever the suffering you may have to go through. If we stand by our pledge and uphold our honour, freedom is bound to follow. Do everything necessary to ensure this. To those who have paid up, my advice is that they should help the others to hold out.

 "
282,"April 10, 1918",SPEECH AT SINHUJ,"
    
 April 10, 1918
 Before I say what I wish to, I should like to ask you how many of you have not paid the revenue.libtech_784_footnotelibtech_785_footnoteOn coming here I learn that many women have been intimidated by the Government’s severity in this fight and that, in consequence, in the last two or three days, a large number have paid up the revenue. I am sorry for those who have done this out of fear and all the more so for such of them who might have taken a pledge and have yet paid up. There is wisdom in not taking a pledge, but a pledge once taken must be honoured. Some will say that this struggle is merely to secure suspension of the Land revenue for a year. Yes, that is true enough; but, in reality, the struggle is for an all- important issue underlying the question of land revenue. We must become absolutely fearless. Fear is not for us, neither for men nor for women; fear is for beasts. The day before yesterday I said by way of illustration that, on seeing the frightened eyes of the bullock when a car passes by, I am moved to pity. As the car comes nearer,  the bullock shakes with fear, and sometimes the car is in danger of being overturned. The bullock’s fear is groundless. We are in the same condition as this bullock. It is a harsh comparison and does no credit
 
 to man, but that is the simple truth of the matter. Why should we fear without any reason? Neither the Talati nor the other officers hurt anyone, they simply cannot do so. Even the ravanias only put questions and walk away. They are rather scared, thinking that this is the people’s day. On one side they are scared and, on the other, we are. What a situation !
 Let the Government, if it will, take away our cattle; hand over the ornaments, too, if it wants to seize them. But there is one thing we will not give up and that is our self-respect. No one who does not maintain his self-respect can be called a man of religion. He who is afraid of God is afraid of none else. He whom we have imagined as omnipotent and omniscient protects all and leads all to welfare. How can you give in, betraying all those who, in this fight for truth and dharma, have bound themselves by a pledge? To the friends who took fright, I should say, ‘‘Stand up, if you have courage enough and patriotism in you, and assure the others who are firm in their pledge that you will stand by them and, if they have to part with their lands or cattle, you will share yours with them.” Some of the women told me that, if I had come two days earlier, they would not have paid up. I should say to these ladies, “If you would be true to your word, you should tell your husbands to spend their money on the community.” I told them in Borsad and Vasad, the day before yesterday, that a man who had yielded would feel like bringing down others and so, instead of admitting his weakness, would try to cover it up. If any of you harbours such an idea, please banish it from your mind and give courage to the satyagrahis who have taken the pledge. That is our sacred duty. If you discharge this duty, at any rate, those who have taken the pledge will stick to it unflinchingly. We want in this way to train and prepare the country, and show the right path to the Government which has chosen to disregard truth and justice; this is our aim in fighting. It is sheer injustice to confiscate land worth ten thousand rupees to recover ten rupees of revenue. If the Government wickedly perpetrates such monstrous injustice, I will go all out against it in the manner of an outlaw and advise you as well to do the same. I cannot imagine the Government acting in this way for the sake of five or ten rupees. These days, the Government rules by threats. It is a wrong notion that a Government can be run on the basis of fear. We should not fall a prey to such fear. We have faith in the justice of Nature. Do not obstruct the Government when it takes away your buffaloes nor hand over anything with your own hands. We have all
 
 these years been giving and obeying in fear, resentful inside. In the result, we have come to be utterly abject. Kheda yields crops of gold and its people are brave.  Despite  the  famine  of  1956libtech_786_footnotelibtech_787_footnote,  they  have, toiling day and night, turned the land into a garden. How does it happen that the light  has  fled  from  their  lands  and  their  faces?  The only reason is that the people have begun to be afraid of the Government. This fight is to emancipate ourselves from such a condition. The success of this satyagraha in Kheda will have repercussions all over India. Our salvation lies in our own hands. By our own efforts shall we end our suffering.
 In this struggle, we shall learn another wonder-working idea, that we do not propose to fight with arms; we do not want to carry guns or spears; we shall fight with the weapon of truth. He who bears this weapon has need of no other. If, without harbouring any fear, we trust to truth and fight, we shall achieve a great success.
 I hear that, in this satyagraha struggle against the Government, things are going on which are the opposite of truth. When the officer asks the farmers why they do not pay, instead of telling him that the crops have been less than four annas, they are afraid and make other excuses. We should not be rude to the mamlatdar or the Collector, though we need not submit to forced labour or give anything demanded as of right. Indeed, they can order nothing from us. On no account should we omit to extend to them common hospitality. We may not give them anything free, but give them what they want  against its full price. We ought not to forget good manners. Yesterday, it was brought to my notice that people refuse things even against money. How can this be in a fight of the nature of satyagraha? I was pained at this. How may those who wish to be rid of tyranny tyrannize over others? A third thing. The Commissioner wants to address you and tell you something the day after tomorrow, at three o’clock, in the mamlatdar’s court in Nadiad. I would advise all of you to attend. They will even tell you that I am leading you astray. It is not for me to judge whether I am leading you well or ill; I tell you only what seems right to me. If it seems so to you as well, declare with one voice that, by following my advice, you command better respect and are able to safeguard your rights. Mr. Pratt will not be angry at this. He understands that, when the people are aggrieved, they have a right to complain. Satyagraha consists in seeking relief from hardships
 
 through voluntary suffering. Be fearless, all of you, and tell the Commissioner this: “Our lands, cattle or jewellery are not dearer to us than our plighted word, our self-respect or our dharma. Again and again we have pleaded with you and told you that our crops have been less than four annas. Under the law, if the crops are less than four annas, collection of land revenue has to be suspended. You took the Talatis’ word and not ours. We have only one way open to us to convince you, and that is, not to pay the land revenue willingly.” Go to the meeting, all of you. Listen carefully to what the Commissioner says and, if permitted, have your say. Afterwards, come to the Hindu Anathashram. We shall talk there. The Government does not want anyone to be afraid. We have been waving the flag of swaraj. It is with our own efforts that we are to achieve it. We shall certainly get it if we become absolutely fearless. Whatever happens, do not pay the revenue. Let the women give courage to their husbands.libtech_788_footnoteIf  anyone has a question to ask, he may have his doubts answered. The situation demands that you act with due thought and care.

 As days pass, our ordeal grows severer. I am coming straight from Ahmedabad after a meeting with the Commissioner. We had a talk lasting an hour. He told me of the proposed public meeting in Nadiad. I assured him that the agriculturists would attend it. I hope all those who have not paid up the land revenue will go to the meeting and see what the Commissioner advises. He may tell you that, despite the failure of crops, it is the people’s duty to pay the Government the land revenue. Maybe, he is right. On my part, I shall only tell you that you should remain loyal, till the very end, to the pledge you have taken. Tell him the whole story from the beginning to the end. If you take your pledge seriously, be  firm and give him your side  of  the
 
 
 case: Why you have taken the pledge; whether you took it knowing full well what you were doing, and also what you hope to gain from it. Tell him all this plainly.
 This is not a struggle merely to escape payment of the revenue this  year.  I  have   been   saying   this   at   every   place.   Through this struggle we want to  bring  home  to  the  Government  that  it ought to yield to the people. No king can remain in power if he sets himself against the people. I have taken it as the chief mission of my life to prove this. Our people have lost their spirit. Their wealth has been  drained  away.  There  is  no   light   in   their   eyes.libtech_790_footnoteThere   is  a comparison which comes to my mind again and again. Government is to the subjects what a car approaching a bullock is to the latter, be it the British Government or a native State. As the car comes on, tears gather in the bullock’s eyes and he begins to sweat; in the same way, the people shake with fear of the authority of their Government. I cannot bear to see this. You should be able to tell the Government that it may grant relief under its own law. If you can bring it to do this, you will have some life in you in place of this abjectness of yours.
 In the morning we repeat the names of innumerable rishis and satis. We chant the names of Sita and Rama, Nala and Damayaanti, Prahlad and so on. And for what? To get inspiration from their lives. The scriptures say that those human beings who pass their lives as beasts will be born as beasts in their next lives. You went to the Collector, you went to the Commissioner and then to the Bombay Government and gave up the effort at last when you  failed everywhere. If that is the truth, I must say that to submit in  this helpless fashion is to behave in the manner of a beast. We may find our happiness either in killing or being killed. The first way is that of beasts, the second that of man. The soul of a beast is ever asleep, a man’s ever awake. We can never prosper till we are fully grown and awake in our souls.libtech_791_footnotelibtech_792_footnoteI shall tell you a story from the Puranas. There was a certain rishi; the fire emitted from between his brows put an end to all suffering. The point of this text is that, when the soul becomes alive, all miseries end and so the injustices perpetrated by the
 
 Government will be no more when we become alive in our soul. I want to put this truth to you in the plainest terms. We want happiness in place of the present misery; if so, we should suffer voluntarily and lay down our lives for the sake of truth. He who knows the power of truth and has realized it in his being is ever happy. I may lose my all, but none can deprive me of the joy in my soul. I want you to know that joy. We need to become religious-minded. We must learn to speak the truth and walk in the way of truth. The ravanias are welcome to come every day and bring orders of attachment. I would tell you, out of regard for your pledge, let them dispossess you of all you have; be as fakirs but do not budge an inch. This is the dharma for a man. I assure the women that we shall not starve. What we lose today we shall get back tomorrow; but, once our pledge is violated, it is violated for ever. We should preserve our good name and our pledge, our dignity and manliness. This is the legacy we should leave to posterity. May God give you strength, and may you make your name ever  so  glorious! Those friends who have taken the pledge may  please reassure us. Let me have it from you that the universe may go to pieces and the sun may fail to rise, but you will not go back on your pledge.libtech_793_footnote
 Say: “You may cut off our heads if you please, but we will not pay the land revenue. We shall not submit to the Government’s injustice. If, however, you will be kind enough to remit the land revenue and see that the poor people don’t suffer, those of us who can afford will pay up.”

DEAR PROF. GEDDESlibtech_795_footnote,
 
 
[NADIAD,]
 April 12, 1918
 I 	am truly thankful to you for your very kind letter.  	You would not be more pained than I am over our  base  imitation of 	the West. I want a great deal from you but nothing indiscriminately. 	I take part in the spectacles such as the one at Indorelibtech_796_footnotelibtech_797_footnotein 	order that I may reach and touch the hearts of the people and wean 	them from materialism as much as possible. There is a materialistic 	view of the vernacular question and the religions. I am endeavouring 	to place the latter before them. The success of the Conference is to 	be measured by the extent to which I have been able      
 to touch the religions in [the] audience before me.
 I tried last year to do away with the pandal for the Congress and suggested a meeting on the Maidan early in the morning. That is the Indian style and it is the best. I wonder if the amphitheatre is an improvement. My ideal is speaking to the crowd from under a tree. Never mind if the voice does not reach the thousands, nay millions. They come not to hear but to see. And they see far more than we can imagine. Amphitheatres suggest a limitation to the space capacity. The merit lies in an unlimited number being able to come and yet doing their work in an orderly manner. Such were the annual fairs of old. We have but to introduce religion into the new social and political life and you have a perfect organization in working order to fall back upon.
 But what is the use of my writing? Both of us are preoccupied. The wretched fever of the West has taken possession of us. We have no leisure for things eternal. The utmost that can be said of us is that we do hanker after the eternal though our activity may belie our profession.
I shall treasure your letter. May I make public use of it?
 And do please tell me how I may build cheap and durable houses—from the foundation to the roof.
 Yours sincerely,
  K. GANDHI

  	I have your letter. I also wrote one to you, which you must have 	received. You have said nothing about your health. I am greatly 	pleased to learn that you have been attending on nursing the sister. 	We read in our holy books that pupils used to volunteer their 	services to their teachers. Your way of putting the thing is as 	natural and sweet as in those books. I do not know how to measure 	the height to which this service will raise you. It 	is quite easy to understand why I did not ask for 35 per cent 
 [increase]  for  more   than   one   day.   It   was   impossible   for   me to stretch the matter any further. The employers even now think that they agreed to give so much not because of any firmness on the workers’ part but on account of my fast. I would have been guilty of a kind of violence if I had asked for more. In accepting the minimum when I was in a position to ask for more, I showed straight forwar- dness, modesty and good sense. Had I not fasted, it is certain that the workers would have yielded. They kept firm because of the fast. A pledge so kept [by the workers] can justify only a demand placed at the lowest. We can have it respected merely in the letter. This one was so respected and, because I placed the demand at the minimum, I made up in a way, indeed in great measure, for the flaws which had tainted my fast. Esther understood the significance of the fast very clearly. She wired me a sentence from the Bible. It means:
 Greater love has no man than  this,  that  he  lay  down  his  life  for  his friends.libtech_798_footnote
 I look upon that fast as the best thing I have done so far. The peace which I knew at the time of that fast was no mere human experience.
 I do not get here the joy which I found in my work at Ahmedabad. I feel uneasy in mind and keep thinking of all manner of things. Sometimes, I feel people have understood the idea all right; at other times, I fancy that they have not understood it and so feel pained. To be sure, excellent work is being done, but now the mind is fatigued. It is a crushing burden I carry, that of the fight for Mohammed Ali. I have no choice but to bear it. I cherish the hope that God will give me the strength for it and, because of that hope, I am calm in the inmost depths of my heart. Ba is with me.
Tell Chhotalal that his pen appears to have grown stale again.
 Let me have more details about the progress in weaving.

  	I have your letter. It bespeaks your love for me. I am grateful. I 	have already written to Natarajan that he has been hasty in forming 	the opinion he has done.libtech_803_footnoteInstead of dealing with your arguments, I would rather 	explain what I mean by “satyagraha”. Although I use the phrase 	“passive resistance”, it does not fully connote what I have in 	mind. Please forget all about it. I apply to political matters the 	same law which regulates our conduct in the family. In India, I find 	that people act under the shadow of fear, do not tell the truth out 	of fear, deceiving themselves and the Government. The juniormost 	police       
 officer can ruin the reputation of a big man of wealth. I think it is the duty of every leader to get out of this state of mind. The officers are not amenable to the public. They think their actions are divinely inspired and cannot conceivably be opposed. It will be a service to them, and therefore to the State, to help them get rid of this notion. Wherever, therefore, I find people submitting to injustice out of fear, I tell them that, to shake off imposed hardships, they must suffer voluntarily. This is satyagraha. To make others suffer in order to save ourselves from suffering is duragraha, brute force. When a bullock is hurt, he kicks. When a man is oppressed, he should employ soul force to fight himself free, suffering voluntarily to that end.
 This is not the first time that hell has been let loose on the people of Kheda district. In the past too they have suffered much. Even the womenfolk of that place tell my wife of it. This time, they spoke out against the hardship of having to pay the land revenue. If they pay up, it will be done not willingly but through fear. For doing so, many of them will have to part with their cattle or have their valuable trees cut down. How can one bear to see this suffering? I have seen it with my own eyes. What is the way out? Should I send petitions? I did. Natarajan says that we should approach the Viceroy or proceed to England. What relief will this bring to the riots? The trees will have been cut down meanwhile and the dues paid. What will be the point of agitating thereafter? Let it be understood that the struggle is not for amendment of the law but against the manner of its administration. What is the use of an appeal after a convict is hanged? Many an innocent person has been so hanged and all that through our indifference. We had only two courses open to us. Either resist the tax collector by force or tell him in all civil that we would not pay the tax. “He will recover it, all the same; in what way will you have saved the people, then?” Surely, you will not put this question? If you do, I have given my reply in the very beginning.
 It happens, incidentally, that in this struggle the people are being educated about religion, right conduct, unity, truth and non-violence and the Government to respect public opinion. There is no room for hatred at all. We have no desire to seek relief by bringing pressure on the Government, but by awakening its sense of justice. The outcome will in every case be good. In the end, people will have but grown stronger in spirit. What will it matter even if, being weak, the people surrender? Self-suffering never goes in vain.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 you.

 [From 	Gujarati]  Mahadevbhaini 	Diary, Vol. IV         April 	12, 1918  	The friends here have come after doing an important piece of work. 	They told the Commissioner boldly what it was necessary that he 	should be told. That to my mind is our victory. The aim behind this 	struggle is to cultivate enough courage to be able to speak to the 	officers as to friends and equals, and get our demand conceded by 	the Government. The fact that the Commissioner spoke in a friendly 	and courteous manner should itself be regarded as our victory. A 	victory is all the more a victory for ‘our having clung to justice 	and truth through all suffering. The Commissioner had told me, very 	courteously though, that the Government would confiscate lands and I 	had replied with equal courtesy and gentleness that it was welcome 	to do so but that it would not find the business profitable.  	In case of a difference between the Government and the people, the 	principle of  panchlibtech_805_footnotemust be accepted. We are fighting for  this 	principle. Considering the matter from the point of view of dharma, 	it is obligatory to have recourse to a panch. The 	relationship of the Government and its subjects is that of father 	and son, not of master and slave. It is the duty of a son to resist 	injustice on the part of his father. To 	those who have taken the pledge, it is my advice that they     
 stick to it to the very end. I shall fight on as long as they do not return to you the lands which have been confiscated. I shall not give up the struggle while I live. Only, you must also join it. If you are prepared to suffer, not minding confiscation of your lands, I am with you. Harishchandra suffered in all sorts of ways, got himself sold to a low-caste family and lost everything, but he clung to truth. It is my hope that all of you will be such Harishchandras. It is my unshakeable belief that to follow dharma is to live it. Chanting of devotional songs and prayers does not amount to following dharma. One must have unwavering faith in God. We have thus to cultivate knowledge of the self, that is, knowledge of the powers of the soul.
 Mr. Pratt has described me as a sannyasi. He was both right and wrong. I do not claim to be a sannyasi. I am as liable to err as you; the difference is this, that I desire to be a sannyasi and constantly strive to be one. It is my firm conviction that political problems can be solved through satyagraha. That our struggle has brought about a change in Mr. Pratt’s attitude—this is soul-force.
 To lose one’s land in the fight is nothing very great. It is a householder, not a sannyasi, who is in a position to sacrifice land. They are not sannyasis in Europe who are shedding rivers of blood; they are but householders. Mr. Lloyd George, running all over the place, himself and his possessions at the disposal of the country, is he  a sannyasi? Is the war which England is fighting one for land? Surely not. Why, she felt, should Germany be allowed to have her way? Germany, too, on her part, is fighting for her self-respect. She wants to vindicate herself. We have been assured by some others that we shall not starve. The only assurance the people of Europe have is the strength of their arms. They see so many of their sons dying every second, but they don’t shed tears over them. You will have your lands back with honour in this struggle. If you put up with the loss of your lands, sacrificing your very souls in doing so, you will earn a name for yourselves not only in Kheda district but in the whole of India.
 Finally, I have only this to tell you: whatever the cost, honour the pledge you have taken with God as witness and with  full knowledge and understanding. And have faith, not in me, but in God.
 What does it matter even if you lose your lands? We shall earn greater respect and fame by doing so. The Government will also take pride in ruling over such a brave people.
I once told Mr. Pratt that theirs was a rule of fear and terror
 and that, if  they  were  to  rule,  instead,  with  love  and  due  respect for the people, their rule would last for ever. I have told you again and again, and do so emphatically even here, that, if you honour your pledge at all costs, victory is assuredly yours.

CHRONICLE”libtech_810_footnote","
         NADIAD 
    TO  THE 	EDITOR 	THE CHRONICLE 	BOMBAY  SIR,  April 	15, 1918 
  	The publication of the summary of the Commissioner’s Gujarati 	address to the Kaira cultivatorslibtech_811_footnotenecessitates a reply in justice to the latter as also 	the workers.  	I have before me a verbatim report of the speech. It is more direct 	than the summary in the laying down of the  Government policy. The 	Commissioner’s position is that the revenue authorities’ 	decision regarding suspension is final. They may and do receive and 	hear complaints from the ryots, but the finality of  their  decision 	cannot be questioned. This is the crux of the struggle. It is 	contended on behalf of the ryots that, where there are, in matters 	of administrative orders, sharp differences of opinion between local 	officials and them, the points of differences are and ought to be 	referred to an impartial committee of inquiry. This, it is held, 	constitutes the strength of to the British Constitution. The 	Commissioner has on principle rejected this position and invited a 	crisis. And he has made such a fetish of it that he armed himself 	beforehand with a letter from Lord Wellingdon to the effect that 	even      
 he should not interfere with the Commissioner’s decision. He brings in the War to defend his position and adjures the ryots and me to desist from our cause at this time of peril to the Empire. But I venture to suggest that the Commissioner’s attitude constitutes a  peril  far graver than the German peril, and I am serving the Empire in trying to deliver it from this peril from within. There is no mistaking the fact that India is waking up from its long sleep. The ryots do not need to be literate to appreciate their rights and their duties. They have but to realize their invulnerable power and no Government, however strong, can stand against their will. The Kaira ryots are solving an Imperial problem of the first magnitude in India. They will show that it is impossible to govern men without their consent. Once  the  Civil  Service realizes this position, it will supply to India truly Civil Servants who will be the bulwark of the people’s rights. Today the Civil Service rule is a rule of fear. The Kaira ryot is fighting for the rule of love. It  is the Commissioner who has produced the crisis. It was, as it is now, his duty to placate the people when he saw that they held a different view. The revenue of India will be no more in danger because a Commissioner yields to the popular demands and grants concessions than the administration of justice was in danger, when Mrs. Maybrick was reprieved purely in obedience to the popular will, or the Empire was in danger because a corner of a mosque in Cawnpore was replaced in obedience to the same demand. Had I hesitated to advise the people to stand against the Commissioner’s refusal to listen to their prayer, instead of taking the open and healthy course it has taken, their discontent would have burrowed under and bred ill will. That son is a true son of his father, who rather than harbour ill will against him, frankly but respectfully tells him all he feels and equally respectfully resists him, if he cannot truthfully obey his commands. I apply the same law to the relations between the Government and the people. There cannot be seasons when a man must suspend his conscience. But just as a wise father will quickly agree with his son and not incur his ill-will, especially if the family was in danger from without, even so a wise Government will quickly agree with the ryots, rather than incur their displeasure. War cannot be permitted to give a licence to the officials to exact obedience to their orders, even though the ryots may consider them to be unreasonable and unjust.
 The Commissioner steels the hearts of the ryots for continuing their course by telling them that for a revenue of four lakhs of rupees, he will for ever confiscate his hundred and fifty thousand acres of
 land worth over 3 crores of rupees, and for ever declare the holders, their wives and children unworthy of holding any lands in Kaira. He considers the ryots to be misguided and contumacious in the same breath. These are solemn words:
 Do not be under the impression that our mamlatdars and our Talatis will realize the assessment by attaching and selling your movable property. We are not going to trouble ourselves so much. Our officers’ time is valuable. Only by your bringing in the monies shall the treasuries be filled. This is no threat. You take it from me that parents never threaten their children. They only advise. But if you do not pay the dues, your lands will be confiscated. Many people say that this will not happen. But I say it will. I have no need to take a vow. I shall prove that I mean what I say. The lands of those who do not pay will be confiscated. Those who are contumacious will get no lands in future. Government do not want their names on their Records of Ryots. Those who go out shall never be admitted again.
 I hold that it is the sacred duty of every loyal citizen to fight unto death against such a spirit of vindictiveness and tyranny. The Commissioner has done the Ahmedabad strikers and  me  a  cruel wrong in saying that the strikers knowingly broke their vow. He was present at the meeting where the settlement was declared. He may hold that the strikers had broken their vow (though his speech at the  meeting produced a contrary impression) but there is nothing to show that the strikers knowingly broke their vow. On the contrary, it was entirely kept by their resuming their work on their getting for the first day wages demanded by them, and the final decision as to wages being referred to arbitration. The strikers had suggested arbitration which the mill-owners had rejected.
 Their struggle in its essence was for a 35 per cent increase in their wages or such increase as an arbitration board may decide. And this is what they have got. The hit at the strikers and me is, I regret to have to say, a hit below the belt.

DEAR MR. PRATT,
I thank you for your note.
 I venture to think that you are prejudiced against the Home Rulers quite unnecessarily.libtech_812_footnoteThey are not so bad as you think them to be. In any case I must take the material that I see before me and improve it where it is bad. I find the Home Rulers to be the easiest people to get on with not because I fall in with their  views  very quickly but because I appeal to their sense of right and wrong and am patient with them. Finding mine to be the superior method they accept it in place of their own. They try to substitute love for hatred. You could do likewise and you can make them yours.
 It is likely that both the Nadiad and the Ahmedabad Home Rulers have a valid answer to your charges. Their selflessness in their relations with me disposes me to think that they are not likely to be guided by sordid motives in their conduct of Municipal affairs. I ask you to trust them and secure their co-operation.
 The Kheda people do not render blind obedience to me. They are not allowed to do so. And I have no doubt that if they follow my advice to the  last  they  cannot  but  be  elevated  morally.  For  does not conscious suffering always exalt a nation? The passive resisters of South Africa are today the strongest supporters of the Government. Their resistance was based on faith in the Government’s ultimate justice.
 Were you not cruelly unjust to the strikers and me? Do you believe that the latter broke their vow? And whatever may be your belief your suggestion that the strikers willingly broke the vow is surely the unkindest cut of all. Your speech at the strikers’ meeting did not leave on my mind the impression that you created at the
 
 
 Kheda cultivators’ meeting.libtech_813_footnoteAll the compliments  you  pay  me  are undeserved [by] me if I have become party to the strikers’ breaking the vow.

 covered the chothai amounts. Should not the chothai amounts be refunded?

 I have just heard that the lands of twenty-five of you have been confiscated. If this is true, I congratulate you on your being the first. I believe the lands will stand confiscated only on paper. However, as you have taken the vow to bear every kind of suffering, I need say nothing to console you. I offer you only congratulations.

 April 16, 1918
 If a person whose name we chance to mention appears unexpectedly at the spot, we usually say that he will live to be a hundred years. Thus has it happened here. The moment we thought of Vallabhbhai, we sighted him coming this way. I had hoped to meet you last week, but I could not come here as I had to go to Bombay, and was-then at Ahmedabad to see Mr. Pratt. Before I acquaint you with the talks I have had with the top officers whom I met in Bombay, let me tell you what I heard about you in Nadiad. I was told that the people of Od are quite spirited but that they have, till now, used their courage and strength, not for their good, but in quarrelling and wrangling among themselves. And so it happens that this soil  of Kheda, fertile and lovely, which your forefathers had transformed into a land of gold, has been ruined while you have been stubbornly fighting of your claims against one another.libtech_815_footnotelibtech_816_footnoteWe shall not succeed in a struggle of any kind so long as this state of affairs continues. You
 
 have taken the pledge to carry on our struggle to the bitter end and secure justice. I can assure you that, if we could forget our past enmities and live together harmoniously, success is ours.
 Mr. Pratt, Mr. Carmichael and [Sir James] Duboulay shook  heads and strongly disapproved of our struggle. During the course of our talks, they remarked: “You do not know the people of Kheda. We do not agree that this struggle will result in their progress and uplift or raise them morally. Rather, it will teach them to be defiant.” I am telling you what opinion the top officials of the Revenue Department hold about you. In the struggle you have embarked upon, you must maintain the utmost truthfulness, not partial. When Prahlad was asked, “Where is your God Vishnu?”, he replied: “On land and in water, in the sky and in the nether regions; I see the Almighty Vishnu wherever  I look.” In the same way, only if we find truth all round us may we call this struggle satyagraha. We cannot have one set of manners in public and another in private. Truth is all pervasive as the Essence that we know as Vishnu. Just as we cannot say that Vishnu is non-existent in a certain place, so also we cannot say that truth exists at one place but not at some other.
 As you all belong to the same village and the same community and follow the same profession, you must learn to apologize to one another [for your errors] and live harmoniously. Anyone who says that satyagraha may be used only against the Government has not understood the meaning of satyagraha at all. We do not want to fight the Government with threats and arrogant defiance; we want to fight it by submitting ourselves voluntarily to suffering. Those who suffer with understanding and knowledge to end suffering always succeed. This is the only way for you if you wish to win in this struggle. In Nayaka, notices of confiscation were issued to twenty-five farmers and their lands were confiscated. I wrote a  letterlibtech_817_footnoteto  congratulate  these brave friends when I heard of this. I told them that the confiscation would remain only in the Government records. All the same, I said, their pledge was that they would remain adamant even if their lands were confiscated, that there was no need to cheer up satyagrahis. They should have nothing but congratulations. This being an occasion for rejoicing, I sent them congratulations, not consolations. I appeal to you also to welcome gladly orders of confiscation. I cannot even dream that the Government will ever be able to confiscate our lands.
 
 That is impossible under British rule. Should the impossible become possible, I shall have no way open to me but to make myself an outlaw against the British Government, which boils down to this, that the lands will not really be confiscated. You have committed no crime in taking the pledge; on the contrary, by doing so, you have averred your loyalty to the State. The crops having been less than four annas, we appealed for suspension of the collection of land revenue as provided in their law, made petitions, held meetings to ask for some relief and our representatives in the legislature tried all remedies provided in law. The Government turned a deaf ear to all this. What, then, should a brave, manly and loyal people do under the circumstances ? The right relation between the Government and the people is that, in case of difference between the two, the former should always bow to popular opinion.
 We do not demand that the Government should accept what we say and yield. We ask that, if our case is proved, justice be done to us. We asked for the appointment of arbitrators, but the Government turned down even that request. Mr. Pratt believes that the  people should have no say in the matter. We have been victims of this policy for the last fifty years; we have become impoverished through fear. We have not money enough for repairs to our houses. Our crops grow poorer. How can God look kindly on us either, so long as we remain such cowards? Even the rains are regular where the king and his subjects are truthful in their dealings. The two sides are at odds, each holding to its own view as a matter of prestige. The people insist on their view of the matter being right and the Government on its. We argue that the people are speaking the truth and yet there is no relief. This struggle will show what the Government should do in case of difference between it and the people. All India has its eyes upon you. Have courage and hold out; don’t prove yourselves cowards. It is prudence not to embark upon a venture but, having once done so, it is not for a brave man to give it up.
 I have been told to beware of Patidars and  the  people  of Gujarat in general. But I  look  upon  all  as  being  no  better  or  worse than I am. All have the same atman and are equal in their powers. We can have the  atman grow  as  we  will      Such  is  my
 experience. This is to your good and will secure you relief. I hope, therefore, that you will hold on. The Patidars are a venturesome community; they are Kshatriyas. They know that their lands are theirs and so it is natural that they should be proud of them. They should
 
 not go back on their plighted word, should not betray their Kshatriya blood but fight on to the last and compel the Government to bow to public opinion. If they can do this, swaraj is in the hollow of our palms. Swaraj consists in knowing our rights and our duties. Mr. Montagu may come over from England and grant us seemingly big rights, but they will avail us nothing unless we grow conscious of our rights and obligations. This requires some education and training. I should think you have some elementary knowledge and under- standing of these matters. I know likewise that you have taken the pledge in this struggle after full deliberation. You must abide by it with an intelligent understanding of its spirit. Malice has no place in this struggle; nor the sword, nor the  dhariyalibtech_818_footnote. Our sole weapon is to abide by truth, and our arms are faith and courage. Satyagraha knows no defeat. To be sure, we shall suffer defeat if we value our lands more than our self-respect. I am confident that my faith in the people of Kheda will not prove to have been misplaced. I pray you will give a good fight to the Government and bring glory to the name of Kheda.

          NADIAD, 
  Chaitra 	Sud 7, 	1974 [April 	17, 1918]  	The most striking instance of the terrible  excesses  of Hinduism’s 	our treatment of the Antyajas. How degrading and shameful it 	is, Shri Amritlal Padhiar has set out vividly in his Antyaj 	Stotra. There is some exaggeration in it, thanks to the 	poet in him, but it is slight. Shri Padhiar has given a 	heart-rending  picture  which cannot but fill the reader with horror 	to the very roots of his being. He has poured forth his indignation 	in the stotra. It should be read out to men and women in 	their millions, in the same way that works like the Bhagavat are 	read out to them in every square. Till we have rid ourselves of this 	taint of untouchability, the big question will remain whether we 	have become fit for swaraj. If slave-owners can be said to be fit, 	then perhaps we are. Let it not be forgotten that we  are ourselves 	under subjection at present. Those who desire to be free    
 from this state should all the more pay attention to their own evils. The little, mole-like faults of those who have fallen on evil times seem to others as huge as the Himalayas. Something of this kind has happened about our conduct towards the Antyajas; what is more to the point, the evil itself is a Himalayan one and hence it obstructs our progress. I have studied, with care and in a spirit of humility, the controversy which has followed in the wake of the Antyaj Conference at  Godhra.libtech_819_footnoteI   have   not   come   across   a   single   convincing   reason justifying the practice of untouchability. Where the scriptures themselves are under attack, to quote from them is like the blind man denying the existence of what he does not see. If we cannot defend our conduct by reason, the authority of scriptures is no avail. They cannot be above reason and morality. If these latter are given the go- by any fraud can be justified in the name of religion.
 We shall have to make such a sustained effort to purge ourselves of this terrible sin that, as Shri Padhiar points out, the effort will by itself raise us very high. If we make it in our traditional manner, we shall have achieved our aim while advancing in the path of dharma; if we follow the method they do in the West, a gulf will be created between us and the Antyajas.
 It is cowardly for anyone to suggest that the Antyajas will be emancipated when the old generation has passed away. Our worth as men consists in doing tapascharya and awakening in our elders compassion and the purest sense of dharma. That and nothing less is our duty. If we boldly translate our words into action, the task can be accomplished quite soon. It is a mean desire to wish to kill an enemy so that one may rule over his kingdom afterwards; dharma consists in winning him over to our way of thinking and converting him into a friend. Shri Padhiar will have to shake off his cowardice.

298,"April 17, 1918",MESSAGE T0 SATYAGRAHI AGRICULTURISTSlibtech_820_footnote,"
    
 NADIAD,
 April 17, 1918
 You did well to listen to Mr. Pratt attentively and courageously. That is the right way for satyagrahis. We have had to disobey the orders of the Government about revenue, but we should not fail in the courtesy due to Government officers. We want freedom from fear and slavery, but have no desire to forget our manners. Rude, of course, we can never be. In satyagraha, one should always show due courtesy.
 The Commissioner pointed out the rights as also the duties of agriculturists and his advice in regard to both was worthy enough, but the gentleman failed to say that every human being has one fundamental right and obligation. A man owes it as a duty to refuse to do anything out of fear and, therefore, when anyone holds out a threat in order to force him to do something, he has a right to resist. By virtue of this right, the people of Kheda are at present respectfully disobeying the Government’s order. We believe that the crops this year have been less than four annas and that, accordingly, the collection of Government dues should be suspended. If, therefore, we pay the assessment which ought to have been suspended, we shall be doing so only out of fear that our movable property or our lands might be confiscated. If we give way to this fear, we shall become incapable of any manly effort. About eighty per cent of the farmers have paid up the dues out of this fear and, therefore, it is for the remaining twenty per cent to redeem the honour of all. Anyone who has lost his manliness cannot even show true loyalty. The difference between animals and man lies only in the latter’s manliness. This is a fight for asserting our manliness.
 If the orders of the Revenue Department or any other Government orders are not revised despite petitions, it is not the spirit of the British Constitution that they must be obeyed meekly. There is no such political doctrine. It is the birth-right and the duty of the people to disobey orders which, on mature consideration, they regard as unjust or oppressive. The rule which obtains in the affairs of a family is equally applicable to the relations of a Government and its
 
 subjects and a violation of this rule leads to a conflict between the two: the subjects turn disloyal in secret and the Government ceases to trust anyone and becomes suspicious. In disobeying an order of the Government, one thing must be remembered. We cannot claim with certainty that the order in question is unjust; though we may think it so, it may in fact be just. Therefore, as in private dealings, so a difference between a Government and its subjects should be settled through a panch. This is what our ancient kings used to do. The British Government always does so. Such a panch is called a ‘commission’ or ‘committee’ and in order to save the prestige of the Government the recommendations of the panch are not made enforceable through a court but are left to the  discretion  of  the former. The ultimate result, though, is the same as in arbitration of the usual kind. Government cannot be carried on without taking into account public opinion. What should be done, then, if the Government refuses to appoint a committee or commission ? A people amongst whom brute force is the sole arbiter resorts to violence and seeks justice with arms. My own experience is that this method is futile. I believe also that the scriptures of all religions have denounced this manner of obtaining justice through violence and we certainly do not employ it in our domestic affairs. The straightforward course is to disobey the order and submit patiently and without anger to the consequent suffering. This will serve many purposes. If it turns out that we were in the wrong, the suffering we may have gone through would be justified; if are right, the other party, that  is,  the Government, cannot remain unmoved and ultimately it will have no option but to do justice. This is vouched for by the scriptures; they assert truth to be ever victorious; and time and again we find it is. The people of Kheda have come forward to suffer in this manner for the sake of truth, of dharma.
 Lest we should become weak, we have bound ourselves by a pledge. No people can ever rise without doing this. A pledge means unshakable resolution. The undecided man is swept from this side to that like a rudderless boat, and finally destroyed. The Commissioner says that the pledge itself was improper and taken without thought. That it was not improper, we saw earlier, inasmuch as we have the right to disobey what we believe to be an unjust order; and that it was not taken thoughtlessly, everyone who took it knows. The course of the sun may alter, but this pledge, just and taken after full deliberation, shall not be abandoned.
 I am sorry that Mr. Pratt has misrepresented the facts in his reference to the mill-hands’ strike in Ahmedabad and has violated the dictates of courtesy, justice, propriety and friendship. I hope that he has done so inadvertently. If any people in this world have honoured their pledge, the mill-workers of Ahmedabad have. They had always maintained that they would be prepared to accept any wage that the arbitrators fixed. It was because, at the time of the strike, the mill- owners repudiated this principle that the mill-hands demanded thirty- five per cent. Even afterwards, they did not refuse arbitration. They secured thirty-five per cent for the first day and so kept the letter of the pledge. To decide what they should get afterwards, an arbitrator was appointed and the workers agreed to accept whatever he awarded. Pending the award, the wages were fixed at between twenty per cent as offered by the mill-owners and thirty-five per cent as demanded by the workers. Even for this intervening period, adjustments were to be made subsequently in accordance with the arbitrators’ award. Thus the spirit of the pledge was kept. However that may be, the mill-hands certainly did not deliberately abandon their pledge, as alleged by Mr. Pratt. He is free to believe that they did; he is his own master. What is material is how the matter appeared to the workers; and this has been misrepresented by Mr. Pratt. He was present when the terms of the agreement were being explained to the mill-hands. It was shown to them how the pledge could be considered to have been kept and the agreement was readily welcomed by the workers. The gentleman was a witness to all this. Speaking on the agreement. he said:
 I am happy that the two parties have arrived at a settlement. So long as you seek and follow Mr. Gandhi’s advice, I am sure, you will succeed improving your lot and securing justice. You must bear it in mind that Mr. Gandhi and the ladies and gentlemen who helped him have suffered a great deal for you, have put themselves to trouble and shown their love for you.
 With what little intelligence I have, I fail to understand how, despite this, he talks of the pledge having been given the go-by.
 The Commissioner uttered many threats and even said that he would carry them out. That means that he will confiscate the lands of all those who have taken this pledge and will even debar their heirs from owning lands in Kheda district.
 This is a very fearful, cruel and heartless threat. I believe it issues from intense anger. When the anger has subsided, he will feel sorry for having uttered such a cruel threat. He holds the relationship between the Government and the people to be the same as between parents and children. There is no instance in the whole history of the world of parents having disinherited their children for having resisted them in a non-violent manner. The pledge you have taken may be a mistaken one—that is not inconceivable—but there is not even a trace of discourtesy or insolence or defiance in it. It is still inconceivable to me how punishment of this serious nature could be meted out for taking a pledge in a more or less religious spirit for one’s own uplift. India cannot tolerate such punishment nor will the British statesmen ever uphold it. The British public would be horrified at it. If such fearful injustice should be perpetrated in the British Empire, I can live in it only as an outlaw. But I have far greater faith in British statesmanship than the Commissioner has. And I will repeat, what I said to you before, that I consider it impossible that you should lose your lands for anything done with such pure motives as yours. Nevertheless, we too must be ready to lose our lands. On the one hand, there is your pledge and, on the other, there is your property. All that property—both movable and immovable— is nothing as compared to your pledge. Your honouring the pledge will be a far more valuable legacy for your posterity than property worth lakhs of rupees. This is  a way by following which the whole of India can raise itself and I am sure you will never abandon it. I pray to God that He may give you the strength to keep the pledge.

299,"April 17, 1918",INSTRUCTIONS TO VOLUNTEERS,"
    
 SATYAGRAHA CAMP,
 NADIAD,
 April 17, 1918
  The 	volunteers must remember 	that, as this is a 	satyagraha campaign, 	they must abide by truth 	under all circumstances.  In satyagraha, there can be no room for rancour; which means that a satyagrahi 	should utter no harsh 	word about anyone, from a ravania 
 to the Governor himself; if someone does so, it is the volunteer’s duty to stop him.
  Rudeness 	has no 	place in 	satyagraha. Perfect 	courtesy must 	be shown even to 	those who 	may look upon us 	as their enemies 	and the 	villagers must 	be taught 	to do the 	same. Rudeness may 	harm our cause 	and the struggle 	may be 	unduly prolonged. 	The volunteers 	should give the 	most serious 	attention to this 	matter and think 	out in 	their minds as 	many examples 	as possible 	of the 	advantages accruing 	from courtesy and 	the disadvantages 	resulting from 	rudeness and 	explain them to 	the people.  The 	volunteers must remember 	that this is a holy 	war. We embarked 	upon it 	because, had 	we not, we 	would have failed in 	our dharma. And 	so all the rules 	which are essential 	for living 	a religious 	life must be 	observed here too.  We 	are opposing 	the intoxication 	of power, that is, the 	blind application 	of law, 	and not authority 	as such. 	The difference 	must never 	be lost 	sight of. It is, 	therefore, our 	duty to help 	the officers in their other work.  We 	are to apply 	here the 	same principle that 	we follow in a  domestic 	quarrel. We should 	think of the 	Government and 	the people as 	constituting a 	large family and 	act accordingly.  We 	are not to 	boycott or 	treat with scorn those 	who hold different views from ours. It 	must be 	our resolve 	to win 	them over by 	courteous behaviour.  We 	must not 	try to be clever. We 	must always be frank 	and straightforward.  When 	they stay in villages, 	the volunteers 	should demand the fewest 	services from the 	village-folk. Wherever 	it is possible 	to reach 	a place 	on foot, they should 	avoid using a vehicle. 	We must 	insist on being 	served the 	simplest food. 	Restraining them 	from preparing dainties 	will add grace to the service we render.  As 	they move about 	in villages, 	the volunteers 	should observe the 	economic condition of 	the people 	and the deficiencies in 	their education and 	try, in 	their spare time, to 	make them good.  If 	they can, they should 	create opportunities when 	they may teach the 	village children.  If 	they notice 	any violation 	of the 	rules of good 	health, they 	should draw the 	villagers’ attention 	to the fact.  If, 	at any 	place, they 	find people engaged in 	quarrelling among 	themselves, the volunteers should try to save them from their quarrels.  They 	should read out to 	the people, 	when the latter 	are free, 	books which 	promote satyagraha. They 	may read 	out stories of 	Prahlad, Harishchandra 	and others. 	The people 	should also be made 	familiar with 	instances of 	pure satyagraha 	to be found 	in the West 	and in 	Islamic literature.  At 	no time 	and under 	no circumstances 	is the use of  arms 	permitted in 	satyagraha. It 	should never 	be forgotten that 	in this struggle the 	highest type 	of non-violence is to be 	maintained. Satyagraha 	means fighting 	oppression through 	voluntary suffering. 	There can 	be no question 	here of making anyone 	else suffer. 	Satyagraha is always 	successful; it can never 	meet with defeat: let 	every volunteer 	understand this himself 	and then 	explain it to the 	people.

  	I am writing this at a little village where I have arrived with Mrs. 	Gandhi and others to preach passive resistance. Here is the 	cutting.libtech_821_footnoteThe 	fight is great but it taxes me to the utmost  	I will not discuss your latest letter; I simply want to say, “Do 	what you like. Phoenix and all it means are just as much yours as 	mine. You are on the spot.  You  must  do  what  you  think  best.  	I can but advise.” You are right; my views about the vernaculars 	must have coloured my view about Indian Opinion. I do 	want it to appear in English, but I feel that if it could not be 	published in English it could at least be published in Gujarati. 	Perhaps you would have me say the reverse. It is enough for me to 	know that you are on the spot. My affection for you and trust in you 	remain undiminished. I recall many more of the touching 	conversations we had in Joubert Park and

 April 17, 1918
 We are carrying on this struggle to secure justice from the Government. Whilst coming here, I observed people using goads to urge bullocks yoked to carts or ploughs. This cruelty is unforgivable in us, especially as we claim to be protectors of cows. To save the cow we engage in big fights with Muslims, but we do not hesitate to apply goads to bullocks. It is for sins such as these that we have to suffer. I trust the use of goads will disappear from now. When, driving here in a bullock-cart from Petlad station, I saw the bullocks being pricked with a goad, I felt that refraining from wearing shoes yet driving in a cart was a far greater sin than wearing shoes. I am here today not to talk about kindness to animals but about justice; all the  same,  believing that we must do justice to others if we want justice for ourselves, I took the occasion to say all this. It is not so very difficult to pay the land revenue to the Government. One can borrow the money from someone or some land or a buffalo and pay up. Then why take upon ourselves all this bother of not paying and allowing our goods and lands to be confiscated? This is howthe wise ones advise us. I have given my answer to this at many places. The question is one of principle, not merely of paying the land revenue. We pay because we are afraid of the Government; it is this fear we wish to get rid of. The gist of all that the Commissioner said was this: that the people must not disobey the Government’s order. The idea I want to put   into  you,   on   the   contrary,   is  that   there  is  no   disloyalty in
 disobeying an unjust order of the Government; rather, it is the purest loyalty to do so. To submit to an unjust order without even a protest is a sign of weakness; it is sheer cowardice. For instance, even in our domestic life, a son or a daughter, suffering injustice at the hands of parents, has the right to resist; we want to apply the same rule to our dealings with the Government. We do not oppose the Government to bring it down or seek anything from it through unfair means. We seek justice through self-suffering. Till today, we suffered out of fear and timidity and now we wish to suffer on purpose. The Government is entitled to test us. You friends, men and women, have been playing a game with the Government; but, when the Government starts confiscating your lands, it will be seen how many of you can hold out. When it has done its worst by way of repression and sees that you will not bend despite it all, it will climb down all too readily. libtech_822_footnotelibtech_823_footnoteWhen the
 people tell their Government with one voice that they will not submit to its unjust orders, the latter is bound to yield. This has ever been so. It is our duty to be loyal to the Government, What difficulty can there be for a people so loyal in obtaining justice from the British Government? That is why I tell you to remain determined till the very end and not to lose heart.
 It is desirable that you should all understand the full meaning of satyagraha. Four days ago, I met Mr. Carmichael in Bombay. He is the head of the Revenue Department. In the course of our conversation, he asked me to consider whether this struggle would ultimately raise or lower the people morally, will teach them respect for law or contempt for it. I told him that there was no fear of their moral sense or loyalty being weakened. In satyagraha, people cannot but gain in moral strength and learn to be more courteous. If we were to suffer moral harm, our struggle would not be satyagraha but duragraha. Our crops have been in most places less than four annas and, in some villages, less than six annas. That being so, according to the Revenue Code, the collection of revenue should be suspended to the extent of half the amount. This is all our demand, one which we claim as our right. Accordingly, we requested the Government  to order the suspension. It did not accept our assessment of the crops. Thereupon, we asked the appointment of a committee of inquiry. We assured the Government that, if it were proved correct,  we  would accept the officers’ assessment of the crops. Even then, the
 
 
 Government refused to appoint a committee. Under these circumstances, we should not pay the assessment. If we fail, in this struggle, to get our rights recognized by the Government, we shall never be able again to lift our heads. I notice that your big two- storeyed houses are in a dilapidated condition; the reason for this is that you have not the money with which to carry out the necessary repairs. From this I can see that the people are impoverished. Bad years are a part of our lot; cloth and food are enormously dear; diseases are so rampant that, even when there is no war, people die before their time. Having regard to the times, I have  advised  the people of Kheda district, who value their self-respects to secure justice by submitting voluntarily to injustice and oppression. We can secure it not through insolence but manliness. Our struggle is so straightforward that it is bound to increase our moral strength. I advise you emphatically, therefore, not to forsake truth on any account. Anyone who has but a glimpse of the truth, will, in every step he takes, follow truth and morality. Make courtesy and truth a part of your life. Caught in a big fire, let us all unite and fight the Government. This is a fine opportunity for us to work for our uplift.
 I repeat to all friends: “Remain steadfast.” To the ladies, I say: “Give courage to your husbands, brothers, sons.”

 I had hoped to meet you all last week, but I went to Ahmedabad to see the Commissioner and then I had to go to Bombay to meet his superior, Mr. Carmichael. I could not, therefore, come earlier as I had hoped to. If Vallabhbhai and I have come here to Chikhodra and the neighbouring villages, where reigns the order of Dayanand Saraswati, it is not, certainly, to give you encouragement but to receive it  ourselves from you, or, if I may say so, not to kindle fire in you but to receive some of that divine light from you. I am sure you will prove me right by holding out in this struggle till the very last.
 Dayanand Saraswati is among the foremost of the great spiritual teachers India has produced in the past. I hope that this and the surrounding villages, following as they do this great teacher, will
 resound with holy chants some the Vedas and also live their life as enjoined by the Vedas.
 I hope, moreover, that they will observe the disciplines of yamalibtech_824_footnote- niyamalibtech_825_footnoteand rigorously keep the vow of swadeshi as well. It would pain me very much to learn that the people of Chikhodra do not wear locally produced cloth, but use other foreign or mill-made cloth. I am taken aback as I see the clothes of many of you here. I see that the cloth is mill-made, either foreign or Indian. To my mind, mill-made cloth is seventy-five per cent foreign. The machinery on which the cloth is woven is foreign and all its benefit goes to foreign workers. Those who wear mill-made cloth may have this satisfaction that the money they pay for its manufacture will go to our mill-hands. But hardly anyone stops to consider that these mill-hands, leaving their agriculture, give up a fine profession and a simple life to join the mills. It is my advice, therefore, that you, in this and the surrounding villages, where Dayanand Saraswati’s order holds sway, should use your own cloth and so keep the rule of non-possession and that of non-violence, for both these are included in the law of swadeshi. This latter holds within itself the basic principles of satyagraha. Having explained them in brief, I proceed to the main subject.
 In employing satyagraha against the injustice done by the Government, adherence to truth and non-violence is very necessary. Where the crops have been less than six annas, collection of half the revenue should be suspended, as provided in the rules framed by the Government. It refuses to abide by this rule and tells you in these harsh and bitter words: “Nothing will avail you in this; you will rather stand to lose. Nor can the people have any  say  on  the  Revenue Code.” The Government argues that we cannot take any  matter arising out of it to the High Court or any other court, but that the people should petition the Collector, approach the Commissioner in the event of the Collector turning down their petition, and, if the latter refuses to intervene, they may go right up to the Governor. In the present case, however, the Commissioner has spared no threats; not stopping at this, he had a letter of the Governor’s brought to the meeting and went to the length of saying that whatever he did would be upheld by the Governor. I have never seen or heard of such
 
 
 unlimited authority in the hands of one single officer anywhere. Our kings sometimes used to oppress the subjects and rob them of their possessions, but I cannot believe that such a thing can happen under British rule. If, keeping within the limits of the law, we decide not to pay the land revenue, there is no disloyalty to the Government. Most respectfully we accept the law and want the Government officers also to be governed by it, I would advise you to let your lands be confiscated, even if they be worth not three million but three hundred million. Ours is a fight in the way of satyagraha and we must fight it with the purest soul-force. Its secret lies in bearing anything that may be inflicted on us. This implies the observance of perfect  non- violence; and hence it is that we have called it a holy fight. We want to win, not by striking terror in the rulers, but by awakening their sense of justice. We are guilty of no treason in doing so nor do we thereby prove ourselves enemies of religion. Our struggle is based on truth and we claim justice from the Government on humanitarian, religious and ethical grounds. Our action is thus: altogether unexceptionable. I have faith in you, men and women of Chikhodra, that you will understand the principles of satyagraha aright and follow them. There is no remedy like satyagraha to see an end to your suffering. If you use it, you will discover that it alone is the right remedy against our present grievances and those to come. You should hold out till the last in the fight on which you have embarked. If you fail to do so, you will have betrayed your religion and the consequences for India will be unhappy. This struggle will make it clear to the administration here in Kheda district that it cannot ruin by ignoring popular opinion; that only by respecting public opinion can it maintain itself. This is the real aim behind our struggle and it is for you to see that it is attained. You have taken the pledge to uphold truth. If you read the Ramayana, you will realize what value to attach to one’s word. Abiding by one’s word, one may achieve moksha. Be loyal to your pledge, no matter how much you suffer, no matter even if the universe should be blown up. To the ladies, I shall say only this: “Even if you have to part with your furniture and other household things, your cattle and your land, do not despair. Help the men in your families to honour their pledge. May God give you the wisdom to be loyal to that pledge.”

 Last week Vallabhbhai and I were to be here, but I had to go to Bombay and Ahmedabad and could not come. I apologize to you for this.
 Owing to the heat today, I casually asked how far the venue of the meeting was. I was informed that it was close by, so I decided-to walk down. However, my young friends saw to it that I did not feel the heat. To be sure, that bespeaks their love for me. Their kind turn also suggests that the advice I have been giving has appealed to you all. You know, however, that my advice will let neither you nor me sleep soundly, nor will it permit any rest to my co-workers. It can mean only suffering, sleepless nights and running from village to village. You should let your buffaloes be seized, your jewellery taken away and your lands confiscated. It is because you believe that I advise you for your good that you shower so much love on me. I am very happy at this, but I am also fully aware, at the same time, what responsibility rests on me and how it increases as the fight intensifies. Despite the complexity and the seriousness of the problem, I do not feel even in the inmost depth of my heart that I should withdraw this advice. As days pass and the struggle assumes its real form, I feel that, had I not given the advice I did to the people of Kheda district, I would have failed in my duty to Gujarat. Had I not given this advice, my trying to serve society and the country, while comfortably settled here in Gujarat, would have made me always feel that my dedication was imperfect in that measure. The advice I have given in the present situation will raise the moral standards of men and women. Simultaneously, the people of Kheda will come up and their triumph will be proclaimed all over India.
 Looking at the matter from another point of view, the Govern- ment has made it a policy not to consult the people or respect their opinions at all. This is our experience in legislatures, municipalities and other public institutions and that is so because they do not have the backing of public opinion behind them.libtech_827_footnoteWhen we are afraid of
 
 even the petty constable and take to our heels at the mere sight of an approaching ravania, how can we ever face a big officer ? We dare not utter a single word before him. This condition is worse even than that of the animals. These, when they have had enough of beating, obstinately refuse to move or do our will. In comparison with them, consider what sort of condition ours is. If, therefore, we would give proof of our being men, we must shed fear; if we do, we shall win in this struggle. In the same way that in Mr. Pratt’s meeting at Nadiad the farmers replied to him boldly, we should cultivate sufficient courage to place the facts even before the Governor. We shall not be insolent in our fight; we desire to fight by means of soul-force, to win through self-suffering. This is a divine, immutable law; our scriptures declare that, if we would have happiness, we must go  through suffering, do tapascharya. King Dasharatha did so, to get sons like Bharata, Rama, Lakshmana and Shatrughna. And so did King Nala, too, for the sake of truth and self-respect, bearing countless afflictions. That is the reason why at early dawn we remind ourselves of these ever memorable holy souls. These divine tales are a part of our heritage.   libtech_828_footnote
 By suffering voluntarily, we seek through truth and non-violence to end our sufferings     libtech_829_footnotelibtech_830_footnoteThe people of Kheda district have taken upon
 themselves to demonstrate this principle to the world. It is a principle which will be of great service to the world        libtech_831_footnotelibtech_832_footnoteOur crop has been
 less than four annas; and so, according to the Revenue Code, the Government should have suspended the assessment this year. Mr. Pratt argues that our figures are incorrect and wants to enforce  the collection. We insist that what we say is one hundred per cent true, that  it is the Government’s figures which are incorrect, and that, accordingly, the Government should suspend the assessment. There is, thus, an element of petty self-interest in this struggle.
 But it also involves a far more important issue than this, namely, that the Government should learn to respect public opinion. As a result of this struggle, it may come about that land revenue is remitted and people may become conscious of their strength; that will be no small gain. We must, therefore, suffer and be loyal to our pledge. We did not resolve on it without thinking. We ventured on the task only after the fullest deliberation. A pledge taken with the purest of motives and for the good of the people can never be betrayed though the sun may rise in the west instead of in the east. I entreat you to cling to it. This is my humble advice. This pledge will purify us and put an end
 
 to all our sufferings. [From Gujarati] Kheda Satyagraha

 1 do not wish to speak much here. I have informed myself about the condition in the village. Where there is unity and firmness among the people, things are bound to be happy. Chothai notices have been served on you, your buffaloes have been seized and your jewellery taken away. We have borne all this. Now, we are threatened with confiscation of lands. Never forget that the respect we enjoy in society will be safe, and so also our lands, only if we keep our pledge. The latter cannot take precedence over the former. If all of you are ready to fight it out with the Government, we shall see what the Government gains by taking over our lands. In Nayaka, one hundred and seventy-eight bighas of land have been confiscated; but I do not believe that land has been confiscated because it is entered so in the register. The Government does not intend to enclose the lands with walls, so that we may not be able to reach them, nor will it be able to do anything of the sort in this satyagraha struggle. Hold out tenaciously, therefore; so you will bring glory to yourselves and to India. If you yield, agriculturists all over India will be demoralized. Bear in mind another thing. Those who have recourse to satyagraha must not be overbearing in their conduct towards others. This is an immutable truth, of universal range like the far-spread rays of the sun. Just as we tell the Government not to use its power as a goad with which to drive us, so also you in your turn must deal out perfect justice to people of all the communities in your town or village.

 I came to your village once before but, yielding to your pressure, we have all come here again. The teacher here sent me a report of the interesting discussion that the people had with the mamlatdar and wanted some clarifications. That is the reason for our
 
 being here again.
 First of all, I shall say something about the arguments of the mamlatdar. He told you that you should keep the terms under which your ancestors acquired the lands from the Government. Let us consider what these terms are likely to have been.
 They could not have been what the mamlatdar said they were. The Government passes laws which serve its own convenience and, though they do not serve ours, we submit to them. For instance, we submit to the Revenue Code though we are not very happy with it. What was the practice in olden days? It was that the Government was paid chothai; in other words, it claimed one-fourth of the yield, if there was any, but nothing if there was none. This was our old system. The present Government believed that the laws it has passed have been for the benefit of the people. Instead of claiming a share of the produce, this Government introduced the system of collecting  the Land revenue in cash. I do not believe that any advantage has accrued to the people by this law of the Government. One of the provisions in the Land Revenue Code is to the effect that, if the crops are less than four annas, collection of the assessment should be suspended. But the officers argue that it is in the discretion of the Government whether or not to order such suspension and that it may use the discretion only if it so chooses. This is naked injustice. Governments can maintain their authority only in one way, and that is by respecting public opinion.
 Our struggle is not merely for securing suspension of the land revenue; a struggle for such relief would be a petty affair. In truth, we are fighting for the sake of the important issue which is involved in it. That is the issue of democracy, of the revival of democratic Government. The people have awakened and begun to understand their rights. A full understanding of these rights is what is meant by swaraj. Let us water the seeds of the fundamental issues involved in this struggle, and they will produce sweet fruits for posterity, as sweet as the pleasant shade of this banyan tree. That is the aim this struggle has set before itself. Let the Government ridicule us; but you must realize that this struggle is not for securing a little relief in terms of money, it is in the nature of a foundation for a future democratic structure.
 The people will be ruined if they let go their rights out of weakness. Sir William Wedderburn, an ardent and sympathetic friend of the Indian people used to say all his life that, as the village
 panchayats gradually disappeared, along with them was lost the key to swaraj. These panchayats cannot be revived by writing books. If, in every village, the people learn how to manage their affairs, the true key to swaraj will have been found.
 A satyagraha struggle is an all-embracing affair. Truth is the very basis which sustains our life. If they come with an order of attachment and you have nothing with you, tell them so; if you have anything, but do not wish to surrender it, let them know that plainly.
 If you would not give provisions to Government servants, you should refuse them straight, but you may not truly say that you have no grain and therefore cannot supply the provisions they need. A satyagrahi must speak the truth on every occasion. You should understand clearly the principles of satyagraha and be guided by truth and other rules of moral conduct all your life. Truth is God. Let your jewellery and your lands be taken from you, but do not betray your dharma. I pray God to give you strength to abide by the pledge you have taken. In the revival of this way of dharma lies the key to swaraj.

 In our daily living  two  weaknesses  are  evident.  The first  is that we do all our  work  superficially;  and  the  second  is  that whatever we take in hand, we do it without any understanding of it. We do our work like the actors on a stage who  speak  out  what  they  have learnt by rote. Consequently we do not  get  the  results  we expect. In our daily dealings, we are like the actor playing Harishchandra, whom we cannot expect to be permeated with truth in every pore of his skin. This is exactly what these girls have proved by their manner of singing Vandemataram. We have got into the habit of doing our work anyhow; so long as we do not put our whole heart into our work, we shall not succeed.
 Our ancestors knew this and that is why they laid special stress on the correct pronunciation of the mantras . Any error they counted as a sin. You asked the girls to sing a grand national song like
 
 Vandemataram. We do not know in full the greatness of the song, its resonance and its tune. That is the feeling I have about this struggle, that we are fighting it half-heartedly. If that is really so, if we have failed to understand its true import, then like the singing of these girls it will be unavailing. I make these harsh remarks that you may all sit up and be more careful in this struggle.
 The second point I wish to make is that we should carry on this struggle with a full understanding of it. Mr. Pratt asked me once whether the people really understand what I have been doing. If they fail to do so [he said] the results cannot but be evil. In such a holy struggle we ought not to work half-heartedly. We are afraid of even petty officials. This should not be so. I keep telling you again and again that, even if we are to meet big and distinguished persons, we need not feel worried. We have only to make up our mind not to be awed by them and to be courteous in addressing them. If there is a difference of opinion, we should put it in proper language. If we get over these shortcomings in our struggle, we should never have to suffer defeat. We must take care that we never act thoughtlessly in this struggle. Nor should fear have any place in it. Truth suffers no harm. You must repeat this at every step.
 Vallabhbhai told me that the mamlatdar was encamped in this village for four days but had had no success. The farmers remained firm. You have shown this courage and I have nothing more to say. I just told you that I was going to Delhi. I don’t like to be away from this district, but I have to go to Delhi in connection with this struggle. The Viceroy is to hold a conference. It will consider how we can render more help in the great war that is being fought in Europe. Perhaps the question of conscription will also come up for discussion. We shall also be advised to put aside all our quarrels with the Government. But this quarrel is not of our seeking, it has been thrust upon us. I will tell them the same thing, that we did not invite this struggle, that it had been forced upon us. When can I say this to the Viceroy? Only if you are firm and true satyagrahis.
 We can never lose. It is impossible that they will confiscate our lands, for we have not committed the least offence. Who can ever stop the person who follows the path of truth? Even if your lands should be confiscated, have no fear and do not budge. We are determined to get them back by taking to the ways of outlaws, if need be. It is up to you to preserve the honour of India. This struggle has turned into one
 
 for self-respect and prestige. It is a struggle of the brave people of Kheda district to recover their lost property and prestige. We must, for this purpose, reform our ways of daily living. We must stop fighting with one another and get ready to fight oppression by an alien Government. All suffering, whether of internal or external origin, should be treated with the magic remedy of satyagraha. I would tell you, sisters, give courage to the men and for ever repeat this mantra: “The pledge can end only with death.”

 I feel tempted to talk about the difference I observed between this village and Palaj. When I entered Palaj, I noticed that there was no band there but instead there were the  zanzlibtech_836_footnotelibtech_837_footnoteand the  pakhajlibtech_838_footnotelibtech_839_footnote. Hearing them, I remembered my childhood days. The feelings of devotion they express, their sweetness and their art, I do not find in the band. The band is a foreign thing; the zanz and the pakhaj are our own. The band is an imitation, a novelty. They are ancient. The band may  sound pleasant to the English and others, but it certainly does not to me. Our ancestors invented an instrument that suited our country; for us, too, it is the only thing. In our religious ceremonies, both instrumental and vocal music find a place. Our native tunes have the power to elevate people from their fallen state; the band has no such power. Why should we, then, give up such simple, beautiful and sweet things as the zanz and the pakhaj?
 The difference between the band and the zanz-pakhaj is the difference between modern and ancient ways. If our struggle is the same kind of thing as this band, it will come to nought. Just as the zanz-pakhaj suggest a number of ideas, our struggle also has beautiful truths underlying it. If you grasp them clearly, we shall get wonderful results out of them.
 Despite all this enthusiasm I observe in you, I am afraid there appears to be an element of play-acting in this struggle. We declare
 
 that we don’t mind confiscation of our lands, but deep down in our hearts, it seems to me, there is fear. If this is so, we are bound to lose and that will have unhappy consequences for the whole of India. I wish, therefore, that we carry on this fight, unflinchingly, with the aid of truth and dharma, as becomes our ancient civilisation.
 They say Gujarat is slumbering. Sometimes I am asked why this is so. But I think this charge that Gujarat is, like Kumbhakarnalibtech_840_footnote, in deep sleep, is undeserved. How can anyone say that, when we find so many men and women assembled here in the scorching heat of noon
 ? All the same, I should like to ask you whether we have really shaken off our slumber or are merely acting awake. The reply should come from the depths of your hearts, that you are no more acting, that you have joined the struggle in all sincerity. This struggle of ours is in the cause of truth. There should not be an iota of falsehood in it. When you succeed in convincing the Government of this, it will conduct itself as our own Government. If, on the contrary, we are trying to be smart or are hypocritical, the Government will not yield. For instance, some friends in Bhavnagar went on a strike, acting hastily. They did not know how to go on with it, not having the strength to suffer. They apologized to the Maharaja. All the world knows that the wages they receive are low but their strike secured them no increase. It gave me a shock to know that they had apologized. I do not understand why they did so. The mahajan, too, it may be said, brought humiliation to the strikers by his intervention. I hope that such a situation will not arise here. Ours is an honest request for relief, because the crops have been less than four annas. It is after the fullest deliberation that we declared we would not pay the land revenue. We knew what we were doing. We will never apologize. Our lands may be confiscated and we may be sent to jail; let us weigh this against truth, against our pledge and our self-respect. Which will you find heavier? We are resolved not to surrender, not to betray our pledge.
 What is the purpose behind our pledge? To establish our right. Armies which have been fighting sometimes pay tributes; the side that pays is considered to have accepted defeat. It is our request to the Government that it should accept this fact. The voice of the panch is the voice of God. Public opinion is always supreme; we shall have won when we make the Government concede that it is the voice of God.
 
 having been in the habit of sleeping for half the year at a stretch.
 
 But who can hope to win? There is no need to be afraid of the officer. We should always speak boldly, without reserve. The reserve between the Government and the people must go, as the false reserve between men and women must go.
 We can bring this about, not by brute force, but by soul-force or the force of love. He wins who worships soul-force. Brute force has no place in our struggle. We must win only by our soul-force. The true hero is he who is ever ready for death. That is the true Kshatriya quality and to display it is the sole aim of our struggle. When India comes to feel that it has no use for the sword, not only the British but the entire world will come to honour us. By ‘us’, I mean truth. There is no arrogance in saying this. Where there is truth, there can be no defeat. We have to be very careful that we do not show ourselves wanting in this struggle; for this, we must cease quarrelling among ourselves. Our cause is just, no doubt, but the struggle is due chiefly to Mr. Pratt. Its only aim is to bring the Government to respect public opinion. The Viceroy is to hold a Durbar in Delhi; he will there request the country’s leaders to patch up our internal quarrels. I shall tell him in reply that it is not the Kheda people who are fighting, but the Commissioner. We are fighting in self-defence. We have but held up our arm to ward off a blow; we have not attacked anyone. What would be my position, though, if meanwhile you yield? You must, therefore, remain firm and bear any losses you may be put to. Only so can it be proved that the blame lies not with the people, but with the Commissioner.
 I assure you that the Government cannot possibly confiscate your lands. They may do so on their records, but, in the absence of our signatures, the lands will not be lost to us. Till now, the responsibility was Vallabhbhai’s and mine jointly, but, when I am away in Delhi, the whole of it will be his. You, too, should share it. If you need my presence to keep you free from fear, this satyagraha will not be your struggle but mine. In truth, it is that of the people of Kheda, not mine nor Vallabhbhai’s, nor Anasuyabehn’s. I can only show you the path. It is for you to tread it. Success depends on the people of Kheda. If you remain firm and cling to truth, you are bound to win. Even the pledge, by itself, has spread your fame all over India; it is your dharma, then, to keep the pledge, to have courage, to maintain truthfulness and courtesy even while you preserve your self- respect, that you may not lose the good name you have won. Dharma is more important than lands. He who has preserved his dharma will
 never suffer defeat, will never starve. My first and last advice to you, my prayer, is this: “Never betray your pledge.’’

Impatience shows absence of love. It is enough if we refuse to help the other party in doing wrong. Your worrying is consuming you and it bars your progress. You should now come out of this state of mind.
 All impressions of sense, O son of Kunti, Are hot or cold, give pleasure or pain; They but come and pass, ever fleeting, Bear them unmoved, O Bharata.libtech_848_footnote
 Think on this verse and let it sink into your soul. It is a very powerful one and it has brought, to me at any rate, peace in moments of great anxiety. Use Santok’s services in [settling] the family quarrels of Bhupatrai.libtech_849_footnoteThey can and must be brought to an end.

 April 23, 1918
 I wish to add something to what the Chairman has told you about the steps which have been taken to secure relief from the Government. This struggle was not started by outsiders. Nobody instigated the Kheda public to launch it. There is no political motive behind it. It did not originate with the Home Rulers or with any barristers or lawyers as some people allege. I stand here to vouch for this.   It   was  started   by   the   tillers   themselves.   After   the Political
 
 Conference at Godhra, some agriculturists in Kheda  decided  to request the Government for relief in view of the excessive rains. They wrote to me, informing me that they were legally entitled to relief and asking me whether I would help. You will thus see that this struggle did not originate with outside agitators, though it is true that it  attracted the attention it did because of outside help. The support of our   Chairman   and   the   Hon’ble   Gokuldasbhailibtech_851_footnotemade   the   people confident of success. Some distinguished members of the Gujarat Sabha also made inquiries and convinced themselves that the crops had failed and that relief was called for. Their testimony was sufficient to justify the people’s stand; even so, everything possible was done to convince the officers. I testify to this.
 Satyagraha is not a way of fighting to which one can resort unless one has a real grievance. It requires more heroism than does fighting a battle. The soldier has weapons in his hand; his aim is to strike the enemy. The satyagrahi, on the contrary, fights by suffering himself. Surely, this is not for the weak and the diffident. Such a one would not be equal to the suffering. The greater the suffering a satyagrahi goes through, the purer he becomes. As gold is tested in fire, so also does a satyagrahi have to go through a fiery ordeal. His only weapon is uncompromising insistence on truth. A true satyagrahi fears nothing and holds fast to truth as he fights.
 Not men only, but women also have joined this struggle. Wonderful scenes are witnessed at the village meetings. The Women declare that even if the Government seize their buffaloes, attach their jewellery or confiscate their lands, the men must honour their pledge. This is a grand struggle, which has fired one and all. Its fragrance is spreading everywhere. It is beyond my power to describe the people of Kheda. They have it in them to help the Government in meeting the present danger. The Patidar claims to be a Kshatriya.
 The Government Press Note describes Kheda as a prosperous district, and in a sense this is quite true. As they say, “Broach is Broach, though in ruins”. When I look at people’s buildings, I am reminded of the greatness which was theirs. By their patience and diligence, by self-exertion, they have turned the land of Kheda into a beautiful garden. Tears fill my eyes, though, when I look at their houses. They say they have no money, else their fields would have been a still more pleasant sight.
The Government even now refuses the relief which it ought to
 
 have granted to such a brave people at a time of natural calamity. The reason for their lack-lustre eyes is that they have had to go through such calamities time and again. Brothers and sisters who are present at this meeting! Go to Kheda district, inspect the big earthen jars in which they store grain to see if there is any, look for crops in their fields. If they have nothing with them, what are they to do? You can imagine from this how wretched their condition must have been. This is our plight, they said. If they could pay the year’s land revenue next year, they would save a year’s interest. But saving them interest is not the idea behind this struggle. Any wealthy magnate of Bombay could easily have paid them the amount, but that would not have ended their suffering. The Government would have assumed from this that every year they could raise money on interest and pay up.
 In this struggle I wish to establish the principle that the Government cannot decide on collection of land revenue without consulting the people. Merely saying that the Land Revenue Code is bad will not bring us relief. There is only one way to save ourselves from our suffering, and that is, by suffering voluntarily, to end our miseries once for all. Mr. Pratt, the Commissioner, is plain about this matter and says that, if he suspended the collection of land revenue this year, people all over the country would think that they could stand up against the Government even in such matters.
 This is an auspicious time for learning self-suffering. We don’t get an opportunity like this every day. The people have exercised self- restraint on this occasion as was but proper that they should. The people have transformed [this struggle] into a holy war. They declare that they will suffer voluntarily so that their suffering may end....
 My experience in Kheda and Champaran teaches me this one lesson, that, if the leaders move among the people, live with them, eat and drink with them, a momentous change will come about in two years. Make a deep study of this struggle; understand the worth of the people of Kheda; give all help you can by way of sympathy and verbal support. We shall not be arrogant in seeking justice. We seek it by awakening the Government to a sense of truth. The people will keep on fighting till they have secured justice.libtech_852_footnote

DEAR SIR,
 The Right Hon’ble Mr. Montagu, the Secretary of State for India, has announced his intention to visit our country for studying at first hand the present political situation in India. He is expected to be in India by the end of October 1917
 Mr. Montagu will in due course discuss the question of Reforms with the authorities and will also receive suggestions from representative bodies. But  in view of the attitude which the Anglo-lndian Press has begun to take and is sure to take, it is not sufficient for us merely to discuss the question with the Secretaryof State as representative bodies but it is imperatively necessary to strengthen his hands against the reactionary anti-Reform forces by clearly and emphatically bringing to his notice the volume of public opinion in favour of Reforms. The opportunity is unique and to miss it would be almost culpable.
 With this view of our Sabha, at the suggestion of its President Mr. Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi has resolved to present a petition to Mr. Montagu, signed by the British subjects of Gujarat. The petition is short and is drafted by Mr. M. K. Gandhi in consultation with R. B. Ramanbhai M. Nilkanth. A copy of the petition is enclosed herein.
 You will note that the original petition is in Gujarati accompanied by an English translation. The Sabha has advisedly done so, as it is not possible to reach the masses of our countrymen through the medium of English. The  Sabha  is organising a volunteer corps for lecturing to the masses and explaining to them the Reform Scheme. The instructions to volunteers framed by Mr. Gandhi himself
 specially enjoin every volunteer not to take the signature to the petition of any person who does not understand the scheme, and of persons who are minors, students and Government servants. Every volunteer is supplied with a Gujarati translation of the Reform-Scheme with a few introductory remarks printed in pamphlet form and the volunteer is strictly to confine himself to the contents of the pamphlet.

 25 per cent in Motihari and Peeprah, and that Mr. Gandhi on behalf of the raiyats has offered to accept reduction of 40 per cent, but that those offers are now withdrawn and the arbitrators have full power to make any award they may settle.
 Under both alternatives, conditions (2) and (3) of A will apply.
 In addition under all the proposals, it shall be a condition that the existing obligation recorded in the settlement records shall be abolished and that in lieu thereof sharahbeshi shall be fixed at the rate at which it would have stood had commutation in their case taken place together with the others, less reduction that may be agreed upon or awarded by the arbitration.
 Under proposals for arbitration, both the planters and Mr. Gandhi would submit written statements of their case, and both would have the option of submitting   a written reply to such statements. The parties will not be permitted to be represented by counsel or to be heard personally as of right. The arbitrator or arbitrators to have the power to call for any papers they may desire to question the planters or any other person, and to give their award within one week of the filing of the written statements and rejoinders of the parties.

 APPENDIX IV
 REPORT OF CHAMPARAN AGRARIAN ENQUIRY COMMITTEE
 October 3, 1917
 CHAPTER I
 CONSTITUTION AND PROCEDURE OF THE COMMITTEE
 APPOINTMENT OF COMMITTEE AND TERMS OF REFERENCE
 The Champaran Agrarian Enquiry Committee was appointed by the Government of Bihar and Orissa in Resolution No. 1890-C, dated the 10th June, 1917, which is reproduced below.
 “On various occasions during the past fifty years, the relations of landlords and tenants and the circumstances attending the growing of indigo in the Champaran district have been the cause of considerable anxiety. The conditions under which indigo was cultivated when the industry was flourishing required re-adjustment when it declined simultaneously with a general rise in the prices offoodgrains; and it was partly on this account and partly owing to other local causes that disturbances broke out in certain indigo concerns in 1908. Mr. Gourlay was deputed by the Government of Bengal to investigate the causes of the disturbances; and his report and recommendations were considered at a series of conferences presided over by Sir Edward Baker and attended by the local officers of Government and representatives of the Bihar Planters’ Association. As the result of these discussions, revised conditions for the cultivation of indigo, calculated to remove the grievances of the raiyats, were accepted by the Bihar Planters’ Association.
 “In 1912 fresh agitation arose, connected not so much with the conditions under which indigo was grown as with the action of certain factories which were reducing their indigo manufacture and taking agreements from their tenants for the payment, in lieu of indigo cultivation, of a lump sum in temporarily leased villages or of an increase of rent in villages under permanent lease. Numerous petitions on this subject were presented from time to time to the local officers and to Government, and petitions were at the same time filed by  raiyats of  villages in  the north of  the
 Bettiah sub-division in which indigo had never been grown, complaining of the levy of abwab or illegal additions to rent by their leaseholders, both Indian and European. The issues raised by all these petitions related primarily to rent and  tenancy conditions; and as the revision settlement of the district was about to be undertaken, in the course of which the relations existing between landlords and tenants would come under detailed examination, it was thought advisable to await the report of the settlement  officers   before   passing  final  orders   on   the   petitions.   The  revision
 
 settlement was started in the cold weather of 1913. On the 7th April, 1915, a resolution was moved in the local Legislative Council, asking for the appointment of  a mixed committee of officials and non-officials to enquire into the complaints of the raiyats and to suggest remedies. It was negatived by a large majority, including 12 out of the 16 non-official members of the Council present, on the ground that the appointment of such a committee at that stage was unnecessary, as the settlement officers were engaged in the collection of all the material required for the decision of the questions at issue, and an additional enquiry of the nature proposed would merely have the effect of further exacerbating the relations of landlord and tenant, which were already feeling the strain of the settlement operations.
 “The settlement operations have now been completed in the northern portion of the district and are approaching completion in the remainder, and a mass of evidence regarding agricultural conditions and the relations between landlords and tenants has been collected. A preliminary report on the complaints of the tenants in the leased villages in the north of the Bettiah subdivision, in which no indigo is grown, has been received and action has already been taken to prohibit the levy ofillegal cesses and, in the case of the Bettiah Raj, to review the terms of the leases on which the villages concerned are held. As regards the complaints of the raiyats in other parts of the district, the final report of the settlement officer has not yet been received, but recent events have again brought into prominence the whole question of
 the relations between landlords and tenants and, in particular,  the  taking  of agreements from the raiyats for compensation or for enhanced rent in return for the abandonment of indigo cultivation. In these circumstances, and in deference to representations which have been received from various quarters that the time has come when an enquiry by a joint body of officials and non-officials might materially assist the Local Government in coming to a decision on the problems which have arisen, the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council has decided, without waiting for the final report of the settlement operations, to refer the questions at issue to a Committee of Enquiry, on which all interests concerned will be represented.
 “The following committee has accordingly been appointed with the approval of the Government of India:
 PRESIDENT
 G. 	Sly, Esq., C.S.I., 	Commissioner, Central Provinces. 
 MEMBERS
 The Hon’ble Mr. L. C. Adami, I.C.S, Superintendent and Remembrancer of Legal Affairs, Bihar and Orissa.
 The Hon’ble Raja Harihar Prasad Narayan Singh, Member of the Bihar and Orissa Legislative Council.
 The Hon’ble Mr. D. J. Reid, Member of the Bihar and Orissa Legislative Council.
  Rainy, 	Esq., I.C.S., Deputy Secretary 	in the 	Finance Department 	of the 	Government of India. 
 M. K. Gandhi, Esq.
 SECRETARY
  L. 	Tanner, Esq., I.C.S., 	Settlement Officer, South Bihar. 	“The duty of the 	Committee will be   to 		inquire into 		the relations between 		landlord and tenant in 		the Champaran 		district, including 		all disputes arising 		out of the 		manufacture and 		cultivation of indigo;  to 		examine the 		evidence on these 		subjects already 		available, supplementing 		it by such 		further inquiry, local 		and otherwise, 		as they may consider 		desirable; and  to 		report their conclusions 		to Government, 		stating the measures 		they recommend 		in order 		to remove 		any abuses 		or grievances 		which they may 		find to exist.  
 “The Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council desires to leave the Committee a free hand as to the procedure they will adopt in arriving at the facts.
 “The Committee will assemble about the 15th July and will, it is hoped, complete their labours within three months.”
 PROCEDURE FOLLOWED BY THE COMMITTEE
 
  A 	notice was 	published by 	the Committee 	in the 	provincial newspapers and 	posted at 	the Motihari 	Collectorate and the 	Bettiah Sub-divisional 	Office, inviting all 	persons, associations and 	public bodies who 	desired to 	give written evidence to 	send the 	same to the 	address of 	the Secretary 	of the 	Committee, and 	stating that 	the Committee would 	hold sittings at 	Bettiah, Motihari and 	any other centres 	where it 	was considered 	necessary, commencing about the 	15th July. 
 In response to this notice, written statements were received from the Bihar Planters’ Association and two managers, one of an indigo and the other of a non-indigo concern, from twenty-five raiyats, from Mr. Whitty, C.I.E., I.C.S., Manager of the Bettiah estate, and from Mr. Sweeney, I.C.S., Settlement Officer, North Bihar, Mr. Lewis, I.C.S., Sub-divisional Officer of Bettiah, Mr. L. F. Morshead, I.C.S., Commissioner of Tirhut, and Mr. E. H. Johnston, I.C.S., formerly Sub-divisional Officer of Bettiah. The Bihar Landholders’ Association was specially invited to submit a memorandum of its views, but replied that it  was  not  in possession of the material and facts concerning the agrarian conditions in
 Champaran and was not therefore in a position to submit a written opinion.
 The Committee held a preliminary meeting at Ranchi on the 11th July to decide the procedure and extent of its inquiry, and its public sittings commenced at Bettiah on Tuesday, the 17th July. Eight public sittings were held at Bettiah and Motihari at which nineteen witnesses were examined, consisting of four Government officers (the Settlement Officer, the Sub-divisional Officer of Bettiah, the Collector of the Champaran district, and the Manager of the Bettiah estate), three representatives of the raiyats the representative of the Bihar Planters’ Association, and twelve managers of concerns. We also made local investigations at eight
 concerns, where we examined in detail the managers together with the  factory registers and accounts and the raiyats who had submitted written memoranda, and then made numerous enquiries from the large bodies of raiyats assembled to meet us. We desire to acknowledge the great assistance derived by us from the official records placed at our disposal by the local Government and the full information given to us by the managers of concerns and the facilities afforded by them for the examination of their records and registers.
 CHAPTER II
 GRIEVANCES CONNECTED WITH INDIGO
 PRELIMINARY—THE LANDLORDS
 
  The 	Government has 	supplied us 	with previous 	records relating 	to the 	history, economic 	condition and former 	agrarian disputes of the 	Champaran district. 	Our enquiry 	has not been sufficiently 	prolonged for us 	to be able to 	add usefully 	to that information, 	and we 	do not propose 	to reproduce 	in this 	report the materials 	already available, but 	only to state 	a few 	broad facts directly 	relevant to our 	present enquiry. 	For historical 	reasons, the 	district has 	always been 	one of large 	landed estates, and 	more than three-fourths 	of it is still 	held by 	three large proprietors, 	viz., the 	Bettiah estate which has 	been under the 	management of 	the Court 	of Wards 	since 1898, 	the Ramnagar 	estate which has 	also been taken under 	management, and 	the Madhuban estate. 	The system 	of leasing 	villages to 	thikadars has 	always been 
 largely followed by the Bettiah and Ramnagar estates, the number  of  villages managed direct and leased to thikadars now being as follows:
          Name 				of estate    Under direct  management    Held 				by perma-  nent 				lessees    Held 				by tempo- rary lessees and on other tenures      Total       1   2   3   4   5       Bettiah   252    503    964    1,719*     Ramnagar   31 				     102    368    501 				†    
 The thikadari system has never prevailed to the same extent in the Madhuban estate of 163 villages, but some are also leased.
 The European indigo planters form much the most important class of thikadars in the district. Some of the older indigo concerns (e.g.. Turkaulia, Peeprah, Motihari and Rajpur) have held many villages continuously in lease from the Bettiah estate since the first decade of the 19th century, while others have been established at
 later dates. In the north-west of the district there are also European thikadars who
 have never grown indigo or have not done so until the last two years. In the Settlement of 1892-99 it was found that the European thikadars exercised landlord rights over 46 per cent of the district, and it seems likely that the area is now slightly larger. Broadly, it may be said that about half the district is in lease to European
 thikadars, and much more than half the district to thikadars of all kinds. Permanent
 leases known as mukarrari have in some cases been granted both by the Bettiah and Ramnagar estates. The Bettiah mukarrari  leases date from the year 1888  and  their
 
 *These figures have been supplied by the Manager of the Bettiah estate. The total number of villages in the estate is only 1,630 according to the Settlement Officer, and apparently there is some difference in the village unit.
 †These figures have been supplied by the Settlement Officer.
 grant formed part of a large transaction for the raising of the sterling loan by which the debts of the estate were consolidated and the rate of interest payable on them reduced. Under the terms of these leases the position of the  lease-holder concerns is practically that of a zamindar, the rent being fixed in perpetuity. We have not succeeded in ascertaining the circumstances in which mukarrari leases were granted by the Ramnagar estate, but there seems little doubt that as in Bettiah their origin is to be found in the financial embarrassments of the proprietor.
 AREA UNDER INDIGO AND METHODS OF CULTIVATION
 
  The 	area under indigo at 	the time of 	the Settlement 	of 1892-99 	was 98,000 	acres which was 6.63 per 	cent of the 	net cropped area, 	but its importance in 	the agricultural 	economy of the district 	was much greater than 	this percentage 	indicates. About one-third of 	this area was cultivated 	by the 	indigo concerns in 	their own 	lands and 	about two-thirds 	by tenants. 	Owing to 	the competition 	of synthetic 	indigo the 	area had 	fallen to 	52,600 acres in 	1907 and 	to 8,100 	acres in 1914, 	but under 	the stimulus 	of high 	prices during the 	war, the area has again 	expanded to 21,900 	acres in 	1916. The cultivation 	of indigo 	carried on by the 	factories in 	lands which 	they occupy directly either as 	proprietors or 	tenure-holders (commonly 	known as zirat cultivation) does not call for special notice. But the condition under which 
 indigo is grown by the tenants for the factories has in the past been the cause of disputes on several occasions, and though we do not consider it necessary to enter into the history of these disputes, we cannot explain the causes of the present unrest without giving some account of the system. In essentials it does not appear to have varied during the last 100 years. Under this system, the tenant agrees to grow indigo for the factory in a portion of his holding. The fraction of the holding so cultivated appears at one time to have been as high as five kathas in the bigha ( = one-fourth), but before 1867 it had already been reduced to four kathas, and in 1868 it was fixed at three kathas, whence the name tinkathia which is commonly applied to this system. In 1910 the fraction was fixed at two kathas ( = one-tenth) by a bye-law of the Planters’ Association, but the name  tinkathia  has survived. Where indigo is  grown
 under this system, the terms of the agreement between the landlord and the tenant are usually embodied in a document which is called the satta. In it the  tenant acknowledges the receipt of an advance and binds himself to cultivate a specified area with indigo annually. The preparation and weeding of the selected fields, and the cutting of the crop when ripe, are done by the cultivator at his own expense the seed
 is given by the factory, and the sowing is done by the factory and raiyat jointly; the
 green crop is carted from the field to the factory at the factory’s expense. The rate to be paid for the bigha of indigo is fixed by the satta and does not vary with the actual outturn of plant. If owing to ca-uses for which the tenant is not responsible the crop is a failure, only half rates are paid, provided the tenant is allowed to plough up the indigo in time to sow another crop during the same season. A portion of the price is given as an advance free of interest to the tenant at the beginning of the cultivating
 season, but is usually credited in the rent account and is not paid in cash. The satta
 also contains a penalty clause specifying the amount of the damages which the factory may recover from the tenant if he fails to carry out the agreement, e.g., if he sows other crops in the land measured for indigo.
 The khushki system by which the raiyat grows indigo for the factory but not under factory supervision and sells the produce by weight or some method of appraisement seems to have been rare in Champaran until a very recent date. It will be more fully discussed in a later paragraph.
 THE  PRICE PAID FOR INDIGO
  The 	price paid to 	the tenants 	for the indigo 	so cultivated 	has varied 	from time 	to time. 	We find 	that in 1869 	after a period 	of friction 	and disturbance, 	the price 	generally paid by 	the factories 	was raised 	from approximately 	Rs. 6-8-0 	to Rs. 	9 per 	acre and 	again in 	1877 after another 	troubled period to Rs. 	11-5-0. In 	that year, it 	was also 	for the first time distinctly 	laid down—previous 	practice had varied—that 	the rent of 	the land 	under indigo was to be 	remitted. In 	1897, the 	Bihar Planters’ 	Association spontaneously raised the rate to Rs. 12 per acre. Finally, in 1910, after. 
 Mr. Gourlay’s enquiry, the price was raised to Rs. 13 per acre at which it now stands.   If the remission of the rent of the indigo lands be taken into account, the price received by the tenant is approximately Rs. 15-8-0 per acre. A general complaint was made to us by the tenant that the cultivation of indigo at this rate of payment caused them substantial pecuniary loss compared to the profits that they could derive from country crop at their present level of prices. Some leading planters have admitted, and it is not, we believe, seriously disputed by any that the direct return to the cultivator in money from indigo is less than from country crops, but stress is laid on certain indirect advantages, such as the undoubted value of indigo as a rotation crop, and also the benefit derived by the tenant from an advance free of interest at the beginning of the cultivating season which amounts to half the price of the crop. Finally, it is urged that the low rates of rent at which the tenants hold their land are directly connected with the growing of indigo and must be taken into account when the fairness of the price is considered. It is unnecessary for us to attempt the difficult task of estimating the pecuniary position of the tenant under the tinkathia system of indigo cultivation, because we are satisfied that on other grounds the system is radically defective and should be discontinued.
 DEFECTS IN THE SYSTEM UNDER WHICH INDIGO IS GROWN
 
  There 	are several  points 	 connected  with  the  	system  which 	 in  our opinion are 	directly responsible for 	its worst features. The 	first is 	that the price 	paid to the cultivator is fixed andremains unchangedfor a long period 	of years. We are aware that 	the prices fixed 	by the 	Bihar Planters’ 	Association are minimum 	prices, but as 	soon as 	they have received the 	imprimatur of 	the Association, they are regarded as the 	authorized rates and 	in practice 	are paid 	by all 	concerns. In 	the course 	of fifty 	years, the 	price paid to 	the tenant 	has been 	doubled in order 	to adjust 	the price 	paid for indigo 	to the 	general rise 	in the 	level of 	prices during that 	period. But 	the price of 	indigo being fixed at 	each stage and 	the rise in 	general prices 	being continuous, it 	follows that, 	if the 	price was fair at the 	beginning of 	any period, 	it had 	become too 	low by 	the end of 	it. Of 	itself, this would tend 	to cause 	discontent, and 	it will 	be noticed 	that with the exception 	of the 	increase made 	in 1897, 	every rise in 	price was 	preceded by 	a period of 	friction and 	discontent, and 	a valid 	objection to the 	system is 	that an 	increase in 	the price 	of indigo 	was seldom 	effected except by 	disturbance and 	agitation. 
 The second point is that the price is fixed on the area and does not vary with the outturn of the crop. This leads directly to two defects. The selection by the factory of the plots to be cultivated with indigo is a feature of the system which has often been called in question. It is certainly liable to abuse, e.g., it is asserted that homestead lands in the immediate vicinity of the village site and which are consequently the best manured are frequently selected for indigo. The real gravamen of
 the charge about the selection of lands does not, however, lie in the possibility of abuse, but in the fact that the system itself is bad. So long as the planter has to pay the same price for a good or a bad crop, he will select for indigo the better lands in the holding. This selection of lands is resented by the cultivator not merely from the fact that the best lands are selected but because it involves interference with his freedom of action. We believe that this is a principal cause of the unpopularity of indigo, and  in this respect the system is radically defective.
 The payment of a fixed rate per acre leads directly to another feature of the system which is equally responsible for its unpopularity, namely, the close supervision of the indigo cultivation exercised by the factory subordinates. This supervision undoubtedly affords an opportunity for a great deal of petty tyranny, and the cultivator resents being compelled to carry out the various cultivation processes not at the time most convenient to himself, but at the time when the work is considered necessary by factory subordinates. The system gives opportunities to the factory servants to harass cultivators against whom they may have a grudge; or to exact payment as the price of their favour. A good manager accessible to his raiyats may be able to keep the oppression of his subordinates within small limits, but even the best of managers cannot prevent altogether oppressive acts by low-paid subordinates placed in a position of authority. So long as the payment is made on the area and does not vary with the outturn, and the tenant has no interest in the outturn, close supervision will be essential. In this respect also, we consider that the system is inherently bad.
 Another important objection to the tinkathia system is the fact that the growing of indigo is connected with a sense of obligation. We are satisfied that for the last fifty years the growing of tinkathia indigo has been disliked by the raiyat
 and that he would at any time have been glad to relinquish it. Whether such sense of obligation had any legal foundation is a matter for the decision of a legal tribunal, but its unpopularity is shown by the large extent to which the tenants have in recent years purchased their release. In the interests of the future peace of the districts, it is essential that the relations of landlord and tenant should be clearly defined by the law, and that the growing of indigo should cease to be connected with any sense of obligation or any customary right.
 PROPOSAL THAT THE “TINKATHIA” SYSTEM SHOULD BE ABOLISHED
  We 	find therefore 	that the 	tinkathia system 	is unpopular 	with the raiyats 	who regard 	it as unprofitable, 	is radically 	defective in some 	important respects, and 	is inconsistent 	with the relations 	that should 	exist between 	landlord and tenant 	under modern 	conditions. We 	accordingly recommend 	that this system of 	growing indigo in 	Champaran should be 	altogether abolished, and 	that legislation should 	be undertaken 	to effect this change. This proposal will affect tenancies in which the growing of 
 indigo has been recorded as an incident of the tenancy in the Record of Rights and a recommendation on this point will be made in a later paragraph.
 FUTURE SYSTEM OF GROWING INDIGO
 
  It 	is not our intention 	of course 	that indigo should cease to 	be grown but 	that it 	should be 	grown under fair and 	reasonable conditions. 	Indigo is already 	grown by 	some factories on 	the voluntary 	system (khushki), 	and we 	consider that 	this is the 	system which alone should 	be permitted for the future. The essential features of such a system are: 
  The 	tenant must be 	absolutely free to 	enter into the 	contract or 	to refrain from making it.  The 	particular plots 	to be devoted 	to indigo 	must be 	entirely at 	the option 	of the raiyat.  The 	price paid for 	the indigo must be 	settled by 	voluntary agreement and 	entirely on a commercial basis.  The 	price must be 	fixed on 	the weight 	of the 	crop, but 	such weight may, 	if agreed, be settled by appraisement of the weight by a selected panchlibtech_853_footnote 
 instead of by actual weighment.
  The 	contract must 	be for 	an emphatically 	short period not 	exceeding three years. 
 To the last condition we attach importance. In the interests of the tenant, we do not think that he should be allowed to bind himself to his landlord to grow a particular crop at a rate of payment fixed for many years in advance,  and  in  Champaran long contracts would directly tend to keep alive the sense of obligation which we desire to end.
 We are in general averse from fixing by outside authority the minimum prices to be paid for particular crops, because of the strong tendency of such prices to become maximum prices. In view, however, of the past history of  the  indigo industry, we believe that a safeguard of some kind will be necessary for the first few years. We recommend therefore that, until the Local Government is satisfied that the safeguard can be dispensed with, a minimum price for indigo should be fixed by the Bihar Planters’ Association, subject to the approval of the Commissioner of the Division.
 CONVERSION OF THE INDIGO OBLIGATION
 
 The 	manufacture in 	Germany in 	the middle 	nineties of 	synthetic indigo, 	which enabled the German firms to undersell the natural product, produced a profound 
 
 
 effect on the indigo industry in Bihar. The price of the natural dye steadily diminished and though efforts were made to reduce the cost of production and to increase the outturn (e.g., by the introduction of the Java plant which gave a larger outturn of colouring matter per acre), these efforts met with but indifferent success. One by one, the factories abandoned the hope of successful competition with the synthetic dye and began to turn their attention to other measures, the principal being the taking of compensation in one form or another for releasing the tenant from the cultivation of indigo.
 Two concerns in the north of the district substituted a fixed payment of paddy in lieu of the cultivation of indigo, but this practice was recently abandoned owing to the disapproval expressed by Government. Some other concerns substituted sugarcane or oats for indigo. We have been informed that the Bara concern has in some cases substitued sattas for l_ kathas of sugar in lieu of 3 kathas of indigo. Oats
 are still grown to a limited extent in lieu of indigo by the Mallahia, Bairia and Kuria concerns. The growing of crops other than indigo under satta conditions is expressly forbidden by a bye-law of the Bihar Planters’ Association adopted in 1910 at the instance of Government after the disturbances which took place at the end of 1908. Those disturbances affected four factories, of which Mallahia, Bairia and Kuria are three. It is, we think, regrettable that those factories should have continued to act in direct contravention of a bye-law which was passed with special reference to practices in these concerns.
 In 1911, a general movement towards the abandonment of indigo began which continued unchecked till the outbreak of the war in 1914, when a large rise in the price of indigo once more made the manufacture a profitable one. Two different methods of commutation were generally adopted. In some cases, agreements were executed by  the  tenants  for  the  payment  of  enhanced   rents,  commonly  known  as  sharahbeshi.  In  other  cases, the raiyats purchased freedom from indigo for a
 lumpsum, sometimes paid in cash and sometimes by a money bond bearing 12 per cent interest. This method is called tawan or tamam. In both cases, a promise was given to the tenant that in consideration of the payment of sharahbeshi or tawan, as the case may be, neither the factory itself nor its successors in interests would in
 future ask him to grow indigo for them under the tinkathia conditions.
 Sharahbeshi has been taken by only five concerns, viz., Turkaulia, Motihari, Peeprah, Jallaha and Sirni, the two last being outworks of Turkaulia which were sold in recent years, and only in the villages which the factories held in mukarrari lease
 from the Bettiah estate and the very few held by them in proprietary right. In the villages held in temporary lease all these concerns, except Peeprah, took tawan, and  it was also taken by nine other concerns, of which the most important are Rajpur,
 Bara, Bairia and Bhelwa. The rates at which  sharahbeshi  was taken varied widely  in
 the different concerns, but on the average the enhancement amounted to between 50 and 60 per cent of the previous rents. The following table shows the average amount of the enhancement and the proportion it bore to the previous rent in four concerns:
 Serial No.	Name of	Amount of	Percentage on
 concern	enhancement previous rents per acre
 1	2	3	4
 Rs.	a.	p.  
 Turkaulia	0	15	0	50 Jallaha	1	3	0	55 Motihari	1	6	6	60 Peeprah	0	15	0	75 
 The percentage is highest in Peeprah where the previous rents had been exceptionally low. The rate of tawan also varied, and was usually calculated on the portion of the holding in which indigo was grown, i.e., three kathas in the bigha. The payment was frequently fixed on the basis of the amount which the factory had realized in indigo damage suits when the tenant had failed to carry out his agreement.
 The amount taken as tawan varied from Rs. 66 to Rs. 20 per acre and probably on the
 average was between Rs. 50 and Rs. 60 per acre, which would be equivalent to a payment of Rs. 7-8-0 to Rs. 9 on each acre of the holding.
 In the concerns affectedby this conversion, about 50,000 acres of indigo were formerly cultivated under tinkathia conditions, and of  this  area  over  40,000  acres were released—18,000 acres by taking tawan and 22,000 acres by taking sharahbeshi. At the recent settlement, tinkathia has been recorded as an incident of the tenancy only in the five concerns of Turkaulia, Motihari, Peeprah, Jallaha and Sirni, and the area of indigo over which it is claimed by these factories amounts to 1,910 acres, though we\ have no information as to what extent the incident has been recorded. We have endeavoured to secure statistics of the present indigo cultivation from all factories and, although not quite complete for the whole district, the omissions are insignificant. They show that a total area of 26,848 acres of indigo is made up as follows:
 Zirat cultivation	10,697 acres Tinkathia cultivation	9,542	,, Khushki cultivation	6,609	,,
 COMMUTATION BY ENHANCED RENT—“SHARAHBESHI”
 The enhanced rents taken in lieu of indigo in every case exceeded the limit 
 
 of two annas in the rupee to which enhancement contracts are ordinarily restricted by section 29, clause (b) of the Bengal Tenancy Act. Under the third proviso to the section, however, this limit does not apply when the raiyat has held his land at a specially low rate of rent in consideration of cultivating a particular crop for the
 convenience of his landlord. It is contended by the concerns that their tenants were under an obligation to grow indigo in three katha in the bigha of their holdings, that the rents of holdings had been determined in consideration of this obligation, and that because of the obligation the concerns had refrained from enhancement of rents. It  is  asserted, in  fact, that the obligation to  grow indigo was an  incident of the
 tenancy. In support of this contention, the concerns have referred to certain sattas
 and kabuliyats executed by some of the tenants before 1880 in which the obligation to grow indigo in three kathas in the bigha is recorded. On behalf of the raiyats, it is contended that in fact they were under no legal obligation to grow indigo or that if there were any obligation they did not hold their land at a specially low rate of rent because of it. It is also urged that whether the enhancements were legal or not, it is inequitable that the tenants should be called on to pay an enhanced rent as the price of relief from a burden under which they had long suffered. Finally, it is urged that the agreements were executed by the raiyats under coercion or under influence or in
 ignorance of their true legal position.
 Mr. Sweeney, Settlement Officer, informed us that these enhancements had been the subject of enquiry during the Revision Settlement and he described to us the principles followed by the Settlement Department in dealing with these cases. The legality of the enhancements has also been considered by the Civil Court in nine suits brought by tenants of the Turkaulia concern asking for a declaration that the kabuliyats in which they agreed to pay the enhanced rents should be declared void on the ground that they were executed under coercion and were not in accordance with the law. These suits are now before the High Court in appeal.
 Our enquiries satisfied us that the feeling of the raiyats against enhancements was very strong and that every legal means would be used to upset them. Without special legislation, prolonged and expensive litigation seemed inevitable. However such litigation might end, it would produce a permanent embitterment of feeling on both sides. We are also impressed with the great desirability of an immediate settlement between landlords and tenants of this difficult question. In these circumstances, it seemed to us very important that if possible a settlement should be arranged by consent with mutual concessions made by both parties in the interests of peace and goodwill. With this object, we entered into negotiations with the representatives of the three principal concerns, and we are glad to report that our efforts have been successful. At a meeting held in Ranchi on 29th September at which Messrs Hill, Irwin, and Norman, the managers of Turkaulia Limited, Motihari
 Limited, and Peeprah concerns, were present and at which Mr. Gandhi represented the interests of the raiyats, an agreement was reached on the following terms:
  The 	enhancement effected by 	sharahbeshi shall 	be reduced 	with effect 	from the commencement of 	the fasli year 	1325 (October 1917) by 	20 per cent 	in the 	case of Turkaulia 	Limited, and by 	26 per cent in 	the case of 	Motihari Limited 	and the Peeprah 	concern, the 	rents for 	years prior to 	1325 fasli 	remaining unchanged 	at the Survey-Settlement rates.  The 	existing indigo 	obligation recorded in 	the Survey 	Records shall 	be abolished 	from the commencement 	of the fasli 	year 1325 and 	in lieu 	the enhanced 	rent (sharahbeshi) 	shall be 	fixed at 	the rate at 	which it 	would have 	stood had commutation 	taken place together with the 	others less the 	reduction now agreed upon. 
 As the representative of the raiyats, our colleague Mr. Gandhi fully accepts this arrangement as a satisfactory settlement and he undertakes to use his influence fully with the raiyats to make them loyally accept it and to bring about future peace in
 the relations of planters and their tenants. This settlement is subject to the condition that full binding effect must be given to it by legislation. We regard this settlement as equitable to all interests concerned and therefore recommend that action should be immediately taken by emergency legislation to render this settlement by consent binding on all the parties concerned.
 As regards the two small concerns of Jallaha and Sirni, which are not parties to this settlement by consent, we recommend that the reduction should be fixed at 26 per cent upon the same conditions as in Motihari and Peeprah.
 COMMUTATION BY MONEY PAYMENTS—“TAWAN”
 
  We 	have still 	to consider 	the cases 	in which 	the indigo 	obligation has 	been commuted 	for a 	lump sum payment which 	method we regard as distinctly 	prejudicial to 	the interests 	of the 	tenants. The 	taking of 	tawan has 	been defended by 	the factories 	in two 	different ways. 	Some concerns 	do not 	allege that 	there was anyincident 	of tenancy 	or obligation 	on the 	tenant to 	grow indigo 	apart from the 
 satta and urge that the payment was made by the tenants for the termination of a
 contract on terms mutually satisfactory to the parties. But this theory that the payment was made by the tenants for the termination of a contract appears to us to be exposed to almost insuperable difficulties. It is not obvious why, when both parties desire to terminate a contract, a large payment should be made by one of them, particularly when the proposal to terminate the contract originates with the party who is to receive the money. In no concern, we believe, did the rate of payment vary according to the length of time which the contract had still to run, though this might certainly have been expected had the contract alone been in question. Again, in every
 case where tawan was taken, it was a part of the bargain that the tenant received a promise that he would never again be required to grow indigo either by the present proprietors of the factory or by any person to whom the factory might be transferred. There is no doubt, in our opinion, that what the raiyat paid for was a final release
 from the obligation to grow indigo and that he would not have voluntarily paid such large sums merely for release from the unexpired period of the satta.
 The older factories which took sharahbeshi in their mukarrari villages and tawan in the villages in temporary lease give a different explanation. They assert in both cases the existence of an incident of tenancy, i.e., an obligation to grow indigo as a part of the condition on which the tenant held his land. But if the factory enhanced rents in a temporarily-leased village, nine-tenths of the profit would at the next renewal pass to the superior landlord. The result is that a peculiar claim is advanced by the factory. It is asserted that the obligation to grow indigo imposed on the tenant could be claimed only by the factory and not by the superior landlord, and that therefore the factory was entitled to commute the incident and take the whole of the proceeds, in which the superior landlord could claim no share. This assumes that a temporary lease-holder, when setting land with a tenant, can create an incident of tenancy the benefit of which can be claimed only by him. No legal authority for this position was placed before us, and we regard it as wholly untenable. If an incident attaches to the tenancy, then the benefit can be enjoyed by the lease-holder only so long as he holds the lease and no longer. The indigo incident has not been claimed and is not now claimed by the Bettiah estate, and the claim of the factories in the form in which it has been presented to us must, we think, be wholly rejected.
 It seems to us, therefore, that whichever theory be adopted, the taking of tawan was not justified in temporarily-leased villages. If it be said that the payment was for the termination of a contract, the answer is that that is not what the tenant desired to buy, nor is it the most important thing the factory sold, that is, final release from indigo. If it is said that the tenant was under an obligation to grow indigo as one of the conditions on which he held his land it is evident that the payment was of the nature of capitalized rent and if so the interests of the superior
 landlord were prejudiced. Since the taking of tawan was within the knowledge of the
 Bettiah estate, which took no action to stop it, we consider that the estate itself must accept some share of the responsibility. We recommend that where tawan has been taken in temporarily leased villages, the Bettiah estate should make it a condition of
 the renewal of the temporary leases that 25 per cent of the tawan collected should be
 paid to the estate, and that the estate should refund it to the tenant concerned. Moreover, since tawan must be regarded at least in part as capitalized rent, we recommend that the Bettiah estate should for a period of seven years forgo any enhancement, which may be granted in the Settlement Courts on the ground of the
 rise in prices, of the rent of a tenant who has paid tawan.
 We have been informed that in a few cases where villages had very recently come into lease to a factory, the management procured the execution of sattas by the raiyats and, after growing indigo for one or two years, commuted the indigo rights by taking tawan. Action of this kind seems to us totally indefensible and the Bettiah estate is bound in the interests of its tenants to interfere. We recommend that in such cases, the Court of Wards should refuse to renew the temporary leases of the concern
 unless the whole of the tawan is refunded.
 Tawan was also taken in some of the permanently-leased villages by a few concerns, of which the most important is Rajpur. In view of the fact that a reduction of sharahbeshi has been accepted under the settlement by consent in the interests of future peace and goodwill, we consider that the mukarraridars should be advised by the Local Government to make a refund on a similar basis of a portion of the tawan taken by them. In consideration of the low rate of tawan taken by the Rajpur concern,
 we consider that a reduction of ten per cent would be adequate.
 SPECIAL CASE  OF RAJGHAT CONCERN
 
  Finally, 	we desire 	to refer 	to the 	peculiar conditions of 	the Rajghat 	factory (manager, 	Mr. Apperley), 	where no incident 	of tenancy 	is claimed 	but where 	written contracts 	had been entered into 	by the tenants 	for the growing 	of indigo 	in consideration 	of freedom 	from rent enhancement. 	On the 	expiry of 	these contracts, 	this arrangement was 	continued by 	mutual consent, 	and consequently 	the factory 	refrained from applying 	for rent enhancement 	at the 	proper time 	during the 	revision settlement. 	At our local enquiry, we were informed by the tenant that they now 	desired   to abandon 	indigo. Under these circumstances, it 	is only reasonable 	that the factory 	should be 	enabled to 	apply for 	a general 	enhancement of rents 	in accordance 	with the settlement 	procedure, but as the 	time-limit for 	this procedure under 	section 105 of the 	Bengal Tenancy Act 	has already expired, this 	is impossible 	unless the Government 	takes action under 	section 112 	of the 	Bengal Tenancy 	Act. Failing 	this course, 	we recommend 	that the special 	legislation should contain a 	clause enabling this 	concern to 	take advantage of 	section 105. 
 CHAPTER III
 “ABWAB” AND THE RENEWAL OF “THIKA” LEASES
 “ABWAB”
  Our 	enquiry has 	shown that until 	recently, certain 	sums were regularly levied 	from the tenants 	in addition 	to the 	recorded rent 	by the 	thikadars of 	the non-indigo concerns in the north-west portion of the district, which unauthorized 
 dues are generally known as abwab. The imposition of abwab was forbidden by
 section 54 of the Decennial Settlement Regulation (VIII of 1793), which definitely laid down that all landlords should consolidate the abwab with the rent into one sum before a fixed date and prohibited under penalty the imposition of any new abwab. This prohibition was again enforced by section 10 of Act X of 1859, and by section
 74 of the Bengal Tenancy Act (VIII of 1885). For many years past, no abwab have
 been realized in villages under the direct management of the Bettiah Estate, but although the estate received no direct benefit therefrom, the thikadars of non-indigo concerns continued their realization until this illegal practice was recently brought to notice at the revision settlement, when orders were issued by the Court of Wards prohibiting the levy of anything in excess of the recorded rent and authorized cesses. The evidence taken by us shows that this action has achieved its object. In some indigo concerns we found that the tenants made a small annual payment known as
 farkhawan, which is usually taken direct by the patwari at the time of rent collection.
 This practice is also contrary to the law, the landlord being responsible for the patwari’s emoluments. The systematic levy of abwab still prevails in the Ramnagar estate. In one lease produced before us, certain abwab are specified as payable by the thikadar to the estate, and in addition there is a clause binding him to assist in collecting certain dues “which are realized from the tenants and banias according to the ancient custom”. The abwab realized by the thikadars bear many names,libtech_854_footnotelibtech_855_footnotemost of
 which are of old standing, but the full development of the system seems to be comparatively recent and does not go back beyond the last quarter of the nineteenth century. It took the form of an amalgamation and an enhancement of the old  abwaband the consolidated levy thenceforth passed under a single name, usually salami or panikharcha (irrigation due). Occasionally, as in the Bhasurari concern, this levy is called tinkathia by analogy with the indigo obligation although no indigo is grown. The amount of the levy is usually Rs. 3 to Rs. 3-8-0 per bigha and is equivalent to an addition to the rent of from 60 to 100 per cent. The collection of
 abwab in this manner has been systematically adopted by the European thikadars of
 this estate who until recently never grew indigo, and also by a number of Indian thikadars and petty proprietors. We received no complaint of the systematic collection of abwab in the rest of the district, and it appears that at least of recent
 
 
 years an occasional levy only has been taken by some landlords for a special purpose, such as a marriage in the proprietor’s family.
 In spite of the general exaction of these irregular dues in the north-west tract of the district, not a single suit has been brought under section 75 of the Bengal Tenancy Act, which provides the legal remedy. The Collector is of opinion that the section remained a dead letter because the tenants did not complain and because there are difficulties in enforcing the law. It has been suggested to us that section 75 should be amended in order to give power to the Collector to deal with cases summarily on the lines of section 58 and we agree that a special remedy is required to meet the peculiar conditions of the Champaran district. We also consider that it should be made more generally known that the exaction of abwab is illegal. Connected with this exaction is
 the practice of landlords’ servants levying a commission on payments made by tenants known as dasturi, which is equally illegal. We, therefore, recommend that:
  Government 	should issue a 	proclamation informing 	all landlords and raiyats 	that both abwab 	and the dasturi 	taken by 	landlords’ servants are 	illegal and 	must be stopped;  the 	Court of 	Wards should take steps 	to enforce 	those prohibitions in the 	estates under its charge; and  the 	special legislation 	recommended by us for 	the Champaran district 	should contain 	a clause 	providing that 	the Collector 	of his 	own motion may 	enquire into 	and punish the 	exaction by 	a landlord 	from a 	tenant of 	any sum in 	excess of 	the rent payable, 	his decision 	being subject 	to the 	ordinary appeal. The 	penalty might 	appropriately be 	fixed at 	a fine 	not exceeding 	Rs. 50 	or double the 	amount of 	the exaction, 	whichever is greater. 	Our colleague, 	the Hon’ble 	Rajah Kirtyanand 	Singh, dissents from 	this proposal for legislation. 
 RENT RECEIPT
  Where 	abwab are 	systematically levied, 	the practice 	is to credit 	the first 	payments made by 	a tenant to 	that demand and 	a receipt is 	not given until he 	has paid off the whole abwab and at least some portion of his rent. This is facilitated by the 
 fact that rent receipt are not usually given until payments for the year have beencompleted. Again, no receipts at all are given for the payment of produce rents. The intention of the Legislature, clearly shown by the form of rent receipt prescribed in schedule II of the Bengal Tenancy Act, was that the first payment of rent in any year should be entered in the receipt given to the raiyat who would produce this receipt for the entry of subsequent payments. We were informed during the course of our local enquiries that such a procedure is unsuitable for Champaran because the tenants fail to produce the first receipt at the time of subsequent payments. The alternative procedure, if the law is to be followed, is to give a full receipt for every
 payment, which would involve a great increase in clerical labour because rents are frequently paid in small instalments. We consider it essential that some form of receipt should be given for these intermediate payments, though it need not be so elaborate as the prescribed form, and we therefore recommend that the Local Government should use its power under the proviso to section 56 (3) to prescribe a simple form of receipt for intermediate payments, the full receipt being reserved for the final payment. The inter-mediate receipt need only contain the name of the tenant and his khatian number, the amount paid with date of payment and the account on which it was paid.
 RENEWAL OF “THIKA” LEASES
  We 	have already 	described in paragraph 3 the large extent to which the thikadari 	system prevails 	in the 	district. If 	we believed that 	the abuses 	of the 	past were inseparable 	from that system, and 	that good relations 	between landlord 	and tenant 	could not be 	secured under 	it in the future, it would be our duty to recommend 	its abolition. 	But although 	we consider 	that good 	relations between 	landlord and 	tenant can 	ordinarily best be 	secured under an 	efficient system of 	direct management, 	which follows the 	general policy laid 	down in the 	Court of Wards 
 Manual, they can also be obtained under a suitable thikadari system. We are opposed
 to any extension of that system, and if for any reason the lease of a village is not renewed, it seems preferable to take it under direct management rather than to lease it to another thikadar. The thikadari system of the Bettiah  and  Ramnagar  estates was not created by the Court of Wards; many of the thikadars are of very old standing,
 and there may be other reasons arising out of their previous relations which render it inadvisable to make a sudden change of policy. If the conduct of a thikadar has been detrimental to the interests of the raiyats or of the superior landlord, his conduct should be scrutinized before the lease is renewed. In cases where the Court of Wards decides to renew the leases, we consider it preferable that they should be granted for moderately long periods, subject to cancellation for breach of the conditions, rather than that the periods should be short. In these circumstances, the commission granted to the lessee should be sufficient to cover the cost of collection (including irrecoverable arrears) and a  reasonable remuneration for himself. Unlessthe  estate
 offers its thikadars reasonable terms, it cannot evade all responsibility for resulting
 abuses. What a fair commission would be can no doubt be calculated for each tenure. On the other hand, where the commission to be given to the thikadar exceeds the estimated cost of direct management, the renewal of the leases on such terms requires special justification on the merits of each case. Finally, the leases should contain conditions enforcing such recommendations of the Committee as are accepted by Government, including in  particular stipulations that no  indigo should be grown
 except on a voluntary system, and that no abwab should be taken. We consider that
 the estate should hold itself responsible  for   the   well-being   of   tenants   in thika
 villages and when that well-being is in danger, should be responsible for the remedy.
 CHAPTER IV
 OTHER GRIEVANCES OF TENANTS
 FEES ON TRANSFERS
  It 	remains for 	us to deal 	with various other 	matters some 	of which 	have been 	sources of 	trouble in 	the past and some of 	which are suggestions 	made for the 	improvement of 	agrarian conditions. The 	first is the 	levy of fees 	on the 	transfers of 	occupancy holdings. So 	far as 	fees are 	levied on 	transfers by 	inheritance, they 	are illegal, 	as the 	right of inheritance 	is given 	by section 	26, Bengal 	Tenancy Act, and 	no custom 	exists in derogation 	of this 	right. Such fees under the 	name of 	Bapahi Putahi 	have been already 	referred to as an abwab 	in Chapter 	III. As 	regards transfers 	otherwise than 	by inheritance, 	it may 	be noted 	that the consent 	of the 	landlord is 	required by 	law to 	the transfer 	of a 	portion of 	a holding since 	that involves a 	sub-division of 	the tenancy 	(section 88, Bengal 	Tenancy Act). The 	transferability of 	an occupancy 	holding depends on 	custom. In 	Champaran, the 	general custom is 	stated to 	be that no 	transfer can 	be made 	without the landlord’s 	consent, so that 	legally landlord 	can take 	a fee for recognized 	transfers otherwise than by 	inheritance, and 	this appears 	to be the usual 	practice. At the same 	time, however, we think 	that it would 	be desirable in 	the interests 	of good 	management to adopt 	a uniform 	scale of fees 	where  it 	is possible to 	do so; e.g., 	in estates 	under the Court 	of Wards. 	This scale 	might be varied 	from time to time, 	if necessary, 	and its existence 	would not derogate 	from the right of 	veto possessed 	by the 	landlord even 	if the 	transferee offered the 	prescribed fee, 	for it would 	only be taken 	where the transfer 	had been 	approved. We recommend, 	therefore, that a 	moderate scale of 	fees be 	fixed from time to 	time in 	estates under the 	Court of Wards which should be enforced in villages held direct or under temporary 
 lease, and that as regards villages let in mukarrari lease, the estate should use its best
 endeavour to induce the lease-holder to adopt the same policy.
 The procedure followed by the Bettiah Estate in dealing with applications for mutation of names has been criticised. At present, the attendance of the parties at Bettiah is required, which causes unnecessary inconvenience, as local enquiries are always necessary. At the same time, we do not think it desirable to entrust thikadars with the power of disposing of such applications even subject to an appeal to the Manager. We recommend, therefore, that the power of sanctioning mutations should
 rest with the Estate Manager but that the applications may, if the applicant wishes, be made through the thikadar, who would forward it with his report to the Manager and who would communicate to the applicant the orders when received.
 RIGHTS IN HIDES
  A 	complaint that 	has become prominent 	lately refers to the 	right claimed 	by the Bettiah and Ramnagar Estates and some of their tenure-holders to all the hides 
 
 of dead cattle. With the rise in the value of hides in recent years, the question of ownership has become more important and has led to changes in the old custom under which a chamar took from the estate the lease of the right to the hides of a village for  a small sum and supplied the tenants with a fixed number of shoes and other articles, whilst in addition his wife gave her service as midwife. The Charsa Mahal as it is
 called, of the Bettiah Estate was leased out to various persons, some of whom took the right to the hides over a large area and some of whom were chamars who took the right in individual villages. The total annual income of the Estate from this source is about Rs. 3,000. This right to hides was made over with other miscellaneous assets to
 the indigo concerns who were granted  mukarrari leases in  1887. In  the Ramnagar
 Estate, we understand the income from the Mahal in the past two years has been Rs. 79,000. The Manager of the Bettiah Estate has tried to justify the claim on the ground of custom and supports it on the ground of public policy for the prevention of cattle poisoning. On the other hand, it is urged that the hide is the legal property of the owner of the dead animal and that the present practice grew irregularly out of fees paid by the chamars for the use of waste land for skinning dead animals. The question of the validity by custom of such a right is one for legal decision. We doubt, however, whether such a custom even where proved can override the natural right of the owner of the dead animal to dispose of its hide in any way he pleases. Subject, therefore, to any legal right which the landlords may be held to possess, we are of opinion that the hides are the property of the owner of the dead animal who is entitled to dispose of them as he wishes, whether by sale or in exchange for services.
 KEROSENE OIL MONOPOLY
 
  A 	somewhat similar claim to 	the monopoly of 	the trade in 	kerosene oil 	has been 	abandoned by 	the Bettiah 	Estate and we 	think that 	the mukarraridars who 	derive their claim 	from the estate should 	also abandon 	the practice of issuing 	licencesfor the 	sale of 	kerosene oil. Such a 	practice is 	clearly not 	legally enforceable 	and acts 	detrimentally in 	restraint of trade. 
 RIGHTS IN TREES
 
  A 	widespread discontent is 	manifest among 	the raiyats 	in respect 	of the 	rights in 	trees. The 	legal position has 	been ascertained both 	at the 	settlement of 	1892-99 and 	at the 	present revision 	settlement. It 	appears that 	trees growing in 	tenants’ holdings 	cannot be felled 	without the consent 	of the 	landlord, and 	half the value 	of the 	timber of 	dead or 	felled trees 	belongs to 	him. The tenant 	urges that he 	pays rent for 	the land and 	the whole produce of 	it including the 	trees should belong to 	him, but, on 	the other 	hand, the rent 	was fixed 	in consideration 	of the 	custom and 	there is 	the legal right of 	the landlord. 	The tenant 	undoubtedly feels the 	restraint in 	not being able to take wood even from his own holding when he wants it without 
 obtaining permission and with the possibility of abuse by subordinates. On the other hand, there is the danger that the handing over of all the trees to the raiyats might lead to their rapid destruction. The district is exceptionally well wooded, and we understand that in Saran, where the tenants have full rights in trees in lands for which   a cash rent is paid, no evidence of general denudation is apparent. In view of the inconvenience resulting from the present custom, we recommend that in the Bettiah
 Estate the raiyats should be given the option of purchasing the landlord’s half share
 in the timber, the valuation to be made on fair principles, and, in case of disputes, referred to assessors. If it is found in practice that applications for purchase are received in such large numbers from any particular area as to make it probable that undue denudation might take place, the Estate would be able to limit the option.
 GRAZING RIGHTS
 
  During 	our enquiry, 	we found 	that practically 	all the waste 	land has been 	recorded as being 	in the 	exclusive possession of 	the landlords, 	except certain small 	plots used 	for communal purposes 	such as 	roads, burial grounds, 	sites for threshing 	floors and 	the like. This permits 	the landlords 	to break 	up all 	waste for 	cultivation or 	to enclose 	it for 	his exclusive use. 	It has 	been urged that this is 	detrimental to 	the welfare 	of the 	village community and 	provides a 	weapon of 	which unfair use 	may be made 	by a bad landlord 	in cases 	of dispute 	with his tenants. 	There is little 	doubt that a village 	is benefited 	by some 	land being left 	for communal use, 	not necessarily large 	enough to 	provide for 	grazing of 	all the village 	cattle but at 	least adequate to 	provide the cattle 	with an 	exercise ground where 	they can move about freely 	without undue risk 	of trespass 	on cropped 	land. We, therefore, 	recommend that 	proprietors and 	permanent tenure-holders 	should be 	advised to 	set apart 	suitable plots 	of land 	for communal 	use in the way suggested, 	and that 	the Court 	of Wards 	should do this 	in the 	villages under 	their direct 	management, while 	in villages on 	lease a similar 	reservation should 	be made after due enquiry 	before the renewal of any lease, 	 conditions relating to such reservation being inserted in the lease. 
 LABOUR
 
  Complaints 	were received 	by us from 	some raiyats 	that the rates 	paid by the 	landlords for 	labour are 	inadequate. No 	claim was 	urged before us 	by any landlord to any 	right over the 	labour, ploughs or 	carts of 	his tenants, 	and it 	is admitted that 	labour of 	all kinds 	should be taken 	on a 	voluntary basis and 	paid for at local 	market rates. 	While it is clearly 	impossible for us 	to prescribe suitable 	rates for all classes 	of labour, 	we consider 	that it would 	be an advantage 	for the Bihar 	Planters’ Association 	to lay 	down a minimum 	scale of wages 	based on the 	local market rates to 	be paid by 	concerns in 	membership. We 	recognize the 	danger that the 	minimum might in 	practice be 	regarded as 	the maximum, 	but rates 	of wages 	change slowly and the 
 
 adoption of the proposal would at least enable the Association to ascertain whether a concern was prima facie paying inadequate wages and to exercise a stronger position of control. We, therefore, recommend that all labour should be on a purely voluntary basis and paid for at local market rates, that a minimum tariff of labour wages should be fixed on the basis of local market rates by the Association with the approval of the Commissioner of the Division, and that this tariff should be revised from time to time in accordance with the local rates.
 CART “SATTAS”
  Closely 	connected with the 	question of 	labour is 	the supply 	of carts. 	Most indigo 	factories require a 	number of 	carts at 	particular seasons of 	the year 	for the 	carting of 	the indigo 	crop to 	the factory 	and the refuse 	to the 	fields. Most 	factories keep 	sufficient carts for 	their ordinary 	requirements throughout the 	year, but 	hire the 	extra carts required on 	such special 	occasions. In order 	to ensure 	a regular 	supply of carts, 	agreements (sattas) 	are made 	with the cartmen 	to supply 	carts with bullocks at 	certain seasons for 	a fixed 	period of year 	at a 	fixed rate, and 	the consideration for 	these agreements 	invariably takes the 	form of 	an advance which is 	in some cases 	sufficient to 	cover the 	initial cost of 	a cart and 	pair of 	bullocks. Generally, 	however,   it 	is about Rs. 	30 or Rs. 	40. We recognize 	that contracts of this 	nature are essential 	to the 	interests of 	the industry, 	and the system 	is unobjectionable 	provided the rates paid 	are fair and the periods 	not too long, 	but we 	consider the 	periods of 	these contracts 	extending in some 	cases to twenty 	years are prejudicial 	to the 	interests of 	the cartmen. 	We recommend 	that the period 	should be restricted 	to three 	years where the 	advance does not 	exceed Rs. 	50, and to a maximum of 	five years where it 	exceeds Rs. 	50, and that the 	Planters’ Association 	should enforce on its 	members a 	bye-law to 	this effect. 
 FINES
  We 	 received  some  complaints 	 that a   few   landlords   had 	  imposed and retained 	fines on 	tenants in 	particular cases 	where their own interests 	were not 	concerned and no damage 	of any kind was sustained by them. Such a practice is clearly 	illegal and the levy of fines, properly so called, should be stopped. 
 POUNDS
  The 	question of 	pound management 	in the 	Champaran district has 	been brought 	to our notice. 	The pounds 	are largely 	leased to factories, 	which has given 	rise to 	complaints that they are 	sometimes used as 	improper means of 	coercing raiyats 	by the 	impounding of 	cattle without cause. 	While it was impossible 	for us to enquire 	into and 	record a 	finding on 	individual complaints, 	the leasing 	of pounds 	to landlords 	may give 	an opportunity 	for abuse, 	and recommend 	that a 	trial should be 	made as an 
 experiment of the direct management of pounds by the District Board.
 
 VILLAGE ADMINISTRATION PAPER  
 
  We 	have found that there is 	no authoritative record 	of village 	customs such as exists 	in other 	provinces of 	northern India, the 	procedure followed at 	settlement for recording 	various village customs 	being to make 	an entry 	in the 	village note 	which does not 	form part of 	the Record 	of Rights. 	In most 	provinces, it 	has been 	found desirable 	to make 	a regular 	record of such customs 	and rights. 	While we recognize 	that communal 	village life in 	Bihar is 	not so 	strong as 	in some other 	provinces, and 	that some of 	the matters 	such as 	irrigation rights 	recorded in 	these village 	administration papers are 	included in 	the Record 	of Rights 	of Bihar, 	we think 	that advantage would 	result from 	some better authenticated 	record than the village 	note of 	such matters 	as the 	right in 	hides, grazing rights, 	customs as 	to house building 	and the like. 	We commend the suggestion 	to the consideration 	 of Government. 
 MISCELLANEOUS
 
  There 	are two final 	recommendations that 	we desire 	to make 	which are designed 	to secure 	that full effect is given 	to the 	orders which Government 	may pass. 	The first 	is that 	such orders as may be 	passed should be communicated in the 	vernacular to 	the raiyats 	by as wide 	publication as 	possible. The 	second is 	that it 	should be 	impressed on 	the district 	staff and especially 	on the 	staff of the 	Court of Wards 	estates that, 	until Government is 	satisfied that 	full effect has been 	given to these 	orders, an important 	part of 	their duties will be 	to see that 	these orders are carried out.

 [DELHI
 November 26, 1917]
   SIR 	S,     We, 	the members of the All-India Committee of the Indian National 	Congress 
  and 	of the Council of 	the All-India Moslem 	League, welcome you, Sir, His 	Majesty’s Principal 	Secretary of State 	for India, 	and approach 	you and Your 	Excellency the 	Viceroy and 	Governor-General, His 	Imperial Majesty’s 	august representative and 	the head 	of his Government 	in this 	country, with 	feelings of 	gratitude  and  hope; 	gratitude, in 	that proposals 	of reform 	formulated by the 	National Congress and 	the Moslem 	League have received 	the attention 	of Your 	Excellency and 	of His 	Imperial Majesty’s 	Ministers in Great 	Britain whom you, Sir, 	represent; hope, in 	that we 	feel that 	our proposals 	being just and 	in full 	harmony with British history and 	policy, will 	meet with favour at your hands.  Sirs, 	we cannot let this historic occasion pass without acknowledging the 	great and good work that Great Britain has accomplished in India. 	The protection of the land from invasion from without and the 	establishment of peace and order are in themselves no mean 	achievements; but it is a prouder title to glory that she has 	produced a new intellectual awakening a national consciousness and 	an eager longing for freedom among the heirs of ancient civilization 	who had unfortunately fallen from 
 their high estate. It was a great truth which Lord Ripon  of  blessed  memory felicitously uttered when he described educated Indians as the children of British Rule, and we can assure you, Sirs, that Sir Bartle Frere’s observation is as correct today as when he made it that no section of the people of India appreciate the advantages of that rule more highly than those whose minds have been broadened by the liberal English education which will for all time stand as Britain’s most imperishable monument in India. The ir very pol itica l asp irati ons are a tri bute to  the  suc cess  of her mis sion in the Eas t. “Th e pro udest day in the ann als of Eng land” whi ch Lor d Mac aulay for esaw has com e, and Ind ians tod ay dem and  tha t  Sel f-Gov ernme nt  whi ch  Eng lishmen  hav e  alw ays  fer ventl y  bel ieved  to  be   the   ind ispen sable con ditio n of sel f-res pecti ng nat ional lif e. The Ind ian Nat ional Con gress , whi ch a ren owned  Ind ian  sta tesma n  des cribe d  as  “th e  gre atest   tri umph   of   Bri tish adm inist ratio n and a cro wn of glo ry to  the  gre at Bri tish  nat ion” is  the  highe st exp ressi on of thi s  sac red nat ional  asp irati on, and  the  ide al  of  the  Con gress  is als o the ide al of the mos t imp ortan t org aniza tion of Ind ian Mus alman s, the  All - Ind ia  Mos lem  Lea gue.  The  aut horit ative   ann ounce ment   whi ch   was   mad e  sim ultan eousl y in England and India on the 20th of August last that His Majesty’s Government with the complete accord of the Government of India, accept responsible government for India as an integral part of the Empire as the goal of British policy was therefore received by the country with no ordinary feeling of satisfaction. For that epoch-making declaration, Sirs, we Indians of all creeds, classes and communities are deeply beholden to His Majesty’s Government as well as to the Government of India.
 We submit however that to ensure the early realization of this ideal the reforms that are to be introduced as a first instalment should confer a substantial measure of power on the people acting through their chosen representatives in Councils, and further, that the determination of future progress should not, as has been proposed, be left entirely to the Government in India and England. It ought to be recognized that the people of India themselves, as the party principally affected, have a right to an effective voice in the decision of a question which is of such supreme moment to them. This would be in conformity with the principle of the declaration recently made by the Prime Minister of England “that the wishes of the inhabitants must be the supreme consideration in the resettlement”, and that this formula “is to be applied equally in the tropical countries”. It is our settled conviction that the best interests of this Country and of the Empire demand that full responsible Government should be established here as early as practicable. We are therefore anxious to be assured that the progress towards the goal shall be reasonably rapid. We hope that this point will be taken into consideration by His Majesty’s Government.
 We are not less grateful for the decision to introduce a substantial first instalment of reforms at as early a date as may be practicable. We beg leave to observe, Sirs, that the proceedings of the annual sessions of both the Indian National Congress and All-India Moslem League are a living proof of the imperative need of liberal reforms in all directions—constitutional, financial and administrative. Amelioration of the material condition of the masses as well as the satisfaction of the political aspirations of the classes has throughout been the anxious concern of these organizations. They have persistently advocated reforms in land revenue policy and administration; measures for the relief of agricultural indebtedness, agricultural education and agricultural improvement; rapid progress in the construction  of irrigation works; an active policy of industrial development and technical education; the wider diffusion of education in all its branches; retrenchment  of  public expenditure and reduction of taxation, pressing heavily on those least able to bear it; reform of the police, and of the system of administration of justice; temperance reform; lenient forest rules; the improvement of public health, and adequate provision of medical relief; the re-institution of village Panchayats;—all of which are designed and calculated to make life more worth living for the tens of millions of our poorer countrymen, with whose condition as it is no one can affect to be satisfied. We submit with confidence that educated Indians cannot justly be blamed if the remedial measures for which they have been striving have not been introduced. It is true that they have been claiming with equal ardour the practical recognition of the rights which legitimately are theirs in their own country; but in doing so they have been actuated at least as much by the earnest desire to exercise them in the interest of their less favoured brethren as by the prompting of their own national self-respect. If they have insistently pleaded for some measure of real power for the representatives and spokesmen of the people in the government of the country, if they have declined to reconcile themselves to a position of subordination and inferiority in administration,  if they have pressed for the removal of all disabilities and distinction based on racial and religious grounds, if they have expressed their dissatisfaction with the share assigned to them in the defence of the country, and if they have protested against reactionary and repressive measures, they have done so because the assertion of their rights as Indians is to them a compelling public duty. Neither the National Congress nor the Moslem League has ever been slow to acknowledge the  value  of  the progressive measures that have been adopted by Government from time to time. And we may therefore be permitted to say with the less hesitation that the experience of years has convinced us that under the existing system social and economic reform has much less chance than the well-being and advancement of the people demands, that
 
 Indian public opinion is more powerless than effectual, service  and  sectional interests are not always subordinated to the common weal, and that the system should be so altered as to make the will of the people prevail as far as may be in all matters of internal administration.
 ESSENTIAL FEATURES OF SCHEME
 It is in this conviction, Sirs, that the National Congress and the Moslem League considered the constitutional and administrative reforms which they should respectfully urge on the Government here and in England for present adoption. The Joint Scheme of Reforms is the result of careful deliberation of joint conferences of their committees. It may be mentioned here that the Memorandum which was submitted to Your Excellency by nineteen-elected members of Your Excellency’s Legislative Council in the autumn of 1916 is in accord with theproposals of the Congress and the League. We now ask permission, Sirs, to dwell on what may be regarded as the essential features of the Scheme of Reforms. The basal principles on which it is founded are, firstly, that the British connection with India should be safeguarded, and secondly, that, subject to this fundamental reservation the character and constitution of the Government of India and the Provincial Governments should be transformed so as to make them representative of and responsible to the people acting through their elected representatives in Councils. To the former end it is proposed that the Government of India should continue to own responsibility to His Maj esty’s Gov ernme nt, and thr ough the m to the Bri tish Par lia ment, in mat ters pertaining to foreign relations and the defence of the country. The Legislature is to have no control over them. Nor will it have any right to interfere with the relations of the Government with the Indian States. This being secured, it is urged that in matters of internal administration the control of the Secretary of State should be replaced by control by the Legislature; the Government of India similarly devolving power on the provincial Governments, which in their turn will own responsibility to their respective Legislatures. It must obviously follow that there should be a strong Indian element in the Executive Governments as well as that the Legislative Councils should be expanded and reformed so as to consist of a substantial majority of members elected directly by the people on as wide a franchise as may be possible. And these Councils should be endowed with real and substantial power, not only over legislation but also over finance and administration. We venture to think that the Congress and the Moslem League make no extravagant proposals when they ask that one-half of the Executive Councillors should be Indians, and that four-fifths of the Legislative Councils should consist of elected members. Nor, we submit, are the powers proposed for the latter bodies excessive or impracticable. Adequate safeguards have been provided in the Scheme to prevent the adoption of hasty or unsuitable measures— legislative, financial or administrative; as well as to protect the interests of minorities. In connection with the latter point we beg to invite attention to the provision that no non- official proposal affecting communal interests to which three-fourths of the members belonging to that community object, should be proceeded with in any Legislative Council.
 The reforms relating to the Secretary of State and his Council are suggested as being consequential on the reform of the system of government in the country itself. They will, it is trusted, be found to make for economy and for harmony between the authorities in the two countries, without in any way impairing efficiency.
 In the Memora ndum in suppor t of the propos als, which we beg to hand with this addres s, the case for reform is set forth at some length . It discus ses, too, the import ant cognat e subjec t of local self-g overnment and a few urgent ly  needed admini strative reform s for the introd uction of which both the Congre ss and the League have long been earnes tly appeal ing to Govern ment. The resolu tions of the Congre ss and the  Moslem  League ,  the  Joint  Scheme  of  Reform s,  and  the memora ndum of the  ninete en  member s,  are  append ed  to  our  Memora ndum  to facili tate refere nce. We hope that the countr y will not have to wait longer to  see  Lord Ripon’s cheris hed scheme of real local self-g overnment fully  carrie d  out;  or for the substa ntial Indian ization of the public servic es for which our late revere d countr yman, Mr. Dadabh oy Naoroj i, labour ed so long and so  hard;  or  for  the comple te separa tion of the judici al servic es and functi ons from the execut ive, a reform needed even more in the intere st of he backwa rd masses s than of  the classe s; or for such an amendm ent of the Arms Act and Rules as will  not only do away with  the invidi ous racial discri mination agains t Indian s but empower them to possess and carry arms on conditions similar to those which prevail in other civilized countries, in most of the States in this very country, and in the case of Europeans and Americans in British India itself. The country has expressed its gratification at the removal of the bar against the appointment of Indians as commissioned officers in the Army. It trusts that the rules which will regulate their admission will be liberal and open an honourable and patriotic career to the young men of all classes who may satisfy such tests as may be imposed to judge their fitness, that the requisite facilities for their training and examination will be provided in India itself, and that lndians will be appointed in reasonably large numbers. It is a grievance of long standing that Indians are not permitted to enlist as volunteers. If, however, the system of volunteering as it has existed is to disappear, it is believed that the Indian Defence Force will not be disbanded after the war, and it is urged that the Indian section of it may be placed on a level of absolute equality with the European.
 INDIA’S STATUS IN THE EMPIRE
 
 Before taking leave of you, Sirs, we would invite attention to the very important subject of India’s status in the Empire. Our claim in one word is that she should be lifted from the position of a dependency to that of equalitlity with the Dominions. The relation of the two should be mutual in the complete sense of the term. We submit that if the Dominions are to exercise any rights in relation to India, the latter should have the power to exercise the same rights in relation to them. In
 
 any Council or Parliament of the Empire which may be constituted at a future date, India should be represented in like manner and in an equal measure with the  Dominions. Unless this is done, the participation of the Dominions  in  the governance of our country, without a corresponding right in us to participate in the governance of them, will mean a lowering of even our present unsatisfactory status, which will arouse the strongest opposition in this country. We hope and trust that His Majesty’s Government will never entertain any such proposal. In the meantime we re- quest that India may be allowed to be represented in the Imperial Conference (and in the Imperial Cabinet if any such should be constituted) through persons elected by the elected members of our Legislative Councils. We are beholden to His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India for the privilege accorded to India in the beginning of this year, of sending three gentlemen to represent her in the Imperial War Conference and the Imperial War Cabinet. Nor are we less sensible of the value of the unanimous resolution recorded by the former body in favour of the regular representation of India at future ordinary sittings of the Imperial Conference. The consti tutional positi on of the Govern ment of India being what it  is  in  relati on to His Majest y’s Govern ment on the one side and the people of India on the other, its nomine es cannot have the charac ter of repres entatives or spokes men  of  the people, as have the Ministers of the Dominions, which are endowed with responsible government. In this view of the matter we are constrained to submit that during the period of transition from the existing system to responsible government, the representatives of this country in the Imperial Conference and the Imperial Cabinet should be allowed to be elected by the elected members of the Legislative Councils in India.

 APPENDIX VIII
 THE CONGRESS-LEAGUE SCHEME
 
  That 	having regard to 	the fact that the great 	communities of 	India are 	the inheritors 	of ancient 	civilisations and have 	shown great capacity for 	government and 	administration, and 	to the 	progress in 	education and 	public spirit made 	by them 	during a 	century of 	British Rule, and 	further having regard to 	the fact 	that the present 	system of 	Government does 	not satisfy the 	legitimate aspirations of 	the people 	and has become 	unsuited to existing 	conditions and 	requirements, the 	Congress is 	of opinion 	that the 	time has 	come when His 	Majesty the 	King-Emperor should be pleased 	to issue 	a Proclamation 	announcing that it is the 	aim and intention of 	British policy 	to confer 	Self-Government on India 	at an early date.  That 	in the 	reconstruction of 	the Empire, 	India shall be 	lifted towards 	Self- Government 	by granting 	the Reforms 	contained in the 	scheme prepared by 	the All- 	India Congress 	Committee in concert 	with the Reform 	Committee appointed by 	the All-India 	Muslim League (detailed below).  That 	in the 	reconstruction of 	the Empire, India shall 	be lifted from  the 	 position of 	a dependency 	to that 	of an equal 	partner in the 	Empire with the 	Self- Governing Dominions. 
 
 REFORM SCHEME I—PROVINCIAL LEGISLATIVE COUNCILS
  Provincial 	Legislative Councils shall consist of 	four-fifths elected and 	of one-fifth 	nominated members.  Their 	strength shall 	be not 	less than 125 	members in 	the major 	Provinces, and 	from 50 	to 75 in the minor Provinces.  The 	members of 	Councils should be 	elected directly by 	the people 	on as broad 	a franchise 	as possible.  Adequate 	provision should be made 	for the representation 	of important 	minori-ties by 	election, and 	the Muslims should be 	represented through 	special electorates on be 	Provincial Legislative Councils in 	the following proportions:

 Provided that no Muslim shall participate in any of the other elections to the Imperial or Provincial Legislative Councils, save and except those by electorates representing special interests.
 Provided further that no bill, nor any clause thereof, nor a resolution introduced by a non-official member affecting one or the other community, which question is to be determined by the members of that community in the Legislative Council concerned, shall be proceeded with, if three-fourths of the members of that community in the particular Council, Imperial or Provincial, oppose the bill or any clause thereof or the resolution.
  The 	head of the Provincial 	Government should 	not be 	the President of the 	Legislative Council but the Council should have the right of electing its President.  The 	right of 	asking supplementary 	questions should not be 	restricted to 	the member putting 	the original 	question, but should 	be allowed 	to be exercised 	by any 	other member. 
 7 (a) Except customs, post, telegraph, mint, salt, opium, railways, army and navy, and tributes from Indian States, all other sources of revenue should be Provincial.
  There 	should be no divided 	heads of revenue. 	The Government 	of India 	should be provided 	with fixed contributions 	from the Provincial 	Governments, such fixed 	contributions being 	liable to revision 	when extraordinary 	and unforeseen 	contingencies render such revision necessary.  The 	Provincial Council 	should have full 	authority to 	deal with all matters 	affecting the internal 	administration of the 	Province, including the 	power to 	raise loans, 	to impose 	and alter taxation 	and to vote 	on the Budget.

Resolution 	on all 	matters within 	the purview 	of the 	Provincial Government 	should be 	allowed for 	discussion in 	accordance with rules 	made in that 	behalf by the 	Council itself.  A 	resolution passed by 	the Provincial 	Legislative Council shall be 	binding on 	the Executive Government, 	unless vetoed 	by the Governor-in-Council, 	provided however 	that if 	the resolution 	is again 	passed by the 	Council after an 	interval of 	not less 	than one year, 	it must 	be given 	effect to.  A 	motion for 	adjournment may 	be brought 	forward for the 	discussion of 	a definite 	matter of urgent 	public importance, if 	supported by 	not less than one-eighth 	of the members present. 
  A 	special meeting of 	the Provincial Council 	may be summoned  on  a 	requisition by not less than one-eighth of the members present.  A 	Bill, other than a 	Money Bill may be 	introduced in 	Council in 	accordance with 	rules made in that behalf 	by the Council 	itself, and 	the consent  of 	 the Government 	should not be required therefor.  All 	Bills passed by 	Provincial Legislatures 	shall have to 	receive the 	assent of 	the Governor before they become law, but may be vetoed by the Governor-General. The term of office of the members shall be five years. 
 II-PROVINC IAL GOVERNM ENTS
  The 	head of every 	Provincial Government shall be 	a Governor 	who shall 	not ordinarily belong to the Indian Civil Service or any of the permanent services.

The 	franchise for 	the Imperial Legislative 	Council should be widened 	as far as 	possible on 	the lines of 	the electorates 	for Muslims 	for the Provincial 	Legislative Councils, 	and the elected 	members of the Provincial 	Legislative Councils should also 	form an electorate for the return of members of the Imperial Legislative Council.  One-third 	of the Indian elected members should be Muslims elected by separate 	Muslim electorates in 	the several 	Provinces, in the 	proportion, as 	nearly as 	may be, 	in which 	they are represented 	on the 	Provincial Legislative 	Councils by separate 	Muslim electorates. Vide 	provisos to 	section l, 	clause 4. The President of the Council shall be elected by the Council itself.  The 	right of 	asking supplementary 	questions shall not 	be restricted 	to the 	member putting the 	original question but 	should be 	allow to 	be exercised by 	any other member.

All 	Bills passed by 	the Council 	shall have 	to receive the assent of 	the Governor-General 	before they become law.  All 	financial proposals 	relating to sources 	of income 	and items 	of expenditure 	shall be 	embodied in 	Bills. Every such 	Bill and the Budgets as 	a whole 	shall be submitted 	for the vote 	of the Imperial 	Legislative Council. The 	term of office of members shall be five years.  The 	matters mentioned herein 	below shall be 	exclusively under the 	control of 	the Imperial 	Legislative Council. 
 Matters in regard to which uniform legislation for the whole of India is desirable. Provincial legislation in so far as it may affect inter-Provincial fiscal relations.  Questions 	affecting purely Imperial Revenue, 	excepting tributes 	from Indian 	State.  Questions 	affecting purely Imperial expenditure, except that no 	resolution of 	the Imperial 	Legislative Council shall be 	binding on 	the 	Governor-General-in-Council 	in respect 	of military 	charges for the defence 	of the country.  The 	right of 	revising Indian tariffs 	and customs 	duties, of imposing, 	altering, or removing 	any tax or 	cess, modifying 	the existing 	system of 	currency and 	banking, and 	granting any 	aids or 	bounties to 	any or 	all deserving 	and nascent 	industries of the 	country. Resolutions on all matters relating to the administration of the country as a whole. 
  A 	resolution passed 	by the 	Legislative Council 	should be binding 	on the 	Executive Government 	unless vetoed by the 	Governor-General-in-Council; 	provided however that 	if the 	resolution is 	again passed by 	the Council 	after an interval 	of not 	less than one 	year, it 	must be 	given effect to.

When 	the Crown chooses to 	exercise its 	power of 	veto in 	regard to 	a Bill 	passed by 	the Provincial 	Legislative Council, or 	by the Imperial 	Legislative Council,  it 	should be 	exercised within twelve 	months from the date 	on which 	it is passed, 	and the Bill shall cease 	to have 	effect as 	from the date on 	which the fact of 	such veto is 	made known to 	the Legislative Council concerned.  The 	Imperial Legislative 	Council shall have no 	power to 	interfere with 	the Government 	of India’s 	direction of the 	military affairs and 	the foreign and 	political relations 	of India, 	including the 	declaration of 	war, the making 	of peace 	and the 	entering into treaties. 
 IV-THE GOVERNM ENT OF INDIA
 The Governor-General of India will be the head of the Government of India. He will have an Executive Council, half of whom shall be Indians.  The 	Indian members should be 	elected by 	the elected members of 	the Imperial Legislative Council.  Members 	of the 	Indian Civil 	Service shall 	not ordinarily be 	appointed to 	the Executive 	Council of the Governor-General.  The 	power of 	making all 	appointments in 	the Imperial 	Civil Services 	shall vest 	in the 	Government of 	India, as 	constituted under this 	scheme, due 	regard being 	paid to 	existing interests 	subject to any 	laws that may 	be made 	by the 	Imperial Legislative Council.  The 	Government of 	India shall not 	ordinarily interfere in 	the local 	affairs of a Province, 	and powers 	not specifically 	given to 	a Provincial 	Government shall be 	deemed to be vested in the former. The authority of the Government of India will 
 ordinarily be limited to general supervision and superintendence over the Provincial Governments.
  In 	legislative and 	administrative matters 	the Government 	of India, as constituted 	under this scheme, 	shall, as far as 	possible, be 	independent of the 	Secretary of State.  A 	system of 	independent audit 	of the 	accounts of 	the Government 	of India 	should be instituted. 
 V-THE SECRETARY OF STATE IN COUNCIL
 
 The Council of the Secretary of State for India should be abolished. The salary of the Secretary of State should be placed on the British Estimates.  The 	Secretary of 	State should, as 	far as 	possible, occupy the 	same position in 	relation to 	the Government of 	India, as 	the Secretary of 	State for 	the Colonies does in 	relation to the 	Governments of 	the Self-Governing Dominions.  The 	Secretary of 	State for 	India should be 	assisted by 	two Permanent 	Under- Secretaries, 	one of whom should always be an Indian. 
 VI—INDIA AND THE EMPIRE
  In 	any Council 	or other 	body which may be 	constituted or 	convened for 	the settlement 	or control 	of Imperial 	affairs, India shall be 	adequately represented in 	like manner 	with the Dominions 	and with 	equal rights.  Indians 	should be placed 	on a footing 	of equality 	in respect 	of status 	and rights 	of citizenship with other subjects of His Majesty the King throughout the Empire. 
 VII-MILITAR Y AND OTHER MATTERS
 
  The 	military and 	naval services of 	His Majesty, 	both in 	their commissioned 	and non-commissioned 	ranks, should be thrown 	open to 	Indians and 	 adequate provision should be made for their selection, training and instruction in India. Indians 	should be allowed 	to enlist 	as volunteers.  Executive 	Officers in India shall have no judicial powers entrusted to them, 	and the 	judiciary in 	every Province shall be 	placed under the highest 	Court of that 	Province.

EXTRACT FROM J.T. WHITTY’S LETTER TO L. F. MORSHEAD
 [BETTIAH,
 November 17, 1917]
 . . . It is a fact that very exaggerated ideas as regards Mr. Gandhi’s position are held   by   the   raiyats,   but   I   hear   it   on   good   authority    that    in    cases where  he  has  given  directions of  which  the  raiyats disapprove they   have refused to  obey  him.  I  am  told  for  instance  that  in  the  Turkaulia  Dehat  when Mr. Gandhi advised the raiyats that they should pay Sharahbeshi less the 20 per cent agreed on they said definitely that they would do no such thing and are now saying “Who is Gandhi?”
 Two days ago Mr. Gandhi wrotelibtech_856_footnoteto me to say that he had a number of enquiries from the raiyats as to why enhancement suits in villages where Tawan had been taken were still going on although no enhancement was to be taken for seven years. It struck me that the enquiry showed an extraordinary lack of knowledge of the law on the subject and the position generally. Obviously we are not going to withdraw our cases as we merely intend to remit the enhancement for seven years but must have it recorded as legal rent and in any case we have as yet no reliable information as to the
 raiyats who have actually paid Tawan.
 I replied to Mr. Gandhi that he was under a misapprehension which I should be glad to explain to him if he would call on me but that at the same time I wished to point out that the raiyats had not been to me and that I did not approve of having an intermediary in matters which I can deal with myself.
 His reply was to the effect that he could not understand Government Offi- cers refusing the assistance of public men who are in closer touch with theraiyats than they could hope to be when both were working with the same object. He said he did not wish to come and see me on sufferance.
 I replied that the matter in which he had intervened between me and my tenants was one of no difficulty whatever, [one] on which I required no assistance from any outsiders and that I objected to the introduction of an intermediary which prevented me from being in direct touch with my own tenants.
 Mr. Gandhi refused to admit that his intervention was not justified, but expressed his wish to see me as regards his education policy.
 
 
 I saw him and had a long talk with him and discussed the various points raised in the Commission’s report.
 As always in conversation I found him generally very reasonable. He  expressed regret at the sudden breaking up of indigo cultivation. His own view was that some time might have been given. He told me that the refusal to pay rent is due to the stupidity of the raiyats who misinterpreted the orders passed. Whenever they came to him he explained to them that they must pay rent as usual. His own wish he says now is to utilize his position and any gratitude which he has earned from the
 raiyats to introduce sanitary ideas and improve agricultural methods. He wishes to
 improve the relations of planters and their tenants as far as it is in his power to do so.
 He approved of the action of his lieutenant in going out to enquire into the alleged disturbance in Ammon’s dehat, in which the police  were  said  to  be implicated, and this being so he would no doubt be prepared to make similar enquiries
 if asked to do so by the raiyats.
 I still consider that Mr. Gandhi himself is disinterested in his  ultimate motives, but in order to strengthen and secure his position he has to make use of methods and instruments which are sure to become a danger to the peace of the district.
 As regards the non-payment of rent and the interference with landlords’ admitted rights, he would certainly be on the side of the law and would advise the raiyats accordingly. To this extent at the present time his presence in the district is likely to do good rather than harm. At the same time he must be a continued centre of
 agitation. He has not been accepted as an arbitrator who will be fair to the interests of all parties, but as a champion of the raiyats against the Planters and it will be impossible for him to avoid being a storm-centre.
 Yours sincerely,
 J. T. WHITTY

 MOTIHARI
 November 18, 1917
 
 DEA R MR. GANDH I,
 I have to acknowledge your letter of 14-11-1917 instt.
 I am interested to hear of your attempt to found schools. I shall be glad to hear more about this, regarding the class of schools you propose to open, and the type of education to be imparted. Also the places where you open them.
 With regard to your letter of 17th instant about the matter of certain ryots’ complaints that they had been compelled to sign certain documents. . . they are at liberty to go to the court if they think they have been victimized.
 I am quite unable to listen to any observations in a case which is before the courts, which might tend to prejudice the merit of the court . . . I am glad therefore that you do not intend to impart your observations to me regarding a case brought by Sheoratan Nonia.

 J. 	L. MERRIMAN’S LETTER 	TO L. F. MORSHEAD 
 
MOTIHARI,
 November 24, 1917
 
DEA R MR. MORS HEAD,
 
My fortnightly confidential report.
 The general situation gets no easier, rather the reverse. I regret to report that the recent Government vernacular notice appears to have tended to increase its difficulty. . .
  . 	.. t he re a 	pp ea r 	s  t o  b e a  r ec ru d 	es ce n 	ce  o 	f  e xc it e 	me nt c oi 	nc i di 	ng w it h M r.  G an dh i ’ s  r et ur n  a nd  t he  a nn ou n ce me n t  o f  t he  G ov er n me nt ’ s r es ol u ti on .  Mr. 	Gandhi is 	again with us, 	though he 	has just written to 	inform me 	that he 	is going 	away for a 	fortnight. I 	informed you 	of the 	interview I 	had with 	him on 	9th November 	1917. He has 	been very active since 	his arrival 	early in the 	month. He 	has started 	founding schools at the 	following places: 
  Barharwa-ne-Dhaka—in 	charge of Mr. 	and Mrs. Gokhalay, the 	latter being a 	“trained nurse and midwife”.  Mi 	ti har wa 	—in ch 	ar ge of Mr . So ma n, “a 	pu bl ic wo rk er fr 	om Be lg aum 	”, Mr 	. Ba lk ris hn a, “a yo 	un g ma 	n fr 	om Gu ja rat ” 	an d 	Mr s. Ga nd hi he 	rs elf . Belwa, 	P. S. Shikarpur, near Belwa Factory. 
 I solicit instructions as to the attitude to be adopted to Mr. Gandhi and his schools and hygienic propaganda. Am I to encourage him in his  work  before satisfying myself of its character, or am I to adopt a neutral attitude.
 I am not prepared as yet to make any comments either on the nature of the instruction given by him or on the character of his followers. I know nothing about them. Personally I think that if they are genuinely interested in the matter they profess, they will soon get sick of trying to teach hygiene to the Bihari cultivator. Mr. Gandhi has been trying to get subscriptions for his schools, but has been met with a very modified enthusiasm from local Indians in this respect.
  Similarly 	I would 	like instructions as 	to my attitude with regard to Mr. Gandhi’s 	other activities 	He is not 	confining himself 	to hygienic 	and educational 	matters only. He 	has been 	making personal enquiries at 	Belwa (the place at 	which he 	has also 	founded a school) 	concerning the recent 	case brought by Sheoratan 	Nonia v. 	Mr. Ammon 	of Belwa 	Factory, in 	connection with 	which I reported 	the conduct 	of Babu 	Janakdhari Prasad in my 	official letter of 	the 27th 	October last. Mr. Gandhi 	has offered 	to make 	“observations” on the 	case to 	me after it 	has been 	judicially decided. He has also been enquiring into the question of some agreements executed by the 
 raiyats of the Seeraha Factory. I learn from Mr. Ammon that at Belwa Mr. Gandhi
 held a kind of formal enquiry, and took the depositions of complainant and some witnesses.
 As a public officer, I presume, I should welcome friendly assistance from outside. At the same time the practice of independent enquiries into cases actually pending before the course appears to me to be open to grave abuses, especially when the people concerned are, as in Champaran, ignorant, ill-balanced and prone to untruthfulness. Mr. Gandhi himself, quite possibly with justice, claims to be wholly impartial, but the impartiality of many of his assistants is open to suspicion, and I consider them be not above “doctoring” a case to suit themselves. Mr. Gandhi has, I believe, previously given assurance that he would only interfere in cases where he believed the raiyats had been clearly victimized. But I submit that Mr. Gandhi’s judgment is fallible. It appears to be quite impossible to make such distinction between cases. The practice must be countenanced in all cases or in none. I ask for guidance on this point.
 Wit h reg ard to the imp ortat ion of “vo lunte ers” fro m Bel gaum, Guj arat and Bom bay rep orted in par a 9, I sho uld als o lik e to be inf ormed of the
 attitude of Government. Mr. McPherson in a D. O. letter no. 2577C-1571/II of 1917, dated 20th July, 1917, to Heycock, instructed Heycock to inform Mr. Gandhi that he (Heycock) was ‘‘not aware of the attitude Government will adopt towards the importation of “volunteers”. May I now enquire if Government will communicate to me their attitude? . .
 Yours sincerely,
 J. L. MERRIMAN
 (C) EXTR ACT FROM L . F. MORSH EAD’S LETT ER TO H. MCPHERSO N

 There are three factors just now tending to upset raiyats in the Division, namely, Home Rule propaganda, Gandhi’s activities, and the tension between Hindus and Mahomedans: These react upon each   other   to   upset   the   raiyats’  minds and
 promote a disregard of law and authority. As already reported, village to village Home Rule meetings are being held in Saran, and are said to have encouraged the incident at Sipahiya; and, in combination with Gandhi’s influence, to be stirring up trouble with the Maniara concern in Gopalganj.
 Merriman’s letter will show that the refusal to pay rent is becoming serious in Champaran, and that labour troubles are not settled. He asks for instructions as to his attitude towards Gandhi, especially in regard to his educational schemes and his importation of volunteers. I have not, however, had time to consider his letter properly.

 I understand Sir William Vincent is coming here in a day or two and I think it might clear the air if H. H. and the two H.Ms. could see him together and point out the state of affairs in the District and ask how far the Government of India is prepared to go. The only effective action that I can see is to get Mr. Gandhi to promise to leave the District absolutely alone for six months or a year at least. If he really does that there is some chance of things settling down. As long as his name and personality keep bobbing up there is no chance of things settling. If we appeal to Mr. Gandhi to give the District a chance and he refuses or does not do so, how far will the Government of India back us up if we have to resort to compulsion? Sir W. Vincent will not of course be able to give us any absolute pledge, but he may be able to give us a glimpse into the mind of the Government of India which we do not possess.

CHI EF SE CRETA RY,
 Mr. Reid told me yesterday he had heard from Messrs Norman and Hill that all is quiet in their dehats and that Mr. Gandhi has helped to bring refractory raiyats to reason. He says, however, that considerable unrest is now spreading into Muzaffarpur, owing, it is stated, to the distribution there of the leaflets issued in Muzaffarpur district stating that these leaflets have no reference to that district and concern Champaran only.
 The Maharani of Hathwa also told me this morning that there is a tendency in Saran for the raiyats to withhold their rents because of the unrest caused by Mr. Gandhi and the Home Rule propaganda. It is worth couidering whether it would not be
 well to issue proclamation to the raiyats enjoining the payment of their lawful rents,
 and pointing out that they will themselves be the sufferers if they withhold payment.

 In considering the situation in Champaran we have also to consider the disquieting reports received from other districts north of the river, particularly those from Chapra. There can be no doubt that a wave of unrest has passed through the districts of Muzaffarpur, Darbhanga and Saran. This wave undoubtedly started with Mr. Gandhi’s advent. That there was discontent in Champaran there can be no question but with Mr. Gandhi’s advent the attitude of the raiyats underwent a change for the worse.
 Rumours of what Mr. Gandhi was going to do spread throughout the districts named and we know it for a fact that raiyats from all districts went to Mr. Gandhi with their grievances.  At  the   time   not  much  attention  appears  to   have   been   paid   to  the
 complaints from other districts but the general impression amongst the  raiyats  of
 other districts seems to be that, Mr. Gandhi, when he has done with Champaran, will take up the cause in other districts; in fact our latest information is that, speaking at recent meeting at Muzaffarpur, he promised that later on the tenants of that district would also enjoy the benefits that he, by his efforts, had secured for Champaran. In these circumstances it is not surprising that the simple folk should in Mr. Gandhi recognize someone all powerful. Whatever Mr. Gandhi’s intentions may be, and l am willing to believe they are well meant, the fact remains that he is accompanied by a number of undesirables who are making use of his name to stir up trouble. If Mr. Gandhi’s speeches have been correctly reported, they are calculated toencourage disaffection. Such statements as he wished to see tenants partners with the planters and not slaves, that “the interests of the Hindus lay in trying to stop the wholesale
 slaughter of cows” appear curious statements for this gentleman to make at the present time, if, as he professes, he is trying to allay unrest. His action in making enquiries into cases that are sub judice almost amounts to contempt of court and certainly lowers the prestige of the local officials. I have no hesitation in saying Mr. Gandhi’s presence is undesirable at the present time.
  EXTRACT 		FROM H. McPHERSON’S 		LETTER TO  
 SECRETARY, HOME DEPARTMENT
 December 6, 1917
 Mr. Gandhi’s continued presence in Champaran is a difficult factor in the situation. His objects are doubtless sincere, and he is said to be striving for peace and to have worked with success in certain case to attain this end in co-operation with the more responsible planters. His politics, however, are not within the comprehension of the ordinary cultivator, and the actions of the satellites, with whom he is  surrounded, are not in all cases inspired with his own honesty of purpose. Mr. Gandhi  is a prominent exponent of Home Rule, and the “monster” petition for which signatures are being collected throughout the mofussil was drafted by him.
 There are other development of Mr. Gandhi’s work which, however well intentioned they may be, are liable to be misunderstood by the raiyats. His activities extend to the foundation of schools where instruction is imparted by educated teachers from Bombay and to the investigation by him and his followers of cases which are being inquired into by the police. Enough is not yet known of his schools and teachers to say what sort of ideas they are instilling into the minds of their pupils, but it is certain that his interference in criminal cases is a cause of embarrassment to the local police and magistracy.

MY DEAR MR. G ANDHI ,
 You would have arrived at Motihari by the time this reaches you and would like to know how the work here is progressing.
 Since you were here last, we have been able to put almost all the wells in the village in order by removing the drains which being so close to the wells were polluting the drinking-water. In one or two case, it was a difficult task as a drain from
 the house could not be diverted unless it passed through a neighbour’s property which we managed to divert by appealing to the kindly feeling of the neighbour. In the other case, we had to take assistance of the elders of the village to use some persuasion. Anyhow we have achieved our object.
 We are now after them for committing nuisance quite close to their house. This we propose to effect through an elderly Mahomedan preaching against [it at] their usual Friday gathering. We propose to adopt a similar course for the Hindus. l think in the course of a few weeks we shall be able to see good results. In the meantime, we have managed to convince the people that there is no loss of prestige in at least covering the faeces with earth by doing it ourselves for them. You will be glad to know that people have now taken to it.
 As for the schools, the number of students has gone up to over 75. The average daily attendance for the last month was over 60. The boys seem to take great delight in learning their songs and also the new outdoor games that are taught to them after their usual drill. Mrs. Gokhalay visits the village in the neighbourhood almost daily as there is always a female patient requiring medical aid.
 When the people have gathered their harvest we intend to call them in the evenings and address them on the subjects of hygiene and general culture.
 Dr. Deva called here last Wednesday and stayed over a day as there are many patients  whom   we   could   not   have   attended.   We   cannot   get   his prescriptions dispensed in Dhaka Dispensary and we shall have to apply to higher authorities to make special case and have them dispensed, which would greatly help the poor folk in the neighbourhood but before that we intend to see  Hospital Assistant in Dhaka.

As soon as the harvest is gathered we shall call the members of the committee to raise necessary funds for the work in hand.

DEA R MR. GAND HI,
 You may remember discussing with me in Ranchi possibility of your raising a labour corps from Champaran for service in Mesopotamia. I understood that you were prepared to raise a corps of Army Bearers under your own command. I have however been told that you would be willing to raise a labour corps. Will you kindly let me know if this is the case, and if so whether you are still willing to do so, and what, if any, conditions you wish to attach. If you wish any force you raise to be a self-contained unit and not drafts to existing units, it will be necessary for me to address Army Headquarters. On the other hand if you do not want to go yourself and could assist us in obtaining men for the railway training depot at Gaya, where we need 500 a month, your assistance will be much appreciated. Kindly address your reply to me at Ranchi.

MY DEAR MR. G ANDHI ,
 Thanks for your letter of the 15th. I note our requirements which you will see are at present limited to drafts for existing units. There is no intention at present of raising a fresh Labour Corps.
 We need men for Mesopotamia or for the Railway Training Depots at Gaya and Puri whence after 2 or 3 months’ training they would be despatched to Basra. We give an advance of Rs. 30. The men get Rs. 15 p.m. while in India and Rs. 20 when overseas. Rs. 3 capitation fee is paid for each man brought in.
 Cannot you in the course of your tours point out the  great  economic opportunity now offered? If one man from household goes he can remit Rs. 8 p. m. to
 his family and still have 100 or 200 according to the duration of war as undisbursed pay to start him in life on his return.
 Labourers must be over 20 and under 35, really physically strong. If you can help us in recruiting such men you will not only be doing something towards the war but benefiting the people in whom you are taking personal interest. Three or four lakhs of rupees have been paid out in the Sandal Parganas to the great discomfiture of the mahajan or oppressive landlord.
 If you want to raise a corps of army bearers yourself and will let me know how many you could get I will send on your proposal to Army Headquarters.
 Yours sincerely,

   LETTER 			FROM L. F. MORSHEAD   
 
MOTIHARI,
 January 14, 1918
 
 DEA R MR. GAND HI,
 In connection with the Champaran Agrarian Bill, I pointed out to the Government that the first clause of section 3, as at present drafted, prohibits khuski agreements, as hitherto understood, no less than tinkathia, because the forra of satta approved by the Planters’ Association contains a stipulation as to the area to be cultivated in order to supply the produce to be paid for by weight.
 I have had a letter in reply to say that in the opinion of Government there is nothing in section 5 of the Bill to render invalid a khuski satta of the kind hitherto approved, but section 3 would render invalid the penalty for breach of such contract
 by liquidated damages. Prima facie there is no objection to an agreement to grow
 indigo on two bighas or, I suppose, any other portion of land provided that the raiyat has entire freedom to select the actual plots to be cultivated, and it was apparently the intention of the Agrarian Committee that the existing system of  khuski should be
 allowed to continue subject to that proviso.
 I have been accordingly requested to ascertain the views of the raiyats and their representatives both on this point and as to the most suitable way of modifying clause 3, so as not to interfere with khuski sattas.
 We discussed the matter this morning, and I put before you Mr. Kennedy’s amendment, which is as follows:
 From the Ist October, 1917, any right, servitude or other interest notwithstanding, all lands within the district of Champaran shall be held by the tenant thereof free from any incident of tenure whereby such tenant is burdened with the obligation to grow any crop for the convenience of his landlord on his land or any part thereof and any previous act or acts permitting such as an incidence of tenure are hereby expressly repealed.
 Any agreement, contract or hypothecation whereby a tenant agrees, contracts with or hypothecates to his landlord the crop grown on his holding or any part thereof shall be void as regards such condition save the holding or part of the holding be specially defined in such agreement, contract or hypothecation.
 l understand that you take exception to the second portion of this amendment, which   I   mark   B,   but   thought   that   the   first    portion    alone,    which    I  mark A, would be acceptable. Will you kindly let me know if I may inform  Government accordingly ? They are anxious to have a reply before the meeting of the Select Committee on the 19th. Could you oblige me with a reply before that date? I shall be in camp at Ramgarhwa on the 15th and 16th and at Chainpatya on the 17th and 18th.

 (B) L. F. MORSHEAD’ S LETTER TO H. COUPLAND
 
 CAMP RAMGARHWA,
 January 16, 1918
 
MY DEAR COUPL AND,
 . . . Heycock and I saw Mr. Gandhi at Motihari on the 14th on the subject. I pointed out to Mr. Gandhi that the first clause of section 3 prohibits khuski, as hitherto understood and approved by the Committee in paragraph 8 of their report, no
 less than  tinkathia. Under that system a   raiyat  agrees to  grow indigo usually  in
 consideration of an advance. He offers land which the concern approves before giving an advance, and is paid on the produce.
 For purpos es of discus sion I took the Rajpor e system , as I  unders tand  Mr. Sly an d Mr . Ga nd hi ha d ex am ine d th is  sy st em at  Ra jp ore  an d we re  sa ti sfi ed wi th it . Mr . Gandhi raised an object ion that if the raiyat failed to grow the plots agreed upon, he would be liable to a suit for specif ic  perfor mance  of  the  contra ct and liquid ated damage s; and so he would be, of course , if he took the advanc e and did not fulfil his part of the agreem ent and damage result ed.
 Mr. Gandhi explained that the Bill was drafted in order to save khuski agreements which     otherwise     were     held     in     accordance     with      the      opinion      of Sir S. P. Sinha to be barred under the Tenancy Act. I then suggested that they might be left to the operation of the Tenancy Act, which at any rate would leave the khuski
 system in the position in which it stands now, whereas the Bill prohibits it contrary  to the Committee’s intention. In order to focus the discussion I showed him Mr. Kennedy’s amendment, and asked if he approved of the first part of it, which confines the new legislation to the prohibition of tinkathia as a condition of tenancy. Upon reading it he declared himself ready to accept the first part of it as a solution. I told him that I did not wish to ‘shoot him sitting’ and he had better think it over. I then wrote the attached letter, and enclose a copy of his reply.
 I do not myself believe that Mr. Gandhi represents the raiyats. So long as there is no compulsion they are competent to understand their own interests, and they both have been and are willing to grow indigo on the khuski system in Saran, where there is no tinkathia as well as in Champaran and Muzaffarpur a leading advantage of
 it being that if they require a fairly substantial advance to pay off a mahajan or the like they can get it. They will, however, lose this if they are not allowed to agree upon, at any rate, the description of land to be sown. It might be necessary to stipulate that the rent accounts must be kept entirely separate, but to go beyond this  is likely, in my own opinion, to do more harm than good.
 Yours sincerely,
 L. F. MORSHEAD

LETTER TO ‘‘THE STATESMAN’’","
 January 8, 1918
 TO
 THE EDITOR
 THE STAT ESMAN
 [CALC UTTA] SIR ,
 It being quite evident that people outside of Champaran, and least of all the Governments of Behar and Orissa and of India (vide the New Year’s Honours’ List) have no adequate conception of the grievous harm done in that district by Mr. Gandhi’s “mission”, and the ill-judged recommendations of the egregious Committee
 
 of Enquiry, I am once more tempted to draw attention to and emphasize both cause and effect.
 To Government Mr. Gandhi gave an assurance that when he returned to Champaran all his efforts would be concentrated on the promotion (really renewal) of amicable relations between landlords and tenants (of the disruption of which he and his supporters were the main if not the only cause). I hope and intend that this letter well enable you to decide whether or not he had loyally abided by his undertaking.
 His instructions to tenants, since his return, have been to resist all the landlords’ rent demands, unless granted a reduction of 20 per cent; 26 per cent Sarabeshi (as the case may be) or a refund gf 25 per cent Tawan,— this  in  anticipation of the threatened special legislation, and notwithstanding that there is no law at present to that effect. Not only has this advice, which has been closely followed by the tenants, greatly embarrassed factories in their current working expenses, but has also, for the first time in the 32 years since the floating of the
 Bettiah Sterling Loan, caused the guarantors (or at least some of them) of the interest for that loan, to fail in the payment of the kist (instalment) which fell due on December 15th last, and thus has actually forced the Estate to borrow money again for the purpose. The guarantors can hardly be held responsible by the Courts of Wards for a failure directly caused by the mistaken action of Government, in sanctioning the wholly unnecessary (as was stated by His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor himself) Committee.
 I was asked by the District Officer to submit a rent collection statement for the Ist quarter of the current Fasli year (1325) for comparison with the same period of last year, in order no doubt to explain the default of the Mothihari Ltd., share, amounting to Rs. 48,590-8, of the above interest, and I showed a deficit of Rs. 56,086-8-3, which more than accounted for the non-payment. Fisheries which since time immemorial have belonged to the Raj and to the lessees under the Raj have been and are now being stopped ant looted by misguided tenants under, as they have stated in judicial and police inquiries, the instructions of Mr. Gandhi. The average in this
 concern for the past five years, or ever since Sarabeshi and Tawan were instituted, of
 rent suits ant trifling criminal cases, was 21, and less than 3, respectively, per annum. This year, thanks to Mr. Gandhi and the Committee’s recommendations, I anticipate not less than, 2,200 of the former, and for the later I cannot of course make any estimate. From the points of view of the lawyers and usurpers who imported Mr. Gandhi this doubtless is satisfactory but alas! I sigh for the happy record of non- litigation now hopelessly broken.
 At a lecture delivered by Mr. Gandhi in what is known as the ‘‘Gaurakshini Sabha” or refuge for aged cows, in Motihari, that gentleman, I am informed and believe, exhorted his Hindu and Mohamedan listeners to cease fighting with each other about the killing of one cow per annum, and make a united attack on the
 Saheblog (the landlords) who slaughter and eat cows daily. During the absences of her lord and master at Home Rule and suchlike functions Mrs. Gandhi, following in the footsteps of Mrs. Annie Besant, scatters similar advice broadcast, and has recently, under the shallow pretence of opening a school, started a bazaar in the dehat of one of
 the smaller concerns, in which grain and other articles can be purchased without the payment to the malik (proprietor) or lessee of the customary bazaar dues, octroi, etc. This is obviously and palpably done to shut down and ruin two neighbouring bazaars belonging to the factory. Can all the above be possibly construed into an honest fulfilment of Mr. Gandhi’s undertaking to Government?
 Court chaprassis have told me that they dare not mention the disloyalty and defiance of all authority which are openly tallced of in villages into which they have  to go in the performance of their duties. At least one court peon, whom I know, went into two of my villages to serve summonses, and was there insulted and hustled and turned out, and was told that no authority, civil or criminal, was now recognized other than that of “Gandhi Saheb”. And so on and so on. Instances might be indefinitely multiplied, but will these serve any purpose when the Government wilfully shuts its eyes to the contempt of all legally constituted authority, and to the defiance of all civil and criminal law, and blindly persists in trying to pass a special Bill affecting only 5 factories in all Behar and Orissa ? And even these so unfairly and inequitably that those whose tenants are discontented and out of hand,  are  compulsorily benefited, while those whose tenants have not complained nor have had any cause of complaint, are to be most unjustly penalized. There is no knowing to what extremes this sort of special legislation may not be carried and all zemindars and landholders should take warning that their liberties may at any moment be similarly sacrificed for the pacification of any political agitation, and the Permanent Settlement be as ruthlessly brushed aside as the Bengal Tenancy Act, if thought to be standing in the way of any preacher of thinly-veiled sedition. I would be, perfectly willing to guarantee that if Mr. Gandhi and his satellites were compelled to evacuate the district, in less than two months order and quiet would be re-established, for already the raiyats are jeering at the lavishness of his promises to them and the tenuity of their
 materialisation.
 Yours, etc.,

 APPENDIX XVI
 MEMORANDUM OF BIHAR PLANTERS’ ASSOCIATIONlibtech_857_footnote
 January 5, 1918
 In the opinion of these members, the Champaran Agrarian Bill is both unnecessary and undesirable for the following reasons:
  Because 	it is based 	on the 	recommendations of 	a Committee 	of Enquiry 	which was 	admittedly appointed to 	allay an 	artificial agitation, 	organized outside 	Champaran and 	not in any 	way the consequence of 	any widespread 	grievances. The Committee 	has been 	shown to have 	made no genuine 	enquiry into agrarian conditions 	in Champaran 	as a 	whole, but 	merely to 	have made a 	superficial examination 	of the 	management of 	a small 	number of Indigo 	and Ticcadari 	Estates holding leases from 	the Court of Wards, and 	that at a time when the minds of the raiyats 	were inflamed by 	an agitation, 	encouraged by the 	Government, from 	which they 	have been led to expect 	some sort of Agricultural 	Millenium. Further, this Committee has 	been shown 	to have 	been actuated solely by a 	desire to 	produce a 	report which one 	of its members, the 	leader of 	the agitation 	mentioned above, could be 	induced to 	sign and 	not by any 	wish to report on the full and true facts of the case. 
 The present Bihar and Orissa Government and its predecessors have been fully aware of every detail mentioned in the Committee’s Report, which has neither brought forward any new facts, nor shed any new light on the general position, and have not considered that any special legislation was necessary.
 As a result of the unsatisfactory and partial enquiries made by this Committee the information it acquired was not sufficient to show the general position in the district in its true light, and this fact, combined with its biased attitude and anxiety to pacify a mischievous agitator at any cost, even, if necessary, by a misuse of Trust Funds under control of the Government, render the Report and the recommendations contained in it so grossly one-sided and unfair, that no weight whatever should be given to them, and this legislation which is frankly based on them, should be entirely dropped.
  Because 	it singles out 	one district for 	invidious and 	unnecessary legislation.  Because 	it proposes 	to invalidate 	existing contracts and 	incidents of 	the raiyats’ 	tenancy, both 	of which 	have been proved 	to be perfectly 	legal, and the 	former of 	which received the 	direct sanction of 	the Government of 	Bengal only seven 	years ago. 
 
  Because 	it proposes to 	abolish without 	compensation and 	for no adequate reason a 	system which 	has been in existence 	for over a 	hundred years 	and which 	is still 	carried on without 	friction in other districts.  Because 	it proposes, 	without the 	consent of 	the landlord, 	to forcibly 	reduce rents which have 	been declared after an 	exhaustive enquiry by 	the Settlement 	Officials to 	be perfectly legal, 	fair and not excessive, 	and which 	have been paid 	willingly for 	a number of years. 
 In case the Government persists in pressing this Bill in spite of all the cogent reasons in favour of its abandonment, we will point out some of the chief defects and make certain suggestions which may go some way towards remedying them.
 Section 3 (1),—This section, as it stands, will render the growing of Indigo and Sugarcane under what is usually known as the khuski system, impossible.
 Admitting, for the sake of argument, that it is not considered desirable to allow the raiyat to make a contract with his landlord binding himself to sell the produce of a particular crop grown on a fixed proportion of his holding for a long term of years at a flat rate based on the area of the land on which this crop is grown, it is still both desirable and necessary that he should be allowed to agree to sell the produce from a specified plot, selected by himself, at a rate based on the amount of the produce obtained. And this principle is admitted in the statement of objects and reasons attached to the Bill. If as is suggested, he is only to be allowed to bind himself to deliver a certain weight of produce, he is at the mercy of climatic conditions ant renders himself liable to damages if he fails to divert the specified amount, whereas if he contracts to deliver the produce of a certain plot, he is only liable for the amount of the balance of his advance if the crop on that plot does not come up to his expectations.
 Further, the raiyat almost invariably demands a large advance before  he begins to prepare his land, and being an exceedingly thriftless person, if  no  agreement is permitted binding him to grow the particular crop on a specified plot, he is very likely to take the advance and then fail to sow sufficient suitable land to produce the required amount, and for this reason it will be impossible for the landlord to risk the advance and the price of the seed. Also the raiyat instead of getting money
 from his landlord without interest will be forced to obtain it from the money-lender at an extortionate rate.
 It is also obviously grossly unfair that existing contracts should be an nulled without warning and without compensation and that a system of cultivation which has been carried on for over a hundred years should be abolished without giving planters time to arrange for an alternative system to take its place.
 Champaran raiyats are both stupid and conservative at the best of times, and look on any innovation with suspicion, and the present disturbed state of the district
 and the agitation still being carried on by Mr. Gandhi’s followers will render the institution of the khuski system doubly difficult. We, therefore, wish to urge most strongly that contracts now in force should be allowed to continue for three years
 more or such time as outstanding advances on the original sattas remain unpaid on
 the understanding that planters will endeavour to replace the  tinkathia  system by  the
 khuski system during that period.
 It is often very difficult to collect these sums and raiyats can cause an infinite amount of trouble and expense if they refuse to pay, as they know that the individual amounts are very often so small as not to be worth suing for, though collectively they may amount to a very large sum.
 It is, therefore, recommended that the above condition in favour of the planter shall be allowed to continue until the balance of the advantage received by the raiyat shall have been completely restored. This could cause no hardship, as the raiyat can at any time refund it either through the post or the civil courts. ..

 APPENDIX XVII
 NOTE ON INTERVIEW BY W. MAUDE
 January 31, 1918
  We 	first discussed 	the khuski system. 	Mr. Gandhi objected to 	the hypothecation 	of any particular plot 	but said he did not 	object to the raiyat contracting to 	grow a 	certain amount of 	land in 	indigo. I 	then suggested 	substituting in 	the Champaran 	Planters’ proposed amendment the 	words “produce 	of a 	certain proportion 	of his 	holding” ins 	tead of 	 the  wor ds 	“pr oduce 	 of  any  spe cifie d  fie ld or 
 plo t sel ected by him self”. Mr.  Gandhi then suggested draft provisions to clauses 3, 4 and 5 (vide footnotelibtech_858_footnotelibtech_859_footnote).
  We 	next discussed 	the proposed 	amendment making the 	satta obligation 	continue until 	advance is 	paid off. Mr.Gandhi 	objected altogether to 	this, though 	it was 	explained that it 	might save much litigation.  We 	then discussed Sirnie. 	Mr. Gandhi’s 	view was that 	neither Jallaha nor 	Sirnie deserved any 	consideration whatever 	although Sirnie may have 	taken a less 	rate of 	sharabeshi than Turkaulia. 
 
 To section 5 — Provided that nothing in the contract shall take away or limit the raiyats’ freedom to select the land.”
  We 	then discussed 	the proposal 	to make 	the sharabeshi 	enhancement as 	reduced binding. Mr. 	Gandhi agreed on 	this point 	but quoted 	from his letter 	of 24th 	January 1918 	in which 	he said 	that “any amendment 	will have to 	carefully guard the 	right of 	appeal on 	grounds of 	irregularity or 	want of 	jurisdiction”, as 	for instance 	the Settlement 	Officer may have wrongly 	recorded the incident 	or where there is a 	manifest clerical error.  As 	to abwab Mr. 	Gandhi has 	no objection 	to the 	proposal to 	make it 	applicable to 	the whole Province. 
 As to Mr. Gandhi’s own amendment to make the landlord liable in all cases it can be put before the Select Committee but Government cannot undertake to withdraw the whole section if it is not accepted. Mr. Gandhi also objects strongly to the retention of sub-clause (3) of the clause.
  As 	to cart sattas Mr. 	Gandhi insists that there 	should be a provision 	ending these, otherwise there will be [a] crop of law suits on the cart sattas.  The 	question of 	refund of 	tawan was 	mentioned but 	not discussed at 	this interview.

 This is the first leaflet l write for you. I wish, therefore, to state at the very outset that my right to advise you is only nominal. I have not done any manual labour. I have not suffered the miseries that workers have to endure, nor can I do anything myself to remove that misery. Therefore, I feel hesitant in giving advice on this occasion. But, even though I have done nothing for you in the past it is my keen desire to do what I can hereafter according to my capacity. I write this with that desire.
 Two days ago our situation had taken a serious turn. Some of you were in straitened circumstances, but instead of taking to labour to get relief from those circumstances as urged so often by Gandhiji, it was apprehended that some of you would break the vow and get back to the mills. But that situation has now passed away. Our dull hearts have been quickened by Gandhiji’s fast. We have become conscious of the seriousness of our oath. We are convinced that ‘we shall not break the oath even at the cost of our lives’ is not a slogan merely to be repeated in meetings but has to be demonstrated in action. As a proof of this change in the situation, those who are in financial difficulty have willingly begun to do manual work. Not only so, but also those who are better off have set an example by assisting from their wages those in need, and have removed the possibility of a split among us
 for all time. But that is not enough. A very heavy responsibility has come over us by Gandhiji’s fast; and if we understand that responsibility fully, we should exert ourselves to the utmost to end this struggle as soon as possible, we should adopt all such means as would shorten the struggle consistently with keeping to our pledge. Our oath is to obtain a 35 per cent increase. And we know that financially it is not difficult for the employers to give the 35 per cent increase. But employers feel that if they gave the 35 per cent, the workers will become domineering and insolent, that they will become unruly at the slightest provocation, and ruin the industry by resorting to strikes on trifling matters. I see no reason for entertaining such a fear. Workers can never desire that an industry which gives them their daily bread should be destroyed. But if workers behave without discretion and without thinking about justice or injustice, such a result is inevitable. If we desire to be saved from it, we should determine to work regularly for the mill-owners in good faith. We should decide not to make unreasonable demands, and not to resort to remedies like strikes to secure justice until all other avenues are exhausted. But our task is not over with such   a determination. We have to go to the employers, acquaint them with our decision and win their confidence. We have to remove the misapprehension which restrains them from giving us the 35 per cent increase. I strongly urge upon the workers to take immediate steps in this direction.
 A Righteous Struggle
 
 
 APPENDIX XIX
 COMMISSIONER PRATT’S SPEECH
 
 [AHMEDABAD,
 April  12, 1918]
 I would like you to listen to me attentively and repeat to everybody what I say, when you go back to your villages so that what I say to you now may come to be known throughout the district; for what I am going to say to you today is not only for you but for the whole district. You have been given much advice by Mahatma Gandhi and Vallabhbhai Saheb and other gentlemen who are working with them. They have made speeches from village to village but today I would request you to listen to me.
 The rights of the agricu lturists are such that they can keep the land in their posses sion for genera tions. But those rights carry  with  them  the  duty  to  pay regula rly the land revenu e assess ment fixed accord ing to law. It is only on that  condit ion that you can contin ue to enjoy the posses sion of your land. It  is  the Govern ment who determ ines the assess ment throug h the instru mentality of its  office rs and withou t the interv ention of any lawyer or barris ter. No one but the
 Govern ment has the right to fix the assess ment. It is not a matter of which the civil courts can take cogniz ance. No one can go to a court with a compla int that the land revenu e assess ment is too high. The agriculturists have no legal right to demand or to insist upon the postponement of the assessment. That is entirely within our gift. We issue orders after taking into account the condition of the  crop  and  any complaints and objections that may be raised. After the final order is passed, there is no appeal. It is not a matter for Gandhiji or Vallabhbhai, and on that particular issue your fight will be in vain. That is what I wish to impress upon you and you must pay heed to these words, not merely because they are my words, but because they represent the legal position. It is not merely my order but that of Lord Willingdon. I have in my possession his letter which says that he will accept whatever order I will pass in this matter. You must, therefore, realize that it is not just I who am talking today but His Excellency the Governor.
 Mr. Gandhi is a very good man, a very holy man and he gives you advice because he believes genuinely and honestly that it is in your interest. He thinks that by not paying up the land revenue assessment, you will be protecting the poor; that is what he was telling me when he saw me yesterday. But isn’t the Government the protector of the poor? Is it the duty of your Governor or is it your duty to protect the poor? Do you not remember the days of the famine? In the famine of 1900, in the famine of 1902 caused by rats, I was the Collector of Ahmedabad and Panchmahal Districts. You will remember how many works had been opened by the Government for assisting the poor. I remember how many hundreds of thousands of rupees were spent for feeding the people, in building tanks and in giving taqavi loans. Those amongst you who are old will certainly remember those days. It is against such a Government that today your fight in this district is being waged. There is a big war going on in the world, and the circumstances are such that it is the duty of you all to give the Government every assistance. But instead of that what does the Government get from this District? Does it get assistance, or does it get opposition?
 If you continue this fight against the Government it will be you who will have to bear the consequences and not these gentlemen of the Home Rule League. They will not suffer in any way. They are not the people who will go to jail. When a movement of this kind was started in Africa, Mahatma Gandhi went to jail. In this country he will not go to jail. Jail is not a fit place for him. I tell you again that he is a very good and a very holy man.
 The Government does not harbour any anger against you. If children kick their parents, the parents are sad, but they do not get angry. Why must you suffer all this loss, forfeiture, chauthai fine, confiscation, the disruption of the Narva right? Why do you want to destroy your property by your own hands ? Do you wish to lose your
 Narva right ? Do you not care for your women and children? Would you like to be reduced to the status of labourers, and what for ?
 I have 28 years’ experience of land revenue law. Mahatma Gandhi is my friend. He came to this country from Africa only two or three years ago; he has spent the greater part of his life in Africa. He is well-versed in religion. Whatever advice he gives on that subject is sound, but in political matters, in matters concerning land and land revenu assessment, he knows very little. I know far more about these matters, and I shall be sorry to see you suffer the consequnces of your ill-advised actions. I shall be sorry to see the lands of good Patidars confiscated. Government knows that there has been a misunderstanding regarding the rights of agriculturists. Therefore, the benevolent Government is giving you this final opportunity of listening to its advice.
 I have come here to give you this advice, and I have only this to say that it is duty of the agriculturists to pay up their land revenu dues. Do not think that our Mamlatdars and talatis will collect money by seizing and selling your property. They will not take so much trouble. Our time is very valuable. They will not go to anybody’s house to collect the money. I am not threatening you. You must realize that parents do not threaten but merely give advice. If you will not pay your assessment, your land will be confiscated. Many people tell you that that will not be so. But I tell you that that will be so. It is not necessary for me to take any pledge to that effect, but I have the authority to make good my words. Those who refuse to pay land revenue assessment will not get back their land. The Government does not wish to retain on their books such agriculturists, nor are we anxious to include the names of such in our records of rights. Once those names have been removed they will not be re-entered.
 Now, let me tell you one more thing in conclusion. If anyone, through misunderstanding or mistake, takes a pledge, he need not consider himself bound by that pledge. Such a pledge need not be kept. If you break such a pledge no one can say   to you that you have sinned or have committed a mistake. The world will regard such a person as innocent. You will recollect what happened in Ahmedabad. Many of you may not read newspapers; therefore I will tell you. There was a struggle recently in Ahmedabad between the mill-owners and the mill-hands. The latter had taken an oath that they would not go back to work until they got an increase of 35 per cent in their wages. But what happened in the end? When they realized that their pledge was not reasonable they could not adhere to it, they broke it and accepted an increase of 27 1/2 per cent and resumed work. In the same way, I tell you that when you took this pledge, you made a mistake. You did it only because you forgot your duty towards the Government. You did not give full weight to the consequences of this pledge; consequences not only to yourself but to your children. Taking into account all this I ask you to think again and decide whether you should do your duty by the Government  or adhere to your pledge and suffer the consequences?
