       October 	2, 1944  When 	I approached him this morning and asked him whether he had any 	particular message to give to the country on this auspicious day, 	Gandhiji said: I 	am not accustomed to giving messages on such occasions.  Gandhiji 	amidst laughter added:  	I want life for 125 years. But Malaviyaji cut it down by 25 years 	when he wired to me in Poona at Parnakuti that I must live for a 	hundred years.  Bernard 	Shaw’s message arrived here today . . . that he would not send 	birthday messages to Gandhiji. Gandhiji laughed aloud and said:  	There you are. I did not know until a few years ago that I have a 	birthday.  The 	Hindu, 4-10-1944

3,"October 2, 1944","SPEECH AT KASTURBA
MEMORIAL TRUST MEETINGlibtech_1_footnote","
  
 SEVAGRAM,
 October 2, 1944
 Gandhiji reminded them that the day’s gathering was not a public meeting. There was an order prohibiting general meetings without previous Government permission throughout the Wardha district. They all knew that he was a confirmed civil resister. But this was not the occasion for civil disobedience. Disobedience to be civil implies a certain procedure. This was a meeting of the trustees and collectors of the Kasturba Gandhi National Memorial Fund for presentation of the collection.
 Referring to the large number of people from Wardha and outside that had gathered there, he remarked that the reason for their presence on that occasion was that, for years, people all over India had got into the habit of celebrating his birthday according to both the Indian and the Christian calendar. The intervening period between the two dates was also included in the observance. This time, it had become known long before that he intended coming to Sevagram for receiving the purse on October 2.
 The Secretary, in his report, had told them how the idea of the Fund had originated. They might like to know how he had come to be the President of the Trust. The collections were started when he was in jail. The trustees had asked for his consent to nominate him as their President. After his accidental releaselibtech_2_footnote, owing to illness, they were able to consult him and he had become President for the purpose of guiding the trustees as to how the money collected should be spent in a manner befitting the memory of the late Smt. Kasturba. The responsibility primarily rested on the trustees, but it rested on him most of all.
 The money had to be spent in villages, which were not part of the cities. The poorer and farther away from the cities, the better. The Fund had to be spent for education and welfare of women and children only. At first, the age limit for male children had been fixed at twelve years. He himself had thought of raising it to sixteen. But it was pointed out to him that in that case boys would get a disproportionate share, leaving the girls at a disadvantage and so their age limit was reduced to seven years. As he had already remarked, the money was to be spent for education of women and children. So long as he had any voice in the matter, the education would be of the basic education type. The scope of basic education included the education of the entire society, beginning with the children and going up to adults and old men and women. It had to be imparted through the practice of handicrafts, village sanitation and medical relief, preventive and curative, especially with regard to deficiency diseases.
 
 
 It was a tremendous work to carry out these reforms in the seven lakhs of India’s villages. A sum of rupees seventy-five lakhs or even of rupees one crore was a trifle, compared to the vastness of the task. Seventy-five per cent of the money collected from a particular area would be spent in that area, not being towns or cities, and the remaining twenty-five per cent would go to the Central Fund. But the money collected from big cities would all go to the Central Fund and nothing out of it would be spent in the cities. In place of collection committees new committees would have to be formed to ensure proper spending of the money. These committees might include some members of the collecting committees, but new names should be added. If in any place ways and means of spending the money satisfactorily in accordance with the aims and objects of the Fund could not be found, the money would remain with the Central Fund. On the other hand, if in any place suitable workers in adequate number could be found to carry out bigger plans satisfactorily, they would be given more money.
 It was his wish that, as far as possible, money should be spent through the agency of women workers. It was a matter of regret that women workers with suitable qualifications were not forthcoming in sufficient numbers. The fault lay with the men who had kept the women enslaved in domestic drudgery. They had to draw them out and push them to the fore. After all men were not born efficient as a special creation. It rested on them to produce more and efficient women workers. Men, before they became efficient workers, were prone to make mistakes. Therefore, they must not expect efficiency from women without giving them responsible work. The Fund was collected in commemoration of an old illiterate village-minded woman. It would give peace to her departed soul if women, and especially old women, took a leading part in the execution of the object of the Memorial. The collection had been made out of an overflow of enthusiasm and affection towards the memory of the departed soul. He wanted them to see that it was spent in a way commensurate with that sentiment. That was not a task merely for the twenty-six trustees; hundreds of workers would be needed for it. He had already said that to spend money properly was much more difficult than to collect it, unless they showed as much aptness in the former, as they had done in the latter. So long as he was with them in the flesh, he would, of course, argue with them and fight with them, but it was for them to see that their work was so carried on as to give to the departed soul no cause for dissatisfaction.libtech_3_footnote

           DEAR 	JEHANGIRJI,         SEVAGRAM ,  October 	7, 1944 
  	In order that I may be understood by you as fully as possible I 	write this in English, though I should love to write to you in 	Gujarati. For similar reason this will be typed.  	Thank you for your cordial letter of greetings. I would like you to 	make the cordiality concrete by attending the next meeting of the 	Trusteeslibtech_14_footnoteto 	 be  held   at   Wardha   on   Saturday   the   4th   November. 	Saturday has been specially chosen in order to enable the original 	Trustees to attend with minimum of inconvenience. That you have 	already accepted the additional names proposed by me for the Board 	of Trustees and for the small Executive ought not to bear the 	meaning that the original trustees are to be sleeping members.libtech_15_footnote     
 I know I am guilty of having given currency to the thought that the administration of trust funds should in practice be left to the Trustees of my choice. I discovered my mistake before any mischief was done. The more I think about it, the more I feel the narrowness underlying such a conception. The whole board is a very happy combination and if most of the Trustees take an active interest in the administration of the Fund, we may expect even unthought of beneficial results. An active combination and co-operation of top city men and simple village-minded men and women is not an everyday experience. I trust therefore that you will make it convenient to attend the forthcoming meeting and even persuade the Trustees to  do likewise, if indeed they need any persuading.

18,"October 7, 1944","DISCUSSION WITH SHRIKRISHNADAS
JAJUlibtech_16_footnote","
  
 October 7, 1944
 At the outset Jajuji read out the resolution submitted by Gandhiji before the workers of the A. I. S. A. in the September meeting. There was a suggestion in that draftlibtech_17_footnotethat the A. I. V. I. A. and the Hindustani Talimi Sangh be also consulted while drawing the future plan of work of the A. I. S. A.
 J. Should the Harijan Sevak Sangh, Goseva Sangh and Kasturba Trust be also included in this list?
 G. Of course, inasmuch as they are as intimately connected with the programme of village reconstruction as the A. I. S. A., and have an economic background and outlook, not a political one. The idea behind the merging of the Sanghs is only that of co-orclinated service of the villages. But the Kasturba Trust may well be kept out.
 J. Keeping the Trust out would mean paralysing an organ of the united body. Out of the six Sanghs we can easily form a united executive of one or more representatives from each Sangh.
 
 G. We can get our work done through the institutions of the Kasturba Trust, for their work is not anything different from village service. Yet we should not include the Trust in it. When I placed that resolution before the Charkha Sangh the Kasturba Trust was not in my mind. I had only the A.I.V.I.A. and the Hindustani Talimi Sangh in view. My idea was that the heads of these Sanghs should meet together and co-ordinate their activities from the point of view of all-round village service, and influence one another morally without any of them disturbing any of the others in its day-to-day work.
 The only work of the Central Office of the A. I. S. A. should be to watch and give moral guidance. It is quite possible that  like  Euclid’s point we might not be able to reach the ideal. Decentra- lization consists in bothering little about the practical details of the various centres but regulating the over-all work on moral lines. I know that I may not be able to get the Goseva Sangh, the Harijan Sevak Sangh and others to carry out this policy of decentralization. But as service and total uplift of villages is the basis of all their activity I hope and trust the heads and workers of these Sanghs would of their own accord meet and think jointly how best to organize their work. They would also have to consider, for example, why the work of the A. I.
 S.A. had to be arrested or modified. One may argue that the work had not been arrested in any way. The Sangh’s work had expanded to cover 15,000 villages; 4_ crores of rupees had been distributed among the poor. All this is no doubt true but we should not rest content with only this much. Rather it should be a matter of regret for us that we have as yet accomplished only a hundredth part of our task.
 A worker of the A. I. S. A. would hereafter not confine himself to khadi work alone but regard himself as well a representative of the A.I.V.I.A., the Goseva Sangh, etc., in the larger sense of the term. And in so doing the worker should not feel that all this other work was beyond his sphere and that a new burden was being imposed upon him. If he did so, it would mean that our policy and outlook were not really based on non-violence. Our worker should be able to identify himself with all that requires to be done in the village, that is, with the entire life of the village and yet feel as light as ever.
 J. Like the A. I. S. A., should institutions such as the Goseva Sangh, the A. I.
 V. I. A. and the Hindustani Talimi Sangh also depute such workers to the villages?
 G. Exactly so. This is the real meaning of the merging of the Sanghs and of their having a united policy. It does not mean any regimentation of work but it simply connotes working with the united moral strength of all and with a wholesome integrated outlook.
 J. Will the A.I.S.A. have to run commercial and welfare  departments separately? I feel that to run all village activities with an all-round outlook and to give general guidance to the workers will be the special function of the joint body of all the Sanghs.
 G. I do not think so. The joint body of the various Sanghs can once for all lay down administrative policies. The arrangements so made must be honoured by all the Sanghs, which would greatly facilitate their managerial work. My idea of the united body is that its work will expand like the mighty Krishna river, which starts as a tiny tickle of ten to twenty drops of water and ends as one vast Krishnasagar. So also should flow the ceaseless stream of all-sided work. Such is my conception of the joint body.
 J. The real problem is to obtain suitable workers. You suggest various activities, but we cannot undertake them for want of workers. Then again you insist that we should reach the seven lakhs of villages.
 G. Of course, I do. But when you fail I am there all along with you to share with you the blame.
 J. So we are to take it that good workers are to be trained. For the present we cannot hope to get thoroughly capable first-grade workers. We shall have to get on with second-grade workers. From among them we shall obtain first-grade ones later.
G. Does the A.I.S.A. have about 2,000 workers?
 J. About 3,000.
 G. Well, then use them. Place upon them the responsibility for this new type of work. Also allow them greater freedom in their work. We shall have to decentralize even at some risk.
 J. I do not quite understand what you mean by decentralization.
 G. We shall have to expand the work so that it covers every village. This cannot be done by imposition from without. The workers will have to be allowed to carry on the work themselves, more or less free of regulation by a central authority. Were they to refuse to bear this much burden and wish to leave us we shall let them go ungrudgingly. But we are not going to turn anybody out.
 I like your idea of giving khadi cloth in exchange for hanks in Maharashtra. This is not yet much in vogue. But it is being done through workers already on our staff. This is the way work will go on
 and develop. But workers who create obstructions will have to go. I will have no hesitation in removing them. If they disobey the policy of the A. I. S. A. they will have to quit. And the Sangh is authorized to change its policy from time to time. The plea of the workers that they were not aware of such changes will not be accepted. Compulsory wearing of khadi, provident fund contributions,  etc., were introduced in the course of the running of the Association and they were made applicable to all. Those who could not accept them had to go. Workers may leave us in this manner. But we shall not remove them ourselves. Nay, we shall require them to work along the new lines I have indicated. On the other hand, we shall require those who would like to stay under our plan to work extensively on the new lines, others  would naturally quit on their own. Not for a moment did  I think that we would have to disband the existing set of workers and start on a clean slate. Suppose we have five workers at a centre and we feel that more work of various kinds can be carried out there, we shall ask them to take up manufacture of hand-made paper and other village industries also, and if possible at the same time to produce more and more khadi and sell it in the neighbouring areas. This is decentralization.

  	I have talked to Sohanlaljilibtech_19_footnoteand to Devdas also. I think that it should be easy 	enough to collect one lakh rupees towards a memorial for Mahadev. So 	it doesn’t seem proper to sell Sohanlalji’s booklibtech_20_footnoteat higher than its market price for that purpose. The 	book should be sold at its market price and on its own merit.

Sohanlalji has agreed. Devdas and Shriman have also accepted my 	point. I understand, from what Devdas told me, that you feel some 	sort of a moral obligation [as you had agreed] that the book would 	be published for the Mahadev Memorial Fund. In that case too it only 	means that one lakh rupees will be collected for that fund, isn’t 	that so?

21,"October 8, 1944",DISCUSSION WITH SHRIKRISHNADAS JAJU,"
  
 October 8, 1944
 J. Please explain what should be the equipment and qualifications of workers.
 G. For the present I shall not deal with other institutions but answer your question keeping in view the worker of the A. I. S. A. alone. First, he should know, besides his mother tongue, the language of the province in which he is working as also the national language. I do not feel that knowledge of English is essential. He should know about the economic, social and political condition of the country and also something about the condition of the world. This is rather difficult, it is true, but essential. Unless he knows what is happening in other countries, their political set-up, etc., how can he understand the relative conditions in India and where we are bound for? He must have especially detailed knowledge of the conditions prevailing in and about his place of work.
 So much in regard to his general preparation which is only a preliminary part of his equipment. In regard to khadi, he should not only have thorough knowledge of the charkha, but he must also be well acquainted with the takli. Spinning alone will not do. He must know the entire science of khadi, i.e., evaluating the count, carding, identifying the variety of cotton, the kind of cotton required for a specific type of carding, spinning, etc. He must be in touch with the history of improvements in technique, viz., how carding reached its present stage, the various improvements effected in the charkha. He must also be able to repair and put the charkha in order. It was in Yeravda that I systematically learnt spinning, repairing of the charkha, etc., and I had no one to help me either. It means that the worker must know the elements of carpentry as well, for if he is not able to set right the damaged charkhas of the villagers, spinning will stop in the village and the cause will suffer.
 I have dwelt upon the charkha so much because I regard it as the centre of village uplift. In addition, the worker will have to see what other village crafts can prosper in his village. The first in order among these crafts will be the bullock oil-press. Our worker would have to know its technique which has now been scientifically improved at Maganwadi under the supervision of Jhaverbhai Patel.
 Another industry which may be introduced is hand-made paper. This has to be learnt not with the view of supplying paper to the whole country but in order to make the village self-sufficient and capable of earning a little income.
 J. If the work of hand-made paper develops it will be like running a small factory.
G. I am only giving its outline.
 Next to oil and hand-made paper we must revive the handchakki (grinding stone)—a vital thing in every village. Otherwise flour-mills which have been a source of anxiety to me for several years will be our fate. Similarly in regard to rice. Unless we inculcate among the villagers the habit of eating whole rice we shall not be able to solve the problem of food. We must get our people in the villages to take to hand-pounding of rice or handchakkis for husking paddy, for it is a well-established fact that the white polished rice put out by mills and white sugar are harmful to health. All the top experts are agreed upon it. We do get enough literature on these subjects from America. There brown, that is, yellow sugar has come in vogue. So much so that traders sell the white polished sugar after colouring it with harmful colours.
 Next take agriculture. Our villagers depend on agriculture and cattle for ploughing. I am rather ignorant in this respect for I have no personal experience. But there is not a single village where we have no agriculture or cattle. There is the buffalo, but except in Konkan and a few other places it is not much used for agriculture. Even then it is not as if we have boycotted the buffalo. Our worker will have to keep a careful eye on the cattle wealth of his village. If we cannot use this wealth properly India is doomed to disaster and we also shall perish. For these animals will then, as in the West, become an  economic burden to us and we shall have no option before us save killing them.
 Our worker, therefore, would have to acquire some knowledge at any rate about these things, and discover a non-violent way of solving them. Therein lies the solution to our problem of increasing population. I do not know whether our non-violent way will succeed or fail. If it fails it will be our fault, not that of non-violence. It means that our sacrifice and efforts were insufficient. Nevertheless all of us will have to make some effort. Again, in the sphere of agriculture chaos reigns supreme. In regard to agriculture, we must do our utmost to prevent further fragmentation of land, and to encourage people to take to co-operative farming. The village worker will fully examine
 the circumstances prevailing in his village and induce the villagers to take up co-operative farming.
 Next to land is the question of water, not for agriculture but for drinking. The worker will go and examine all the wells in the village. It will be his duty to clean them both inside and around. He will see how many wells of the village are fit for drinking water, whether the surroundings are clean, and whether there are any public urinals and latrines near them. If they are near the wells, he will explain to the people the dangers involved in having them so near. He will seek their co-operation in having them removed to a distance. He  will  thus attend to the cleanliness of the entire village. Now we know about a worker’s field of activity. He should have a thorough knowledge of village sanitation and efficient compost-making. He should convert this knowledge into practice. Of course there will be division of work but it should not be like that of the railway porter showing the green signal or like the woman-worker making soles in a leather factory. Such people are incapable of doing any other work save their own. This extreme division of work is degrading. The village worker should acquire all-round knowledge about building up the whole village. There will be some sewing work in the village, smithy, carpentry, leather work, agriculture, etc. The village worker should seek to bring about co-operation among the workers in these various occupations so as to make them serve as harmonious parts of one whole and thus organize the villages. All these activities appear to be too numerous but in fact they are not. This should not be too difficult for a worker resolved to employ his body and mind fully.
 Now for my last point. If the worker going to the village has no faith in non-violence, our work must fail. If he concerns himself with economics alone and disregards ethics and morality, all our efforts are of no avail. Non-violence is the basis on which our work is to be built. It will not do to ignore it. In the initial stages people might achieve something even without it but ultimately the edifice of swaraj will not be raised without the foundation of ahimsa.  Workers  must demonstrate non-violence in everything they do. They must be living embodiments of non-violence. If they cannot do this, their work will be but a showy nothing. Our history is full of such instances. Merely holding classes on non-violence is of little use.
 J. Would it not be better to have two workers instead of one in a village? They could then divide the work between them and one could supplement the other.
 G. Many people have asked me this question. I am not going to lay down any definite rules in this regard. I would prefer a worker to go alone. He should tackle the situation single-handed and become fearless in the process. But if one is not enough you may send two. We shall consider the position if lack of finances comes in the way. But so far as I am concerned, I am prepared to go to the length of regarding one worker, if married, as two when both husband and wife serve in the village.
 J. Experience often proves the contrary. The wife of a worker is more a handicap to him than a support.
 G. That is why I am not going to frame any rules or regulations about it. Do you know that Rajaji insists on workers being married?
 J. Some workers will be of higher calibre than others. How do you like the idea  of putting under one good worker five or six ordinary workers working in adjoining villages?
 G. I have had talks about it with several friends. It will not always be feasible. I asked Timappa Naik to train a large number of workers as otherwise his work was likely to suffer. He is a very capable and efficient worker of Karnataka. He maintains himself on about six rupees. He feels that only local workers could be trained at small expense. He has trained such and they are working with him.
 J. How much should we spend on a worker?
 G. These are days of war-made dearness. I am afraid it may last for a fairly long time. I am prepared to spend rupees fifty on a worker or even a hundred.
 J. Besides food for the worker there is the burden of his family, of the education of his children, etc.
 G. We shall take the middle way. We shall leave out those with many burdens. We shall confine ourselves to a family  of four, husband, wife and two children, or at the most five. I think it would be better not to take a bigger unit.
 J. Many workers argue that they have the responsibility of maintaining their parents, brothers and sisters or other relatives.
G. We cannot take them.
 J. While fixing the allowance of a worker, which was to be considered as of greater importance, his capacity or his family responsibilities?
 G. To Vallabhswami I would give only five, not hundred. But I would pay the maximum to one with a big family rather than let him go. That is to say, both should live and neither should be envious of the other. Nor should any entertain false hopes.
 J. How much response should our workers expect from the villagers? Would it be proper to impose some conditions on villages at the time of selection of our place  of work? The situation today is that workers who go to the villages are regarded as moneyed people and villagers think that they should extract from them as much benefit as possible. Consequently the whole work is reduced to nought when the worker leaves the village after working for two years.
 G. I think we should not impose any conditions. For example, if we go and settle down for service among the aborigines, what terms can we lay down for them? If we settle down and work resolutely in places where we have already gained some experience, our work will grow and prosper.
 In the end everything depends on the worker himself. If he wins the hearts of the villagers he will be able to get them to work with him.
 J. How long may it take for a worker to become self-sufficient? Five years?
 G. You yourself say five years. The worker will go to the village with one month’s allowance in his pocket. He will ask for a piece of land from the villagers and build his hut on it. In case he obtains a vacant house he will occupy it. Taking out the takli from his pocket he will sit under a tree and spin. If the villagers have their spinning-wheels he will repair them and spin along with them. He will also gather the children of the village, play with them, tell them stories, teach them songs and do village cleaning. Apart from his salary I am not going to give him a pie by way of capital to start an industry or anything else. He will have to set up things by dint of his resourcefulness and love. This will put to trial his passion for service and his ability.
 J. It is a very hard test.
 G. Yes. We don’t have to take up a sword, have we? The way of love and service shown by me is the only way. If we have to achieve swaraj by non-violent means I have no other way.

The halls 		for treatment 		and experiment 		should be 		in the centre 		or in one 		corner. They 		should be surrounded 		by decent 		huts for the residence 		of patients 		and children 		entrusted to 		our care. 		The sanatorium 		should grow fruit, flowers, food 		grains and 		vegetables. It 		should have cattle 		sheds and roads 		good enough 		for vehicles. 		It should 		also have a 		gymnasium, a 		tank for 		bathing and 		other facilities. All 		this cannot be 		built in 		a day. 		But the entire project should 		be completed 		within five years. 		Patients should be 		admitted right 		from the beginning. 		They should 		be given 		such treatment as 		does not 		involve the 		use of electricity, 		for example, 		hot and 		cold water, steam, earth and sun-rays.      
 Think over all this. Recently a nature-cure practitioner from Andhra had been to me. He has thirty acres of land. And he treats about ninety patients. I would certainly wish to send you to see his sanatorium. You should study such institutions.

31,"October 10, 1944",DISCUSSION WITH SHRIKRISHNADAS JAJU,"
  
 October 10, 1944
 J. How will the workers become self-supporting? Villagers can either give them money or grain, or give them employment. Or they may run an industry and support the worker with a percentage of the profit.
 G. Both courses may be adopted. We shall surely pay the  workers. But apart from it the villagers or the worker himself can take up a craft for the sake of the village. It may be possible for a good intelligent worker to work in the village and meet his own expenses as also those of his entire activities by his own intellectual work and take nothing from friends. But earning money thus by the use of intellect alone is, as I have often said, a misuse of the intellect. All such income must go to the country.
 J. If our worker were to live on khadi production alone, it would not be possible for him to become self-sufficient. He would have to produce commercial khadi; and to earn profit, he must sell it, send it outside and do various other things.
 G. This is not what I had visualized in my scheme. I agree of course that if a village has to be made self-supporting through the production of khadi alone, the surplus will have to be sent outside.
 Once somebody explained that if we did not produce, in addition to self-sufficient khadi, some amount of other khadi also, and our villagers had no other means of subsistence like land, etc., self-sufficient khadi alone would not suffice to provide all their needs. My idea of self-sufficiency is that villages must be self-sufficient in
 regard to food, cloth and other basic necessities. But even this can be overdone. Therefore you must grasp my idea properly. Self-sufficiency does not mean narrowness. To be self-sufficient is not to be altogether self-contained. In no circumstances would we be able to produce all the things we need nor do we aim at doing so. So though our aim is complete self-sufficiency, we shall have to get from outside the village what we cannot produce in the village; we shall have to produce more of what we can in order thereby to obtain in exchange what we are unable to produce. Only nothing of our extra produce would be sent to Bombay or far off cities. Nor would we produce things with an eye to export to those cities. That would run counter to my conception of swadeshi. Swadeshi means serving my immediate neighbour rather than those far away.
 Our outlook must be that we would serve the village first, then the neighbourhood, then the district and thereafter the province. Working on these lines the A.I.S.A. must function only as the central protector of this policy. We should not get involved in all sorts of complications. We have three thousand workers and a large number of sales depots. We shall not do away with them today. But I am simply telling you of our new line of approach.
 J. What should be the extent of a worker’s field of work? Should it be an area of about five miles around his centre?
 G. Yes, sometimes even less. In Bengal and Bihar an area of five miles around the centre would cover many villages.
 J. Why should we not define his field of activity as the area which he can cover   if he left his centre in the morning, and returned to it after having a round by the evening?
G. Yes, we can do so.
 J. Would the A.I.S.A. have to take up this work first?
 G. Certainly, because the charkha is the sun round which other industries revolve like planets. They would revolve rightly only when the sun’s movements are all right. Today the village industries are behaving like comets.
 J. The work against untouchability sometimes involves the worker in all kinds of difficulties. How far may our worker entangle himself in them?
 G. He should not involve himself in such troubles as would stop his work. But there should be no place at all for untouchability in his personal life. Our worker will draw water from the same well which the Harijans use. He will clean up their wells and take all sanitary steps possible for proper drainage.
 J. Then there is the political issue. Suppose my self-respect is wounded in the course of performance of my duties or my freedom is restricted, would it then be proper for me to offer civil disobedience? It may be that I may keep aloof from other political disturbances, but in case of a general civil disobedience movement the worker cannot remain unconcerned. What should he do under such circumstances?
 G. General civil disobedience means a sort of anarchy in which everybody is a leader. People start talking in terms of fighting. But ordinarily we must follow the orders of the chief or the commander in charge of that movement. Surely none can remain unconcerned in a movement of that nature. Yet the worker would have to explain his position to the President of the A. I. S. A. who would give his opinion after taking all the pros and cons into consideration. However, I am not thinking of general civil disobedience today.

36,"October 	11, 1944",DISCUSSION WITH SHRIKRISHNADAS JAJU,"
       October 	11, 1944  J. 	I could not quite follow your views about decentralization. Will you 	kindly throw more light on it?  G. My view is that we 	should let as many provinces as wish to be free to develop their 	work as they desire. I would very much like them to take the entire 	responsibility on their own shoulders and recognize our authority 	only in the moral realm. I would allow them to work with complete 	freedom if they follow my lines, are personally of sparkling 	character, and are prepared to take risk in honestly implementing 	our policy. My only condition will be that they should sell all the 	khadi they produce in the villages near about the centre of 	production, the tehsil, the district or at the most the province. 	They 
 should not, like the people of Chicacole, produce everything for Bombay and use nothing at home.
 J. Chicacole is an exception, and is the only production centre in the country for fine khadi.
 G. Yes, even in that case I would ask the producers and sellers to wear what they produce or sell. They may send their articles outside but they must also wear them. In case they go on producing fine khadi for Bombay but use only mill-cloth themselves, their centre must cease to be run by the A. I. S. A. I would even insist that it be closed altogether.
 J. Deducting something from the income of the craftsmen or women towards supply of khadi to them, we do make them wear some khadi. But this seems to be a sort of imposition. They do not take to it voluntarily.
 G. I may put up with such a situation for a short period. I do not expect people to take to khadi immediately and to  accept  non-violence. We must educate them in true economics and in non-violence. If we succeed in doveloping a true economic outlook in them, they would ultimately understand non-violence as well. An economics which runs counter to morality cannot be called true economics. Our workers can develop an outlook of true economics in the villages only if they work under the inspiration of non-violence and morality.
 Their personal conduct should be of the purest nature and they should not be a party to any exploitation of the people. If we try to cover India with khadi but ignore the miseries of the craftsmen, do not pay them living wages, do not share their weal and woe, or worry little if they are drunkards, it will not do at all. It is better to burn all khadi to ashes than to pretend to work for the good of the country in this manner. I would keep the drunkard and give him work, but I would befriend him and sweetly urge upon him daily to abstain from drink. My aim is not to do the work of khadi only but to enter into the entire life of the villager.
 I know that Chicacole khadi is very popular and that it fetches a good sale in far off provinces; but this pains me very much. If we want to do khadi work successfully on the new lines in any province, district, taluk or village, we must not make one district lean on any other, or enter into competition with it. All districts must meet their requirements themselves. This would relieve us of our worries about sales. It is quite possible that implementation of this new policy may
 for the present reduce a centre to zero. But later on the work is bound to progress. Of course I cannot submit data and figures to prove what  I say as I know nothing about them. But you can of course supply them to me. What I know, however, is that if khadi is to disseminate non-violence, we shall have to follow this new policy, come what may.
 J. Do you mean to say that the work of the A. I. S. A. will hereafter be entrusted to separate boards of trustees to be newly formed in each province?
 G. I cannot say immediately what exactly would have  to  be done. I know, however, that to promote decentralization such as I want, we would have to do away with the central control now dominating our every activity. Today our machinery is top-heavy. Our approach and method being what they have been hitherto, this was inevitable. It could have been avoided had I followed and insisted from the very beginning on our doing the right thing. It is not that I was not aware that the work was not going on the right lines. But I succumbed to the temptation of doing some work and let the work develop itself, resulting in the present centralization.
 J. Yet we shall have to evolve some sort of constitution. . . If the work of the provinces is to be entrusted to some body, registered societies with at least seven trustees for each would have to be set up.
 If you allow me I shall soon bring about decentralization in sales. Today khadi is such a profitable business and so full of opportunities for expansion that dealers and tradesmen are ready to take it up. I am flooded with letters asking me for the transfer of one bhandar or the other. But as a clear picture of the coming decentralization is not yet before my eyes I am not able to go ahead. And even were we to entrust khadi work to some individual, trust or institution we shall have to insist on three things: (a) Purity of khadi, (b) Living wage and (c) Non-profiteering. If we are not able to control these three things the whole business will be reduced to a farce. Whatever is to be done has to be done very carefully. For example, take the case  of the A. I. S. A. Every now and then we issue circulars to our branches to raise the wages and to impress upon the workers not to put the spinners to any difficulty whatsoever. Nevertheless, our experience is that it is well-nigh impossible to keep every worker of each centre in full control regarding such matters as accurate determination of the count of the yarn, correct payment of wages without adding or subtracting a pice or two here and there, and many little things of such nature. And this happens even though our worker has no axe of his own to grind. We appealed to purchasers of khadi to pay a higher price but those engaged in the craft did not receive   an adequate wage. This is as regards the conduct of workers and centres even when run under the direct supervision of the A. I. S. A. If however we introduce decentralization and the control slackens or is almost withdrawn, one cannot say what a fearful mess the certified dealers might not make of it. Whether it is an individual or an
 institution, there is acute rivalry among all those engaged in khadi work. Even institutions indulge in a lot of profit-making. Under these circumstances if the A. I.
 S. A. keeps away from commercial sales, it would be a problem as to who should be entrusted with this responsibility or what sort of conditions or limitations should be imposed on them. Again, if the provinces are to be left free to look after themselves, they do not have enough workers with the proper khadi outlook to be entrusted with the work.
G. Is there no way out of this difficulty?
 J. The issue of provincial freedom will not be so difficult in some of the provinces, but it is bound to lead to complications in most of them. For the present, I think, it would be wise to confine decentralization to the district, and not to extend it to the province. The change should not be effected all at once.
 G. For the present we may introduce decentralization in production only. It should be binding on the producers to sell in their neighbourhood what they produce. And it must be insisted that the central office should be consulted in case of distant sales.
 J. What is the harm if we limit the sales-area of a centre to its tehsil?
 G. We may, but we must see that the producers or those who live in that village or in its neighbourhood wear the khadi produced. We do of course recognize that khadi may be required to be produced for other places also.
 J. We would ask workers to go to the centres that are well developed and to extend the work on the new lines as far as possible. The A.I.S.A. will withdraw from those places where such workers take up work. Thus decentralization will grow. But one thing is important. We shall ask the workers to sell khadi where they produce it, or in the tehsil or at the most in the district. The A.I.S.A. will help in disposing of the surplus. There is no loss in this work at present, as we know. Today all the khadi that may be produced can easily be sold. There is no worry as regards sales but only about transport.
G. Is the khadi sold in those centres where it is produced?
 J. No, not even in the neighbourhood. Today we have our bhandars in the headquarters of the district and sometimes at tehsils also. We have also agents for taking khadi from the district bhandar and distributing it in other places in the district. To those engaged in the craft we supply khadi after deducting two annas, four annas, or even eight annas in the rupee. But apart from it, most of the khadi is sold in the cities.
 G. As against this, I want the worker to go to his centre and produce only as much khadi as he can make the people there wear. He must not produce for outsiders. He should not rest content with training people in khadi production alone but should impart
 instruction in other crafts also. The earnings from these crafts will also go to the villagers and add to their meagre resources. We shall take the unused or surplus khadi only if the villagers there tell us: ‘We are producing khadi in a larger quantity than we can ourselves consume as we want cash for our other needs. Please, therefore, buy our surplus khadi.’ It is quite possible that such villages as produce more khadi than they use will develop into centres of khadi production. But I am not thinking now of them. I have in mind only those villages where production of khadi will be carried on as a supplementary industry and so where the people will not depend for their living only on khadi but also on other industries. That is how most of the villages will have to be organized. This is decentralization in the true sense of the term.
 J. Agriculture is the main occupation in the countryside. The bullock oil-press can also be run but it can provide a livelihood only to a few. It is khadi alone that can in a large measure relieve unemployment among the poor. But there is little scope for earning money through khadi produced for self-sufficiency. Should we desire to add a few pice to the coffers of the villagers, we shall have to encourage production of khadi for sale outside and we shall have to make arrangements for it. Otherwise we cannot succeed in providing relief to those underemployed villagers who have work only for part of the year.
 G. The trouble is that such khadi will continue to provide occupation to a few people only without spreading everywhere.
 J. Spinning, I hope, will become universal. Weaving of course will be a skilled craft carried on by a few as it is even today. The fact is that so long as there are mills khadi production cannot be carried on on a large scale. We began cloth self-sufficiency work in Surgaon. Ours was a five-year programme. Vallabhswami’s experience is that people do take to khadi but not intelligently. Once we withdraw from the centre, khadi also disappears. Unless the people grasp the place of khadi in the entire economy of the village they will not stick to it. The benefits derived from self-sufficient khadi are so little that it offers hardly any attraction.
 G. That also worries me. Vallabhswami’s words resound in my ears. Party feeling developed in his village. Fasting had to be resorted to. I feel that behind it all there was a mistake in approach somewhere. We offered inducements to the people, gave them facilities, but these do not serve our purpose. We have to discover to what length khadi, by its own inherent strength, can carry India forward. So far in our quest we have found that khadi is saleable in the cities but not in the villages. We have not yet succeeded in making it acceptable to the villagers. If we have been defeated we must confess our defeat. We should learn from our past experience and adopt new methods of
 work if needed. That is why I say that we should stop producing khadi for the cities. Today about a crore of rupees worth of khadi is sold in the cities. We should hereafter make it clear to the cities that we cannot any more supply them ready-made khadi but will teach them how to produce it, leaving them the option of either producing it themselves or getting it from the producer. I am not enamoured of the sales of one crore of rupees worth of khadi in the cities. We should put into khadi work not money but brain and heart. In other words we shall now have ruthlessly to investigate the value of khadi in terms of its real potentialities. In case we find it does not carry us as far as we claimed, let us give it up or lower our claim or let us take up some other basic occupation such as agriculture.
 From the very beginning it has been my firm conviction that agriculture provides the only unfailing and perennial support to the people of this country. We should take it up and see how far we can go with it as basis. I would not at all mind if some of our young men serve the country by training themselves as experts in agriculture in place of khadi. I have come to realize that we have yet to overcome a lot of difficulties. The time has now come for us to pay attention to agriculture. Till now I believed that improvement in agriculture was impossible unless we had the administration of the State in our own hands. My views on this are now undergoing modification. I feel that we can bring about improvements even under the present conditions, so that the cultivator may be able to make some income for himself from the land even after paying his taxes. Jawaharlal says that any extra income to the peasant through the improvement of agriculture will be swallowed up under one pretext or the other by the alien Government. But I feel that even if it were so, it should not hinder us from acquiring and spreading as much knowledge about agriculture as possible. It may be that the Government will take away any additional income that may come to the villagers through improvements in agriculture. If they do, we can protest and teach the people to resist and make it clear to the Government that it cannot loot us in this manner. This is only by way of an illustration. I therefore hold that we must hereafter find workers who will interest themselves in agriculture.
 J. From the very beginning the question of agriculture as the main problem of the peasantry was before our eyes. But we did not take it up because we thought it too difficult and also because we had to keep in view our own limitations. Besides, in agriculture the peasant is today dependent on external factors altogether beyond his
 control. Supposing, for instance, we taught him better methods and he succeeded in producing more, his lot would still continue to be as bad as it always was if in the mean while the prices of cotton were reduced by half, a contingency which he can do nothing to prevent. This is the terrible situation confronting him.
 G. There is remedy for this also. We did not train him on the right lines. The capitalists induced him to sow commercial crops that would yield them money, so food crops became scarce.
 J. This is inevitable where economics is subservient to the ruler or the capitalist.
 G. The same is the condition in the field of cattle farming and dairying. The cow and the bullock are intimately tied up with agriculture. In this field also we have failed to play our  part. Therefore, our workers going to the villages will hereafter have to be alert and acquire the necessary knowledge to render effective service along all such lines. God alone knows how far they would be able to accomplish all this. But I have said what I had in my mind and what I thought fit.

44,"October 12, 1944",DISCUSSION WITH SHRIKRISHNADAS JAJU,"
  
 October 12, 1944
 J. Before discussing the idea of decentralization further, I would like to place before you the present position of khadi work. It will help us in our discourse. Khadi work has been carried on along two lines:
 Production 	and sale 	of commercial 	khadi to the utmost extent.  Extending 	cloth self-sufficiency as 	much as 	possible. Today the 	A.I.S.A. is blamed for not discharging fully its responsibilities in both these respects. 
 G. May I interrupt? Have we carried on sufficient research in regard to the self-sufficiency programme to be able to prove that self-sufficient khadi is cheaper than mill-cloth? In case we are not able to prove it, our villagers will not take to self-sufficiency and the workers will have to face despair. Now you may proceed.
 J. There will be no cause for despair if we once grasp properly the limitations under which khadi work has to be carried on, whether it is commercial khadi or self-sufficient khadi. For instance, in spite of having made great progress as regards commercial khadi, it cannot be speeded up all of a sudden, for so long as there are textile mills khadi can develop only on public goodwill. Besides, there are other difficulties. Today, for instance, we produce one crore rupees worth of khadi. Last year we discussed a scheme to increase it to five crores. This meant that ignoring all other considerations, we had to make use of whatever workers were available, irrespective of their quality in order to push through our programme. After careful calculation we reached the conclusion that even after our utmost efforts we shall not be able to produce more than one and a half times our maximum production, and that it would be quite impossible to increase production to two to four times. Besides, there are other dangers in so recklessly increasing the work. For then we shall have to recruit all sorts of workers who are neither conversant with khadi work nor observe truth and non-violence. This will not only injure the basic policy of the A.I.S.A. but also bring a bad name to it since the behaviour of the new workers may not always be becoming and clean. I am, therefore, not in favour of developing work on such lines.
 So also there are limitations in regard to cloth self-sufficiency. Even if the various processes from cotton-cultivation to ginning, carding and spinning are carried out by the villagers in their own homes, weaving charges are so high that their net saving as compared with the price of mill-cloth is very little, so little that the villager is not easily inclined to put himself to all the trouble involved. Besides, mill-cloth seems more attractive to him than khadi.
 Moreover the reasons underlying our self-sufficiency programme require to be explained to the villagers in a manner which will appeal to them. They must see that only through working for self-sufficiency the entire money of the village will remain in the village, that they can control the factors that make for their well-being, that idle time will be profitably utilized and that the people of the village will become industrious. In other words, self-sufficiency khadi work can begin to have permanent effect only when carried out as part and parcel of the wider programme of non-violent village uplift or village reconstruction. A programme, which aims at making a certain number of villages self-sufficient in cloth within a specific period, does not appeal to me. We can succeed only to the extent to which we learn to work intelligently and with the backing of educated public opinion. Work based on momentary sentiment or emotion does not endure.
 The same is true about other village industries as well. For the present the bullock oil-press is running well in the countryside. But there are serious misgivings as to whether it will continue always to do so. The fact is that our village economic organization of which khadi, chakki and other village industries were the various main organs has collapsed. Further, on account of mill competition, village-made cloth, flour, rice, oil and everything else have become costlier. Should we desire to reinstate them in their proper place, we should have to tackle the entire village economy and build it up anew. Concentration and research on any single aspect will
 be of little avail. Inertia has seized our people. Progress cannot be by leaps and bounds but very gradual. The problem is very intricate indeed.
 G. I would like to go even a step further. I accept all that you say. That is why for three days I opened my heart before the A.I.S.A,libtech_46_footnoteand raised all these issues.
 Now we have to do the work anew with the  objective  of all-round village uplift. Let us see how far we can go. Even if our present activities have to be slackened or reduced to nought for some time on account of these changes, it does not matter. We have created some sentiment about khadi among the people. But if there is some error in what we told the people about the significance of khadi we must pause. If ours was a wrong claim we must declare our error openly and withdraw our claim.
 I would ask city-dwellers to produce their own khadi. I would forgo the temptation to supply khadi to them. We shall go and settle in the villages. In case workers want to leave us on account of this change we shall let them go. Unless our head and heart are converted to this extent we cannot achieve the desired result. We of the A. I. S.
 A. will merely direct policy. By decentralizing our work as much as possible we shall free ourselves from day to day khadi work completely. Thereafter we shall concentrate our energy and attention on the other activities or crafts carried out in the vicinity of the village we settle in. Only then will the real substance of our work be realized. All these years I remained under the delusion that we had made good job of it in that we had put four and a half crores of rupees in the pockets of the poor. I became anxious to increase it to sixty crores, and I claimed swaraj would be in our hands if we produced sixty crores worth of khadi in a year. Had I persisted along that line, I might perhaps have succeeded. But now I realize that even if I had succeeded what was done in a year might possibly have been undone in the next. Today our main concern should be to lay the foundation for this work as deep as possible.
 J. It means that the city workers should curtail their present work (which is mainly concerned with pushing up sales in the commercial way) and start selling khadi in lieu of yarn. They should also participate in the programme for the revival of other village industries.
 
 
 G. Exactly. In case we do not do it we shall be betraying ourselves and the world. Today we rejoice in having sold khadi worth several thousand rupees in one day in the Kalbadevi Bhandar at Bombay.
 J. If we arrange to give khadi in lieu of yarn, and the A.I.S.A. does not do it, private dealers would come forward and say that they would willingly take up the work, asking us merely to give them certificates. If we agree to it we shall have to look into their accounts, their procedure, their work, etc., and we shall get engulfed in a maze of difficulties from which it would be hard to extricate ourselves.
 G. Satis Babu says that we should give them freedom in this matter.
 J. He holds that the entire production and sales work should be handed over to the people, and the A.I.S.A. should keep aloof.
G. It is essential for us to consider his proposal in detail.
 J.  In  matters  of  money   even   good   men   have   been   found   to   have failed in resisting the temptations of earning extra profit . . . Human nature being thus what it is, it is very dangerous to hand over khadi work to private persons.
 G. I have my answer. I do not know what exactly Satis Babu’s proposal means. But in the picture before me there is no question of handing over khadi work to anybody. We shall say only this much to city-dwellers that if they want to put on khadi they cannot do so save according to the principle we have laid down. It is not merely a principle of economics but also invariably of morals and ethics. According to it everyone has to prepare his or her own khadi. If there is no weaving arrangement in the city, weavers can be domiciled in the cities, or somewhere in the neighbourhood in colonies. Weaving can be carried on there. There need be no rivalry. We shall explain to the city people that the khadi we are at present giving to them is of no use, as they are not able to know the extent of relief that the poor obtain thereby, and that therefore they should get khadi woven before their own eyes. Thus we shall change our policy. Today we ask the city people to take to khadi on the plea that it supports lakhs of people. But this compels the A. I. S. A. to resort to trade and commerce. Well, if the Sangh were to carry on commerce alone, it could easily support many people by doing so.
 Hence we are not going to lend to khadi dealers the prestige of the A. I. S. A. We shall withdraw from that field of work so that the certificates will cease to have any meaning. The only limitation that we shall observe is that if there is some extra khadi left over in a village or
 locality after meeting the local need, and if that khadi is useful to the city people we shall permit it to be sold in the cities. But the khadi should not be produced specially for export to the cities. If this means  a reduction in our work it matters little. I am sure I am not providing true work relief to the people from the way in which I am doing khadi work today. What I am doing is tempting them by the handsome wages of the A. I. S. A. This is not the way to make the work permanent. If the poor want employment we must provide it. But it must be in such a manner that they can secure earnings from their own neighbourhood instead of depending on distant cities .
 J. I would like you to throw more light on this point.
 G. Today we are not really able to help the villagers. By offering the spinners three, four, six or eight annas I comfort myself with the belief that I have given them a livelihood. But it amounts to nothing more than a dole, for the work that I am providing them is not of a permanent nature. In case we get control of the State in our hands and by that means close all mills, it may perhaps then be possible to provide them permanent work. But today I cannot hide from them the truth that I have been only trying to fill their idle hours. If I have to provide them with some money I shall teach them other crafts also. I shall fully acquaint them with the present economic situation and educate them in this regard. No doubt I would wish to give work to every spinner who comes seeking it. But I shall not send the khadi thus produced to Bombay. I shall ask the workers to sell it in the neighbouring villages. But this is not enough. I must investigate what work other than spinning can be provided to them in the village. Only by revising the entire economic life of the village can our  work  become permanent. Whether for villagers or for us, I agree, cities will always have some sort of attraction. Nevertheless we shall be free from our present day city life. We shall show how in contrast to the cities more amenities can be provided in the villages. But if we merely go on sending to Bombay the khadi produced in the village, this object can never be accomplished, however high a wage we may pay to the village spinners.
 I allotted an hour every day for discussion with you because I believed that through such discussion my own thinking would be clarified. I am convinced that we shall have to introduce fundamental changes in our mode of work. If we are destined to fail we shall face it; we shall do so with full knowledge and alertness, not in our
 ignorance or folly. Even then If people laugh at me I shall bear it. They might say: ‘Gandhi wasted a crore of rupees. But of course no one pocketed it.’ I need your help in deciding whether what I am saying is correct. I would like to know your opinion.
 J. When we send to the cities the khadi produced in the villages we provide immediate economic benefit to the villagers. But if we stop doing so what else can we give them?
 G. If I had my way I would say to those whom I have been supporting through khadi so far that they should get out of this rut and take to some other work. We shall have to find other work for them, as we are doing in Sevagram where the majority of the population consists of Harijans.
 J. The situation here in Sevagram is exceptional. There are so many  institutions here. Guests are always coming in, new houses are under construction and various other activities are going on. All this provides work to the people.
 G. Everywhere I would try to create a similar situation. We shall have to apply our mind and energy to discover new avenues of work.
 J. What you say about agriculture, cattle-breeding, etc., is perfectly correct. But we should also consider how to provide permanent economic benefit to the villagers through khadi. Had mill-cloth not been there, it would have been easy. But the question is what are we to do when we have the mills.
 G. I would explain to the people that they could not get khadi like mill-cloth. I would try to bring it home to them that if khadi is dearer the extra money goes to the villager, his family and to the village, and that this provides security to the economy of the village. I would explain to them the moral aspect as well. Besides, I would teach them other methods of earning in the village. I have now given up the idea that villagers can earn their living through doing khadi work alone.
 J. It means that we have to set them to work by bringing home to them the moral and social value of khadi and other village industries.
 G. Yes, I do not want to confine myself to khadi alone now. I am, therefore, thinking of ways and means of improving the condition of the people through a rehabilitation of agriculture, cattle-breeding and all other village industries. My problem will be solved if I succeed even in half a dozen villages, for “as is the part so is the whole”.
 J. That means we shall have to develop the villages keeping their allround progress in view. We should emphasize not only the economic aspect of khadi but explain its moral and social aspect also.
 G. From this point of view even Vallabhswami’s method does not appeal to me, for he emphasizes only khadi and promises to make the entire village khadi-clad within a certain period. There was a time when this idea appealed to me immensely, but now I feel that khadi alone cannot revive the villages. Village uplift is possible only when we rejuvenate village life as a whole, revive all village industries and make the entire village industrious.

 MY DEAR C. R.,

Love.
    From 	a photostat: G.N. 2097  BAPU "
48,"October 	13, 1944",DISCUSSION WITH SHRIKRISHNADAS JAJU,"
       October 	13, 1944  J. 	Today I would request you to throw more light on decentralization. 	Narrowly viewed, there is even now decentralization in production 	because production centres are distributed all over the country. But 	of course all capital is centralized in the Head Office. I believe 	that the central control existing today is merely a control 	exercised by the A.I.S.A. in regard to policy.  Looking 	at the matter from the point of view of capital we must consider 	under whose initiative the work is to be carried on in the villages 	hereafter and who is to bear the profit or loss in the end. Now 	there are three ways of doing this.  Our 	worker on 	the spot 	can carry 	on all 	the work. Or, 	we may 	work through a 	committee of 	villagers interested in 	khadi work who 	may themselves raise 	shares, subscriptions, 	etc. Or 	as a third 	course the artisans 	of khadi 	can form 	their own 	societies and 	carry on 	the work as 	their own. 	If the 	worker remains solely in 	charge we 	shall have to 	hand over to 	him all the assets, 	money, property, etc. Should he 	then be 	regarded as 	a trustee or 	should some condition be 	imposed upon him? If 	the worker carries on 	his activities 	with an 	eye to 	personal profit 	there is every 	likelihood of 	undesirable developments. 	I think 	the best 	way, therefore, 	would be to form 	co-operative societies. 	Selfish interests may 	lead to 	some mismanagement 	but this 	fear should 	not deter 	us. We 	may have co-operative 	societies not only for 	khadi but 	also for oil-pressing, 	hand-paper, etc. In 	course of 	time these bodies 	in the 	various villages 	may, if necessary, 	merge into a union.      
 G. I do not have much to say on this point. Wherever we can get reliable workers work should be started. There is no  harm  in beginning simultaneously the three types of experiments you have enumerated. But, as we had discussed yesterday, we can get rid of many worries if we do not hold ourselves responsible for khadi sales. So long as khadi remains a saleable commodity, these worries are bound to be there. I also realize that we cannot entirely get rid of them today. But so long as we believe that khadi, like bread, must be made at home and that we should not maintain ourselves on bazar-made biscuits even if cheaper, we shall have to explain to the people that to use bazar-made goods is to court disaster. If the people grasp the idea, we shall have to devise an easy method of khadi manufacture at home. Our slogan will be ‘cloth even like bread’. All difficulties will then disappear. The co-operative bodies will then have their own shape and form which need not now be anticipated.
 When you said that there was decentralization in khadi production, I was about to contradict you. Even in Lancashire some cloth is made at home, not for the use of the home but for the use of the masters. It would be outrageous to call this decentralization. So also in Japan everything is made at home; but it is not for the use of the home; it is all for the Government which has centralized the whole business. Though things are made at home, and made in a better manner than in England, yet the producers cannot keep any of it for their home consumption. The work is done at the behest of the Government which supplies ships and does everything else to carry such goods to the different markets of the world and thus draw wealth from other countries. The same is happening in Lancashire. Though millions of dhotis are made there, yet not a single one is available to any purchaser on the spot. They are exported to the country for which they are scheduled, be it India, Africa or any other. I would certainly not call this decentralization.
 So also with khadi. Our artisans produce not for themselves but for the A. I. S. A. to which they give their finished material for wages paid. They were happy when we raised their wages. But this is not decentralization. What I mean by decentralization is that the artisan must produce for his own or his neighbour’s use and not for sale. When we realize that khadi is not a commodity for sale but for self-consumption only then we shall have grasped the message of khadi and understood the scope of its potentialities. We may be
 expected to clothe the whole country with khadi after getting political power. Should we not therefore make such an arrangement from today so that we may be able to make the country self-sufficient in clothing in case the future government of free India were to provide the requisite facilities to the A. I. S. A. and ask it, as an expert body, to do this task? But if the government of the day were to close all its mills, and to charge us with this responsibility, we are apt to fail as things are today. We should, therefore, know the extent to which khadi can take us. I myself cannot say that I know it for certain. But what I am quite clear about is that khadi should not be for sale but for self-consumption. Hence the necessity of changing the present policy of khadi work. We have before us the task of reconstructing our whole country, and in this khadi is an important item. So also there are oil-pressing and other industries. It is only if we look at the problem from the point of view of production for use rather than for sale that the country has everything to gain by Our work, and we shall be able to meet the situation squarely without withdrawing a single step when we obtain control over the reins of Government.
 J. I presume what you mean is that we should direct all our efforts towards cloth self-sufficiency, i.e., towards spinning for one’s own consumption.
 G. Exactly so. But as I have no personal experience about it I cannot insist on it. I first introduced khadi and only later studied its implications and experimented with it. I find that I have been  deceiving myself. What I gave to the people was money in the form of wages and assured them that it contained swaraj. People took me at my word and believed me, and continue to believe me. But I have now my own misgivings as to how far such khadi can lead to swaraj. I am afraid that khadi has no future if we continue it as today.
 J. Do you visualize a stage in which the khadi bhandars running presently in the cities will be closed down?
G. Of course I do.
 J. We shall then have to supply khadi to the people in lieu of yarn alone.
 G. When we saw that we could not proceed without spinning we learnt spinning. But we did not take to weaving. However, now we feel that weavers will also have to be trained in the same manner. Whatever changes we want to introduce we must introduce intelligently and with discrimination.
 I may recall what we did about living wages in spinning. We went along certain lines. Slowly it dawned upon us that khadi so
 produced was no philanthropy but an exploitation of spinners. We then raised the wages. I pleaded for eight annas. The rest of you insisted on three annas. I agreed to your three annas. Then you raised it to four annas. Similarly we may proceed in our new attempt. First you must accept the principle, later we shall proceed in the light of our experience. You have pointed out three possible ways of reorganizing the work on the new basis. Think over them. We have got our machinery in every province.  Provincial  organizers are already there. Call some of the workers and discuss the matter in detail with them. True, it will mean some curtailment of our present work. But that will not deter me. Even if nobody else spins I shall go on spinning alone. When we started khadi production I was told that khadi dhoti was impossible to produce. I replied that I would put on sack cloth or a blanket but would not wear a mill dhoti. And hardly a month passed when Maganlal produced  a dhoti; Gangabehn Majmudar also sent me one and asked me to place an order for any number of them.
 J. It means we shall have to stop the large-scale sale of khadi in the cities and instead ask the people to take up spinning for themselves. Consequently, at least for some time a lot of our work will come to a stop.
 G. I agree that there is practical consideration behind what you say. Today people have become paupers. Therefore if you provide them with bread they will do whatever you ask them to do. But if we carry on our work thoughtlessly we shall be deceiving them as well as ourselves. The livelihood we provide them today is nothing but a sort of dole as is usually handed out during the time Of famine to the people who are offered work on the roads or quarries. It does not have a lasting value.
 J. Before asking khadi consumers to spin their own yarn we should consider how much we ourselves are devoted to spinning. Let me take the instance of the
 A.I.S.A. workers. Our rule requires every worker to spin at least 7_ hanks in a month. But we have not had a satisfactory response. Further, the number of spinners among the khadi customers is quite small. Most of the spinners in the countryside spin only for wages, scarcely for their own use. This is the situation. I wonder how far the experiment you suggest can succeed under these circumstances.
 G. At least this much should be clear to all that khadi is not an occupation or a craft merely for earning a livelihood. None of us should harbour this idea. For, if khadi is an industry it would have to be run purely on business lines. The difference between khadi and mill-cloth would then be that while a mill provides employment to a
 few thousand people in a city, khadi brings a crore of rupees to those scattered about in fifteen thousand villages. Both must then be classified as industries, and we would hardly be justified in asking anybody to put on khadi and boycott mill-cloth. Nor can such khadi claim to be the herald of swaraj. On the other hand we have claimed that the real significance of khadi is that it is a means for uplifting the villages and thereby generating in the people the spontaneous strength for swaraj. Such a claim cannot then be sustained. It will not do to continue to help the villagers by appealing to the philanthropic sentiments of city-dwellers. What is required is that the  villagers  should be made strong to face life’s problems and march ahead. If we encouraged mills, the nation might get sufficient cloth. And if mills are nationalized cloth prices may also come down, people may not be exploited and may earn adequate wages. But our reason for putting forward khadi is that it is the only way to redeem the people from the disease of inertia and indifference, the only way to generate in them the strength for freedom. If other crafts are also thus revitalized, our villages could be made self-sufficient and self-reliant. They would prepare their own soap from sajji clay. That soap will not have the luring fragrance of soaps turned out in the factories of Tata and Godrej. Its packing also will not be so attractive. But it will have the quality of self-sufficiency even like khadi. But this grand picture of khadi as the means of all-round uplift of the villages, which I have been putting forward for so long, is not being realized. The talks I have had with the workers have led me to believe that I must now retrace my steps. As the founder of khadi, I must not grudge doing so. That is the call of truth. I retrace my steps consciously or intelligently, and not in a mood of defeatism or of cowardice. If there was any exaggeration in my claims for khadi it is but right that I must own it publicly and rectify it.
 J. Our chief claim was that khadi was a craft whereby those who were forced to remain idle for a few months in the year could have some supplementary earning.
 G. No, I did not stop at that. I went further and claimed that it had the capacity to bring swaraj.
 J. That is true, but you did not stress so much its life-giving capacity as you are doing today. About three lakhs of people are employed in khadi work. They cannot quickly develop the manifold virtues (other than those of self-sufficiency) that you desire. They may do so in course of time. What you want to do today is to stop khadi sales and make people spin for their own needs, do you not?
G. You are right.
 J. But a closure of the sales would mean a suspension of spinning for wages.
 G. Of course. But the little amount of spinning we may then have would positively be such as can yield swaraj. For basically that strength is inherent in spinning.
 J. Today we are in contact with about three lakhs of people through khadi work. Requiring people to spin for self-sufficiency, we would reduce it to no more than thirty thousand.
 G. These thirty thousand would later grow into three crores. Be it as it may, I at least will not be guilty of betraying the cause. Further, we shall then not have to cajole or coax the villagers and artisans to spin. What we do today is to go to the villagers with a money-bag like bankers and promise four or six annas for spinning. Instead, we would enter into the life of the villagers. The workers and the villagers would freely lay bare their hearts before each other. We would raise the wage of the (woman) spinner. I would pay her as much as to a man. But I would tell her clearly that I am not interested in her spinning merely for a wage. I would ask her to spin for herself. I would promise to get her yarn woven, her children educated and trained in one craft or another. I would enquire into her budget and promise  every assistance. I would try and relieve her of her woes. Had we done this from the beginning and taken the right type of workers with us, we would have assuredly secured freedom by now. But I have no regret for the past.
 J. Do you think that you can get a large number of workers of this type? If so,  it is easy sailing.
 G. The mistake was undoubtedly ours. We did not keep this point of view ever before us. Nor did we train workers for it. Also we were in too much hurry. Had we devoted ourselves to the task intelligently, we would have got the needed workers.
 J. You have said many a time that good workers should go and settle in the villages.
 G. Yes, in order that they may make khadi the emblem of non-violence. If we fail, our claim for khadi will lose all force.
 J. After all we shall have to get our workers from the material that we have in our country today.
 G. If that is our attitude there can be no swaraj through non-violence. In other words, people are not ready for my conception of swaraj.
I would then go my own way even if I have to work all alone. I
 would be happy if any of the A. I. S. A., A. I. V. I. A., Hindustani Talimi Sangh or other bodies co-operate with me. It is quite possible that people may not follow us. It would then show that we are full of violence and that the non-violence we talk about is not non-violence but cowardice.
 J. That is all right. But the question is one of implementation.
 G. We should then  renounce  the  tall  claim  we  have  made.  We must stick to the truth. Without hesitation, without flattering ourselves we must declare that we are weak like everybody else and that we are in no way better. It would then be clear that swaraj, if and when obtained, will not be due to any special strength of ours.

55,"October 14, 1944",DISCUSSION WITH SHRIKRISHNADAS JAJU,"
  
 October 14, 1944
 J. If your programme of village reconstruction as a whole is to be taken up, we must select and train efficient workers. . . .
 Then there will be the question of training workers for which we would have to start vidyalayas in every province and frame syllabi for them. There is a great dearth of able teachers. Our first-grade workers have confined themselves to their particular areas—to their village, tehsil or district. . . .
 I do not quite see how the new work can be accomplished unless we divert some of these workers from their field to the training centres. Who else can impart the right attitude and approach to village workers?
 G. Khadi work started in the beginning from a single centre. So also now we may begin with only one training centre. We shall prepare graduates there and send them to other centres. They will produce other workers who will start yet more centres.
 J. It may involve a lot of time, from five to even ten years.
 G. Possibly, but I do not think so. Our first batch will consist of those who have already enough prior preparation, and so they will not take long to go out as full-fledged workers. Again, as soon as they have acquired a certain amount of efficiency we shall ask them to go out to the villages and add to their store of knowledge by dint of actual experience in the field. I do not, therefore, feel that a large amount of time will have to be spent on training. But even if it is, we should not worry. If we do not get workers of the highest quality it does not matter. We will try to obtain the finest material, but be ready to do with what we can get at present.
 J. The workers we got in 1920 proved their worth. Thereafter we did not secure that high type of workers in so large a measure. Some did come indeed, and do come, but in very small numbers.
 G. The fact is our method was defective and there was little in our programme to attract the better type. There seemed to be little scope for intellectual development in our work. Hence a large number of people did not feel attracted to it. Besides the remunerative attraction present in other fields was not there. But what was worse, a sort of ignorance and inertia characterized the khadi workers, which made others look down on them. People felt that khadi workers did not dress properly, looked dirty and were quite often devoid of common sense. The workers did not have adequate knowledge of the science of khadi and so did little to explain it to the people. They were
 often not in a position to answer the simple questions of those who wanted to know.
 We did settle in the villages where we provided work to the villagers. But the intellectual among us did not, to any large extent. The few who worked did not have the attitude of an anxious and earnest  devotee eager to explain his viewpoint to the people.libtech_51_footnoteIf  we had we would have become such experts in our work that we would have been in a position to declare before economists, “We know all that you know. But you lack the practical knowledge that we have. This you can learn from us.”
 J. True. Our knowledge is incomplete and we have very many defects. But our scale of measuring values is also different.
 G. May be, but we must have the capacity to tell them that their scale is not right.
 J. But how to compare moral values with material values?
 G. Then you could at least place those moral values before them and prove their worth. If I come to realize today that khadi alone is not going to last I shall have to proclaim it to the world. So far as the material value of khadi goes, even Government records show that  there is a place for the spinning-wheel as a means of relief, like stone-breaking, road-making, etc. You also can establish this much that khadi has an invariable place as a relief measure. But what we are required to prove above all is the need for khadi to establish a strong, non-violent village economy.
 We shall see what difficulties we come across in working the programme of self-sufficiency. Commercial khadi may continue for a time, but the essential programme of the A.I.S.A. hereafter must be that of self-sufficiency, and workers should concentrate all  their thought and energy on it.

 Acharya Shriman Narayan Agrawal is one of those young men who have sacrificed a prosperous, perhaps even brilliant, career for the service of the Motherland. Moreover, he happens to be in full sympathy with the way of life for which I stand. This brochure is an attempt to interpret it in terms of modern political science. Acharya Agrawal seems to have made an earnest study of modern literature on the subject. I am sorry to have to say that I have not gone through the treatise with the attention it deserves. Nevertheless I have read enough of it to be able to say that he has not misrepresented me in any place. There is no pretence at an exhaustive presentation of the implications of the charkha economics. It claims to be a comparative study of the charkha economics based on non-violence and the industrial economics which to be paying must be based on violence, i.e., exploitation of the non-industrialized countries. Let me not anticipate the author’s argument. I commend the treatise to the careful attention of every student of the present deplorable condition of the country.

 SEVAGRAM,
 October 16, 1944
 Mrs. Vijayalaxmi Pandit has asked me to pen a few words about the late Ranjit Pandit’s unfinished rendering of Ritusanhar. I consider myself wholly unfit to do justice to the author’s effort nor does Vijayalaxmi expect me to attempt the impossible. But the touching circumstances under which Ranjit Pandit made the effort need emphasising. It is remakable how much India owes to political imprisonments. Lokmanya’s celebrated work on the Gita would not have seen the light of day but for his imprisonment nor Jawaharlal Nehru’s world-known works. Ranjit Pandit’s Rajtarangini and his labours on Ritusanhar might not have been but for his imprison- ments. And he was ailing in the prison. His literary labours made him forget his pain. Instead of a preface the author’s introductory notes
 are deeply interesting and instructive. It reveals to us Ranjit Pandit as a patriot and scholar. Having known him intimately I know what talents he had. It is a sad thought that such a son of India should have died in the prime of life. I congratulate Vijayalaxmi on giving to India and the world her husband’s last labour of love.

CHI. JETHALAL,
 Jajuji has investigated the matter. He had passed on [the relevant things] for me to peruse. He also gave me the letter addressed to you which I have read. I find that no office-bearer has made any allegation against you. Bhai Dhotrelibtech_61_footnotenever had any suspicion. And why should he? You are not asking for the return of some money that had been given away. You have only asked for the substantiation of any charges against you. There is no allegation, however. But I don’t like your rejoinder to Jajuji. It reads like a lawyer’s reply. It is not worthy of a votary of non-violence. Jajuji had asked the questions only to refresh his memory and you ought to have answered them. I want you to answer them even now.
 Do you really have any khadi activity there these days? What do you do nowadays? How far have you merged yourself in the life of the people of Anantapur?

  October 	22, 1944  	Congressmen should read without passion Dr. Mahmud’s letters to 	the Viceroy and his statement to the Press releasing those letters. 	The motive in writing the letters was undoubtedly pure.

The practical question for Congressmen is whether they are to make 	use of Dr. Mahmud’s services or ostracize him for the 	‘impropriety’ he admits having committed.

100,"October 22, 1944","HINTS FOR CONSTRUCTIVE
WORKERSlibtech_92_footnote","
  
 Workers should definitely realize that the constructive programme is the non-violent and truthful way of winning purna swaraj. Its wholesale fulfilment is complete independence. Imagine all the forty crores of people engaged in the constructive programme which is designed to build up the nation from the very  bottom  upward. Can anybody dispute the proposition that it must mean complete independence in every sense of the expression, including the ousting of foreign domination? When the critics laugh at the proposition, what they mean is that forty crores of people will never co-operate in the effort to fulfil the programme. No doubt there is considerable truth in the scoff. My answer is, it is worth the attempt. Given an indomitable will on the part of a band of earnest workers, the programme is as workable as any other and more so than most. Anyway, I have no substitute for it, if it is to  be  based  on non-violence.
 Civil disobedience, mass or individual, is an aid to constructive effort and is a full substitute for armed revolt. Just as military training is necessary for armed revolt, training in constructive effort is equally necessary for civil resistance. And just as the use of arms becomes necessary only when an occasion demands it, even so is the use of civil resistance only occasional. Therefore workers will never be on the look-out for civil resistance. They will hold themselves in readiness, if the constructive effort is sought to be defeated. To take one or two illustrations, effort for communal friendship cannot be defeated, political pacts can.
 But political pacts are required because of the previous lack of friendship. Similarly khadi manufacture and its use  cannot  be defeated if both become fairly universal. The manufacture and use are not to be brought about by imposing them upon the people, but they have to be intelligently accepted by them as some of the necessary items of the freedom movement, when it is worked from the villages as units. Pioneers even in such programmes are likely to be obstructed. They have had to go through the fire of suffering throughout the
 
 world. There is no swaraj without suffering. In violence truth is the greatest sufferer; in non-violence truth is ever triumphant.
 If this preliminary observation has gone home to the reader he will find the constructive programme to be full of deep interest. It should prove as absorbing as politics so-called and platform oratory.
 The detailed constructive programme is to be found in my pamphletlibtech_93_footnotelibtech_94_footnoteon   it,  and   Dr.  Rajendra   Prasad’slibtech_95_footnotewhich   is  a   running commentary on it. It should be remembered that it is illustrative, not exhaustive. Local circumstances may suggest many more items not touched in the printed programme. These are beyond the scope of a treatise on an all-India programme. They are necessarily for local workers to find out and do the needful.
 In these hints I have singled out some items for fuller emphasis in the light of experience gained since the publication of the programme.
 The kisan or the peasant, whether as a landless labourer or a labouring proprietor, comes first. He is the son of the soil which  rightly belongs or should belong to him, not to the absentee landlord or zamindar. But in the non-violent way the labourer cannot forcibly eject the absentee landlord. He has so to work as to make it impossible for the landlord to exploit him. Closest co-operation amongst the peasants is absolutely necessary. To this end, special organizing bodies or committees should be formed where there are none and those already in existence should be reformed where necessary. The kisans are for the most part illiterate. Both adults and young persons of school-going age should be educated. This applies to men as well as women. Where they are landless labourers their wages should be brought to a level that would ensure a decent living which should mean balanced food, dwelling-houses and clothing, which should satisfy health requirements.
 Land laws should be examined. The peasant indebtedness offers a limitless field for research. The problem of cattle too is an integral part of agriculture in India and therefore requires the attention of workers skilled in this very intricate and somewhat baffling problem.
 Closely allied to the kisan work is labour. Here labour means industrial labour and, therefore, concentrated and centralized and
 
 much more limited in scope. Moreover, it lends itself readily to political handling; being necessarily confined to the cities it attracts workers more easily than kisan work. As part of constructive programme its primary aim is elevation of labour to its  deserved status. Therefore a labour worker’s aim should be to raise the moral and intellectual height of labour and thus by sheer merit to make him or her capable not merely of bettering his or her material condition but making labour master of the means of production  instead  of being the slave that it is. Capital should be labour’s servant, not its master.
 Labour should be able to support itself during strikes. (Labour should be taught the science of conducting a successful non-violent Labour should be made conscious of its duty from  whose  performance rights follow as a matter of course.
In a concrete form:
 Labour 	should have its own unions.  Education, 	both general 	and scientific, 	of both 	men and women 	should be regularly 	undertaken through night-schools.  Children 	of labourers 	should be educated 	after the 	Basic Education style.  There 	should be a 	hospital, a 	creche and 	a maternity 	home attached 	to every centre. Labour strike.) 
 All the work I have mentioned could be only done through unions mentioned in (a). To my knowledge the Ahmedabad Union is the best managed union. This does not mean that it has reached my ideal. It is trying to. If all the unions worked in the same direction, the lot of labour would be infinitely better than it is today. Labour united and morally and intellectually trained would any day be superior to capital.libtech_96_footnote
 Next in importance is the student class above the age of 12. Indeed if we had enough workers of the right type, I would go so far as to say that we should work among them as soon as they begin learning as infants. For they have to be taken in hand from the school-going age. Indeed, I need not say that I have not in mind their political use. For the present the schools are largely  under  Government control or are influenced by them. Hence the students’ education is defective in a vital matter. They are untouched by the political condition of the country save what they learn from the newspapers or platform orators. They should have in a systematic
 
 manner their present education supplemented by Congress workers. How this can be fitted into the present system of education is a serious question. But it has to be tackled. Up to the matriculation standard co- operation of parents is necessary.
 I adhere to the view often expressed by me that the student world should be aloof from the political turmoil. It would be different if there was mass civil disobedience. But at any rate for the time being that is out of the question. But they should have education in national consciousness. It is the duty of an independent State to teach  its citizens to be patriotic. The education is imparted by a foreign agency. It runs contrary to the national aspirations. There should, therefore, be a body of workers whose duty it would be to undertake the big task of taking in hand the work mentioned above. In this sense it is a new field and it is of vital importance to us. We must recognize the fact that the students are not to be weaned from schools and colleges. The rapidly increasing number of entrants is proof positive of it. The best course, therefore, is to supplement their studies in an orderly manner. Deliverance lies through  national effort in this direction showing marked superiority over the foreign method.

VI       [On or after October 22, 1944]libtech_98_footnote  Friends 	and co-workers tried to argue with him. He had just presented to 	them his enlarged and revitalized programme of constructive work. 	Would not the great wave of emotion, which his fast would set up, 	disturb the “peace and tranquillity” in which many of them were 	settling down to work? Gandhiji replied: But 	that is just what I want. I do not want you or anybody else  	“to settle down” to anything. In the midst of this frightful 	triple do so because I know the joy of dying. Because I know that 	joy and amazing thing is that I still survive and can feel the joy 	of living. I can grief are the obverse and reverse of the same coin, 	I remain unaffected     
 by either and act as God bids me.
 Must you speak through the pangs of hunger? Is there no other method?
 There are many. They are for you to adopt. I must use mine, which I hold as a special gift from God to appeal to the heart and soul of the people.
 a result, it would not let loose a storm with none left to control it?
 That may happen. I do not want it. But I would face that risk if the upshot of living a conscious life of truth and non-violence for over half a century is that India, too, has to go through a blood-bath.
 “Why should you not in that case invite the risk of chaos in pursuit of non-violence The slaughter of soldiers, civilians and truth, it is impossible to settle down to anything. One has ceaselessly to be on the march body and soul. My business is to stir up myself and my surroundings and shake us out of our complacency.
 What reason had he to think that his fast would compel the people to think instead of paralysing their thinking?
 While it might be presumptuous on the part of a puny individual like himself to think, he replied, that his fast would galvanize the people, it was his faith that he had not striven all those years in vain to live a life of truth and non-violence, that gave him the right to speak through his fast.
 Today millions are experiencing the pangs of hunger in passive helplessness. Even a small fraction of this suffering undergone willingly and with knowledge could change the face of the situation. How can I speak to these millions, or identify myself with them, without [under]taking this fast and knowing myself what pangs of hunger mean?
 He could not point to any single thing in explanation of his urge to fast, he said, but the whole situation in its totality overwhelmed him.
 The friends were not satisfied. What guarantee was there that if anything happened to him as while you are there in the flesh  to control it?” the friends returned to the charge.
 Because I do not want anarchy or chaos. I must work for orderliness, not anarchy. But if in that attempt anarchy comes in my way, I would not be deterred by it. The world is thrilled  by  the  reckless bravery of the Japanese. Far greater courage and bravery are expected of non-violence at this juncture if the law of the Jungle is to be replaced by the law of love.

         WARDHA, 
  October 	23, 1944 Mr. 	 Hornimanlibtech_99_footnotelibtech_100_footnotethoughtfully  sent   the   following   wire  to   Mr. Pyarelal 	on the 19th:  Can 	you confirm or deny the Allahabad report that Gandhiji is 	contemplating a fast to achieve communal unity? Pyarelal 	sent the following reply:  Thanks. 	Report without foundation.  	The reply is accurate, in that I do not contemplate any fast to 	achieve communal unity or any particular end. Yet the reply is not 	complete.  	Ever since my premature discharge, I have been saying to myself and 	some friends that yet another fast is in store for me. Of late what 	was vaguely felt has been taking a concrete shape, and so I have 	been sharing the feeling with a larger circle of friends.  The 	report has now crept into the Press. It is as well for the public, 	therefore, to have a correct version of the talks I have been having 	with friends.  	Fasting has a definite place in the scheme of satyagraha. It is the 	last weapon in the armoury of non-violence. It is taken by way of 	penance, purification, protest. If I am at fault, I must do penance. 	My non-violence rebels against the organized violence that surrounds 	me. It takes many shapes. Lying is as much violence as doing 	physical harm to a person. I do not here refer only to the violence 	of the rulers. I know this, that non-violence has to be most active 	in the face of what may seem to be invincible violence.  	But nothing is clear, nothing is certain. What seems to me to be a 	call may be no call at all. I am, therefore, testing myself, 	discussing the pros and cons with friends, and allowing myself to be 	acted upon. I have never made fasting a fad.  	I have never looked forward to it and yet it has often brought 	solace to the agonized soul, for real fasting puts the soul in tune 	with the Maker. It puts life into one’s prayer. All the while, I 	am discussing the feeling with friends. I am praying for light and 	guidance, without    
 which there will be no fast. I ask for the co-operation of friends throughout the world in my search for light.

SARABHAIlibtech_119_footnote","
  
 SEVAGRAM,
 October 26, 1944 The unbearable forces of injustice, exploitation and falsehood prevailing  in   this   country  and   the   world   stifle   me. Government
subsists on falsehood, but amongst us  the  number  of  people,  who
 subsist on this falsehood and who have made  injustice  and exploitation the principles of their lives, is not small. In the presence of this, good elements of life are entirely suppressed and appear helpless. There is nothing left like moral public opinion.
 On the one hand, there is a combination of violence effected on an unprecedented scale while, on the other, I have laid a claim that non-violence has strength enough to oppose any amount of well-organized and banded violence, and how to achieve it is the question. There are too good elements in India and the world, but how to awaken them? How can it be done? Fast is the last resort of satyagraha. When people cannot be made to do anything it is the right of a lone satyagrahi to resort to this final measure. If my fast comes about it is possible that it will be the complaining voice  of  the exploited humanity before the world.
 
 Those who can foresee the possibility of mass  movement, against the prevailing falsehood, they are at liberty to do it. But the individual or the individuals who do it must shoulder its complete responsibility. I cannot give my blessings to it. Today, the circumstances are not favourable for it. Besides, the public is full of resentment, and therefore the mass satyagraha would  result  in violence. Our little violence will be met by hundredfold violence by Government. We should not expect merciful treatment from them.
 This does not mean that we should be a mute spectator of it, or that we should continue to suffer it. Those who consider the present condition as oppressive, and find the laws encouraging injustice and exploitation and depriving of one’s liberty, they can definitely resort to satyagraha. Only that it should be done individually and it should not be devoid of politeness. It can only be done with absolute non-violence. There are good many forces contained in it. If a crore of people were to do individual satyagraha it would  baffle Government. Then Government would either be helpless or resort to use of guns. You cannot sit silent after saying that  individual satyagraha can be offered. It is one’s duty to do it. If the public has any stamina, it can oppose thus the looting going on under its nose. Leaving aside the question of a crore of people, if all (local) people do so at one place, it is enough.
 If individual satyagraha is not approved, the prevailing falsehood of the present day should be opposed in any other way. Today our own people are depriving the public of their food grains. If they do not do it, people will not starve. The cultivator, who produces food, does not get it to eat in spite of its being there. We have no political power, otherwise its remedy would have been found. This condition is terrible. I cannot tolerate our people behaving thus, and collecting vast fortunes at the cost of people’s starvation. If we can rid our people of  falsehood and  roguery,  Government’s falsehood cannot work. Let us remove the corruption prevailing everywhere. It is already there in the Government, but it has increased to a very great extent among those middlemen who live on brokerage. If these people improve by themselves, others would do so. Today the chain of violence is made up thus. Against this we have to work non- violently. Fast is the last weapon of non-violence.
 Corruption—It is both in the Government and other quarters. If non-Governmental corruption stops, the Government corruption
 cannot go on. Non-violence has to bring about the union of good elements. Violence brings about unity among wicked elements. This is the first exhibition of violence.
 The second is untouchability. Hindu religion must understand that it is a sin. If untouchability endures, Hindu religion will not survive. If the former is removed, the latter is safe. In the removal of untouchability and in trying to live as brethren Government cannot interfere.
 The third exhibition is communal bitterness. Political settlement may be effected or not. As long as the present Government remains, it will not be possible; it would not be allowed. But we can develop good relations between us. We should not give any cause of complaint with regard to matters which are in our hands. The conduct  of Congressmen in Allahabad Municipality has grieved me much. In short, we should develop good relations amongst us in the removal of untouchability and securing communal unity. Government cannot interfere in such attempts.
 Refer to the supplementary note to the previous suggestions on the constructive programme and ponder over them. The meaning of your turning to me every moment for small things is that you do not want to use your intelligence. Everyone should be his leader. No harm if you commit a mistake. I shall point it out. You mend it and it should be considered as atonement. By making mistakes we shall find the real path. This does not mean that I would not guide you. As long as I can do so, I shall continue to do it.
 When Gandhiji was requested to take the public into confidence with regard to all that is troubling his mind and to postpone his fast until then, he said:
I am neither in a hurry for the fast nor have a desire for it, but I
 think I will have to undertake it. I neither know the time nor the duration of the fast. I am trying to check that idea. How could I be a mute witness of the terrible looting and falsehood going on in India and the world? Then, what should I do? Should I start  mass satyagraha? Or a revolution? That is possible. I can bring it about. But I do not want to do it. Non-violence cannot remain in it. I will not take that risk. There is no atmosphere for it. I can foresee it. Therefore the satyagrahi has only one weapon left and it is the fast. If I can move my forces thereby, I would do so. But nothing is certain yet. No decision has been taken on this fast question. Every time the public knew it after the decision was taken. This time I have been putting it
 before my companions for discussion and consideration, and now this has been declared to the whole country. If they and the public desire, they might contribute towards its prevention by lessening its causes.

If any unit did not want to adopt basic education, he would leave it free to follow any other system approved by the Board.
But the Talimi Sangh should have the confidence that no one
will be able to find a better system than theirs.
 Basic education would forge ahead through its intrinsic merit. He knew that the reform would not come by mere argumentation. It would come by ocular demonstration. If they could carry their experiment to a successful end even in one village, the battle would be half won. He was, therefore, content to go slow. It was enough that the trustees had agreed to the money being spent for the education and welfare of women and children in the villages exclusively.
Your work is going chiefly to be among women. I have always
 had a passion to serve womankind. Ever since my arrival in India, the women have recognized in me their friend and servant. They have come to look upon me as one of themselves. I hold radical views about the emancipation of women from their fetters which they mistake for adornment. If God wills it, I hope one day to place some of my conclusions before the public when my researches are completed. My experience has confirmed me in the view that real advancement of women can come only by and through their own efforts. I am, therefore, anxious that as many women workers as possible should be inspired to carry out the Talimi Sangh activities under the Trust.
 The second suggestion put forth by the Talimi Sangh was that the age of the
 
 boys to be covered by the scheme should be raised from 7 to 12.
 Mahatma Gandhi explained why he had agreed to the reduction of the age limit for boys from 12 to 7 years. It had been brought to his notice that, if there were equal facilities for the education of boys and girls, the mothers would send the boys to school but not the girls, as they would be loath to spare them from domestic work. The result would be that the boys would get a disproportionate share of the benefit and keep out the girls. But if in any place a sufficient number of girls  was  not forthcoming, they could take in boys above the age of seven, on condition that they would have to make room for the girls as soon as the latter came up and that their education was paid for. The object was not to shut out boys above seven, but to prevent them from being a burden upon the Memorial Fund. The Talimi Sangh should not fall back upon the Fund designed for women. All that he was concerned about was that the money of the Kasturba Fund should not be diverted to the use of boys over seven at the expense of girls.
 “Is it desirable that there should be basic schools for girls exclusively if there was not enough room for both?” somebody asked. Mahatma Gandhi said he had no objection.
 Supposing crores of boys come to us for education, are we to refuse them for lack of accommodation? I tell you I won’t. I will let them sit under the shade of a tree, if necessary, put bamboo taklis into their hands and begin to educate them straightway through these.
 As to adult education, Gandhiji observed that it had become clear to him that the scope of basic education had to be extended. It should include the education of everybody at every stage of life.libtech_122_footnote
 A basic school teacher must consider himself a universal teacher. As soon as he comes in contact with anybody, man or woman, young or old, he should say to himself: ‘Now, what can I  give  to  this person?’
 Won’t that be supererogation on his part?
 No. Supposing I come across an old man who is dirty and ignorant. His village is his universe. It would be my job to teach him cleanliness, to remove his ignorance and widen his mental horizon. I need not tell him that I am to be his teacher. I will try to establish a living contact with his mind and win his confidence. He may reject my
 
 advances. I won’t accept defeat, but continue my effort till I succeed in making friends with him. Once that is achieved, the  rest  must follow.
 Again, I must have my eye on the children right from their birth. I will go a step further and say that the work of the educationist begins even before that. For instance, if a woman becomes pregnant, Ashadevi will go to her and tell her: ‘I am a mother as you will be. I can tell you from my experience what you should do to ensure the health of your unborn baby and your own.’ She will tell the husband what his duty towards his wife is and about his share in the care of their expected baby. Thus the basic school teacher will  cover  the entire span of life. Naturally, his activity will cover adult education.
 Some work for adult education is being done in many places. It is mostly concentrated among mill-hands and the like in big cities. No one has really touched the village. Mere three Rs and lectures on politics won’t satisfy me. Adult education of my conception must make men and women better citizens all round. To work out the syllabus and to organize the work of adult education is a more difficult task than preparation of the seven years’ course for children. The common central feature of both will be the imparting of education through village crafts. Agriculture will play an important part in adult education under the basic scheme. Literary instruction must be there.Much information will be given orally. There will be books more for the teachers than the taught. We must teach the  majority how to behave towards the minority and vice versa. The right type of adult education should teach good neighbourliness and cut at the very root of untouchability and communal problem.
 The particular industry which is to serve as the medium of instruction will be determined by local conditions in each place. For instance, people in a village might tell you that they are interested in agriculture, but they are not interested in the spinning-wheel. In that case, you will choose the former as the medium of instruction. You could make a beginning by taking a census of its cattle. For instance, I find that almost everyone in Sevagram has a bullock and  a bullock-cart. It seems wasteful. The villagers should be taught co-operation. Again, we must inculcate in them the right principles of relationship between men and women. Men get almost double the women’s wages for identical work. Sometimes men sit lazily at home and smoke while the women toil the whole day. People should be
 made to realize that this is doubly wrong and ought to go. If you agree with me that the scope of basic education should be extended, you might have to change your constitution.

 I have your letter. It shows your inadequate understanding. I have spoiled nothing by setting up here the Khadi Vidyalaya, etc. The organizations initially started by me had to work in close association with me. If the people engaged in them could not live together as a family, then whose fault is it? Mine? Maybe, the fault is his who sees it. The Sabarmati S[atyagraha] A[shram] was remodelled after thoughtful consideration. It is my belief that we have lost nothing by being truthful. Again, after today’s heart-searching we have lost nothing. We were in a slumber but now we are awake.
 It is clear from what happened yesterday that it would not be right for us to continue as we have been doing. Those who can be of greater service outside should certainly go. What benefit can one derive from being near to me if one fails to understand my actions and the changes I make? No doubt a fire bucket is a very useful thing but how can one become like a fire bucket just by using it as an illustration? If you wish to be like a fire bucket then be quiet, be humble and be a sort of comfort for all, and do it after proper deliberation. Continue the study of Sanskrit.

 October 29, 1944
 My heart is heavily grieved by the injustice, exploitation and falsehood prevailing and increasing, day by day, in the world. The best remedy for it is to awaken the good elements in the whole world. Collective civil disobedience is the way for it, but it is not possible today. It is very likely that such collective activity will result in violence. If we are able to avoid unofficial falsehood and injustice, Government falsehood and injustice will be no more. I feel I must do penance by fasting.
 I am asked not to go on fast. I do not know when and for what duration it will come but let me say that the way to avoid the fast is in the people’s hands. I desire destruction of exploitation, injustice and falsehood. If they are destroyed my fast will be unnecessary.
 As a satyagrahi I cannot be a silent spectator of all these things. Revolution or collective civil disobedience is not possible and hence I must move on my wheels of non-violence through the fast.
 I have expressed my views to someone today. I express them to the whole country. People can give their contribution in the work which I intend to do.
 I cannot see people starve. Their rights are snatched by others. Nobody must do this. We must avoid falsehood and badmashi. We can improve those working as middlemen and thus lessen  the  burden upon the people. Activities of exploitation are in full swing and have become unbearable. Government stands firm and is maintaining its position on falsehood. But injustice and the policy of exploitation among the people too cannot be ignoredlibtech_137_footnotelibtech_138_footnote.

 I have read your letter. Yes, you can take out what you want from my writings. This work is good but you must do  a  lot  of physical work. It is very harmful to keep thinking of Vidya and go on weeping. That remembrance is good which elevates the atman and awakens it. The nature of atman is sat (truth) chit (awareness from heart, duly experienced) and ananda (bliss). The test of both lies in bliss—the inner bliss which finds outward expression. If you do not get peace here it would be better to go to Andhradesha early. I believe there you will get satsanga and treatment as well. If you do not, leave the place.

140,"October 29, 1944","INTERVIEW TO N.
G. RANGAlibtech_140_footnote","
  
 October 29, 1944
 PROF. RANGA, You say that the earth rightly belongs or should belong to the peasantlibtech_141_footnote. By this, do you mean only that the peasant ought to gain control over the land he cultivates or that he should also gain effective voice and power in the society and over the State in which he is obliged to live? If the kisans are to have only land and not effective political power, their position will be just as bad as in Soviet Russia where political power has been monopolized by the proletarian dictatorship while peasants were first allowed to gain some holdings and later were deprived of those
 
 holdings in the name of collectivization of land.
 GANDHIJI: I do not know what has happened in Soviet Russia. But I have no doubt that if we have democratic swaraj, as it must be if freedom is won through non-violence, the kisan must hold power in all its phases including political power.
 Am I right in interpreting your statement that land should not belong “to the absentee landlord or zamindar” and that ultimately the zamindari system has to be abolished, of course through non-violent means?
 Yes. But you should remember that I visualize a system of trusteeship regulated by the State. In other words I do not want to antagonize the zamindars (and for that matter any  class)  without cause.
 When you say that a peasant “has so to work as to make it impossible for the landlord to exploit him” does it include, apart from the satyagrahic campaigns and the legislative and administrative reforms, that the peasants may oblige the  State  through the exercise of their franchise and political influence to improve their individual and collective conditions and minimize the powers of the landlords?
 Civil disobedience and non-co-operation are designed for use when people, i.e., the tillers of the soil, have no political power. But immediately they have political power, naturally their grievances, whatever their character, will be ameliorated through  legislative channels.
 ‘But he might not have all that political power’,  you  will  perhaps say. My reply is that if swaraj is attained by the effort of the whole people, as it must be under non-violence, the kisans must come into their own and have the uppermost voice. But if it is not so and there is a sort of a workable compromise between the people and the Government on the basis of a limited franchise, the interests of the tiller of the soil will need close watching. If the legislature proves itself to be incapable of safeguarding kisans’ interests they will of course always have the sovereign remedy of civil disobedience and non-co-operation. But as I said as early as in 1921libtech_142_footnotelibtech_143_footnotein connection with Chirala Perala, ultimately, it is not paper legislation nor brave words or fiery speeches, but the power of non-violent organization, discipline and sacrifice that constitutes the real bulwark of the people against
 
 injustice or oppression.
 You suggest that the existing kisan organizations should be reformed where necessary. I quite recognize the need for Congressmen who have been working among kisans to re-orientate the general political attitude of the kisan class organizations so that they will recognize the need for a united political leadership for winning our national freedom. I am also convinced that the National Congress provides for us all—especially for peasants—the most effective weapon and leadership to win freedom. But is there any harm if we organize peasants into a ‘Kisan Congress’ which accepts the political leadership of the Congress?
 There may be gross self-deception in this presentation. When I said that the Kisan Sabhas should be reformed, I meant that up till now Kisan Sabhas have been formed not to wrest power from the Government, but to capture the Congress. That applies to the student and labour organizations too.
 You are partially right. That was so in the past. But we have now completely abandoned    that    idea.    Since    you    made    your    statement    on    the    subject  in 1938libtech_144_footnotethe thing was completely given up. We have adopted the word Congress not in a spirit of rivalry but because we want to be identified with the Congress. We will have double membership. Every member of the Kisan Congress will also be enrolled as a member of the National Congress.
 Then why not run the Congress? Why set up an independent and parallel organization? Don’t you see when Kisan Sabhas are bona-fide organizations they are the Congress? Today only a fraction of India’s population is represented on the Congress register. The Congress aspires to represent the whole nation. It claims by right of service to speak even for those who are not on its register. When it becomes a fully national organization, de jure as it is today by moral right, the bulk of its membership will naturally consist of the kisans and they will be in a position to dictate its policy.
 The trouble is that some of our Congress colleagues think we are ousting them from their legitimate position of power and privilege. They may not be prepared to welcome our existence or trust our bona fides. We want to avoid conflicts within the Congress by willingly accepting the political leadership of the Congress. For executing our economic programme we want to have a separate class-conscious organization which will derive power both for itself and the Congress from its
 
 contact with the masses. Unless we do that, others will come and confuse the kisans.
 Here you have involved yourself in a fallacy. You should work to make the Congress fully representative of the kisans. Unless we get down to this fundamental thing and work from bottom upward, there will be no swaraj. Every Congressman must make up his mind to make the Congress an honest organization, and therefore a kisan organization. As for rights they should follow as a natural corollary from the performance of service. Otherwise, there is only usurpation.
 You have tried for the last twenty-five years to rebuild the Congress organization and you know the result. I along with others must plead guilty for my share in the responsibility for failure. I must confess we have not got the confidence that we shall be able to so behave and act that the Congress will in the end become a kisan organization. Our fear is that by following your line of action in spite of ourselves, we shall allow ourselves to be exploited by vested interests. The very fact that the Birlas and their like are today prepared to give you shelter and you accept it from them prevents radical reform. Therefore, though I shall feel the wrench, I shall feel unable to work on your lines.
 Then you admit that whilst you will work under the aegis of the Congress, you will at the same time run a parallel, independent organization. My mind runs in a straight line. I do not understand this zigzag. This can only lead to trouble when the Congress becomes an effective organization. I am thinking of the millions of our downtrodden countrymen who do not know what to hope and what not to hope. A parallel organization will only further confuse their minds. It would be more logical to keep out of the Congress altogether.
 We enter the Congress, but we do not fight for position and power. Can you not treat us on the same footing as the Ahmedabad Labour Union?
Well, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. It will all depend
 on the spirit in which it is done. I have already expressed my apprehension. It is for you to remove it. You can model your organization after the Ahmedabad Labour Union. All the Labour Union members are on the Congress register. They are under the discipline of the Congress. Yet they are a power in the Congress and in the Municipality. You should confine yourself to Andhra alone. All kisans should be automatically on your register. But the purpose of enrolment should be educative, to make the kisans Congress-minded and politically conscious.
 I am glad you are laying special stress on adequate wages which will assure a minimum and decent standard of living for the landless peasants. Do you not also recognize the need for achieving minimum prices for agricultural produce which will assure labouring proprietors a decent and minimum standard of living?
Of course I do.
 The Bombay A. I. C. C. Resolution assures the masses that the power in the national Government and swaraj India ought to belong to the toilers on the fields, in the factories and elsewhere.libtech_145_footnoteCan we say that the spirit of the Resolution means that the Congress therefore stands for the achievement of democratic-kisan-mazdoor-praja raj after the attainment of swaraj?
Not only after but before also. The Congress stands for
democratic-kisan-mazdoor-praja raj.
 Do not your new instructions envisage the development of  kisan organizations from the village upwards, to provide for peasant leadership and co- operative action, but working in harmony with the local National Congress Committee and their leadership? I may say that the Haripura sessionlibtech_146_footnoteof the Congress has recognized the right of kisans to have their own class organizations. But we are anxious, in the light of these four years’ experience, that Congressmen shall take the lead in organizing kisans into their own unions so that there can be real unity and co-operation between kisan organizations and Congress Committees.
 Kisan organization and Congress organization are to me convertible terms. National Congress organizations to be true have either to be kisan organizations or nothing else.
 Can we organize landless agricultural labour into their separate unions wherever there are workers to undertake such responsibilities in order to win for them the barest economic and social justice? I do not envisage such unions in rivalry with the local peasant unions but as a supplement to them.
Yes, but as part of Congress reorganization work.
 Your instructions do not specifically mention the need for awakening and organizing the Hill Tribes and people of backward areas known as the Excluded or Partially Excluded Areas. These people number easily thirty million all over India and they are subject to many disabilities and they need our help very badly. May we take  it that Congressmen have to spare their energies to organize these people into their unions?
Certainly. The  aboriginal  is  as  backward  as  the   Harijan  and
more   neglected.   He   calls   for   all   the   humanitarian   service  that
 
 
 Congressmen are capable of. Unfortunately very few Congressmen have taken to it.
 Can our peasants and their organizations undertake satyagraha campaigns against any oppressive measures or policies of a landlord or a revenue authority, i.e., after all possibilities for settlement by negotiations through the good offices of the local Congress Committees have failed? We are aware of the 1939 Bombay A. I. C. C. instructionslibtech_147_footnoteregarding such campaigns and we accept that when there is a National Government with which the Congress co-operates, peasants’ unions as well as local committees have to seek the guidance of the Provincial Congress Committees as to when and how to start and conduct such satyagraha campaigns.
They would be fools if they did not do that.
 What flag do you recommend for peasant unions and handloom weavers’ unions and such other unions which agree to accept the National  Congress leadership? I may inform you that we have decided to drop the Red Flag and adopt the National Flag, with the typical class or professional emblem such as the plough or the loom placed in one corner in addition to the charkha which occupies already the central place.
I don’t mind. To differentiate you can have your class emblem
by the side of the national emblem.
 Do you not recognize the need for all the colonial peoples to try to come nearer to each other, learn from each other’s experience in their fight for freedom and help each other?
“Colonial people” is a badly chosen expression, “oppressed
 races of the earth” expresses the idea better. “Colonial” in the English language means whites who have migrated to the Colonies.
 Are we right in thinking that your stand against world imperialism is intended to benefit as much the African, Chinese, Red Indians and other non-white masses as the 400 millions of India?
My correspondence with the Government while under detention
shows that most clearly.
 May we have your blessings for our attempt to build up the “Colonial Peoples’ Freedom Front” and thus develop a research, propaganda and ideological platform with merely advisory and informative functions? I may inform you that several of our friends and your admirers in England, Africa and the West Indies, such as Mr. Reginald Reynolds, Miss Stock Kenyatta, Mr. George Padmore, have already been working on your lines for the emancipation of the colonial and coloured peoples.
 
 
 I want to say ‘Yes’. But I want to understand its implications.
 The greatest social problem of the modern world is the exploitation of the vast masses of agricultural people by the industrial peoples and countries through the unequal exchanges imposed upon the former by the latter through their control over the world markets and finance and imperialist machinery. Are we right in thinking that you stand for the abolition of this process of exploitation of the producers of primary commodities and the agricultural masses of the world?
Root and branch.
 Are we right in thinking that ours is only a part of the general struggle of colonial peoples against world capitalism and imperialism and that India is the vanguard in the world movement of colonial and agricultural masses for freedom, economic and political?
I hope so.
 Is it not our duty to allow Congressmen to join and work in local food councils and such other quasi-official organizations now that every detail of a person’s life has come within the price-controls, grain procurement and requisition and acquisition and rationing activities of Government, provided we feel satisfied that we can render some effective help to our masses or prevent mischief?
Yes. They ought to be allowed if they can do without loss of
initiative and independence and can really render effective help.
 What shall those peasants do whose Gandhi-Irwin salt privileges have been unjustly withdrawn or curtailed?
They should take the salt if it comes within the clause.
 Do you not recognize the need for students and their Students Congress to understand, popularize and act upon the ideology of the
I.N.C. consistently with their responsibilities as students?
 Of course they should study and understand all that. I have set forth the limitations in my “Hints”.

A lot of correspondence has been passing between Shri Phatak and Shri Barve of Dhulia, the President of the Maharashtra Sangh.

 I have carefully read your two letters. I will take the last sentence. I will assuredly not undertake a fast unless it is as clear to me as daylight [that it is my duty to do so]. Secondly, at whose call?—of the God of Truth or of the ego? If on the earlier occasion it was that of the God of Truth, so will it be this time, too. I have answers to all the other arguments. After declaring my intention to fast, I am examining myself. If any argument against the fast convinces me beyond the shadow of a doubt, I would give up my intention, but if ultimately I get a clear call from the God of Truth, nobody will be able to dissuade me. You may go on arguing, but please do not worry.  I should certainly be pleased to meet you, but it is not essential for us to meet over this problem. Leave me to the mercy of God.

 It is very good but it does not touch me because I have not been able fully to devote my mind to it. The entire constructive programme is the end. Negative non-co-operation is meant to achieve that end. The example of Christian missionaries would not help because the way to realizing God as Truth is different. I cannot describe that way. If someone can see it in my life, let him do so. Here fasting is very important. Natural death comes even to animals and birds as it comes to us. If you feel like writing something after reading this, do so. Send this back to me.

 DEAR FRIEND,
 Utmost frankness is a sure test of friendship. I therefore appreciate all your criticism, being that of a true friend.
 Gould you tell your audience in Dacca that  religious  strife should be impossible especially in a place which is a seat of learning? The influence of a university should travel beyond its four walls. Religion should be a binding, not a disruptive force. I need not elaborate this thought. It came to me as I was reading your letter.
 The late Charlie Andrews used to tell me of the good that some missionaries had done among the Frontier tribes. This was
 
 corroborated by Khan Saheb Abdul Ghaffar Khan. Your testimony therefore does not come upon me as a surprise.

Prayer is the only thing that matters. To do sincere work in the name of God is itself prayer. I say what I feel. There is not only one thing that  disturbs me today, there are several. I have only mentioned the thing that most perturbs me. If something else comes up, I shall not hesitate to say it. These have little to do with Congressmen. People today are engaged in fraud, black-marketing and amassing of wealth somehow. There is no end to the lies they mouth. Who can change their hearts? I do not know whether my fast will do so. I can only pray. God’s will be done. Nobody knows today what is going to happen. If everyone does his duty it is possible that the fast will not come off. One man cannot assume the whole burden, but the concerted effort of many people may bear fruit. Let everyone calmly do his work without being despondent or becoming agitated. This is all I ask for. God too will want no more. I am at peace.

I 		do wish, 		however, that all 		Indians learn both 		the scripts and 		speak a 		language which could be 		understood by 		both Hindus 		and Muslims.  The 		Hindi style and 		the Urdu style are 		like the Ganga and 		the Yamuna. 		Hindustani is like 		the Saraswati. It 		is concealed and 		yet not concealed. 		The Sabha should 		endeavour to 		make it clearly discernible.       It 		appears that, in 		1942, when 		the Hindustani Prachar 		Sabha was formed, 		you intended and directed your efforts that persons enrolling themselves as members  
  Hindustani 	Prachar Sabha will be 	complementary of 	both and 	will seek help from 	both. But 	its work will be 	distinct from 	theirs, which 	could also be regarded 	as the 	same. If 	the Sabha 	tried to undo 	the work of 	these two organizations, 	its own objective would be defeated. 	How can you have 	Saraswati without the 	confluence [of 	the three]?  The 	work of 	the Sabha 	will be, 	and should be, 	uniform all 	over the 	country. The 	procedure may 	be modified 	here and 	there to 	suit the 	differing needs of 	the provinces.  The 	new movement of 	the Hindustani 	Prachar Sabha should 	not create 	difficulties in the 	work of Rashtrabhasha 	Prachar Samiti, if the 	two co-ordinate their activities.

                        of 	the Hindustani Prachar Sabha must learn both the scripts of the 	Rashtrabhasha. Do 	you, even today, expect that thing only from the members, or do you 	want that everybody, both old and young in the country, must learn 	both the scripts?   Regarding 		the plan 		of work 		of Hindustani 		Prachar Sabha, some 		people understand 		that the 		Sabha aims at 		propagating both 		Hindi and Urdu 		but there 		are others 		who say that it 		aims at 		propagating neither 		Hindi nor Urdu but 		Hindustani. In 		1942, you 		were of opinion 		that the Saraswati 		in the 		shape of 		Hindustani had 		not yet made 		its appearance. Is 		the situation 		different at present? 		What is 		it that the Sabha 		will propagate if 		Hindustani has 		not yet made its appearance?  Under 		the auspices 		of the Hindi 		Sahitya Sammelan a 		number of 		institutions are 		working for 		the propagation of 		Hindi and 		the Devanagari script, 		and the Anjuman 		Taraqqi-e-Urdu for 		that of Urdu 		and the Persian script. 		Will the Hindustani 		Prachar Sabha be 		merely co-ordinating 		the activities 		of these 		two institutions 		or will 		it be 		complementary of 		the two? Or 		will it 		be a third 		body pursuing its 		own programme undoing 		the work of these two?  Will 		the policy 		and programme 		of the 		Hindustani Prachar 		Sabha with respect to 		South India and 		the non-Hindi provinces 		be the 		same as in the 		other provinces—that is, will the propagation of both the scripts be obligatory?  Will 		the new policy of 		the Hindustani 		Prachar Sabha create difficulties in 		continuing the 		propagation of 		Rashtrabhasha as 		it is being carried 		on in South 		India and the other non-Hindi provinces for the last so many years?

243,"November 	14, 1944",LETTER TO DURLAB SINGH,"
          SEVAGRAM, 
    DEAR 	SARDAR DURLAB SINGHlibtech_243_footnote, This 	is my answer to your questions: libtech_244_footnote  November 	14, 1944 
   My association with Rajaji in his formulalibtech_245_footnotelibtech_246_footnotecould not affect the Sikh 		position in the 		slightest degree, even 		if Quaid-e-Azam 		Jinnah accepted it. The Lahore Resolutionlibtech_247_footnotelibtech_248_footnoteof the Congress referred to by you 		stands. The 		result of 		Quaid-e-Azam Jinnah’s 		acceptance would have been that both of us would have gone to the Sikhs and others         
 interested to secure their acceptance. I had made this clear in my letterlibtech_249_footnoteto Masterjee.
  I 	cannot understand 	the Akali 	indignation. My 	meeting a 	deputation was 	unnecessary in 	view of 	my absolute assurance. 	If Masterjee had 	wanted to bring 	his friends 	to me, in spite of 	my assurance, 	I would 	have gladly seen them as 	I did 	other friends 	who sought 	clarification from me.  Maulana 	Saheb explained the 	implications of the 	Jagat Narain Lal’s Resolutionlibtech_250_footnotelibtech_251_footnotewhich please see. But supposing that  it  is 	inconsistent with 	the Rajaji Formula 	and the 	Congress accepts the latter, 	there is nothing 	to prevent 	the Congress 	from rescinding 	the Resolution.  How 	could I 	favour a 	contrary opinion when 	I have 	always given 	the closest 	collaboration to Sikh 	friends? Those 	Sikhs, who 	do not 	accept the 	Congress creed, 	naturally refrain, 	like many others, 	from joining the Congress.  I know nothing  about  the  Sikandarlibtech_252_footnotelibtech_253_footnote-Baldev  Singh 	 Pact, 	much less about the 	Congress High 	Command’s association 	with it. 	Nor do 	I know the 	details of 	the Azad 	Punjab scheme. 
 I could never be guilty of blessing anything which is con- trary to the national    interest.    You    can    certainly    have     the     assurance that the interests of the nationalist Sikhs, as also of all nationalists, are safe in my hands, also, I presume, in the Congress hands, though as you know I have no authority to speak on behalf of the Congress.
 There are many inventions about me going the round. I would warn friends against giving credence to any of them without reference to me.
 Yours sincerely,
 M. K. GANDHI

 Weeping and laughing come from the heart. When grieved one weeps. One must turn that grief into joy and laugh. Hence the need for Ramanama. Surrender all to Him and there is only joy.  Why grieve over the loss of hearing? You are saved from hearing a lot of drivel. What is relevant you get through the written word. Moreover I believe that if there is joy within, the ears will of themselves regain the power of hearing.

You should ask for a raise if you cannot make both ends meet. Otherwise choose some other vocation. If the money belongs to you, you should get an injunction from a court of law. In case I have

  	Since I had passed on your original letter to Bapa I did not reply 	to it. Ravishankar Maharaj gave me a copy of it and we also had  a 	talk. You certainly have my blessings. Your work is fine. And it was 	good that all of you participated in [raising] the contributions.  I 	suggest you should utilize the fresh amount you might have for 	whatever work you wish to do and not add it to the Memorial [Fund]. 	This will not create any difficulty and you will be able to utilize 	the entire sum locally. I am sure you have a local committee.

Should 	Mahadeva’s abode be in a grand mansion or in a simple place? In my 	humble opinion the noblest of ideas dwell in a simple temple. The 	courtyard is quite good as it is. Thousands of devotees will be able 	to worship Mahadeva under a simple roof. There is no urgency to 	build the temple just now. All that is needed is there. You should 	be happy    
 if a firm resolve is made and a vow taken to fulfil it.

  	I read your statement fully. Till this point I wrote in Hindi either 	inadvertently or because I was possessed by Hindi. Why is your 	statement in English? Your language too does not follow the English 	usage and hence sounds out of tune. Very few among us have a perfect 	command over English. And why must we? When we cannot do without it 	we may scribble some kind of English to express our thoughts. You 	want to place your thoughts before the Indian people. They should 	therefore be either in Gujarati (your mother tongue) or Hindi (the 	national language). This 	was only a point to note.  	What have you to do with a charter? Your own merit deserves to be 	your writ. Certainly, you don’t need State patronage. I think the 	[institutions at] Santiniketan are run without a licence and yet 	command  global  reputation.  Did  Vishnu  Digambarlibtech_267_footnoteever  obtain  a licence? And 	now the third point.  	Your statement is contrary to your new resolve. It smacks of 	Pakistan.

  	The sincerity of your letter is unmistakable. The leaders who are in 	jail are doing their duty by being there. A satyagrahi in prison 	never rots.

If we had the requisite strength, many of our leaders should 	not be today in jail. In its absence, we must strive with whatever 	measure of strength we may possess. I, therefore, like the idea of 	students abstaining from going to school on 9th, provided they 	devote the whole day to self-purification and service. There should 	be strictest adherence to truth and ahimsa in whatever they do. Mass 	civil disobedience is today in abeyance; rather, it was never 	started but the fight for independence shall go on so long as 	independence is not attained.  	Whatever your decision let the bounds of propriety be not 	transgressed and let the decision be taken after due consultation 	with your teachers and school management.

TEACHERS’ TRAINING
CAMPlibtech_277_footnote","
    
 SEVAGRAM,
 November 19, 1944
 At the request of Shrimati Ashadevi, Gandhiji delivered a short address to them on the 19th instant, to explain the meaning of New Education. He described in a few words how the Basic Education scheme was born. In 1937 when the Congress took up power for a short term, as it afterwards turned out, in seven out of the eleven Provinces they were confronted with the question of popular education. His advice was sought. Like many others, he had been dissatisfied with the present system of education. He felt that if education was to be linked with the living needs of the masses inhabiting the villages of India, it ought to be imparted through a basic craft. He had no practical experience of agriculture. But he was saturated with the idea of the charkha which he had identified with village life. He, therefore, suggested that it should be used as a medium for the children’s education. The idea appealed to Shri Aryanayakum, Shrimati Ashadevi and Dr. Zakir Husain and through their effort the Hindustani Talimi Sangh was founded.
 Originally this New Education was intended to cover only the first seven years of a child’s education, viz., from the seventh to the fourteenth year. The experiment had already completed six years and was now entering upon the seventh. As a result of further thought, he had come to the conclusion that this education should cover the whole of life from the moment of conception to the moment of death.
 Referring to the prayer which had been recited at the beginning of the proceedings, he observed:
 There are several things in this prayer which are worthy of your note but I want to draw your attention to that particular portion of it which pledged the reciter to adherence to Truth in speech and action under all circumstances and at all times. One mantra means: “Lead me from untruth to Truth, from darkness to Light, from death to Immortality.” Similarly the Islamic prayer, which has just been recited is an outpouring of the soul for Light and for being guided on to the straight path of Truth and Righteousness. This quest for Truth is the Alpha and Omega of all education.
 After finishing your training here you will go back to your respective Provinces to propagate this New Education. You will  keep this ideal of devotion to Truth before you. Your work will be that of pioneers. There will be no one to help or guide you with his previous experience. You shall have to grope your way all by yourselves. It is, therefore, not an easy task that you have before you. Then this New
 
 Education will not help you to get big jobs carrying high salaries and emoluments. But yours will be the privilege to go among and serve the villagers in their villages. Palatial buildings and costly equipment can, therefore, have no place in your scheme of work. The school of my conception is one where classes are held in the open under the shade of a tree. I know that it cannot be realized at present. Some shelter will be necessary, perhaps always for protection against the sun, wind and rain. True education can only be given under conditions of utmost simplicity.
 Pointing to the building in which they were assembled, he continued:
 All the buildings here in the Talimi Sangh are built of local material and with the help of local artisans. We have thereby established a living link between ourselves and the people. That by itself is an education for the people and constitutes the foundation of our future educational work.
 If you thoroughly assimilate this ideal of simplicity and its importance in the New Education, you will have justified your training here. You will then appreciate your work.
 That work consists of cleaning up. Cleanliness of the mind and body is the first step in education. Prayer does for the purification of the mind what the bucket and the broom do for the cleaning up of your physical surroundings. That is why we always commence our proceedings with prayer. No matter whether the prayer we recite is the Hindu prayer or the Muslim or the Parsi, its function is essentially the same, namely, purification of the heart. God has innumerable names but the most beautiful and suitable in my opinion is Truth. Let Truth, therefore, rule every action of our life, be it ever so insignificant. Let every morsel of food that we eat be sanctified with His name and consecrated to His service. If we eat only to sustain the body as an instrument of His service not only will it make our bodies and minds healthy and clean, the inner cleanliness will be reflected in our surroundings also. We must learn to make our latrines as clean as our kitchens.
 As with the individual so with society. A village is but a group of individuals and the world, as I see it, is one vast village and mankind one family. The various functions in the human body have their parallel in the corporate life of society. What I have said about the inner and outer cleanliness of the individual, therefore, applies to the whole society. In the mighty world, man, considered as an animal, occupies but an insignificant place. Physically, he is a contemptible worm. But God has endowed him with intellect and the faculty of discrimination between good and evil. If we use this faculty to know
 God we become a power for good. Abuse of that talent converts us into an instrument of evil, so that we become like a scourge and a plague and fill this earth with strife and bloodshed and unhappiness and misery.
 The struggle between the forces of good and evil is ceaseless and eternal. The former have truth and ahimsa as weapons against the letter’s falsehood, violence and brute force. There is nothing more potent in the universe than God’s name. If we enthrone Him in our hearts and keep Him there always, we shall know no fear and lay for ourselves rich treasure in life.

  	When I saw in the papers months ago a reference to a lawyer 	brilliantly arguing his case before the Federal Court, I never knew 	that you had the honour to own that lawyer as your son. May his 	marriage be a blessing to him and his future wife. I congratulate 	her on her choice.

  November 	22, 1944   BHAI 	JYOTI,  	Your letter is fine. Obviously what you say is correct. I also know 	that the Bungalow has changed hands. I have raised only a question 	of dharma.libtech_293_footnoteIf 	you sell the property I shall have to bear it without a word.  	Who is Keshubhai? I cannot understand why Qureshi should turn 	inimical. I am writing to him.  	I consider it intolerable that anyone should disfigure the Bungalow. 	I should also consider it wrong on the part of anyone who 	appropriates the Bungalow. Arrange, if you can, for the property to 	cease to be negotiable. But you may sell it if it will safeguard 	Champa’s interests and if you think that it will not tarnish 	Doctor’s name. I have a letter from Maganbhai of which I am 	sending you a    
 copy. Just now I am not in a position to arbitrate.

329,"November 	27, 1944","STATEMENT TO THE
PRESSlibtech_315_footnote","
          SEVAGRAM, 
  November 	27, 1944  	At present, the Hindustani prachar work is being carried on 	in Gujarat by Shri Amritlal Nanavati. This work is in accordance 	with the scheme prepared by Kakasaheb in consultation with me.  	Hindi prachar work is being conducted by the Rashtrabhasha 	Prachar  Samiti, Wardha, appointed by the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan. 	Both these activities are supposed to be undertaken for spreading 	the national language. I regard myself as the founder of the 	Hindustani Prachar Sabha. In 1925, the resolution about Hindustani 	was passed at the Cawnpore session of the Indian National Congress. 	But no attempt was made to act upon the resolution. The Hindustani 	Prachar Sabha was, therefore, established in Wardha on the 2nd May, 	1942. The Sabha has defined Hindustani as follows:  Hindustani 	is that language which the Hindus, Muslims and all other people of 	villages and towns in Northern India speak, understandand use for 	mutual intercourse, which is written and read in both the Nagari and 	the Persian scripts, and the literary forms of which are recognized 	today as Hindi and Urdu.libtech_316_footnote  	But before the work of the Sabha could be started properly, many 	people of the country, including the founders of the Sabha, were 	thrust into jails on account of  the  August  Resolutionlibtech_317_footnotelibtech_318_footnoteof 	 the Congress. Shri Nanavati was not in jail, and he felt that he 	should start the Hindustani prachar work. In my opinion he 	has  served  the  country by doing this work.  	Hindi and Urdu are the two literary styles of the same national 	language. These two styles are, at present, diverging from each 	other. From the point of view of Rashtrabhasha—Hindustani—it 	is necessary to bring these two styles nearer to each other. Without 	the knowledge of both these styles and the scripts this is 	impossible to achieve.      
 The venom of Hindu-Muslim differences has entered the sphere of language as well. I have been possessed with the idea of Hindu-Muslim unity ever since my childhood. In order to eliminate this poison of disunity in the domain of language, it is necessary to learn both the styles and the scripts. If the Congress desires to conduct its work without English—and this must be done—it is the duty of each Congressman to learn both the styles and the scripts. This will result in the happy fusion of Hindi and Urdu, and the language that will thus evolve will be the natural Hindustani.
 A question is asked whether the enthusiasm for learning both the styles and the scripts should be among both the Hindus and Muslims or only in one of them. A misunderstanding lurks behind this question. Those who make progress in the knowledge of languages will stand to gain: those who do not will be the losers. Moreover, he who cherishes unity will take special pains to know both the styles and the scripts. It should also be remembered that, in provinces like the Punjab, the Hindus, Muslims and all others know only Urdu. To know at least this much is the duty of every patriot. In  a vast country like India, the more languages we strive to learn the better equipped shall we become for national service.
 Should both the scripts and the styles be learnt by national workers and Congressmen only or by all?
 My answer to this question is that all Indians should become Congressmen, and thus everybody should learn both the styles and the scripts. In fact, the very question is irrelevant, because only a very limited number of men and women have so far developed this hobby of learning the national language. We cannot go into raptures over the fact that a few thousands or a few lakhs of people appear at the Rashtrabhasha examinations. Even the number of persons in the non-Hindi and non-Urdu areas who desire to learn only Hindi or Urdu is not sufficient to satisfy our ambition.
 Is it not enough that those who desire to learn Urdu should do so through the Anjumanlibtech_319_footnoteand those who desire to learn Hindi should do so through the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan?
 Not at all. It was precisely because of this that the Congress passed the resolution on Hindustani and the need of establishing the Hindustani Prachar Sabha was felt. The scopes of both the institutions (Sammelan and Anjuman) are restricted, and from my point of view, narrow as well. It is my cherished desire that both these sister institutions should co-operate with each other. When that auspicious
 
 day will really dawn, the work of the Hindustani Prachar Sabha will be deemed to be over. So long as this situation does not arise, the Hindustani Prachar Sabha should continue to perform its duty. I do hope that these two sister associations will not only tolerate but also welcome this third sister institution which seeks to establish unity between them.
 In Gujarat many workers who are at present engaged in Hindi and Hindustani prachar work are my colleagues. Some of them have sought my guidance. This statement is my guidance to them. If those who are working for the Wardha Samiti of the  Hindi  Sahitya Sammelan agree with my views on Hindustani prachar, they should take up this work as well. They can certainly teach and coach for the Sammelan examinations those students who desire to learn only the Hindi style and the Devanagari script. But they themselves should popularize both the styles and the scripts and should also try to persuade as many persons as they can to do the same. So far as language is connected with the welfare of the nation, I regard Hindustani prachar work to be most essential. There should never develop any conflict between the two activities (of Hindi and Hindustani).
 Now a question arises as to  what  should  be  done  by  those who have so far learnt or may learn in future only Hindi or only Urdu.Such persons should learn the other style or script and sit for the Hindustani examinations which are to be conducted in  both  the scripts. Those who have already learnt one style and script will find it very easy to answer the question papers.

She is training a 	few girls, and she will carry on as she thinks right.  	Thinking about a board of trustees I see that any scheme coming from 	outside will necessarily have to be examined. So there will have to 	be a board. I am considering its final form. You too should think 	over it and write to me. The onslaught of Ayurveda,  	homoeopathy, etc., is crushing.

 You are going not only to have your ears treated but for nature cure in a wider sense. My opinion is that your deafness is closely connected with the state of your mind. Nature cure includes mental activity. In this sense uttering Ramanama, reading the Gita, and so on, are part of nature cure. Perhaps Rajuji’slibtech_331_footnotelibtech_332_footnotecentre will provide this. I have a feeling that Raju looks at nature cure in a spiritual way. You too should make such an effort. Give up all other thoughts. Go there determined that you will be cured and you will get back your hearing. Take the treatment that Raju advises and eat what he says you should. Do some reading and writing. Leave all thoughts of Vidya, Father, Mother, myself and Mahadev (son). You will be doing good to them all by giving up their thought. Detachment will help cure your ears. Do not think about the ears. Think about work. Try and remove the shortcomings you notice in Raju’s centre. Get to know the patients there. Speak to Gokhale or Babaji. Learn the Gita from them. Learn Telugu. We from the North neglect the four Southern languages. It is  a great mistake. In short you are going to Andhra for a new life. You must give there what you have taken from here and you have to bring here what you find there. Do spinning and  other  allied  work regularly. What more? God is with you.

350,"November 28, 1944",INTERVIEW TO N. G. RANGA,"
    
 November 28, 1944
 At the second interviewlibtech_333_footnoteProf. Ranga placed before Gandhiji two alternative proposals for the re-organization of the Kisan Sabhas and their co-ordination with the Congress organization. They were:
  To 	include in the kisan 	councils that 	may be formed one-third 	representation from 	corresponding Congress Committees. This would secure for 	them the 	co-operation and 	the advice of 	the Congress. (a) 	To adopt 	Congress membership as 	a basic 	membership for the kisan 
 organization.
  To 	constitute kisan 	councils out 	of rural delegates to the Congress 	Committees elected as 	per the present 	constitution. Such kisan 	councils would be 	part of the 	Congress Committees while 	retaining their 	separate Corporate 	existence for dealing 	with the problems 	relating to the kisans.  In 	addition to Congress 	members some non-Congress 	but not 	anti-Congress members 	also might 	be taken 	on the 	kisan councils 	to provide 	a suitable representation. 
 He felt that the first formula would be more acceptable than the second to most Kisan Sabhaites. The final clause in the second formula too had the same object in view, namely, to make it acceptable to them.
 GANDHIJI: But this is a variation upon what you suggested last time. Then you suggested that the Kisan Sabha will have no member who is not a member of the Congress also.
 PROF. RANGA : We want to have in our organization some non Congress kisans also who are not anti-Congress but for various reasons could not afford to join the Congress.
 GANDHIJI: Why do you want that? You said that you did not want anything in opposition to the Congress. So, if you have for your members only Congressmen, the kisan organization will deal with matters relating to the rights of kisans as against landlords and employers. It won’t deal with political questions. I thought that I could reconcile myself to it. I said I approached it with hesitation while it was for you to dispel my doubts. So you better stick to your original proposal.
 PROF. RANGA : It has been forcibly brought home to us that the Congress people feel nervous about this double membership. So I thought the Kisan Sabha had better remain as a distinct body. Our workers are used to that idea. I have been able to
 
 persuade them that so far as politics is concerned we must accept Congress leadership. The idea is that after the Congress elections are over the rural delegates will form themselves into a kisan council. This kisan council will deal with matters relating to the kisans and in politics accept the lead of the Congress.
 GANDHIJI: My suggestion is this. You have your  own organization where you register all the kisans. As soon as the kisan becomes your member, he becomes also a Congress member. Matters particularly bearing on the kisans and their relationship with the landlords, etc., are then tackled by your organization while political matters will be tackled by the Congress.
 PROF. RANGA: In that case may we retain one anna for the kisan council out of the Congress membership fee of four annas?
 GANDHIJI: You can do that subject to Congress approval. This would mean that the Congress allows a gratuity of one anna to you for doing this special work. If I were at the head of Congress affairs I would certainly allow it.
 PROF. RANGA : In the mean time may we start with one-anna membership from now on the clear understanding that those who are now enrolled are to become members of the Congress as soon as the Congress organization again begins to function? Or we can take five annas from each member now and out of it keep four annas in trust for the Congress.
 GANDHIJI: I am afraid you cannot do it today. You must do it openly or not at all. Do not collect the four annas Congress membership fee in advance. I will suggest a better plan which I recommended to Shrimati Rama Devi. Have a register of workers  only. Don’t have Congress members just now.
 PROF. RANGA: Can’t we have something like  a  Congress  Seva  Sangh,  an  ad hoc body of Congress workers but not Congress members, to carry out Congress work?
 GANDHIJI: Yes, you may do that. But seeing that ours is a non-violent body their work will only be to carry on the fifteen-fold constructive programme. That will avoid tussle with the Communists also. Today you are not working for power but as Congress servants. If you carry on your work silently and unostentatiously you become irresistible. No one will come in unless he wants to work with you. There will be no eloquence or Press publicity to attract power seekers.
 PROF. RANGA: Eloquence by itself, I admit, is no good but has it not its use when coupled with solid public work?
 GANDHIJI: Work by itself is eloquence. Here there are workers in Khadi Vidyalaya, Hindustani Talimi Sangh and the Gram Seva Sangh, working themselves to death. They make no speeches. They speak to the villagers through their activity.
 
 PROF. RANGA: As regards the Communists they have done a lot of harm so far as kisan work is concerned and as a result have become very unpopular. There are two kisan organizations in Andhra, one Congress-minded, the other Communist. So far as we are concerned we keep the Communists out of our organization.
 GANDHIJI: You won’t be able to keep anybody out of primary membership by merely making rules. But you can keep out trouble if you work on the lines I have indicated.

  	I have had a talk with Rajaji. The position is as I have explained, 	namely, that the Princes can preserve their independence and 	Pakistan can exist only if British power remains. How can I tolerate 	this? It means that a part of India can be independent, and the 	British rule will continue in the States ruled by the Princes and in 	the Muslim majority Provinces. I can never be a willing witness to 	this. I cannot understand how you can be. You may, if you wish, meet 	Rajaji and seek clarification. I have stated here the position as I 	have understood it.

 You understand the matter correctly. Maybe, I should proceed in the same direction. In support of my action I quote the fasts in the past that were universally praised. But I should not waver if they were found to be wrongly undertaken or not fully justifiable. It is my firm conviction that even from a purely modern point of view fasting has an important place. It is as much necessary for the atman that takes on a body as for the body itself. If in the process the body drops that should be no reason at all for grieving. Nevertheless I should like to read whatever Nathjilibtech_365_footnotelibtech_366_footnotemay write.

370,"December 1, 1944",ADDRESS TO A.I.S.A. TRUSTEES,"
    
 SEVAGRAM,
 December 1, 1944libtech_372_footnote
 I am sorry to say that I am physically not so fit and fresh as I had expected to be and that I have decided to take complete rest for four weeks commencing from the 4th December in order that I may be able threafter to take up the work more energetically. However, I warn the members not to take pity on me and spare me in the deliberations.
 Shri Jajuji, the General Secretary of the Sangh, has discussed with melibtech_373_footnotethe future policy of the Sangh in all its aspects for seven days devoting one hour daily to it The gist of those discussions has been sent to the members of the Board and other prominent khadi workers in the form of a circular letter. Replies thereto have been received from a number of members and they are all before the Board for their consideration.
 The chief thing that I want the members to consider is that so far the Sangh work was directed from the Central Office, but henceforth the work is to be decentralized and any province or district which wants to be autonomous is to be allowed to do so. Workers must be prepared to go to organize such autonomous centres with the prestige and moral support of the Sangh. The worker will be paid a maintenance for five years on an annually diminishing scale.  He should work there according to the fundamental principles and policy laid down by the Sangh. It is not possible otherwise to decentralize the work in seven lakhs of villages.
 There are two schools of thought current in the world. One wants to divide the world into cities and the other into villages. The village civilization and the city civilization are totally different things. One depends on machinery and industrialization, the other rests on handicraft. We have given preference to the latter. After all, this industrialization and large-scale production are only of comparatively recent growth. We do not know how far it has contributed to our development and happiness, but we know this much that it  has  brought in its wake the recent world wars. This second world war is not still over and even before it comes to an end we are hearing of a third world war.
 
 Our country was never so unhappy and miserable as it is at present. In the cities people may be getting big profits and good wages, but all that has become possible by sucking the blood of villagers.
 We do not want to collect lakhs and crores. We do not always want to depend on money for our work. If we  are  prepared  to sacrifice our lives for the cause, money is nothing. We must have faith and we must be true to ourselves. If we have these, we shall be able to decentralize our capital of thirty lakhs in the villages to create national wealth amounting to three hundred crores. To do that, the main thing that is necessary is to make the village self-sufficient and self-reliant. But mind you, my idea of self-sufficiency is not a narrow one. There is no scope for selfishness or arrogance in my self-sufficiency. I am not preaching isolation. We have to be humble as dust for a cause. We have to mix with people even as sugar mixes itself with milk. Though the villagers will be self-sufficient so far as it is possible, they will devote their time also to their intellectual development for the creation of the consciousness for the contemplated non-violent society of the future.
 Cloth stands second to food as necessity. If every village begins to produce its own cloth, its strength will greatly be enhanced. But to achieve that we do not want to close down the textile factories by legislation. We want to achieve our purpose by revolutionizing the psychology of the people. By decentralization we want to produce cloth wherever cotton is grown.
 But what of the city people who have taken to khadi now? I would ask them to spin their own yarn and to find out for themselves weavers to weave that yarn into cloth.
 It is absurd that the cloth should come from Manchester for the poor, who produce cloth for Bombay people. It is also not proper to compel the poor to accept part of their wages in the form of khadi. They should be so educated that they may Spin voluntarily and intelligently and may use with love and pride the cloth produced by them. If the people of Bombay want to wear khadi they should spin for themselves or get their children and other dependents to spin. If people pledged to khadi, spin for themselves, the practice will be contagious. Even if we are able to produce khadi worth ten crores instead of one crore as at present our object of reaching the whole of India will not be achieved.
 Gandhiji then read out the resolutionlibtech_374_footnotewhich he wanted the Board to consider and adopt. Whilst explaining its implications he said:
 The workers of all our five constructive programme institutions (Charkha Sangh, Gram Udyog Sangh, Hindustani Talimi Sangh, Harijan Sevak Sangh, Goseva Sangh) should possess such knowledge that the politics of the whole country may be guided by them.
 Today we are all the while thinking that our work will be able to make headway only when Rajaji becomes the Prime Minister of Madras. But that is not proper. In our present politics we are looking with longing eyes to the Viceroy’s Secretariat but if we do our work properly the Viceroy will have to come to us. He will see our work and realize that it is not possible to keep such people in subjection or to rule over them. When seven lakhs of villages will take up this work in the new spirit we shall not remain a subject nation. Each one of our villages will be independent and self-reliant. That is true swaraj and that is true democracy. I do not worry when we shall be able to attain our goal, but if we are sure of our path and if we have faith that it is the only true one, we should go on striving for it incessantly and uninterruptedly.

371,"December 	1, 1944",STATEMENT TO THE PRESS,"
          SEVAGRAM, 
  December 	1, 1944  	That ‘man proposes and God disposes’ constantly proves true in 	my case, as I expect it does in every case whether we realize it or 	not. I was contemplating a food fast for reasons I hold to be 	entirely spiritual. But for the time being, it is being replaced by 	a day-to-day-work fast. I had hoped that I had recovered 	sufficiently to be able to go through the routine work without 	interruption. But nature’s warning has been sounding in my ears 	during the last ten days. I was feeling fatigued. Even after the 	noonday siesta, the brain seemed tired. There was a complete 	disinclination to speak or write. But I continued hoping that I 	would be all right without having to discontinue mental activity.  	But nature would have her way. Rajaji who saw me after a month 	detected a marked change in my face, and he said, ‘You must stop 	all    
 this ceaseless mental activity if you want to avoid a disaster.’ I seized the suggestion. He even went so far as to say that I should not mind disappointing invited workers of the Charkha Sangh, although I was looking forward eagerly to meeting them and discussing with them my plan for a new orientation of khadi work. But I would not listen. So I am going through these meetings in the best manner I can in the hope that no crisis will overtake me during the remaining two days of these meetings.
 From the 4th to the 31st of this month, I have decided rigidly to discontinue all public activities, all interviews for public or private purposes and all correspondence of any nature whatsoever. I shall read no newspapers during the period. This abstention will be subject to exception for unforeseen circumstances of a grave nature.
 I shall not deny myself the pleasure of reading non-political literature in which I am interested. This also I shall read without in any way unduly taxing the brain. I have asked friends who were expecting to see me during the month to indulgently postpone their visits for the time being.
 Let readers not be alarmed at what is only a precautionary measure. Dr. Sushila Nayyar assures me that there is nothing physically wrong with me except that my old friends, the hookworms and the amoebae, have not left me. I am able to take daily walks without the slightest strain and they will be continued. I had hoped to make one or two public statements in connection with a lot of misrepresentations of my views and doings about the communal question and some other public questions. I must forbear for the time being. But I must repeat the warning I have given before, that nothing that is not authoritatively stated by me should be accepted by the public. There are things which I have seen in the Press which I can only say I am incapable of having  countenanced  directly  or indirectly.
 There are some vital questions addressed to me by correspondents. They will forgive me for my inability to deal with them for the moment. If, after a month, they still feel the necessity, they will please repeat their letters and if all goes well, I shall gladly reply. Starvation of millions, black markets, and what I cannot but describe as gambling, will continue to worry me as they do now. I can but entreat my numerous co-workers to do what they can to ease the situation, which can be done, I am perfectly sure, if those concerned will make up their minds that the claims of the famishing millions are the first charge on their care and attention.

  	I have made arrangements for a watch for you. You will get it soon. 	I have read all your letters. You have been doing fine work. God 	will bless you with success.  	You will soon get lots of drugs, but they will not be very helpful. 	So long as water, fire and earth are available, drugs are not 	necessary.  	Give the people boiled water to drink. This will cure most of the 	complaints. Use soda [bicarb] if you have it. Water containing soda 	will stop diarrhoea. Food should be stopped. Persuade the people 	patiently to stop eating. You may even let them die who do not 	listen to you. Search for village medicinal herbs. You must have 	neem trees there. If you persuade the people to chew its 	leaves and see that they fast, the fever will probably disappear. 	Boil neem leaves in water and wash the blisters with that. 	The water should be bearably hot. Cover the blisters with a mud-pack 	of clean earth. Get clean cloth for bandaging the blisters. If you 	can get tamarind you can  give  a  solution of it in place of water 	mixed with lemon juice.  Revive people’s knowledge of nature-cure 	remedies. Local medicinal drugs should be made available. Give rice 	water instead of milk. If you mix jaggery with it, it will provide 	more energy. Teach people the rules of hygiene. If food is stopped 	to people suffering from fever  or  diarrhoea and they are put on 	boiled water, more than fifty per cent of the cases will recover. I 	have no doubt in my mind about this at all. Fifty per cent is a 	conservative guess. For guinea worm,  try fomentation with hot water 	and tie up the thing as it comes out. Try also a poultice of onions. 	You must have received the suggestions sent by Kishorelalbhai and 	Sushilabehn. I have suggested only the simplest remedies. Let 	Devibehn send whatever she wishes. If cows, buffaloes or goats are 	offered, accept them. To meateaters you may unhesitatingly give 	meat-soup. Soup means water in which meat has been boiled. These 	things should be served hot after boiling them. This is not the time 	for doing our religious duty of propagating vegetarianism. Soup is 	bound to be useful where milk is not available.

  	I had known it even earlier that my Muslim friends who are not with 	the League were a little angry with me because I went to Bombay to 	talk with Jinnah Saheb and did not talk with them. As I  have 	already written to you earlier, I can never be unfaithful to the 	Muslims or Islam. I had never thought that I would have any 	settlement with Jinnah Saheb which would be against the interests of 	my Muslim friends who have joined me in making sacrifices or which 	would harm the genuine interests of any community in India. Had any 	such situation arisen, I would have certainly consulted some of you.  	I was distressed to learn that some of my Muslim friends think that 	in my friendliness with Jinnah Saheb I have ignored them. That 	certainly is not the case. It must be accepted that the majority of 	the Muslim community belongs to the Muslim League whose Quaid-e-Azam 	is Jinnah Saheb. It must also be accepted that he is opposed to our 	line of action. That is why I wished that either he should convert 	me to his course or I should convert him to mine, and if this could 	be done, the Hindus and Muslims would march together to freedom. I 	failed in my attempt. I wish that Maulana Sabeb and certain other 	friends, particularly Maulvi Hafizur Rehman Saheb,  Mufti 	Kifayatullah Saheb and Maulana Syed Ahmed Saheb would take the 	trouble of meeting me here. I would try to clear their doubts. We 	can all work together and pray to God to show us the straight path 	to freedom. If all of you cannot come, it would be enough if only     
 Maulana Saheb comes. Or, Maulvi Hafizur Rehman Saheb who is the secretary of the Jamiat may come. Please convey my regards to all the friends.

     MY 	DEAR KALLENBACHlibtech_386_footnote,  December 	3, 1944 
  	Manilal will give you all the news about me. I hope you are doing 	well. I send you these lines to tell you that the Phoenix Trustlibtech_387_footnote      
 requires complete overhauling.
 There are now no settlers. Therefore the clause about them should go. There is no formal resignation or withdrawal by them. If the law requires it, a formal resignation should be secured from each one of them. Perhaps their physical withdrawal amounts  to  resignation.
The following new trustees may be added:
Manilal, Jalbhailibtech_388_footnotelibtech_389_footnote, Medhlibtech_390_footnote
 Manilal should be the managing trustee and the manager of the Settlement, including Indian Opinion. He should draw from the Trust
 £100 per month for the maintenance of his family and children and live on the land free of rent with the right to use for his household the fruits, vegetables and cereals grown on the Settlement. He should maintain proper books of account in connection with the Settlement and Indian Opinion. He should be free, subject to its being no additional burden on the Settlement, to remove Indian Opinion partly or wholly to Durban.
 Such changes as may be necessary may be made in the Trust-Deed. In the event of my death before the Deed is prepared and signed by me, this letter may be treated by the present trustees as authority for the changes herein suggested.

 MY DEAR LOWER HOUSE,
 I hope you are keeping well and fit even as I am. Don’t worry over the threatened fast.libtech_392_footnoteIf it comes, it will  come  from  God.  And where is the cause for worry when a thing is from God?
 I had a discussion with Manilal and Jalbhai when he was here.
This is the result.
 Three new trustees should be added. Jalbhai, Medh and Manilal. Manilal should be the manager of the settlement in my place. He is managing Indian Opinion and everything at present and drawing his
 
 
 expenses. I think and he agrees that he should draw for himself and his family a fixed sum per month, say £100. The budget of expenses for the settlement should be prepared annually and passed by the Board.
 There should be a clause added giving the trustees authority to sell the proceeds to be utilized for the objects of the trust.
 If a Kasturba memorial is to be founded, on the  Phoenix  ground, it should be properly secured.
 If you, the remaining trustees, approve of my suggestions, an amended deed may be prepared and sent to me for my signature. Should I die before my signature is taken, this letter should be used by the trustees as my wish in the matter. I hope that they will give effect to it and free Manilal from the uncertainty that hangs over him.
 I feel too that those settlers who are not working on the settlement, although they may be deemed to have resigned, should formally do so, to avoid future complications.

I did not consider Mavalankar an outsider. You may 	appoint whatever committee you wish for the running of the Kasturba 	Trust. The rules are formulated with a view to safeguarding the 	Trust, the purpose being that the money should be spent according to 	its objectives. It may be said that all parties are, or rather no 	party is, represented on the Trust. Individuals have contributed on 	their own behalf whatever they wanted. We should, in view of this, 	appoint a committee comprising men of all shades of opinion. Indeed, 	whoever is appointed on the committee should be in his or her own 	right a representative of India’s village women. It will be proper 	only when all work done in this spirit. Then alone shall we be able 	to utilize the one crore rupees for our village sisters. There is no 	place for  distinction between rich and poor, Congressmen and non-    
 Congressmen. I indeed desire that a Congressman should harbour no hatred in this heart. All our actions should be based upon love and truth.
 You may read out this letter to all the men and women. Please understand it is my earnest wish that there should he no bitterness whatsoever.

But you must develop the ability to get along with Aryanayakum and Ashadevi. I am in no hurry.

 Yes, I consider it very essential that you acquire complete mastery of carding. Start [learning] it in the Khadi Vidyalaya after taking permission from both of them. You have already been given one responsibility, haven’t you? Do you want another person besides Anantramji?

On such occasions we should search 	our hearts and cleanse it of all impurity. We should know that     
 God is one, whether we call Him Ishwara or Khuda, and that His commands are the same for all. We should not harm others for what we regard as Truth or right. We should be prepared to die for Truth and when the call comes give our life for it and sanctify it with our blood. This in my view is the essence of all religions. On this day we should ponder upon this and remember that Jesus mounted the Cross for what he considered to be the Truth.

410,"November 20, 1944","A THOUGHT FOR
THE DAYlibtech_411_footnote","
    
 November 20, 1944
 Innumerable are the names of God; but if a choice were to be made of one, it would be Sat or Satya, that is, Truth. Hence verily Truth is God.
 November 21, 1944
 Realization of Truth is not at all possible without ahimsa. That is why it has been said that ahimsa is the supreme dharma.
 November 22, 1944
 The quest of truth and the observance of non-violence are impossible without brahmacharya, non-stealing, non-possession, fearlessness, equal respect for all religions, removal of untouchability and the like.
 November 23, 1944
 Brahmacharya here mean control over the sense-organs—in thought, word and deed. One who, while remaining bodily chaste, is impure at heart shall not be deemed a true brahmachari.
 November 24, 1944
 Non-stealing does not mean mere abstention from theft. To  keep or take what one does not need is also stealing. And of course stealing is fraught with violence.
 November 25, 1944
 Non-possession means that we should not hoard anything that we do not need today.
 November 26,1944
 Fearlessness should connote absence of all kinds of fear—fear of death, fear of bodily injury, fear of hunger, fear of insult, fear of public disapprobation, fear of ghosts and evil spirits, fear of anyone’s anger. Freedom from all these and such other fears constitutes fearlessness.
 November 27,1944
Let us respect other religions even as we respect our own. Mere
 
 tolerance thereof is not enough.
 November 28, 1944
 Removal of untouchability means not merely touching the Harijans, but also looking upon them as our own kith and kin; in other words, treating them in the same way as we would our own brothers and sisters. None is high, none low.
 November 29, 1944
 Yogah Chittavrittinirodhah—This is the first aphorism of Patanjali’s  Yoga Darshanlibtech_412_footnotelibtech_413_footnote.  Yoga is controlling the activities  of  the mind. Restraining the surging passions, suppressing them, that is yoga.
 November 30, 1944
 How can one is whose mind passions keep surging ever realize truth? The upsurge of passions in the mind is like a tempest in the ocean. The helmsman who holds fast to the helm in a storm remains safe. Likewise, he triumphs who relies upon  Ramanama  when  the mind is restless.
 December 1, 1944
 The  bhajan  “Take  Thou  a  Lesson  from  the  Tree”libtech_414_footnoteis  worth laying to one’s heart. The tree bears the heat of the sun, yet provides cool shade to us. What do we do?
 December 2, 1944
 Let us always beware of false knowledge. That which keeps or turns us away from Truth is false knowledge.
 December 3, 1944
 For the realization of Truth it is necessary to read the lives of the saints and reflect upon them.
 December 4, 1944
 Against whom shall we harbour enmity when God Himself says that He dwells in all living beings? (Translation of today’s bhajan.)
 December 5, 1944
 The great lesson that we learn from the life of Mirabai is that she renounced her all—even her husband—for the sake of God.
 December 6, 1944
 What can a person not accomplish by faith? He can do everything.
 December 7, 1944
Man can overcome mountains by faith.
 
 December 8, 1944
 He who concentrates on any one thing with singleness of purpose, will ultimately acquire the capacity to do everything.
 December 9, 1944
 True happiness does not come from without; it comes from within.
   He who loses his 	individuality loses all.  December 	10, 1944   December 	11, 1944 
  	The straight path is as difficult as it is simple. Were it not so, 	all would follow the straight path.  December 	12, 1944  	“Compassion is the essence of religion,” so Tulsidas has said. 	And he adds: “Abandon not compassion as long as you live.” 	Suppliants for compassion ourselves, all of us, how shall we take 	compassion, and on whom?  December 	13, 1944  	A sister said: “I used to pray, but have now given it up.” I 	asked: “Why?” She replied: “Because I used to deceive myself.” 	The reply is of course correct. But let her give up deceiving. Why 	give up praying?  December 	14, 1944  	Yesterday’s bhajan was very melodious and worth pondering 	over. It says in essence: God dwells neither in the temple, nor in 	the mosque. Neither within, nor without. If at all He is anywhere, 	it is in the hunger and the thirst of the humble folk. Let us spin 	daily in order to sate their hunger and quench their thirst, or, 	with Ramanama on our lips, engage ourselves in some such labour for 	their sake.  December 	15, 1944  	Why is it that even ordinarily we do not escape untruth be it out of 	fear or even shame? Would it not be better to adopt silence instead, 	or, shedding fear of one another, speak frankly what is in our mind?  December 	16, 1944 Even 	a little untruth ruins a man, as a drop of poison ruins milk.  December 	17, 1944  	We are loath to devote time to things that matter, but hanker after 	worthless things and find pleasure in them!!!  December 	18, 1944  	“Man is not God; call him not that. But of Divine refulgence he 
 is part.”
 December 19, 1944
 Listen to the discourses of the sages, study the  scriptures,  become learned. But if you have not enthroned God in your heart, you have achieved nothing.

 We all desire muktilibtech_415_footnotebut, perhaps, we do not know precisely what it means. Deliverance from the cycle of birth and death is one of its several meanings.
 December 21, 1944
 The poet-saint Narsinh says: “A  man of God seeks not deliverance from birth and death; he asks to be born  again and again.” Viewed from this angle, mukti takes on a somewhat different form.
 December 22, 1944
 Extreme non-attachment is salvation, according to the Gita, and we find the same meaning given in the first verse of the Ishopanishad.
 December 23, 1944
 How to develop non-attachment? This can be done by regarding joy and sorrow, friend and foe, mine and thine, as all alike. Thus another name for non-attachment is equanimity.
 December 24, 1944
 As drops add up to make the ocean, we can be friendly and become an ocean of friendliness. The world would be transformed if everyone in the world lived in a spirit of mutual amity.
 December 25, 1944
 Today is Christmas Day. For us who believe in the equality of all religions, the birth of Jesus Christ is as worthy of veneration as that of Rama, Krishna, etc.
 December 26, 1944
 Illness itself should be a matter of shame for man. Illness betokens some lapse. Illness should not beset one whose body and mind are wholly sound.
 December 27, 1944
 Evil thoughts are also a sign of illness. Let us, therefore, avoid evil thoughts.
 December 28, 1944
 One infallible means for escaping evil thoughts is Ramanama.
 
 The Name should come not merely from the lips but from the heart.
 December 29, 1944
 Numerous are our ailments; numerous, too, are physicians and their treatments. But we would be spared much bother if we regarded all diseases as one and Rama as the one and only Physician who can eradicate them.
 December 30, 1944
 How strange that we run after physicians who are mortals themselves but forget Rama, the immortal, eternal and never-failing Physician!
 December 31, 1944
 Stranger still it is that, knowing that we, too, are mortal and that a doctor’s treatment can at best but prolong our life for a few more days, we still run from pillar to post to seek it.

  	I have heard that you want to take in someone sent by Akbar but want 	the Ashram to pay for his upkeep. This is wrong and after I am gone 	the whole thing will close down. It must not be so. The first 14 	years may pay in the end, but altogether in the end. But the adult 	education and the preparation of school masters should pay from the 
 beginning, barring of course the expense of the permanent teaching staff. I can argue this out and prove it but I must not do so now. It will tax me unnecessarily. I hope that all those whom we have taken just now have been taken on that basis.
 If they have not, the matter requires re-thinking out. I have not allowed the mind to lie quite fallow all this month.

 The Gatha needed a fitting picture. Dr. Bhingare had selected a cheap one. It hurt me very much. I sent it to Shri Nandalal Bose, the renowned Santiniketan artist. He has been kind enough to send me four pictures of Tukaram to go with the abhangas. I sent the one that  I thought the best among them to Bhingare and it will be published in this edition.

 January 10, 1945
 The Ishavasya gripped me during my Harijan tour of Travancore. All my speeches invariably included the first verse of this Upanishad: “All that is pervaded by God. It all belongs to Him, therefore nothing belongs to you. But in a way it is yours too. But why get caught in the argument? Renounce all, and all is yours. Nothing will remain in your hands if you regard anything as yours.” This was the note with which I concluded my Travancore tour and I felt that I had come by a treasure. I told Vinoba and requested him to give me a simple Hindi rendering of the Ishavasya. As is his wont he granted my request. The result is this translation.

 [QUESTION]: If it is possible to meet the Working Committee, will you try to persuade the Working Committee to accept this planlibtech_452_footnote?
 [ANSWER]: Yes.
 Q. What are your arguments in favour of this plan?
 A. After my talks with Jinnah, Jinnah told many people that Gandhi had not even mentioned Interim Government. Bhulabhai’s effort is a reply to this. But if the intentions of the League are not genuine, nothing will come out of it.
 Q. What happens if the Viceroy uses his veto over the head of the Congress and the League?
 A. In that case there will be an agreement between Bhulabhai and Liaquat Ali that the Government will resign.

		CONFERENCElibtech_454_footnote","
    
 SEVAGRAM,
 January 11, 1945libtech_455_footnote
 DR. ZAKIR SAHEB, ARYANAYAKUMJI, SHRIMATI ASHADEVI AND BROTHERS AND SISTERS,
I had hoped to speak a few words while opening this
 Conference, but God had willed otherwise. I had to observe silence because of a cough, and other things. Therefore I have written down what I wanted to say.
 Although we have been working for Nayee Talim all these years, we have so far been, as it were, sailing in an inland sea which is comparatively safer. We are now leaving the shoals and heading for the open sea. So far our course was mapped out. We have now before us uncharted waters, with the Pole Star as our only guide and protection. That Pole Star is village handicrafts.
 Our sphere of work now is not confined to Nayee Talim of children from seven to fourteen years; it is to cover the whole of life from the moment of conception to the moment of death. This means that our work has increased tremendously. Yet workers remain the same. But that should not worry us. Our guide and companion is Truth which is God. He will never betray us. But Truth will be our help only if we stand by it regardless of everything. There can be in it no room for hypocrisy, camouflage, pride, attachment or anger.
 We have to become teachers of villagers; that is to say, we have to become their servants in the true sense. Our reward if any, has to come from within and not from without. It should make no difference to us whether in our quest for Truth we have any human company or not. Nor does Nayee Talim depend on outside financial help. It must proceed on its own way, whatever critics might say. I know that true education must be self-supporting. There is nothing to feel ashamed of in this. It may be a novel idea if we can make good our claim and demonstrate that ours is the only method for the true development of the mind. Those who scoff at Nayee Talim today will become its ardent admirers in the end and Nayee Talim will find universal acceptance.
 
 Seven lakhs of our villages, which are today the symbol of our poverty in every sense, ought to become prosperous in the real sense. This prosperity will not come from outside; it will grow from within the villages as a result of the labour of every villager. Whether this is a mere dream or a practical reality, this is the goal of Nayee Talim and nothing short of it. May the God of Truth help us to realize it.
 I have gone through the balance-sheet of the Talimi Sangh. It shows that whatever we have spent has been spent with due care and consideration. It is a brief document. I hope everyone will go through it carefully.
 The question of language as such does not fall within the scope of Nayee Talim but the question of the medium of instruction does and that must always be the mother tongue. This point cannot be over-emphasized. Equally  important  is  the  question  of a  national or all-India language. It can never be English. English is undoubtedly the language of the rulers and of international commerce. But Hindi-Hindustani alone can be our national language. At present ithas two forms. In order to understand both the forms of the national language, viz., Hindi and Urdu, and for their natural synthesis we must learn the Devanagari and Persian scripts. I find this lacking even in my immediate surroundings. All our sign-boardslibtech_456_footnotelibtech_457_footnotemust be written in both the scripts and there should be none amongst us who cannot easily read and write either.
 I want to draw your attention also to another thing. I consider the Sevagram centre to be an ideal centre for conducting the central experiment in Nayee Talim, as it is here that the Charkha Sangh is carrying out its main experiments. Wardha is the centre for the other village industries. Experiments for the improvement of cattle, which is service of the cow in the true sense, are also being conducted here. Sevagram does not stand alone; there are nearly 20 villages lying about it in close proximity. Therefore if experiments in Nayee Talim in its most natural form can be carried out anywhere, it is here. The various institutions mentioned above are not rival organizations; they are complementary and are calculated to supplement one another’s efforts. That is the hallmark of a revolution of love.

 P. M. What should the students do to strengthen the Congress?
 G. The students must identify themselves with the  aims  and ideals of the National Congress and, by being part and parcel of it, they must continue to struggle against the foreign rule.
 P.M. Should the students’ organizations have a separate identity or should they align themselves with the different political parties?
G. Students should do in this case what they think proper and
 advantageous for their organization and if experience proves otherwise, they must give up party affiliations. Students should not indulge in unnecessary abuse of students belonging to a different ideology. However, they must strengthen the Indian National Congress and prepare it for the final fight for freedom by doing silent service.

 T. V. KUNHIKRISHNAN: You know the Communists took an attitude of hostility to the political activities of students in 1942 and afterwards. The Indian Students’ Congress  embodies  to  some  extent   the   faith   and   aspirations   of   students   who are opposed to the attitude of the Communist section. Here are some of our questions:
 Have we the right to exclude Communists and oppose their attitude and tactics? Please do not tell us that this is a minor provincial question. We want your guidance  in this matter.
 GANDHIJI: I dislike the idea of excluding anybody because of his label. But use your independent judgment.

 choice.
 T. V. K. Can the Indian Students’ Congress have a flag of its own? Can you suggest some flag for us?
G. I cannot suggest a better flag than the Congress flag. It is
all-sufficing.
 T. V. K. You had said that Congress workers should take charge of students below 12. Can you amplify the statement?
G. Quote my exact words and you will know the meaning.
 T. V. K. You had asked students to observe the 9th of every monthlibtech_483_footnote. This has been characterized as an advice for ‘back-door satyagraha’ by Communists. Would you allow students to abstain from classes on the 9th?

 I have read the whole thing. You have poured out your heart in it, which was the right thing to do. You are still unsteady. For the unsteadiness to go you must remain in the institution  and  give  yourself wholly to it. So it should be the same to you whether it is Jajuji or Chimanlal or I. You should obey the head whoever he be. Therein lies your training. If, however, that is not possible for you, I shall not mind if you two live together away from the Ashram. I doubt, though, whether you will then be able to observe brahmacharya. But what even if you cannot? It will be no crime. You two are married and should be free to do as you like. Whatever you do, you should do together and with deliberation and determination.
 Even while remaining in the institution you will continue to serve the people. In fact you will then do it better. But even here you must do as you think best. If you wish me to guide you, you will of course have my guidance whenever you ask it.
 If you can be more specific about the difficulties you mention, I may perhaps be able to solve them. The irregularity you mention cannot be tolerated. Give me the details. If something is unavoidable we shall put up with it, but we will do that with our eyes open. I can understand about Nanavati. He is ill, but he is a tried worker. I believe that one should not eat for the pleasure of the palate.
 Chimanlal is an old-timer. Well or ill he has stuck on. He goes on working silently. You should have regard for his services. The secret of good life is strictness with oneself and generosity to co-workers. Why need you keep anything private?

 It would be good if you addressed brief notes to those who make mistakes or shirk work. I only wish to help. But would it not make it difficult to improve things if I did not mention what you wrote, did not know the names nor what lapses had occurred?
 You should have definite work. I assume you have. But if that is not so, I am willing to give you whatever help you ask for.
 You should welcome any new suggestions I make. They may seem new, but in fact they are not new. They are at the very root of our way of life.

Along with nursing, she also takes lessons in English, etc., from Bhansalibhai and others. But she is still careless, I am not fully satisfied. I had her sleep with me for three nights.

 I have read the whole of your letter. You can come here when you like. I am silent but you will see Dr. Sushila Nayyar and the patients. You may try your remedies.
 I adhere to all Dr. Nayyar has said of me. What I have said is a result of hard experience. I had the pleasure of meeting your father. I had sent for him for Sardar Vallabhbhai. He could not help. His admissions were revealing. I have met most naturopaths. They do not agree and they are obstinate and even lazy.
 You will now see why I cannot preside or be at your conference even if I was able to do all that work. Nor can I send you any helpful message. It will be critical. But you may make what private use you like of this. I want naturopathy to make real progress.

           SEVAGRAM 
  January 	26, 1945  	With the independence of India is bound up freedom for the whole of 	exploited humanity in the world—for even exploiters i.e., 
 imperialist England and other imperialisms.
 Referring to an incident that occurred that morning in front of the Ashram, when the police attempted to interfere with the normal village cleaning programme of the workers, Gandhiji said that it had been repeatedly announced that there was to be no militant programme on the Independence Day and after that it was not possible for anyone to offer civil resistance. Members of the various institutions in Sevagram worked under his guidance.
 Gandhiji said he had placed the Constructive Programme before the country years ago and it was the only way of attaining swaraj, i.e., full freedom through truth and non-violence. While he did not want a militant programme he had also said that if anyone interfered with the execution of constructive work, he expected the people to die rather than turn back. One such occasion arose that morning when a batchlibtech_540_footnoteproceeding mutely with pickaxes, shovels, broomsticks and baskets was stopped. They were not carrying fighting weapons and yet the police would allow them to proceed only if they broke up file. In such circumstances, non-violence would be sheer cowardice if they yielded and bent before authority. Their hymn for that evening was exceptionally appropriate, Gandhiji continuing said, and its central theme was, that true happiness lay only in the womb of unhappiness. For the hearers it meant that true happiness, i.e., swaraj, came only through unhappiness, i.e., self-suffering. The volunteers did right in refusing to break up file and at the same time not breaking through the police cordon. Though the police had fire-arms they were rendered useless through the dignified and yet firm attitude of the volunteers.libtech_541_footnoteThey were neither to invite firing nor avoid it and for them real authority was the dictate of their hearts which Gandhiji would call God or Truth.
For me, true independence is convertible with God. Tilak has
 given a mantra that “Swaraj is our birthright”. It is a simple one. I will only add that the way to realize the mantra is through truth andnon-violence and I claim that that way is possible only if millions work the Constructive Programme.
 Concluding, Gandhiji warned the volunteers not to gloat over their success, for, if they did so, that very pride would prove their destruction. Humility, he said, should be their touchstone.

          CHI. 	MUNNALAL,       January 	28, 1945 
  	I have gone through your letter from beginning to end. I have made 	some arrangement for the newspapers. You want other newspapers 	besides the Bombay papers. Even among the Bombay papers you do not 	get the Chronicle on the same day. Many persons want it, and 	it is not possible to refuse them. The same is true about the 	Patrika. You will get both of them but late. And if you get 	the Gujarati, Hindi and Marathi papers, you ought not to insist on 	the English ones.  	If I could have your  whole letter shown to the  persons concerned 	it would have made my task easier. Since you have forbidden it I 	have not shown it to anybody.  	I do understand your problem, but I cannot offer you much guidance 	unless I go deeper into the matter. What took place before me today 	was a spectacle worth watching. Both of you had lost your tempers. 	You were not aware of it, either of you. Each could see the other 	party’s error, but neither his own. This is true of everyone of us      
 and that includes me. I do not ask you to go and live in the village. The atmosphere in Sevagram having become vitiated I do not wish that you should go there. I myself am waiting and watching. I have already suggested that it would be enough if someone from the Talimi Sangh goes. He must be given the first place. He may do what he can. If he does not, then we shall see. But I see that co-workers have not been able to put up with your nature. They cannot fully appreciate your worth. I, therefore, do wish that since you both are now capable of observing brahmacharya even though living together and alone with each other, you should select a village within about four miles from here, settle down there and take up some work. I will continue to guide you in whatever matters you wish. So much for my wish. The decision will have to be made by you two on your own, even if it should go against my wish.
 You  can  use  turmeric and  salt.  I  am  not sure   about  pepper. If anybody wishes to add it later, he may do so. What the vaidyalibtech_547_footnotesays   is   for   ordinary   men   and   women.   In   my   view,   a brahmachari should shun all these things, including even salt and turmeric. If absolutely necessary, he may take them as medicine but not for the pleasure of the six flavours. But I do not insist; I do not forbid them. My observation may even be erroneous. I have lived for more than forty years without condiments, and for nearly  thirty without salt. It might have been a mistake on my part.
What is the matter with Ramdas ?
Let me know if I have left out anything.

  	I got your letter. I understand your need. I should advise you to 	write to Devdas about the books, too. If you are positively 	disinclined to do that, you may write to Kamalnayanlibtech_561_footnote. He will consult me. If I go and tell him, he will not 	refuse me. You should either send a list of the      
 books to Kamalnayan or tell him the amount you need. A list of books with their prices will look more respectable. I would like you not to take any help from Amritlal Sheth. He will certainly send you whatever you ask for. Your present need shows that this is not going to be your last request. This is significant for me, for it shows how costly present-day education is. And at the end of it, you won’t earn anything more than your livelihood. I have heard of many doctors who are unable to make both ends meet. Only a few have made good on their own strength. A good many have had to resort to influence even after passing their examination. In writing this it is not at all my purpose to persuade you to give up your study. You must finish it now. I do wish to suggest, though, that the knowledge you acquire at such a great cost should be used for service of the people.
 I am glad that you are keeping Suru from the lure of ornaments, etc. It remains to be seen how long you will succeed.

 WARDHA,
 January 31, 1945
 Mr. Sinhalibtech_566_footnotediscussed with Mahatma Gandhi the qualifications of constructive workers whether they choose to work among the labour or among the students. The following appear to be the minimum qualifications for such workers:
 Spinning 	of certain 	quantity of yarn 	regularly each month.  Giving 	preference to such 	articles for personal 	consumption as are 	locally manufactured 	on the basis 	of cottage industries.  To 	have full and active 	faith in 	non-violence and 	truth as understood 	by Mahatmaji. 
 Mahatmaji, it is understood, told Mr. Sinha that the above test was good and it could easily be made stiffer.

 BHULABHAI DESAI,
I understand that the steps would be somewhat as follows :
 The League agrees with us as to the composition of the interim Government at the Centre. (The agreed nominees will be responsible to the elected legislature.)The League agrees that if the proposal is accepted by the G[overnor] G[eneral] the first step to be taken by the new Government will be to release the Working Committee. On this being done, the G. G. will be requested to accept the composition agreed upon (with the addition of members representing the elected parties or elements). On the G.G. agreeing, an interim Government would be formed and when the Working Committee is thereafter released, you will be good enough to tell them that this step was taken with your approval.

 Centre in early January 1845; vide “Note to Bhulabhai J. Desai”, 5-1-1945 and Appendix “Guidelines for Proposed Interim Government”, 5-1-1945.
 
 QUESTIONS : Is the agreement of the League to release the Working Committee as the first step of the new provisional Government (preliminary) proof of their bona fides ?
 ANSWER : Yes.
 Q. If the new provisional Government is formed while the Working Committee is still in detention and if the new Government releases them, why do you see danger in the way of a permanent solution of the Hindu-Muslim question ?
 A : The danger lies with the Quaid-e-Azam being equivocal and two-faced.libtech_569_footnote

MY DEAR DESHBHAKTA,
 I do not appreciate your appeal. There is no hurry. It should be revised. Give the assets of the ashramam, the liabilities, yearlydonations, the concrete activities, the income therefrom. Then give the prospective expenditure in detail.
 Has the ashramam enough workers for the different tasks? Who is the doctor for general work, who is the veterinary surgeon, who is the matron? Are all these experts to be brought in? The thing reads visionary. It must be businesslike. If the burden cannot be borne, the appeal should wait. You will get the funds. Let them not be a curse. Money won’t produce men. The latter will produce as much as you need.

 February 1, 1945
 CHI. MUNNALAL,
 You tried to be brief but failed. I am sure you have omitted something. To be brief means that you should say everything you want to in as few words as possible. I will show you how to do this when I have the time and the opportunity to do so.
 It was not in anger that I wrote what I did about Burhanpur. I was not happy about you or Kanchan going there. But knowing your limitation, I agreed unreservedly. After you had gone there, I saw from your letters that your going there had been fruitful. You made your family happy and you could also improve things to some extent. Besides, there is certainly work to do in the town. Hence, in order to see you become steady and have the proper environment, I also suggested your taking up  work  there.  My  intention  of course is  that you should stay on here and learn through experience. But evenfor doing that, you must have equipoise and you must live in conformity with social norms. If you do not do that, you will not mature. I, therefore, included that also in my suggestions.
 You may forgive Gopalrao and others, but you must know their mistake. I saw sarcasm in Pandurang’s letter. I did not like the letter. Their explanation for all this lies chiefly in what you two, perhaps four, namely, you and Kanchan, Chimanlal and Shakaribehn, are by nature. These two women cannot be considered different from other women. Perhaps you do not know how many of my plans came to nothing because of Ba’s limitations. I exercised as much strictness as I could. But the limitation would always show itself. You may be sure it will be the same in this case. I have explained the rule to you. If, after understanding it, you come to the conclusion that you two should run the Ashram, I would consent to your doing so. Even if you run it in a way different from the way it is run at present, I would let you do so. Or if you decide that the Ashram should be disbanded, I  would  consent to that too. The correct and best thing would be that all four of you should wake up now while carrying on your present work, and do the best you can. You may seek from me whatever help I can give you.
 If Chimanlal also did not understand about Prahlad, ask me when I have free time and when both are present; I will tell you. Writing about it will make the letter too long.
I will see about the newspapers.

You may request them and even if they are not able to help, you may find some other way. If you do not know how to broach the subject to them, do not embark upon the venture.

If you tell me which members of the Ashram refuse to help, I may do something about it.
 The only remedy for all the difficulties is patience. Forget about Sevagram for the time being. Assume that Shantabehn has taken over responsibility from today. You may, if you can, give her whatever help she asks for.

  	I am very much worried about you. You are always crying and seem 	restless. You do tell me that you regard me both as your mother and 	father. Will a child be ever afraid of talking to her parents, or 	feel shy? You do both. I, therefore, wonder what your real feelings 	are. Why should you have any secrets? You should not object to 	others reading your letters. Therefore while I have returned them to 	you, I did not like doing so. You should have the courage to say 	whatever you wish in front of everybody. One hides one’s guilt 	even when it is small. He who has acted truthfully hides nothing. If 	there is any suspicion that truth is being kept back, it comes out.      
 Tell Sushila whatever you wish to say. Why should you be afraid of her? Tell her boldly whatever it is. She tells me that she has not stopped you from attending the class because you share the bed with me. She told you for your own convenience that you might take leave if you wished and get well. She will help you to make up for what you miss.
 You may show this letter to Pyarelal, Sushila or anyone else you wish. Get well.

I have your letter of January 31, 1945.
 My complaint remains. Your letter has, if anything, aggravated
 it.libtech_589_footnote
 All your office-bearers are your own men. So must be the
members. This is not the way to unite people.
 All your work will be carried on in English. What has this got to do with nature? You have dug up the very foundations of nature. Why inflict English on poor Tandonji who is an advocate of the Rashtrabhasha ? If you did not want the Rashtrabhasha it would have been better if you had chosen one of the South Indian languages.
 Father’s letter is full of wisdom. What could Dr. Sapru do?
There is nothing to obstruct a nature-cure practitioner in India.

 An intelligent man will not stop with just learning a script. He who stops there will be defeated. However, a script can certainly be of great help in learning a language. The opposite of it is also true. It is proper to write everything in Hindi. But we want to be practical in our
 
 approach. As we want to achieve unity we should learn as many scripts as there are languages here. By doing so we would be moving nearer the goal. Considered from even this point of view all these things fit into the scheme of Nayee Talim.

Or you can warm it by putting the vessel containing it in hot water and give it to him. You can give him honey mixed in hot water, or pure jaggery. Honey would be better.

Of course it is another thing where the husband is wholly indifferent. I know such a case. Am I clear? Tell B. she should not be silent.

 Mahatma Gandhi addressed a few words to the gathering.libtech_621_footnoteHe told them he had accidentally seen the address which they had presented to Shri Kanu Gandhi, the organizer of the camp. They had said some very nice things in it, but if, as it often happened, it all began and ended with the presentation of the address, without their carrying back with them something of enduring value from the camp, theirs would be merely love’s labour lost. He expected them to develop what they had gained during their month of training a hundredfold and become true gramsevaks, servants of the villagers in deed as well as in name. They had been selected for training out of a large number of applicants. It was for them to vindicate their selection by going back as messengers and torch-bearers of samagra gramseva to their respective provinces. They should go to villages as scavengers and sweep them and clean them and serve the villagers as their humble servants. They should teach those who wished to learn spinning and other village handicrafts in the best way they could. They should never feel helpless in the absence of outside help. In their work, if they had really assimilated the spirit of the teaching that had been imparted to them, it ought to develop their intellect and heart no less than their bodies. Therefore it should develop their character. Their success would depend more on the purity of their hearts than on their skill and knowledge. If they lacked moral purity they would prove a blight instead of a blessing to the villagers among whom they might settle.
 
 
 He was glad to note, Gandhiji went on, that though they came from different provinces, they had all been able to take and flourish on the same diet. It should lead to a better realization of our oneness as a nation. Customs, dress, food and language were bound to be to a certain extent different in different provinces, but the essential unity underneath this apparent diversity had to be fully grasped and a working uniform standard evolved if they were to realize their destiny as a nation.
 Lastly, Mahatma Gandhi exhorted them all to learn Hindustani and acquire proficiency in both the Urdu and the Hindi scripts. Hindustani meant not a highflown Sanskritized Hindi or Persianized Urdu, but a simple dialect which both Hindus and Muslims spoke in the villages of the North. The villagers did not understandhighflown Hindi or Urdu. Their language was either simple and plain Hindustani or a provincial dialect irrespective of their caste or creed. Highflown and sophisticated style in Hindi and Urdu were the disease of cities, bred of mutual distrust. So long as that state lasted it was incumbent on them to learn both the Hindi and Urdu scripts. The third party was there no doubt to accentuate and exploit their differences, but, if they really felt that Hindus and Muslims were kith and kin, blood brethren, no one on earth could divide them or keep them divided. There was a popular saying that it needed two to start a quarrel. He was there to tell them that true ahimsa did not need to wait for a gesture from the other side. If they understood their own part  of the duty and acted accordingly, success would assuredly be theirs.

  	After reading the enclosed, pass it on to Krishnadas. After reading 	he should return it to me.

That 		is why 		I let 		the girls massage 		my legs. 		I would 		not let any others 		do so. 		I don’t 		mind what Bhansali 		does, for 		I have 		complete faith 		in him. 		Nobody is 		privileged. Nobody 		can be  privileged. 		This must be clear.  The 		responsibility for 		anything that 		you may permit Champa 		to do will 		be yours. 		I will 		not guide 		you. You are free 		to be as strict 		as you like. I 		have told Champa 		that she may secure 		from you whatever 		liberty she 		wants, but 		must not ask for my 		permission, since the 		daily supervision 		over her is not mine. The Ashram manager should be a  sthitaprajna, a  gunatitalibtech_624_footnote  and 	a bhakta. For this see Chapter II, XII and XIV [of the Gita].   For 		learning English, why 		should anybody want 		to hear 		it read 		by someone 		else? One 		may read it 		for oneself. 		Bhansali may read 		from Ramakrishna and 		explain in 		Gujarati. Nobody is 		forbidden to 		read English 		by himself. 		One may learn 		any Indian 		language, and 		Bhansali may 		teach it. 		I would 		never say that 		those who knew 		English should 		forget their knowledge, 		except perhaps sarcastically. I 		myself know 		English and 		love the 		language. But 		the language must 		be used 		only when necessary and 		not other wise.  Omprakash 		should hand over his 		watch to the Ashram. I 		think I 		shall be 		able to 		get Rs. 30 		for it. This would 		be the 		right thing 		to do. 		But if O. prefers 		to pay 		that sum to the 		Ashram and 		keep the watch 		himself, he may do so.  Certainly, 		it is one’s 		duty to 		learn an 		Indian language, 		i.e., one’s 		mother tongue.  Ordinarily 		it is desirable 		that the class 		should be conducted 		at the 		place fixed for 		the purpose.   	This has been written in Gujarati unconsciously. I hope you will 	follow it.

 Celibacy is obligatory only for the inmates of the Ashram. It is not meant for others and it would not apply to servants. It should apply to Ram Prasad; he is not an inmate of the Ashram. Our Ashram is no more an ashram in the real sense. But wherever I stay becomes a kind of an ashram. I had even objected to calling it an ashram; but everybody started referring to it by that name and I acquiesced. This does not in any way mean that those who have taken the vow can break it.

From 	the Gujarati original : Pyarelal Papers. Nehru Memorial Museum and 	Library. Courtesy : Beladevi Nayyar and Dr. Sushila Nayyar         February 15, 1945 Referring to 	the amount 	of one 	crore and 	twenty-four lakhs 	that had been collected, Gandhiji remarked that though he was impatient to speed up the work, he  was not going to allow the Fund to be squandered away or loosely handled. It had been  collected in the name of an illiterate and simple-hearted woman. He had his detractors, not so Ba. Therefore, the work done in her memory must be cent per cent honest. He     
 did not care for numbers of workers. If he could find even two capable men or women in the meeting he would begin work with their help and expand it as more suitable workers came forward. So far as he was concerned he would like to exclude men altogether from the various Provincial Committees formed under the Trust and fill them with women. But he would not have them unless they were at least as capable if not better than men. Otherwise he would be exploiting them. He had never done so. One crore and twenty-four lakhs was a mere drop in the ocean when distributed among seven lakhs of India’s villages. India was spending more than a crore a day on the war, but one crore and twenty-four lakhs for the service of women and children appeared a big sum in the eyes of everybody. That gave only a measure of the topsyturvydom to which they had got used.
 Referring to the way in which the money was to be spent, Gandhiji divided it into three heads. The first in order was medical relief for women and children in the villages. From the schemes that had come everybody seemed to think in terms of maternity homes and free hospitals for women and children. He recognized the need of this kind of work but he frankly confessed that he had yet to feel his way to it. What kind of medical institutions they were to have and what system of medicine they were to adopt was a ticklish question. It was taxing his mind and he requested them all to give their serious attention to it. So far as he was concerned, “prevention is better than cure” was his motto. If he had his way he would make sanitation and hygiene work the principal activity under this head. It did not matter if in doing so they had to exclude a certain class of hard and difficult cases. Some of the patients might even die. He could steel his heart to lose them. But it broke his heart to see even one healthyman fall sick.Our village folk must be taught to look after their health. The root causes were poverty and ignorance. In order of importance these two came first.
 Education was to be along the lines of Nayee Talim. As a matter of fact, everything else was included in and was an essential part of Nayee Talim as he conceived its scope.
 They had to better their economic condition through khadi and village industries. Today, the sole occupation of woman amongst us was supposed to be to bear children, cook for her husband and otherwise drudge for the household. This was a shame. Not only was woman condemned to domestic slavery, but when she went out as a labourer to earn wages, though she worked harder than the man, she was paid less. Children were forced to go to work at an early age. Some of them worked often as much as the men but were paid even less than women. This state of affairs must be put  an end to. He had received no scheme for this kind of work so far. The children in the villages began to earn at an early age. Their parents could not afford to send them to school and spend on their education like the city folk. Their education should fit them for some useful industry or other and it should help to put them on their legs.
 The work outlined by him was original and difficult. There were very few men fit to carry it out. Many of them even lacked the desire to train themselves for it. Such men should not come on the Kasturba Gandhi National Memorial Fund Committees and if they were on them already they should resign and make way for others.
 At the end, he invited questions but appealed to the audience to spare. him as far as possible. His energy was limited. He observed silence, he told them, practically for the whole day these days from 3.15 a.m. to 8.15 p. m. He broke it for a short time during the meeting days.
 A friend asked what should be considered the maximum population of a  village. Gandhiji replied that for the present he would set the outside limit at 2,000. This was subject to adjustments later on. He knew an overwhelming majority of villages in India had a population between 500 and 1,000 or even less. He would like them to begin with the smallest village and then work upwards. He knew of some villages in Gujarat which were miniature towns. Rich towns folk had gone and settled there with their wealth. The money of the Fund was not to be spent on such villages.
 Q. What means would you suggest for the economic-uplift of the villagers?
 A. True all-round uplift of the villages cannot but result in their economic betterment. Except maternity work, all the other items outlined by me would directly result in their economic uplift as well.
 Q. If you were in charge of a district how would you set about the
  work?   A. 	A district is too big a bite for me. If I can successfully 
  	organize work in one village I would be satisfied. It will serve as 	a model for the rest of the seven lakhs of villages to follow. We 	have not set about village work in right earnest so far. We have 	only tinkered with it here and there amateurishly. I myself was an 	amateur. But now we are determined to do better.  Q. 	Some people engage in constructive work only as a side line to their 	political work. The result is that they can do justice to neither. 	There should be proper supervision to prevent it.  A. I entirely agree that 	constructive work and political work should not be mixed. To me 	constructive work done properly is all sufficient. It leaves no 	necessity for any other programme. As for supervision, there is the 	old man who is your Secretary and the young woman, the Organizing 	Secretary of the Trust—I mean Thakkar Bapa and Mridulabehn.  Q. 	Today the Provincial Committees have an overwhelming majority of 	men. In how much time do you hope to be able to replace them by 	women?  A. I would, if I could, 	turn out all the men today and myself follow suit. But I would take 	women on their merit,  not  merely because they were women. If we 	could find suitable workers I would certainly wish to spend the 	money in our hands fairly fast. Anyway, I do hope and expect that by 	the time the present fund is expended, women would have become 	capable of managing their own affairs.  Q. 	If you do not find suitable women workers, why should not the Fund 	be used 
 to train them up?
 A. That is exactly our object and it is for that purpose that you are all here. But everything must be done in a way befitting the memory of her in whose name the Fund has been collected.
 Q. What is to be done in a province like Sind where it is too unsafe for any woman to venture out and work in the villages?
 A. So long as women do not come forward, it goes without saying that men have to work in their place. But I have no doubt that you should be able to find women to go to work in the villages. Muslim women at any rate should have nothing to fear in Sind. Anyway the worst that can happen to a woman is that she might lose her life. I am convinced that no one can molest a woman if she has the determination and will to resist and is not afraid of dying. I know of a young missionary girl who went all alone in the midst of Negroes inthe wilds of Africa. Yet she was not afraid and no one ever cast an evil eye on her. We have such women amongst us also. One of them was with me only two days ago. She went to Dacca all alone when Hindus and Muslims had run amok. No one dared to touch her. To enable women to shed their cowardice and to face danger undaunted should in fact be one of the results of our activity under the Kasturba Gandhi National Memorial Fund scheme.
 Q. If we take up work just in one village the pressure of the surrounding area would swamp our work. We can’t make any headway unless we tackle the whole area at once.
 A. My experience is different. If we put off taking a necessary step till everyone else is ready for it we shall never make a move on. We must have the courage to take the plunge even if we are all alone. There are certain difficulties in the way but we have to overcome them. Many of the difficulties that deter us are imaginary. For instance, no one hinders my work here in Sevagram.
 If I can only move the hearts of the people of Sevagram that is all that I need to do. If we cannot succeed in one village we cannot possibly do so in a hundred. Even if we can get a certain law passed by the State, who is going to enforce it in the villages unless there is awakening among the people themselves. For that we have to begin with one village and then extend our field farther and farther.
 Q. Those that are already doing constructive work are being drafted for work under the Kasturba Gandhi National Memorial Fund. There are no new workers forthcoming. In order to do justice to the Kasturba Gandhi National Memorial Fund work those who take up work under the Trust should not be burdened with other preoccupations.
 A. It is true that for many years we have not been able to draw sufficient fresh workers but Mridulabehn tells me that there is no dearth of women workers, if only the men folk remove the stranglehold. I have told her that I would take her side and help her to produce as many women workers as she can.
 Q. Many people who have collected large amounts for the Fund or have contributed substantially to it want to be included in the Provincial Committees. Should we take them on?
 A. The golden rule is that collecting money or contributing money should neither qualify nor disqualify a man from becoming a member of the Provincial Committee if he is otherwise fitted for it.But if anyone thinks that he has a right to be on the committee because of what he has contributed or collected, such a claim cannot be entertained and he should be excluded. We must not have unwieldy bodies and we must not draw men who are already engaged in one sphere of work into another. There are some men who are good at parliamentary work. I would not like them to be stigmatized for it. But if they leave it for something for which they have no aptitude merely because it is the fashion of the hour, I would take them to task for it just as I would take them to task if they sought to advance their parliamentary ambitions under cover of constructive work.
 Q. The custom of slavery of women is still prevalent in some States. Can’t the Fund be used to do something for them? Anyone who tries to help these women is clapped into prison under trumped-up charges.
 A. Send these women to me and I shall look after them. They can all perform an exodus from the States where their elementary rights are denied.

661,"February 	17, 1945",STATEMENT TO THE PRESS,"
          WARDHA, 
  February 	17, 1945  	I have delayed giving my opinion on the Bihar Government’s 	challenge to Congress workerslibtech_634_footnotein  the  hope   that  the  storm  was  an isolated 	mistake and that it will correct itself. I find I was mistaken.On 	top of the happenings in Bihar comes news that Shri Purushottamdas 	Tandon has been rearrested. The workers in Bihar are well known, and 	of them one is an ex-Prime Minister and another is ex-Finance 	Minister. Tandonji is the Speaker of the U. P. Assembly. Now comes 	news that Shri Gopabandhu Chowdhury of Orissa, equally well known 	too, has been rearrested.  	This is one picture. The other is, the Viceroy holds talks with Sjt. 	Bhulabhai Desai. The air is thick with rumours of big changes. The 	rumour hardly squares with the news I have summarized and which the 	public knows already.  	Congressmen in Bihar were busy devising concerted measures to give 	effect to the fifteen-point constructive programme sketched by me 	and in a manner suggested by me when the principal men were arrested 	though the programme has no political fIavour, using the term 	politics in its understood sense. I have not hesitated to say that 	the universal adoption in practice in India of the programme must 	lead to the attainment of complete independence without either civil 	non-violent disobedience or even a parliamentary programme. There 	would then be no necessity for either. The British would not find it 	worth while to stay in India to rule. They would stay, if they do, 	as full citizens. In the language of 1942, as rulers they would quit 	India; for their soldiers would be without occupation, their huge 	industries without use. That day may not come, but it should be the 	non-violent soldier’s dream which he must try daily to realize and 	if in its pursuit he is thwarted, he has his non-violent resistance 	to fall back upon, otherwise called civil disobedience and 	non-co-operation. Mass civil disobedience is nobody’s 	responsibility except, as yet, mine. It was not offered in 1942. 	Nobody who has not permeated the masses can    
 shoulder it. Indeed, the masses simply will not move. That is my conviction based on the experience I have gained. Hitherto the action in Bihar is defended on the ground of an alleged speech by Shri Prajapati Mishra. The text of that speech has been suppressed.
 There is no question of his or any  Congressman  making exciting speeches in the prosecution of the constructive programme or about non-violent resistance or much less about resorting to violence or even approving of it. That there is no plan under the present conditions to offer any form of mass civil disobedience has been clearly stated by me and I know that Congressmen  all  over  the country are acting on the advice I have offered. But abstention even from referring to the theoretical possibility of resistance and the like cannot be forced or even made a condition of prosecuting theconstructive programme. It has undoubtedly independence— political, social and economic—as its aim. It is a moral non-violent revolution in all the departments of life of a big nation, at the end of which caste and untouchability and such other superstitions must vanish, differences between Hindu and Muslim must become things of the past, enmity against Englishmen or Europeans must be wholly forgotten and Princes and capitalists must live as perfect friends with the whole mass of India as the real and legal trustees of the people for all the wealth they may possess. Is there anything wrong in  the attempt? What are Government protestations about Indian independence if they will not tolerate the movement I have sketched except on conditions impossible of acceptance? Are they not satisfied with the extraordinary power they possess? Must they keep without trial the best known as well as the least known Indians in their custody, lest the latter should preach independence from one end of  the country to the other and non-violent acts in pursuit thereof? Must they rearrest released persons the moment they speak and act as free men, if their speech or act does not please the authority?
 Another painful experience I am undergoing which I must share with the public is the number of reports of assault and torture resorted to for purposes of extorting confessions from prisoners. Some cases are already before the public, such as the notable one at Kolhapur.libtech_635_footnoteMany other instances of comparatively recent occurrence have been brought to my notice. One particular case I have in mind related to a young lad who, on my advice, gave himself up to the police because he had been wanted. If some of the reports that one hears are not well
 
 
 founded, I am satisfied several others are perfectly genuine. Is it not time this practice of torture and ill-treatment of people held in captivity is firmly discountenanced and put an end to by the powers that be?
 In August 1942, instead of needlessly precipitating a quarrel with the people, if the authority had listened to the pleading of the Congress, India would have enjoyed independence and the war would have already ended with honour for the Allies and happiness for the suppressed peoples of the earth. That is my retrospection. If things go on as they are doing in India, the victory that the Allies will have will be only so called, because they will also have India and other nations in the same plight bleeding at their feet. Such a victory can only lead in the near future to a bloodier war if possible than the one that will have closed. For, as I have said elsewhere, victory won at the expense of India will mean that, out of the ashes of Fascism, Nazism and Japanese militarism will have risen a new monster that will seek to eat all it sees and in the attempt will be eaten up, leaving I know not what.
 It has given me no pleasure to pen this statement. There is much more I can say but I shall say no more for the present.

662,"February 18, 1945","FOREWORD TO “AMARAN
BA”libtech_636_footnote","
    
 Narahari Parikh is one of those who joined the Satyagraha Ashram when it was first founded at Kochrab. Whatever, therefore, Chi. Vanamala has learnt, she has learnt at the Ashram. She is untouched by any Government school and the education imparted there. It can therefore be said that she knows how to work hard. She has however gone out to collect material for Kasturba’s biography. In this she has also secured contributions from others. Up to the time of writing I have not been able to look at these. It was Chi. Vanamala’s wish that I should go through what she has written. Poor girl, she would write about Kasturba but how could she forget me, with whom she romped around and played as a child? I see she has painstakingly collected her facts and ordered them neatly. Her language is homely and simple. I see no artificiality in it. Whether Chi. Vanamala has been successful in this her first effort is solely for the readers to judge.
Chi. Sushilabehn, sister of Chi. Pyarelal, has written about Ba’s
 
 experiences in jail. Chi. Vanamala thought of taking something from this. But on reading Sushilabehn’s account she found that Sushilabehn’s writing had a natural flow which she could not disturb. The original is in Hindi and its  Gujarati  translation  is  reproduced  in this collection. Sushilabehn after all holds a doctor’s degree. She has besides an interest in vocal and instrumental music, painting andliterature. She takes interest in public affairs too.  The  late Mahadev noticed these qualities of her and took a keen interest in them. But he has departed from us. His life is ended. Readers should keep this in mind when they read Sushilabehn’s article.
So much for the authors.
 But they both assert that if I myself do not say something about Ba the work will remain incomplete. Since I am writing this foreword to the book perhaps it will be appropriate if I say something about Ba.  I certainly intend to write more fully about Ba when I have the time. Here I shall only answer the question, if I can, why Ba was able to attract people to her. Ba’s chief virtue was her voluntary identification of herself with me. I did not draw her forth. The quality blossomed in Ba on its own when the time came. I never knew that Ba had this thing hidden in her. My earlier experience showed her a very stubborn person. If I tried to compel her in any way she would do exactly what she herself wanted. This led to bitterness between us—short or prolonged. But as my public life gradually developed, Ba blossomed more and more and freely merged herself in me, that is, in my work. In time no distinction remained between me and my work—which was service. Ba too became one with that work. This quality perhaps most naturally arises from the Indian soil. At least that seems to me the chief reason for Ba’s sentiments.
 The reason why this virtue reached its pinnacle in Ba is to be found in our brahmacharya. It came more naturally to Ba than to me. In the beginning Ba was not even aware of it. The idea came to me and Ba took it up and made it her own. In the result the relationship between us was as one between true friends. Since 1906—in fact since 1901—all the time Ba was with me, she had nothing outside of my work. She could have lived apart. There would have been no difficulty in her living apart from me. But being a friend she yet considered it her duty as a woman and a wife to merge herself in my work. Ba gave the paramount place to the service of my person and till death never ceased from the task of attending on me.

  	I got your note today. I tasted the wheat [dalia]. I find a great 	difference between wheat and jowar [dalia]. I stick to 	what I have said about the latter. The wheat dalia didn’t 	seem half cooked. You may certainly add jaggery to jowar ghensh 	or raab. The jaggery should be added only after the 	ghensh or the raab is ready and is being    
 removed from the fire.
 I follow what you say about the Gita. If you do not know the rules about where the stress should fall, learn them from somebody. Pyarelal and Sushila know them. For correct pronunciation, it is absolutely necessary to learn to read fast. Without that the tongue does not move smoothly. Don’t suppose that your voice can never improve. If you don’t know the story about  Demosthenes,  ask Pyarelal. If you do not follow it, ask me.
 About rotlis it is like this. One great disadvantage of folding them is that they do not then require to be properly chewed. Crisp rotlis are preferable. It should be made a regular practice to serve a fixed quantity to everybody.

  	Of course I could see your unhappiness. But Sushilabehn made me 	realize that you were even more unhappy than I had thought. There is 	no cause for it. Nothing has been spoilt. The matter has been talked 	out, which is only to the good. We have got to look for the land. 	All that has happened is that the matter has been somewhat delayed. 	We are meeting in Bombay. If our talks there are doomed to break 	down let it be so. We don’t want to keep anyone by force. And 	would a forced association bring credit? It is a stupendous task. I 	am not at all scared even though it is mainly my work. What you have 	created will of course go on. I am not so much interested in it. But 	I am certainly interested in what is being done in Andhra, because 	it islike village work. Now I learn that even that has defects. But 	if the finding is correct it is a great discovery.

Please bear in mind that as from today you are in possession of the 	Sevagram land. It is not to be thrown away. That experiment is to be 	conducted directly under my supervision.

Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	a copy of the Hindi: C.W. 812         SEVAGRAM,  February 	20, 1945  I 	told Bapu that Sjt. Bhulabhai has received his letter regarding 	consultations with the Working Committee members. I drew his 	attention to the fact that the above was there in his Gujarati 	draft, but was not there in Bhulabhai’s latest English draft. Bapu 	said that the Gujarati draft only could be considered correct 	because the English version followed as an explanatory one.     
 However Bapu’s independent opinion was that to meet and consult the Working Committee should be considered as an inevitable condition to act upon.
 QUESTION : But if the new government releases the Working Committee immediately and at that time if the Working Committee is free to give its independent opinion, and at present as prisoners if they don’t give any opinion, will it not be more beneficial ?
 ANSWER: No. In that case Bhulabhai will not be able to carry public opinion with him. And also it will not be fair to the Working Committee.
 Q. If it is possible to meet the Working Committee, will you accompany Bhulabhai or not ?
 A. If Bhulabhai wishes so, I am prepared to go with him.
 Q. Will you try to persuade the Working Committee to accept this plan ?
A. Yes.
Q. What are your arguments in favour of this plan ?
 A. If the League is prepared to work together with  the Congress in any way it is desirable. After the Bombay talks, Jinnah has told many people that Gandhi did not even mention about the interim government. Bhulabhai’s efforts are in themselves a reply to him. But if the intentions of the League are not genuine, nothing will come out.  I am surprised at the Statement of Jinnah and Liaquat Khan. In case Liaquat Khan has not even asked Jinnah, then it is a question how far we can rely on Liaquat’s talks. Arrests have again started and that is a bad sign. Now Bhulabhai must talk in a firm tone and tell the Viceroy that this will not do.
Q. Do we keep aside the question of the Viceroy’s veto ?
 A. Bhulabhai says that it is a question of procedure and I have accepted it. However, it means that the Government will not act with Viceroy’s veto against the vote of the Assembly.
Q. But if the Viceroy uses his veto and function ?
 A. In that case there will be an understanding between Bhulabhai and Liaquat that the Government will resign. Even now this fact must be made perfectly clear between them.
 Q. On the basis of 4-4-2 will you even include the nationalist Muslims amongst the four of the Congress ?
 A. No. But Bhulabhai should tell Liaquat that amongst his four he should take nationalist Muslims.
Q. Hindu Mahasabha ?
 A. Viceroy will create Hindu Mahasabha and other such parties. But we are not accepting them. There are two parties— Congress and League. Sikhs and Harijans, we have accepted as a concession.
 Q. Can we include persons like Shyamaprasad Mukherji amongst the four ?
 A. If Bhulabhai wants to take them, then I would not raise any objection.
 Q. If previous consultation with the Working Committee which is in jail is essential, then why should not the Working Committee members in jail form the Government ?
 A. That time has not yet come. At present the talk is only limited to Assembly members.
Q. But what about the Whites ?
 A. The white, black, all-only those who are appointed by the Congress and League can come, except the Commander-in-Chief. Others will be responsible to them.

 CHI. MUNNALAL,
 The programme on the 22ndlibtech_661_footnotemust be carried out. They have already consulted me. The Gita and spinning in the morning is the right thing, also the Ramayana. I have never believed, let alone saying, any such thing about Kanchan as you attribute to me. I did explain to you what I believed, and you have also accepted its truth. Kanchan told Sushilabehn that she wants to live with you and have children. I asked her on the very day she left and my impression is that she admitted that it was so. If this is true, what you write is not correct. My own view is that after having slept in the same bed with me once it was wrong to discontinue it through ignorance. I did not know who forbade her. I spoke neither to you nor to her about this. I am mentioning this for the first time to you. This is all I wish to say.My experiment, as you know, has been suspended. If any woman comes to me now, she will do so not for the sake of my experiment but in order to receive from me the spiritual strength I possess. I think I have such strength, though I am not sure whether I am right or wrong in my belief. I have no fear at all that I may take unworthy advantage of anybody or violate my cherished vow.
 You are wrong in believing that you are gaining nothing here.
But if such be your belief, now or later you must leave the Ashram.
 To depend on servants for anything will be the fall of you both. But we may engage for service a person whom we look upon as a brother or sister, with the object of helping him or her to advance in
 
 life. If he or she leaves us, we should do without him or her and carry on our work as best as we can. I should welcome such a situation for myself. We would then have neither money nor so-called servants, but that would be a real test for us. I have already been tested in this manner. I have been discussing this with Kanubhai and trying to  tempt him. If he can give us the benefit of his recent experience and do something for us, all of you should welcome it.
 I understand about the dalia. If you send some, I will examine it. I am still of the view that jowar grain should not be ground coarse and flour removed.
 I think I have now said practically everything I wished to say. Nor have I the time for more. If there is anything left out remind me.

 CHI. MUNNALAL,
 I understand about Kanchan. My judgment approves of her opposition. For you have observed no limit in harassing her and now you yourself tell her that from the social point of view your reason does not approve of the thing. Kanchan is bound to interpret that you are opposed. You also desire children, and that is why you cannot regard either yourself or Kanchan fit for brahmacharya. You have tested yourself much. I should advise you now to set up house-separately so that both of you can be happy. If you give up the thought of brahmacharya and live as a householder no harm will follow. If you wish later to observe abstinence, you will be able to do so. It seems to me that a separate establishment for you two and brahmacharya go ill together. However, do what your heart bids. Chi. Kanaiyo tells me that you like his suggestion. I have made a few suggestions. For two days he is going to Wardha. When Sushila comes from Nagpur, he will return here. Meanwhile, all of you may think things over. In my absence you are bound to be under less pressure.
 I understand about servants. In this matter also you should  regard my view only as a suggestion. You should do whatever all of you like and think. About newspapers, Ramprasad tells me that these days he himself gets them at half past one. It would be better if you discussed the matter further with him. If you can take charge of the newspapers, you may do so. I would not at all advise you, though, to take it up. However, have a talk with Pyarelal.
 My desire to run away from here also has at the back of it the consideration of the  convenience  of you  all.  But  we  need not think about this matter. If it is to happen it will happen in the natural
 course. And then neither I nor you nor anybody else will be able to stop it.
Are you satisfied now?

SEVAGRAM,
 
  February 	22, 1945  	This day marks the end of a solar year since Ba’s departure from 	the earth. According to the lunar calendar, the anniversary fell on 	Mahashivaratri Day.libtech_667_footnoteThis 	is no occasion for mourning. On the contrary, it should be 	celebrated with the same joy as a day of birth. I do not make much 	distinction between birth and death. The atman has 	neither birth nor death. We loved Ba’s atman which is 	immortal.  	We spend days like this outwardly in religious rites. We had 24 	hours’ non-stop spinning. To me it was a religious observance. At 	Balvant Sinha’s suggestion, we also have had the reading of the 	Ramayana which lasted throughout the day. In the morning we 	recited the Gita. But these outward acts do not satisfy us. 	We should go through these rites with full consciousness and 	understanding and invoke God. God is not somewhere up above or down 	below. He is in our hearts. In fact He is everywhere. When 	scientists say that they can create a vacuum, what they mean is that 	a vessel can be emptied of air but something still remains. Physical 	scientists have discovered thatthere is something subtler than air. 	Those with religious leanings realize that God is everywhere and is 	witness to all our acts.  	Yesterday, I said that we must first wipe out our sins. There was a 	marriage celebration yesterday. Five minutes before [the function] I 	went to inspect the latrine. It smelled. I found excreta uncovered. 	Is this not a sign of our outer sin? We are guilty of a great error 	in keeping the latrine thus. We might have committed other sins as 	well. We have, therefore, to see that our latrines and kitchens are 	absolutely clean. We have to see that the kitchen runs smoothly; we 	must ask why we hurt one another, why the flies and mosquitoes 	breed. All these are indicative of our sin. I have not yet succeeded 	in finding out the cause of their growth but that does not absolve 	us of our sin.  	On this sacred day we plied the charkha and observed many other 	religious ceremonies. Now the test, whether we deserve to undertake 	it or not, lies in the fact whether we observe cleanliness or not. 	You may not call it a sin, only a shortcoming. But to me the two are 	the same. We are punished for these sins not in the life to come but 	in this very life. Viewed thus, life becomes simple and full of joy.        
 I had a letter from Kanti. He has mentioned what two learned persons said to him. One of them said that he did not consider spinning to be a religious duty. If he span, it was because it had become a convention to do so. It is obvious that spinning in imitation of others cannot be termed a religious act. Such spinning will not win us swaraj. We will win it only if we understand its science and appreciate its potentiality. Spinners who spin imitatively and therefore mechanically should not be found, of all places, in the Ashram. Everyone here does not ply the charkha and I put up with it. I cannot forbid those who spin just because others do. But I may as well tell them that this is not going to help them achieve their aim.
 The other learned person said that he-did not believe in prayer. It is not his fault. The blame lies with us, for we, who believe in prayer, do not make our prayers manifest in our lives and actions. He has warned that those who have gathered round me are not all genuine believers and that I am doomed to despair. But I do not find any particular signs of despair in me. I do my duty and speak of it to others. But if they do not care to act on it, it does not affect me. This learned friend gives discourses on the Gita, attends the prayer but he does so only because it is a convention.
 If one’s mind wanders during prayer and does not lose itself in meditation, it is clear that one does not fully participate in prayer not withstanding the physical presence. There is in that case a conflict between the body and the mind in which the mind is the winner. What  I mean to say is that if we consider this to be a sacred day then we must with all our heart do all we can in the name of an old woman who, though unlettered, was an embodiment of purity. Let all our actions be sincere.

  	It appears Hari-ichchha is nearing her end. Today I sent her to Dr. 	David. He says her lungs are no longer fit for artificial 	pneumothorax. Her condition was not so bad at the time she was put 	under your treatment. On top of your medicine Chandi Prasad made her 	take a lot of milk. Her condition further deteriorated. Now a rib 	may have to be removed. Perhaps Hari-ichchha does not have the 	patience required for this treatment. This is the position. Do you 	have any treatment to suggest?

 February 24, 1945
 With women men should behave as they would with men. Two men would not deliberately embrace or kiss each other, or sleep together. But if there is a reason, one man would touch another, sit by his side, or sit on the same seat. We must behave with women in the same manner. We must forget the distinction of sex as far as possible. There is distinction between men and women but it should have no place in our normal dealings. The consciousness of this distinction arises either in the case of carnal desire or outside it in that of a genuine desire for progeny. Let us forget this second category. Probably one in a million may be resorting to intercourse  for  purposes of procreation. I have not come across any such person so far. I do not consider association with women or keeping away from them in conformity with the conventional restraints of brahmacharya asrealbrahmacharya. My relationships are covered  by  this explanation. Whatever you may hear to the contrary must be rejected offhand. Think of this instead of being curious about my relation- ships."

718,"February 26, 1945",ANSWERS TO T. B. SAPRU’S QUESTIONS,"
    
 AS AT SEVAGRAM,
 February 26, 1945libtech_682_footnote
 Q. In your letterlibtech_683_footnoteof September 14, 1944, to Mr. Jinnah, you said as follows: “You, ask for my conception of the basis for a provisional interim government. I would have told you if I had any scheme in mind.” Did you never discuss even the outlines of any scheme during the course of your conversations?
 A. What I told Quaid-e-Azam was the exact truth. I had no idea of what he meant, for he never told me what he had  in  mind. Therefore I can answer your question by saying we never discussed the outlines of any scheme of interim government except what I have said.
 Q. In answering the first question, please refer to Mr. Jinnah’s letter of September 14, in which he said, “You, being the sponsor of this Gandhiji Rajaji formula, should give me some rough idea and picture of it so that I may understand what this part of the formula means.” Did you give any reply to this? If so, what? If not, why not?
A. The foregoing answer deals with your second question.
 Q. In his letter of September 17, Mr. Jinnah says that “the word (Pakistan) has now become synonymous with the Lahore Resolutionlibtech_684_footnote”. Did you ask him whether in accordance with the Lahore Resolution of the All-India Muslim League, a scheme of Constitution, in accordance with the basic principles providing for the assumption finally by the respective regions of all powers such as Defence, External Affairs, Communications, Customs and such other matters as may be necessary, had been prepared? Was your attention drawn to any such scheme by Mr. Jinnah?
 A. No. Quaid-e-Azam’s position unfortunately was that while he could come as far as seeing me and trying to convince me of his position, he, the President of the League, could not discuss details with me, a mere individual. But so far as I could gather from our conversations, he had no prepared scheme. As the correspondence shows, he had referred me to two books both of which I read, but neither of which could help me to understand Quaid-e-Azam’s exactposition. One thing he insisted upon was that if I first accepted the Pakistan of his conception, he could then discuss other things with me even though I was but an individual.
 
 Q. Is it true that the real breakdown between you and Mr. Jinnah came about on the question of Central authority or Government? Please refer in this connection to Mr. Jinnah’s letter of September 25,libtech_685_footnoteclause (d), in which he says, “If these vital matters (suggested in the quotation from your letter with which clause ‘d’ begins) are to be administered by some central authority, you do not indicate what sort of authority or machinery will be set up to administer these matters, and how and to whom again that authority will be responsible.” Did you, at any stage, indicate to him that you wanted a Central Government or a Central Legislature to deal with a limited number of subjects, such as Foreign Affairs, Defence, Internal Communications, Customs, Commerce and the like?
 A. It can be said that the breakdown took place because we could not come to an agreement of the two-nation theory of Quaid-e-Azam’s. As the correspondence will show I wanted to avoid a Central Government. I suggested an authority acceptable to both the parties, but he would insist first on complete partition as between two nations and then an agreement between them as on foreign affairs, etc. He would not agree to anything simultaneous.
 Q. In that very clause (clause ‘d’), Mr. Jinnah says, “According to the Lahore Resolution, as I have already explained to you, all these matters, which are the life-blood of any State, cannot be delegated to any Central authority or Government.” Then he says that “the matter of security of the two States and the natural and mutual obligations that may arise out of physical contiguity will be for the constitution-making body of Pakistan and that of Hindustan, or [any] other party concerned, to deal with on the footing of their being two independent States.” Did you understand Mr. Jinnah’s position to be that he intended that Pakistan and Hindustan should be completely independent sovereign States with no connection between them except by a treaty? If so, did he tell you what was to happen if either party broke the treaty and what was the authority which could enforce the provisions of such a treaty?
 A. Of course, he wanted two independent sovereign States with no connection between them except by a treaty. If any party broke the treaty, the consequence would be what has happened throughout the world up till now, i e., war. Therefore I did not ask and he did nottell me as to what would happen if either party broke the treaty.
 Q. As regards the C. R. Formulalibtech_686_footnote, can you explain why Mr. Jinnah was opposed to clause (2) of that formula, which demanded a plebiscite of all the inhabitants on the basis of adult suffrage or other practical franchise? Did you understand him to say that in the areas demarcated for Pakistan the minorities shall be given a chance of expressing their choice of staying in Pakistan or not being separated from the rest of the country?
 
 A. Quaid-e-Azam would not have the plebiscite of the Muslims because he thought the League represented the Muslims of India and that the other communities should have no voice as to Pakistan which was Muslims’ exclusive right wherever they were in a majority.
 Q. Please refer to your proposals contained in the letter of the 24th of September in which you said “there shall be a treaty of separation which should also provide for the efficient and satisfactory administration of Foreign Affairs, Defence, Internal Communications, Customs, Commerce and the like, which must necessarily continue to be the matter of common interest between the contracting parties.” Please explain how that treaty would provide for the efficient and satisfactory administration of these matters, and whether you contemplated any machinery which could give effect to the decisions embodied in that treaty. If so, what is the nature of that machinery which you had in mind?
 A. I suggested a board composed of representatives of both the States. It was to be an arbitration board with administrative powers. For the due carrying out of its decisions, it would largely or solely depend upon the goodwill of the parties or States. But I should not object to a machinery jointly devised by the two States.
 Q. Have you any objection to the provinces or States enjoying the fullest autonomy with residuary powers vested in them?
A. None whatsoever.
 Q. How do you reconcile Mr. Jagat Narain Lal’s Resolutionlibtech_687_footnoteof the All-India Congress Committee with the line that you took in regard to the division of India in the course of your conversations and correspondence with Mr. Jinnah?
 A. I depended first upon the decisive interpretation given by the President, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, and secondly on my own, meaning that the Jagat Narain Lal Resolution should be read together with the others bearing on the question. For these latter were not cancelled by the Jagat Narain Lal Resolution.
 Q. Please refer to Appendix ‘C’ of the pamphlet known as Gandhi-Jinmah Talks, and send to the Committee a short memorandum explaining any points in that summary which you may consider necessary. In this connection please refer to your Press statementlibtech_688_footnotedated September 28, 1944, in the course of which you stated as follows: “In that respect the Lahore Resolution is quite sound. Where-there is an obvious Muslim majority, they should be allowed to constitute a separate State by themselves, and that has been fully conceded in the Rajaji Formula or my formula. . . .
 But if it means utterly independent sovereignty so that there is to be nothing in common between the two, I hold it is an impossible proposition. That means war to
 
 the knife.” What did you mean by saying “war to the knife”, and why did you consider that proposition to be an impossible proposition?
 A. “War to the knife” is a simple English idiom. I have never known it used in the literal sense. It simply means a determined  quarrel between parties. I hold that if there is nothing in common between the two or nothing which does not come in conflict with each others’ culture there can be no friendly mutual agreement.
 Q. In your Press statement dated September 28, 1944, you said: “I urge that apart from the two-nation theory, if I could accept the principle of division of India in accordance with the demand of the League, he should accept it. But unfortunately it was just there that we split.” Please explain this more clearly.
 A. I think I am explicit enough. I meant that apart  from conceding the two-nation theory, I accepted the concrete suggestion of division of India as between members of the same family and therefore reserving for partnership things of common interest. But Quaid-e-Azam would have nothing short of the two-nation theory and therefore complete dissolution amounting to full sovereignty in the first instance. It was just here that we split as I have said herein before.
 Q. Are you prepared to admit that the Muslims in India are a separate nation? If so, then why do you deny the Muslims the right of having a separate independentState? If you are not prepared to admit that the Muslims are a separate nation, then on what principle do you agree to a division of India to the limited extent to which you seem to have agreed in the course of your conversation and correspondence with Mr. Jinnah? In this connection, please refer to your interview to the News Chronicle on September 29, 1944,libtech_689_footnotewhich is printed at page 64 of the pamphlet known as Gandhi-Jinnah Talks.
 A. Although I could not agree to the two-nation theory, I agreed on the basis of members of a family desiring severance of the family tie in matters of conflict but not in all matters so as to become enemies one of the other as if there was nothing common between the two except enmity.

		SABHA CONFERENCE-Ilibtech_690_footnote","
    
       BROTHERS 	AND SISTERS,  WARDHA,  February 	26, 1945 
  	I am glad to see you all assembled here at the invitation of 	Principal Shriman Narayan. Dr. Abdul Haq was to have arrived here 	today, but he is now expected tomorrow. This association and I wish 	to have his help. Likewise Sjt. Tandon was to come and I was feeling 	very happy. Shriman Narayanji had wired to him also. I am sorry that 	he is unable to come, being ill. Let us hope that he will recover 	from his illness soon.  	The task confronting you is, in one way, small, in another way big. 	It is small because it requires only very small effort, and yet it 	promises great consequences. Dr. Tarachand tells us that what is  	known by various names today was originally one language spoken in 	the North by both Hindus and Muslims. It is a sad thing that those 	who were once one have become divided. Their language, too, has 	either been split or is being split, into Urdu and Hindi.  	As a result of the efforts of Sjt. Tandon the Congress at Kanpurlibtech_691_footnotegave the name ‘Hindustani’ to the language which is 	spoken by both the communities and decided on two scripts, 	Devanagari and Urdu. But the Congress could not implement the 	resolution. In 1942, the Hindustani Prachar Sabha took up this work 	at the instance of the late Shri Jamnalal Bajaj but he passed away 	soon after. In 1942, Congress leaders and others were arrested; I 	was among them. I was released later on medical grounds. Even during 	my illness I followed the progress of the work that was being done 	by Sjt.  Nanavati  to propagate Hindustani. It gave me joy to find 	that it held out the prospect of success. I see no reason why what 	was at one time the common language of both Hindus and Mussalmans 	should not again become one. In Northern India, we are the 	descendants of those Hindus and Muslims who spoke and wrote the same 	language. It should not require even half the labour to revive that 	old common language than it would to create two different languages, 	Urdu and Hindi. Village folk in Northern India, whether Hindus or 	Mussalmans, even today speak the same tongue and some even write the 	same language. It is for you to decide what should be done to bring 	our labours to a successful completion. The function of the 	Hindustani     
 Prachar Sabha is to implement your decisions.
 I am sorry that, for reasons of health, I observe silence for the whole day so far as possible. During the last three months I had to break my silence during day-time only perhaps on three occasions. Today, it being Monday, I am observing my weekly silence. I hope that it will not interfere with our work.
 I now leave the conference in your hands. Shriman Narayan will conduct the rest of the proceedings.
 Today’s proceedings will go on in my presence till 5.30 p. m. Tomorrow our work will commence at 3 p. m. I shall then place my thoughts before you.
 You will please excuse any inconvenience which, despite Janakidevi’s best efforts, you may have experienced in the matter of arrangements for food and other amenities at Bajajwadi.

  	Certainly all noble  efforts  have  my blessings.  In my view your 	primary duty is to work in such a way as to win the approval of 	Jajuji.  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	a copy of the Hindi: Pyarelal Papers. Courtesy: Pyarelal         WARDHA,  February 	27, 1945  	I am sorry I cannot give you as much time as I would wish. Please 	forgive me. My silence continues for the whole day. It is not that 	it cannot be broken. But I want to continue it for as long as I can 	and smoothly carry on my work. So I observe silence. If I squandered 	my energy, I might collapse in a month. My attachment to truth and 	non-violence would not permit this. But if necessity should arise I 	could spend this energy with both hands. I could also be a miser. 	These days I have adopted the latter course.  	I want to explain to you what the Hindustani Prachar Sabha is. Its 	aim is to make as many people as possible learn Hindi and Urdu 	styles and the Devanagari and the Urdu scripts. There was a time 	when the people of North India spoke one common language. We are 	their descendants. Today we see that the gulf between Hindi and Urdu 	is widening. Protagonists of Hindi use difficult words from Sanskrit 	and    
 the Urdu enthusiasts do the same from Arabic-Persian. I know this will not continue for long. Villagers care for their bread only. They will continue to speak the language which they have been used to speaking for years.
 It is the task of people like me to stop Hindi and Urdu from running into separate orbits. I shall say to both sides that the way adopted by them is not proper. The villagers will not understand their bombastic words. If we learn to write both the scripts, the two languages in the long run will become one. The problem of script is not so complicated. Let both the scripts continue for ever. Or there is no objection if every province started writing the national language in its own script leaving aside these two. But the language should be one. Today we have become slothful. Today we have on our heads the burden of English. But English is also not so difficult. We can learn English in six months. But we want to learn to think in English and study the sciences. So it takes time. We waste as many as fourteen valuable years learning English and yet cannot master it. Today if weask a teacher of English to express his ideas in Hindustani,  he pleads inability. Because of his education through English, he is not able to express his ideas in Hindustani. Then how can he teach Hindustani to his students? This is our sorry plight. This also leads to lethargy.
 We should not be afraid of learning two scripts. Somebody might say that there are other eight or ten good scripts. Why should we not learn them? I do suggest that we learn at least one of the scripts of the South also. There are four languages there. You should not be frightened of them.
 You are living in Hindustan. If you want to serve your Hindustani brethren, why should you be afraid of the labour of learning at least two scripts? We have to learn only one language. It is our misfortune that we have to use two scripts. But I would gladly learn all the languages of India. If we have the interest, we shall not find the task too hard. Today your number is very small, but it does not matter. All of you must at any rate learn the two scripts. I do not want to speculate on what splendid consequences would follow.
 It is idleness which prevents one from learning other languages.libtech_698_footnoteIf anyone comes to me, I can arrange for teaching him not only Hindustani but ten or twelve other important languages. If anyone says ‘I can’t study Urdu (Hindustani)’, I would say ‘you are unfit for staying in India as it is the language of many.’ I invited you for
 
 co-operating in this language (national) task which can be achieved if we work properly and in right earnest.
 Some Urdu-speaking people, while engaged in serious talks, employ words which leave me dumb-founded although I frequently talk with them. Why is it so? I have found a way out and it has been placed before you.

 WARDHA,
 February 27, 1945
 Dr. Tarachand has poured out his heart while explaining the significance of the history of Hindustani words commonly used in the villages.libtech_699_footnotelibtech_700_footnoteI was not able to ask Tarachandji to finish soon because I myself was gripped by what he said. He said things which he could have as well said at a gathering of pundits. I am not a pundit. However, I was listening with interest along with others. He did not repeat anything and that is why I did not stop him.libtech_701_footnotelibtech_702_footnoteLater he narrated how he first joined the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan and left the Bharatiya Sahitya Sammelan after the Nagpur meeting, after which he took up the Hindustani work for making it the national language. I want and desire real democracy even in this field.
 I followed what Anand Kausalyayan said. He spoke hesitantly. On behalf of the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan he said that the burden of two scripts should be avoided as far as possible. Even today, I happen to be in the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan. I did not go there on my own. Jamnalalji used to drag me with him into whatever work he happened to  do.  He  took  me  to  Indorelibtech_703_footnotelibtech_704_footnotewhere  I  gave  a  new  thing   to   the Sammelan. They all digested it. I said “Hindi is that language which both Hindus and Muslims speak and which people write in both the scripts.” The resolution moved by me was passed. I had it included in the Sammelan’s constitution.  It  is  a  different  matter  that  it  was  later amended. Hence I should not feel sorry if now I quit the Sammelan.
 
 There are many among us who are trying to unify Hindi and Urdu. Some wonder why it is necessary. I want real democracy. Democracy degenerates into hypocrisy if people become yes-men. That is why I asked them not to follow others blindly but express their true opinion.
 I don’t want Hindi to die nor Urdu to be banished. What I wish is that both should become useful to us. The law of satyagraha says that one can clap with one hand. It may not produce sound, but what of that? If you stretch one hand, the other one will follow automatically. Haq Saheb had said something in Nagpur, which I could not then understand. I did not accept his “Hindi alias Urdu”. It would have been better if I had accepted his point. He came for friendship, but was met with opposition and turned almost an enemy. But I have no enemy. Then, how can Haq Saheb be one? That is why today we are again on the same platform. An all-India literary conference was held at Nagpur, but it was its first and last session. We had gathered to come closer, but were divided. What was the use of such a gathering? It was a literary conference of all India not only Hindustani and so my speech on the occasion was full of Sanskrit words. If I were again required to speak before such a gathering, I should speak the same language.
 Anandji says that everybody will find great difficulty in learning two scripts. I say there is no difficulty; and if there is, it will have to be overcome. For, if this is not overcome, how shall we be able to face greater difficulties?
 I live for Hindu-Muslim unity. I know the propagation of Hindustani will bring about this unity. But I am not holding out this temptation right now.
 I say, let Hindi and Urdu both prosper. I have to take work from both. Even today, Hindustani exists but we do not utilize it. This is the age of Hindi and Urdu. These are two streams from which the third will flow. Hence it will not do if the first two dry up.
 The villagers will follow my language. They will not be able to follow a language which is full of Sanskrit and Arabic-Persian words. If those in the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan should say that they are going to sponsor a Sanskritized language, then, as far as I am concerned, the Sammelan does not exist. The language of the villages is only one. They cannot have two languages. The champions of Hindi want me to blow the trumpet for Hindi only and to forget Urdu. But I am a satyagrahi believing in ahimsa. How can I do this? I cannot do this work all alone. I need everybody’s help. I am a ‘mahatma’ precisely because I am aware of my limitations and never go beyondthem. That
 is why Moulvi Abdul Haq has come. I have no wings. The veterans are called here so that they may give me wings. If they do I shall soar high and say, “Look, it is well done, is it not?” Else I shall lie in the dust and stay there.
 I am considered a big man also in the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan. Not in that capacity, but in a general way, I would like to say that nothing will be done against the interest of the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan. But people will have to take the trouble to learn both the scripts. I want to take work from Anandji also.
 I am told that the Muslim boys do not learn the Devanagri script. I would say if it is so you have lost nothing but they have lost something. What do you lose by learning one more script? Such a little thing brings such a great gain. I had said the same thing to Hasrat Mohani. But it did not serve the purpose at that time, because a satyagraha had started. I did not tell all of you to court arrest but I did. It is not just foolishness on the part of those who are in jail. Jawahar, Vallabhbhai and Maulana Saheb are already in jail. They are not fools. If they come out by resorting to flattery they will be dead in my eyes, and if they die during imprisonment, I shall not shed a single tear, I shall say they died a noble death. Because while there, they serve India.
 If Hindi and Urdu are unified Saraswati like the Hooghly will be bigger than the Ganga and the Yamuna. The Hooghly is a dirty river, I do not drink its water. But if this one becomes like the Hooghly it will be a grand river.
 Now the question of funds. Those who would like to contribute may give either to me or to Shriman Narayan. Everybody should contribute according to his capacity. Those who contribute may do so for the cause, not to gain fame.

It seems as if you felt 	tired or wrote piecemeal and the link was broken. Clauses 8 to 12 	relating to the work to be done do not seem consistent. I have taken 	this up in haste soon after the prayer. Maybe, therefore, I myself 	have got confused in my mind. But I feel that you should have a 	separate paragraph, with a heading, for self-purification. This can 	come somewhere earlier. What follows is useful but it should be said 	differently and arranged in a different manner. I can do all this 	for you. But I would have to spare more time for that, which I do 	not have. Nor is it right that I should do your cooking for you. It 	should be enough for me to tell you whether what you have done is 	done badly or indifferently. Please, therefore, revise the  whole  	of thatportion and, if you wish, show it to me. But it will be all 	right even if you don’t. Reject what does not appeal to you from 	among the suggestions I have made. Kishorelal is ill. I myself will 	not trouble him. I advise you also not to do so. Do what you 	yourself can.

 I have read the whole thing. It seems to me I shall have to pay attention to a few things. I will not go too deeply into it. Do not expect any help from me but accept whatever help I can give. It is right that I should see my faults. It keeps me vigilant. In your view it is useless. It would be good if we could start a separate catering service. But that will not be possible. By and large we should serve to the guests the same food that we cook for ourselves. I understand about Kanchan. It will be a triumph for you if you secure her testimonial. Just now you don’t have it. Do not think that she is not fully awake. To the extent that she is not, the fault lies with youand me. I do not distrust you. If I did, you would have left. It should be for me to decide what work to assign to whom, don’t you think? “Forget Sevagram” means forget the village, not the Ashram. In telling you that you may have a separate establishment I have shown that such a step has my consent and my encouragement. If even then you do not do that, I shall take it as a matter of special credit to both of you. I cannot bear the thought of your refraining from having a separate establishment under the slightest pressure from me. Kanchan seems to wish to have one. I do want you to play a major role in stabilizing the kitchen. But you should do it my way. I think I have now replied to all your questions.

745,"March 1, 1945",LETTER TO VICHITRA NARAYAN SHARMA,"
    
 March 1, 1945
 CHI. VICHITRA,
I am answering in pencil. Later I shall have it copied out in ink.
 The truth is that I want to make the beginning with the kind of person you mention. If with his help we can achieve expansion, well and good, but if we cannot it will not matter. Because in the long run only the new outlook can help us to expand the work. If we stick to the old way, the work will come to a standstill. Khadi will end up by being merely an occupation for the poor. This will not satisfy anyone. If workers have doubts in their hearts, we shall patiently have  to remove them.
 When I say that we should sincerely believe in the Charkha Sangh as the symbol of truth and non-violence and dedicate ourselves to propagating the idea, it does not at all mean that what we had so far been doing was a mistake. We have benefited from that too. But it would be foolish to imagine that we can continue to do so, for we have certainly gained in knowledge. If the new outlook destroys the fruits of our past work, then we have not understood the new outlook. It is like the elephant’s foot that covers all other things. Yes, what will
 
 certainly happen is that we shall not be content any more to carry on in the old way and we shall be spared the outcry for expanding it. We have some recent instances of this which I shall not go into here.
 It will be false attachment if in our desire to expand the old we forget the new which is priceless. It will be unbecoming, if obsessed with the old, we lose hold of the new. If the old activity can be competently pursued by others they may by all means pursue it.
 The question you ask as regards the institution I can answer only if you show me that it is not merely hypothetical but is based on facts.
 We shall let the Punjab go ahead with the work if  it  can, provided we do not have to invest any funds. There can of course be no question of not wearing khadi.
 Women spinners may continue to spin. How far we may commit funds for this is a practical question. Each case can be dealt with on the basis of its own merits. We should not invest any capital in silk and allied activities. If, however, there are funds to spare and it is found beneficial to have stocks in khadi bhandars then we may have stocks of silks and woollens. There must be the khadi spirit behind all this and we should ensure genuineness.
 In the case of Kashmir, if the State does not impose upon us restrictions which we cannot accept, I should accept money from them under two conditions. All the institutions should be prepared to lose their funds. Maybe if the Charkha Sangh stakes its all nothing will be lost. But they must do so on their own responsibility. Whether the thing has my blessings or not should make no difference. One must base oneself on the situation as it is.
 It is indeed the duty of the Sangh to satisfy the public as well as the workers. If however there is a higher duty, we must pursue it, too. After all, khadi and all other work we have done has been informed only by this view.

  	I have your letter. My experiment can succeed; it can also fail. It 	can fail in the sense that I may not be able wholly to be free from 	passion. In satyagraha there is no room for failure causing the 	least harm.  	If my experiment is that of a satyagrahi, no harm at all can come to 	anyone. I am answering in brief. You may write to me again if you do 	not get the meaning. I did have experiments with Ba, but that was 	not enough. If emission took place then, it would have been less 	regrettable morally than any emission occurring now. Emission was a 	possibility then. I feel it is not a possibility now. Occasion once 	came in my life when I came very near to emission. But I was saved. 	I have mentioned this in one of my articles.  	This question gives me the impression that you do  not understand 	the problem fully. It is surprising that you asked the question 	without trying first to get the correct information from me. What 	does it mean? What kind of trust is this? I do not have much time. 	If you want to know, I shall acquaint you with the facts. Then if 	questions occur to you that will be legitimate.

 CHI. KRISHNACHANDRA,
 Your letter. You should find your answer in my letter. The idea is this. I deliberately want to become a eunuch mentally. If I succeed in this then I become one physically also. That alone is true brahmacharya. I saw an opportunity and seized it.
 If it is satyagraha it can never cause physical harm, nor even moral harm. That is to say, it can only do good. This is what  experience proves. What can happen when a bad person meets a good person? If my conduct is trusted there can be no harm, whoever may be my associate. This in any case must be clear. My reference is not to
 35  years  but  21  years.libtech_725_footnoteYou   have   either   not   noticed   it   or   have forgotten it.

 I 	deal with your letter today.  	You cannot categorically say either that I would or would not come 	on a full moon day. My going there or not going there would be 	guided by considerations of duty.  	Bread comes first and adornment afterwards. That has always been my 	belief. But since you are here, do whatever you conveniently can. 	Learn here what true art is.  	The art teacher should first take up some work which would enable 	him to earn his livelihood. Later on he may paint and teach 	painting. Such artists alone will teach true art.  	You will remember what I had said about the broom. Sweeping is a 	great art. Where to keep the broom, how to handle it,should there be 	one broom or different brooms for different jobs, should one stand 	erect or bend while sweeping, should one raise dust or sprinkle 	water     
 before sweeping, does one sweep the corners, pay attention to the walls and the roof—all these questions should occur to an artist. Only then would he find beauty in sweeping.
 There is therefore a place for a true artist in Nayee Talim. I have already told you who is a true artist. Nanda Babu comes very close to my ideal, though perhaps he is not the perfect ideal. However, he is so big a man that it would be highly improper for me to say anything in criticism of him. Read the article I wrote on my talks with Gurudev.libtech_727_footnoteWrite to me if you wish to ask anything more.

          DEAR 	DR. TARACHAND,      SEVAGRAM,  March 	3, 1945 
  	I understand and appreciate the principle involved in No. 7 of your 	scheme. If full local autonomy is granted to Western Bengal and East 	Punjab as proposed in Nos. l and 2 of your scheme, it may overcome 	the objections of the Muslim League and obviate the necessity of 	dividing Bengal or Punjab.  	This part of your scheme should be treated as an essential condition 	and not be considered as mere detail.  	I do not follow the argument in No. 5. If, however, the people of 	the areas concerned are agreeable to dispense with a  plebiscite,  I 	would not insist on it. It is a matter for consideration what, apart 	from  a plebiscite, would be a satisfactory proof of the people 	being  agreeable to the proposal.  	I presume that the step embodied in No. 4 will be simultaneous with 	and an integral part of the whole scheme.  	Apart from and independent of these proposals I may add that if you 	can induce the League to accept the award of a board, say consisting 	of yourself and Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru, I would accept it.  	You will mark the changes I have made in your draft, which I enclose 	herewith.  Yours sincerely,   K. GANDHI  
 [ENCLOSURE]
 
 
 
 (a) that Mahatma- ji’s terms are an acceptance of the claim for separation according to a reasonable in- terpretation of the	Muslim League resolution	of 1940
 
Suggested changes shown in margin.
 My interpretation of Mahatmaji’s letter of 24th September, 1944, to Mr. Jinnah is as follows:
  that 	Mahatmaji accepts the 	Muslim claim for separation 	as contained 	in the Muslim League 	resolution of 1940.libtech_730_footnote  Mahatmaji 	is agreeable 	to the 	appointment of 	a commission 	consisting of 	representatives of 	the Congress 	and the League 	immediately for the 	delimitation of 	the boundaries of the separate 	sovereign States.  Mahatmaji 	wants that 	the sovereign States 	will immediately 	enter into a treaty 	for the purpose 	of (i)safeguarding 	interests of minorities, 
 (ii) establishing a machinery for the administration of subjects of common concern.
 But Mahatmaji desires that the wishes of the inhabitants of the areas to be demarcated into sovereign States should be ascertained by a plebiscite.
 Mahatmaji does not agree with the theory that the Hindus of the whole of India or the Muslims of the whole of India constitute two separate nations. In my (Tarachand’s) opinion Mahatmaji has substantially accepted the Muslim demand and agreed to the establishment of two sovereign and independent States in India. The differences between Mahatmaji and Mr. Jinnah are:
 Mahatmaji 	wants before separation a plebiscite.  He 	does not believe 	in the 	theory of 	religious or 	communal nationality. 
                    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) The subjects of each federation will be full nationals and no discrimina- tion will be made among them in the matter of vot- ing or other- wise on the ground of race or creed.
  He 	desires that 	the machinery for 	administration of 	matters of common interest should be embodied in the 	treaty of separation. 
 I suggest that the differences between Mahatmaji and Mr. Jinnah can be eliminated provided an agreement is arrived at as follows:
  The 	sovereign and 	independent States in 	the North-West 	and East and in the rest of India should be federations. 	The units 	of these 	federations will be, 	in the North-West:  Baluchistan, North-West 		Frontier Province, Western 		and Central Punjab, South-Eastern 		Punjab (one or two units) Sind.   These 	units will have certain 	subjects including 	culture, education, 	personal law, etc., under 	the control 	of the governments 	of the units. 	The federal government 	will have the usual federal and 	common subjects under its control.  Similarly 	there may 	be units 	in Bengal, if 	the inhabitants 	of Bengal 	so desire 	and the remaining 	India will form one federation.  These 	two federations 	will by 	treaty establish 	a confederation 	of independent 	and sovereign 	fede- rations 	for the administration 	of matters 	of com- 	mon interest, 	e. g., 	defence, customs, 	foreign affairs, communications.  The 	establishment of 	the confederation 	eliminates the 	necessity of 	a plebiscite, which 	therefore need not 	be held.  The 	subjects of 	each federation 	will be 	the full 	nationals and 	no discrimination will 	be made among 	them on the ground of race or creed.  The 	establishment of 	federations in different regions 	obviates the need 	for any large 	adjustment of 	the present 	boundaries of the provinces.  The 	provisions about 	the establishment of 	federations and 	confederations will 	be embodied 	in the 	treaty of separation.

 I have gone through all your letters. I did not feel there was anything in them which Su. should see. If I have done an injustice, haven’t I washed it off by permitting you to write without any restraint? The truth is that I have done you no injustice. Your way wasclear. You should not have said anything. “We are more than even brother and sister. Why should we involve even you in this?”
 I will approve of a catering service. Why should then there be any need for separate arrangements for the Ashram? Everyone can feed there. A catering service could mean that one should be served what one ordered, subject to the normal limitations of the service. The present kitchen itself may be turned into a catering service. That  would solve the problem and save us all from bother.
 There is no such thing as an avatar. If there is, then all of us are avatars. Aren’t we, whether we know it or not, each a part of His being? Rama was not the only avatar. Narasimha also was one, and so were the Fish and the Tortoise. Weren’t the monkeys partial avatars? The question you have raised ought not to have been raised at all. I do not see the Ashram as a hospital. But in any case this work serves a useful purpose. It can be organized as a separate department, with seprarate quarters and kitchen. Others would then be concerned with it
 
 only when they needed medicine. I thus see no reason for bitterness.
 Today I have received letters from Kishorelalbhai and some others in this connection. I should indeed like some of you to read them. If you too think like them you should leave me, or let me go. I am ready for either contingency. I am not in the least afraid of the charge against me, but I am of you all, for any step you take will depend on yourself or myself or ourselves. I had already drafted the public statement I intended to issue, before I received the above mentioned letters. I had been thinking of it for the last two days, but could find the time only today.

 LETTER FROM K. M. MUNSHIlibtech_738_footnote
 BOMBAY VIEW, MATHERAN,
October 12, 1944
 
RESPECTED BAPU,
 Received your letter dated the 9th. . . .
 I too believe in freedom of speech. But the question before me on the night of 1-8-39 was to quell the dreadful riot that had just begun. It was my duty to take promptly all the measures that were imperative to bring the situation under control. And I had (also) to see that some three or four papers that fanned the (communal) passion did not add fuel to the fire. I did not think I was disregarding the principle of freedom of speech in keeping a check on it when it was misused. Even today I do Dot think so.
 My Jaipur speech was the result of my study of that problem. You will not find any contradiction in it if I put it (before you) point by point. . . .
  Sanskrit 	is our most 	valuable treasure. With its 	help alone we 	can make our 	languages as 	powerful as 	English and 	French. . 	. .  The 	power of our language which can express 	thought and 	creative endeavour 	belongs in 	general to 	the Sanskrit 	element. And so, if 	we are going 	to evolve 	in India 	a medium 	for expressing 	our thoughts 	and literature 	there is no alternative except resorting to the use of Sanskrit words. Today I have before me 
 the problem of the technical terms for law, philosophy and psychology. Where can we have the Indian medium except  from Sanskrit?	I do not think I have drifted
away from your stand at Nagpur (and) Indore and which I had accepted.
  I 	do not also see 	any opposition to 	the Congress policy in 	my address. As 	I have understood, 	the Congress 	aims to 	make the 	colloquial Hindustani a 	common medium for the whole country.       But how can the colloquial Hindustani be the 
 medium of thought or literature? The moment it attempts to be (any) such thing, it has got to seek the help of Sanskrit or Perso-Arabic words.	I cannot speak in that
 language unless I use Sanskrit words. There is no  intentional  Sanskritization; nothing else is possible.
  If 	Hindustani is 	to be the medium 	in the 	legislatures or 	the colleges, 	there are 	bound to 	be two forms 	of the 	language: one 	will be Sanskritized 	(and) the other 	Persianized. . 	. . 
 
 
  One 	reason why 	you have not liked my 	address may be that in 	one paragraph 	the experiment 	of the ‘Hindustani 	Samiti’ (carried on) 	under your guidance 	is criticized. 	What the Samiti 	is attempting 	to do is not 	the propagation of 	‘colloquial Hindustani’ 	but evolving 	a new 	style. Among its 	characteristics are: 	(1) abandoning the 	tatsama forms 	of Sanskrit 	words, (2) incorporating 	the tatsama 	forms of 	Persian words, 	(3) introducing an Arabic or a Persian word in the form of an Urdu 	word even if   a tatsama 	Sanskrit word 	has been 	traditionally accepted, 	(4) giving 	preference to 	Persian words in cases where both Sanskrit and Persian words are current. . . . 
 Yours respectfully,
 KANU MUNSHI

 APPENDIX II
 A STATEMENTlibtech_739_footnote
 SEVAGRAM,
 October 29, 1944
 Talks about the possibility of Gandhiji going on a fast have upset many friends and co-workers. Their love for him makes them shudder at the very thought of his undergoing the ordeal of another fast at his age and in his present state of health. Although he is keeping fairly fit and is putting in a full day’s work his reserve of energy is low. He is still slightly anaemic and the two intestinal  parasites,  hook-worm and amoebae, which are lying latent at present, can get the upper hand at any moment if his general condition is run down. Moreover, they feel that a fast on his part at this stage will add to the general demoralization and increase the popular bitterness against the Government.
 Gandhiji is not perturbed by considerations of his age or his frailness. His stand has always been that if God wants to take work from him He will spare him. If his work is over, there is no point in prolonging his sojourn in this world. However, friends have a right to feel that it is not wise to tempt Providence too often.
 As for the risk of increase of demoralization and bitterness as a result of the fast, he does not think it likely. A purely non-violent act cannot result in such a thing.
 Asked as to why he thinks he may have to fast, he said that ever since his release from prison he had an instinctive feeling that another fast lay in store for him. Of late that feeling had taken a more concrete form. The organized violence and slaughter of Truth all over has oppressed him deeply. To take a few illustrations, the cause of millions dying of starvation according to him is not altogether scarcity of food. Food is allowed to rot in godowns while people die for the want of it. It is a sad
 
 tale of mismanagement and corruption. Those who grow food have to go without it. The Government officials, instead of being their protectors, are acting as their exploiters. And it is not the Government officials alone who are to blame. Our own people, middlemen, petty traders and big merchants have not hesitated to make money at the cost of human life. It is a tragedy. Unofficial and official exploitation go on side by side. Without the former, the latter can have no locus standi. From top  to bottom the whole system is corrupt. The Government connives at unofficial corruption. That is the way in which violence works. It organizes all the forces of evil. As against this non-violence must act by organizing all the forces of goodness. If the nation had the control of the Government, this terrible bribery and corruption, which might if at all find its parallel in the bribery and corruption of Lord Clive’s days, would not take place. A national government having the confidence of the people can very largely mitigate their sufferings. But there seems to be no chance of  it. He described to what lengths he had gone to woo the Viceroy. But the Government were blinded by the intoxication of power. The vision of victory, which would be no victory but merely preparation for another war, had made them indifferent. How was he to demonstrate the efficacy of non-violence under the circumstances? How could he relieve the sufferings of the dumb millions? By conducting a mass movement? He had already showed why it was not to be thought of. He could not lead or bless a mass civil disobedience movement today. Then what could he do? He had claimed that non-violence was always more than a match for violence however well organized. How could he make that claim good? At the beginning of the War, English friends had written to him asking how individual pacifists could fight spreading wave of violence and bloodshed. He had suggested fasting as one of the remedies. Some of them had laughed at the suggestion, but he stuck to it. A time might come for him to test that remedy in his own case. That was perhaps the only way to wake up the conscience of mankind.
 Untouchability was another manifestation of violence. He had repeated it from house-tops that if untouchability lived Hinduism must perish. The two could not go on side by side. Though much progress was made why did it still persist?
 Then. there was the question of communal disharmony. It was also a manifestation of violence. He had striven against it from his early youth.
 Why did his non-violence appear to be impotent in the face of these various manifestations of untruth and violence? Was he an unworthy exponent of non- violence? Should he not again crucify the flesh in order to become a better instrument? Knowing the remedy, how could he evade it? That the fast might fail to bring about the desired result or might end in death should not be a deterrent.
 Asked about the nature of the fast, he said he did not know it himself. He was still groping. He was not aware as to when it would come, if at all. All he could say was that the call was insistent.
 If the fast did come, he hoped that the people would not become panicky or grief-stricken. He expected them to co-operate with him in clearing the air of
 
 violence in every shape or form. That was the best way of ending the fast and even of preventing it.

 LETTER FROM T. B. SAPRUlibtech_740_footnote
 Personal	October 25, 1944
 MY DEAR GANDHIJI,
 I have just read in The Hindustan Times of the 24th of October your statement issued after the enquiry made by Mr. Horniman as to whether you are contemplating another fast to achieve communal unity. I know I have no place as an adviser in these matters and I am most reluctant to offer advice to anyone in regard to any matter which is based on spiritual considerations. I am approaching the whole thing from a secular point of view. I think it would be a great mistake to undertake a fast at this time of your life. The consequences might be disastrous. I do not think that your fast will be helpful in the solution of the communal problem. You may undertake a fast by way of penance, purification or protest, but the real question is as to what effect it is going to produce on the minds of those without whose agreement there can be no communal settlement. I do not think those who are taking a different view will be at all influenced by your fast. Indeed some of them may uncharitably suggest that you are putting undue pressure on them. Personally speaking I think that it is very necessary that you must continue to live. Your failure on the last occasion does not mean that you will always fail. Your motives are pure and I think your approach to the whole question is sound, if I may respectfully say so. What you have not been able to achieve so far, God willing, you may achieve it a few months later. I consider it my duty to write to you as plainly as I possibly can against the step which is said to be within your contemplation.
 You will forgive me if I have encroached upon your time . . . .
 With kindest regards,
 Yours sincerely,
 MAHATMA M. K. GANDHI SEVAGRAM

 LETTER 	FROM T. B. SAPRUlibtech_741_footnote 
 Personal and Confidential	GYAN BAGH,
 HYDERABAD DECCAN,
 November 4, 1944
 MY DEAR MAHATMAJI,
 Your two letters of the 1st and the 3rd of November were handed over to me yesterday at the Wardha station by Devdas. I also received your letter through Dr. Beni Prasad.
 I have not issued any statement about an All Parties Conference but have written to certain friends and am awaiting their replies. The idea seems to me to be vague and indefinite. We must decide as to who are the persons to be invited and what will be the agenda. It is quite clear that the gentlemen whom we invite will not come there in their representative capacity. Your presence at the Conference will be a source of great strength and you can certainly make a statement telling us in plain language as to what led to the breakdown of the conversations at Bombay. You say the Conference may meet to consider the causes of the failure of the talks and to find whose fault it was which led to the breakdown. I should not advise that Conference to find whose fault it was, because once we do it will lead to interminable controversy. If  we call such a Conference and hear you I think we may consider what further steps it is necessary to take to solve the problem. From this point of view the proposed conference will be an exploratory one and may thus ‘inform and educate public opinion’.
 I am very anxious that you should on no account undertake a fast. I know how deeply spiritual you are and I also know that in your case the call of religion means much more than in the case of 99 out of a hundred. You will pardon me if I take a matter-of-fact and practical view of the thing. I am definitely certain that although it may bring solace to your heart and you may feel that you have done the penance for what you consider to be the evils of the present day, your fast will not melt the heart  of your opponents. On the contrary I feel some of them may be uncharitable enough to attribute to you unworthy motives. Never before in our history was it more necessary than now that you should live to guide the people of this country on tile true path of nationalism. My own conviction is and has been for years that irrespective of what the British Government may or may not do this monster of communalism should be killed. Whatever your critics may say I honestly believe that you are the one man in the country who does not think on communal lines and it would be a disaster for the country if it was deprived at this juncture of your guidance.
 
 You are the one man who can withstand opposition, ridicule and even the attribution of unworthy motives to you. Above all you have the courage to take the right line. I am saying that in absolute sincerity even though I differ from you and have differed from you in regard to civil disobedience.
 I have told Devdas that according to my information some changes in high quarters may be expected, but whether that information is true or not, the existing situation cannot last very long and when the time comes for practical steps to be taken towards the settlement of national differences I believe your voice will be the determining factor. I do not want that voice to be silenced. I am, therefore, appealing to you with all the earnestness I am capable of not to undertake such a fast.
 As regards my coming to Wardha if I can get away on the evening of the 7th or the 8th and arrangements can be made for reservations from Wardha to Itarsi and from Itarsi to Allahabad I should in response to your message like to break journey at Wardha for a few hours. . . .
 With my profound regards,
 Yours sincerely,

                RESPECTED BAPUJI,  APPENDIX V  LETTER FROM 	DURLAB SINGHlibtech_744_footnote         LAHORE,  November 	12, 1944 
  . 	. . The Congress had promised in its Lahore Resolution of 1929 that 	no constitution would be acceptable to the Congress which does not 	give the fullest satisfaction to the Sikhs. You know a large number 	of Sikhs are perturbed over Rajaji’s proposals. Supposing Mr. 	Jinnah had accepted the proposals in full, or in an amended form, 	what would have been the position of the Sikhs in that?  Even 	the Akalis feel very indignant because you did not touch the 	question of meeting a Sikh deputation as suggested by Master Tara 	Singh in his letter. Can you please make it clear why it was not 	considered desirable to invite the Sikh leaders before proceeding to 	Mr. Jinnah for the talks?  Mr. 	Jagat Narain Lal’s Resolution clearly states that the Congress 	would be no party to the vivisection of the country. Is it not a 	fact that Rajaji’s proposals run counter to that resolution? The 	Sikh public is made to believe that Gandhiji does not favour the 	idea of the Sikhs remaining in the Congress because of their belief 	in the sword. . . .  Master 	Tara Singh and other responsible Akali leaders have often declared 	in the Press and on the platform that the Sikander-Baldev Singh Pact 	was enacted with the consent and blessings of the Congress High 	Command and Sardar Patel’s special representative who was present 	in the Punjab throughout the negotiations and that the Sardar was 	kept informed of all the developments. Further, it is said that the 	Azad Punjab scheme was introduced with your consent and blessings. 	The nationalist Sikhs regard both the schemes as anti-national and 	opposed to the interests of the country and the community. Can you 	kindly guide us in the matter?  In 	the end I will request you, Bapuji, to give a general assurance to 	the nationalist Sikhs that their interests are safe in your hands 	and that they will not be sacrificed at any cost. The heart of the 	Sikh masses is with the Congress and nationalism and patriotism are 	their proud heritage. They cannot depart from these principles, but 	let them have this satisfaction at least that the Congress will do 	no injustice to them and that they will have their proper place in 	free India.  Praying 	for your long life,

 RESOLUTION PASSED BY A.I.S.A.libtech_745_footnote
 [On or before December 3, 1944]
 A meeting of the Board of Trustees of the Charkha Sangh was held at Sevagram on the 1st, 2nd and 3rd December 1944, under the presidentship of Shree Gandhiji and the following decisions were taken:
 The roots of the spinning-wheel lie in the villages and the consummation of the ideal of the Charkha Sangh is to be completely decentralized among the villages of India to bring about an all-round improvement of village life. This meeting of the Board of Trustees of the Charkha Sangh therefore resolves that with a view to this end the following changes should be made in the policy of the Sangh:
   As 		many qualified workers as are ready and are selected by the Board 		should be 		sent to 		work in 		the villages.  The 		activities of 		the existing 		sale depots 		and production 		centres of khadi 		should be curtailed.  Necessary 		changes should be made 		in the 		curricula of 		the existing 		khadi training 		centres and 		their scope broadened. 		New training 		centres should 		also be 		opened.  If 		in any area (not bigger 		than a 		district) the 		workers ask 		to be made 		self-sufficient and 		autonomous in 		order to 		begin work on 		the new lines 		laid down by the 		Charkha Sangh the 		Sangh should, if 		it approves of 		their plans, withdraw 		from that area 		but continue 		to give 		its recognition 		and moral 		support so long 		as the 		work is 		carried on 		according to 		its policy.  A 		Joint Board of 		the nominees 		of the 		Charkha Sangh, Gram 		Udyog Sangh, Harijan 		Sevak Sangh and Goseva 		Sangh should 		be constituted 		to meet 		from time to time and issue instructions in terms of the new policy.  
 The Sangh shall be represented in the Joint Board by its President, its Secretary and Shri Dhirendra Majmudar, while the other four Sanghs shall have two nominees each besides Gandhiji.

 APPENDIX VII
 GUIDELINES FOR PROPOSED INTERIM GOVERNMENTlibtech_746_footnote
 January 5, 1945
 The following were the various steps proposed to be taken in this behalf as they emerged from their discussion and the elucidations provided by Gandhiji from time to time:
    The 			Congress and 			the League would agree 			that they would join 			in forming 			an Interim 			Government in the 			Centre (a) 			consisting of 			equal numbers of 			persons nominated by 			the Congress and 			the League in 			the Central 			Legislature, (b) 			representatives of 			minorities, and 			(c) the Commander-in-Chief.  While 			the Government 			would be formed 			and would 			function within the 			framework of the existing 			Government of 			India Act, it would be clearly 			 understood between the 			Congress and 			the League that any 			measure not 			passed by 			the House 			should not be 			enforced or 			sought to 			be enforced by 			any of 			the powers 			 of the 			Governor-General under 			the Constitution. 			This would serve to 			eliminate in 			action the 			veto of the 			Governor-General and 			make the nominees 			responsible to the 			elected Legislature.  The 			European member, if 			one had to 			be included, should be 			the choice 			of the Congress and the League.  It 			should be agreed between the Congress 			and the  League  in 			advance that if 			such Interim Government 			was formed” 			their first step would be 			to release 			the members 			of the Working 			Committee. A firm 			and clear 			commitment of the League in regard to this would be a preliminary proof of its bona fides.  Bhulabhai 			must make sure before 			committing himself to 			anything that 			the agreement 			he had 			in view 			had the previous 			approval of Jinnah 			and the whole 			thing should be 			clarified and reduced to writing so as not to lead to any 			ambiguity   or misunderstanding afterwards.  If 			such a 			Government was 			formed at 			the Centre, 			the next 			step would be to 			get the withdrawal of 			Governor’s rule in 			the Provinces and 			to form, as 			soon as 			possible, Provincial 			Governments on the 			lines of 			a coalition.  At 			the proper moment 			Gandhiji would tell the 			Working Committee that 			Bhulabhai had 			acted with his approval.

 LETTER FROM P. C. JOSHIlibtech_747_footnote
 BOMBAY,
 February 1,1945
 
DEAR GANDHIJI,
 My last letter to you was dated 28th September, 1944. You had promised  in an earlier letter that you will refer the question of our moral bona fides and your what I may call anti-Communist file to your worthy colleagues. I hope they have reached their conclusions and reported to you. But I have not heard anything from you yet.
 You perhaps do not know that your name is being used against us in the recent Congressmen’s Conferences and even otherwise by persons who pretend to know your mind, etc. I know that most of what they attribute to you could never have been said by you. But my own lips are sealed till my correspondence with you is concluded over the questions you asked me and they were very serious questions, doubting our elementary patriotic and moral bona fides. I hope with the help of your Working Committee colleagues” you have reached the conclusion that we are not unworthy children of our great people.
 Great things are happening in the world but our country is going to pieces. We are anxious to write to you on the big political issues but as I wrote to you before” it will be waste of your time and mine till you are convinced about our intellectual honesty and moral integrity.
 I understand from Dr. Mahmud that you think that you are the aggrieved party. This is exactly the opposite of what we feel. I” of course, meant no offence but only expressed my indignation at my Party being slandered and offered to go into the dock straightaway. I do not know what else I could do. Sjt. Bhulabhai and Mrs. Naidu had promised to speed up the matter but I have not heard from them at all. Rajaji told me that he had already told you all that he had to.
 May I request you for an answer as soon as you can and to get your colleagues speed up their report to you.
 I could send Mohan to pick up the answer and answer any further questions he feels himself qualified to tackle. I am going to Bengal for three weeks today. Could your answer be ready by the time I am back? Mohan will be very busy in my absenceand will find it very difficult to come there in February” unless you specially want him to; but any date after 7 March will be best.
 With respectful salutations,
 Yours sincerely,

 LETTER FROM T. B. SAPRUlibtech_748_footnote
 January 13, 1945
 
 MY DEAR MAHATMAJI,
 I hope you are better now. I have been reading the news about your health in the newspapers.
 I have now much pleasure in sending you herewith a copy of the questionnaire framed by the committee of which I am the Chairman. I dare say your attention has already been called to it. I shall be extremely grateful to you if you will favour the committee with a short memorandum stating your views generally and answering the questions or such of them as you prefer to answer.
 So far there has been a good response to the committee excepting in certain quarters. Mr. Jinnah has declined to recognize the committee or to meet me as Chairman of the committee though he has no objection to meeting me in my individual capacity. Dr. Ambedkar promised support when we first met in November last at Delhi but has withdrawn it because he has objection to the personnel of the committee. The attitude of the Sikhs has been very encouraging so far. I am going on the 16th of January to Lahore to see the Sikh and Hindu leaders and shall try also to meet such Muslim leaders as have no objection to meeting me.
 The work of the committee is being done at great pressure. We have already collected much material and more will be ready soon. I do not wish to trouble you with details but I shall be extremely grateful if you will favour me with a short memorandum. I am also sending you separately the two pamphlets already brought out, others are in the course of being printed.
 With kindest regards and best wishes for your early recovery,
