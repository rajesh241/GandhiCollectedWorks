A large number of Muslims was present. Gandhiji, Jamnadas Dwarkadas and Shankarlal Banker were among those specially invited. Kadarbhai, in introducing Gandhiji to the. meeting, said that the latter had throughout his life tried to see that the differences between the Hindus and the Mahomedans were obliterated, and that his passive resistance struggle in South Africa was principally for the Mahomedans, because three-fourths of the Indian commerce was in the hands of the Mahomedans and that he had done in one day what years of British rule could not achieve in the union of the Hindus and the Mahomedans."

I went in and found Mr.Gandhi seated cross-legged on his couch, dressed in his usual coarse hand-woven clothes and with his spectacles on, busy writing a letter to some friend of his in Gujarati. The letter-paper, pencil and envelope were apparently of the more common swadeshi type, for I noticed the paper was none too fine, the pencil had to be pressed hard to make an impression, and the envelope would not easily open in the prevailing weather . I noticed also that one of the curls of his spectacles had broken midway and was being held in position by a piece of thread knotted round his head. I was wondering why a fresh curl had not been put in, but soon found a broken curl was not without its uses, as it served well enough for a toothpick on occasions. Well, when Mr. Gandhi looked up from his writing and saw me, his thin asetic face lighted up with a charming smile as he recognized me, and bade me sit down and excuse him for a few minutes as he finised his letter.”"
