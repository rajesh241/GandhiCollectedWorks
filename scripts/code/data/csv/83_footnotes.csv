libtech_95_footnote,"1The Viceroy, writing to Amery, summarized Mirabehn’s talk with Laithwaite on July 17, as follows: (a) She continued to insist on vital necessity for full acceptance of Gandhi’s demand for recognition of Indian independence. Nothing else could possibly save a situation which was very rapidly deteriorating. Gandhi was inspired by pure friendship for us. We were loathed through the country by all parties, Congress or non-Congress. Only Congress (subject to the  declaration  of independence) could remedy the situation. Once the declaration had been made everything would fall properly into its place. Disunity would disappear, etc., etc. (b) Gandhi had on the last occasion taken steps to call off the movement where there had been cases of violence. On this occasion, he would do his very utmost to ensure non- violence. But he would not feel justified in calling the movement off merely because cases of violence occurred. He could not do so without doing greater violence to the ideals for which he was working. (c) Gandhi was greatly moved in his decision to press this policy by the state of moral degradation into which he thought the country had fallen. It must regain its own soul. At the moment it was prepared, while hating the British, to lick their boots. This is an intolerable position and no price was too high to pay to remedy it. (d) On the last occasion Congressmen put in prison had obeyed the rules and been strictly non-violent. That would not be so now. It would be   a case of victory or death. Gandhi might be put in prison, etc., but could not be kept there. She hinted definitely that he intended to see the business to a finish, even at the cost of his own life. He would do all he could to guide the movement on non-violent lines, but must be left free to guide it. If he was not left to guide it by word or writing there was nothing left for him but death. (That no doubt may be the meaning of Gandhi’s statement to the Press about a short and swift struggle.) She was given no reason to hope that any modification of our attitude could be looked for or that the Congress claim could be entertained. The Transfer of Power, Vol. II, pp. 407-8"

He was reported by his secretary, Mr. Desai, in  June  as saying: ‘My attitude has undergone a change. I cannot afford to wait. I must even at obvious risks ask the people to resist slavery.’ Mr. Gandhi declared that for national independence they might have to face bombs, bullets and shells. Does this look like a purely non-violent movement? Mr. Gandhi added, as to the method of resistance: ‘No doubt the non-violent way is the best but where that does not come naturally . . . violent way is both necessary and honourable, and inaction here is rank cowardice and unmanly.’...

In 	accordance with 	their known policy 	in regard 	to correspondence 	or interviews 	with Mr. Gandhi, 	the Government 	of India 	have decided that 	this letter cannot be 	forwarded and 	have so informed 	Mr. Gandhi 	and Mr. Jinnah. 	They are not prepared 	to give 	facilities for 	political correspondence 	or contact 	to a 	person detained 	for promoting 	an illegal 	mass movement 	which he has 	not disavowed, and 	thus gravely embarrassing 	India’s war 	effort at 	a critical 	time. It 	rests with Mr. 	Gandhi to 	satisfy the 	Government of 	India that he 	can safely be 	allowed once more to 	participate in 	the public affairs of 	the country, 	and until 	he does 	so the 	disabilities from 	which he suffers 	are of 	his own 	choice.” However, from 	the document published in 	The Transfer 	of Power, 	Vol. III, 	pp. 974-6, 	it is evident 	that the Viceroy 	of India 	was of the view 	that the letter 	should be forwarded 	and that 	Jinnah, if he wished 	to meet 	Gandhiji, should be 	allowed to 	do so."

Mr. Gandhi was not present at this meeting, but he sent for the consideration of the Working Committee a draft resolution which was the direct precursor of the resolution of July 14. ‘Japan’s quarrel,’ he states in the draft, ‘is not with India.

But we want certain facilities now. We shall defend you against aggression. We want aerodromes, freedom to pass our troops through your country. This is necessary in self-defence.’ They might seize strategic points and proceed to Iraq, etc. The masses won’t be touched if only the strategic points are captured.

Yet he proposed embarking on a movement in which he expressed the hope that all classes and communities would join, and in which he directed every man and woman to consider themselves free and to think and act for themselves. Contrast this with his previous movement, the ‘satyagraha campaign’ of 1940-41, in which, in order to maintain the desired standard of non-violence, he had been forced to limit participation to specially selected satyagrahis, who were even then only allowed to commit a special formal offence; remember too that he had before him the example of his previous movements, each professedly non-violent, yet each giving rise to the most hideous violence. The certainty that his movement could not remain non-violent is plain enough and, if further indication were wanted, it is supplied in the extracts, from Mr Gandhi’s own writings quoted in the preceding paragraphs, which make it clear that even if violence and rioting occurred during the movement, this would not deter him, that he was prepared to go to the extremest limit” (The Indian Annual Register, 1942, Vol. II, p. 185)."
