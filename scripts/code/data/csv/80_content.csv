MY DEAR SUBHAS,
 You are irrepressible whether ill or well. Do get well before going in for fireworks.
 I have not been in consultation with Maulana Saheb. But, when I read in the papers about the decision, I could not help approving of it.  I am surprised that you won’t distinguish between discipline and indiscipline.
 
 But I quite agree with you that either of you is more than a match for the Maulana Saheb as far as popularity is concerned. But a man has to put conscience before popularity. I know that in Bengal it is difficult to function effectively without you two. I know, too, that you can carry on even without the Congress. But the Congress has to manage somehow under the severe handicap.

8,"December 30, 1940",LETTER TO SIR J. G. LAITHWAITE,"
  
 SEVAGRAM, WARDHA,
 December 30, 1940
 
 DEAR MR. LAITHWAITE,
I thank you for your letterlibtech_15_footnotelibtech_16_footnoteof 27th instant, received yesterday.
 Your letter raises a fundamental question. I can fully appreciate the fact that His Excellency could only hold the view he does. The
 
 despair of Indian nationalists like me has been that British functionaries could not be persuaded to see the other side of the shield. And so the distance between them and nationalists is growing in spite of all efforts to the contrary. The present struggle is the latest attempt among many to induce the makers of the British Empire to see things through nationalist eyes. Such attempt must be continued till the truth is brought home to them. Why should they constitute themselves the judges of their work among and on us? The ordinary rule is that those should be the final judges who are the beneficiaries and not the self-styled benefactors.But I must not enter into the interminable discussion of a question on which the British rulers and we must for the present differ.
 But that difference can be no reason for gagging me. I sought for the assistance because all the means of communication are under the Government control. I was unprepared for the prohibition against the Indian Press. I was prepared for the gag outside. His Excellency must be the sole judge of the effect on the bona-fide war effort of my letter to Herr Hitler being published in the world in the manner I had intended. But I observe from your letter that the gag has been placed not for reasons of high policy but because, in His Excellency’s opinion, my characterization of British rule is not true to facts. This is a dangerous doctrine of which the logical result would be suppression of all honest opinion except at the will of the executive head of the State or his deputy or deputies. This has evidently no bearing on the war issue. I may draw His Excellency’s attention to the fact that the sentiments expressed by me in the open letter to Herr Hitler are those  I have expressed often enough in the columns of Harijan and elsewhere. My booklet  called  Hind  Swarajlibtech_17_footnotelibtech_18_footnoteor  Indian  Home  Rule contains similar sentiments.
 I should like to know, if I may, whether my interpretation of your letter is correct.
 I may mention that I had copies of the letter prepared for distribution to the Press. But owing to the Press Adviser’s note I refrained from distributing the copies. I have sent a copy only to my son forbidding its publication for the time being. I do not want surreptitious publication, nor do I want to resort to open defiance, so
 
 long as it is at all possible consistently with the interests of the national cause as I conceive it. I shall, therefore, anxiously await a line from you.libtech_19_footnote

29,"January 10, 1941",INSTRUCTIONS TO SATYAGRAHIS,"
  
 SEVAGRAM,
 January 10, 1941
 A very serious question confronts me in connection with the struggle. In many places magistrates; have been imposing heavy fines on civil resisters, in some cases without option of imprisonment. Civil resisters must not and cannot complain of whatever penalty is imposed on them, and Government will always take advantage of weaknesses of human nature. Hitherto I have advised that fines should not be voluntarily paid but that authorities must be left to collect fines by distraint.  The result  during  the   last   struggle   was   a   great   deal of heart-burning and bitterness. Those who bought movables or immovables for a song incurred popular ill will. I hope that if Government wish to touch immovable property, they will not sell but confiscate it. For, whenever the struggle ends, immovable  property  is bound to be restored to the original owners—the resisters. The late Bombay Government knew how difficult it was for them to restore to the resisters the immovable properties that had changed hands. I have, however, discovered what may be termed a flaw in the reasoning that I had applied to the infliction of fines. I now feel that even as a resister courts imprisonment, he is expected to court any other form of punishment, i.e., fines. Punishment courted has to be joyfully suffered. Therefore when fines are imposed and the person fined is able to pay he must do so willingly. The result may naturally be that such a person will be fined again and again. If he persists in his resistance, he may have no property left. This is nothing to be wondered at. As a matter of fact it is the essence of civil disobedience that the resister becomes indifferent whether the authorities take away all his property or not. Therefore all propertied persons who wish to join the struggle should do so well knowing that the whole of their property may be taken up by the Government. This is a struggle which has no ending except in success. Therefore those who may be
 fined should pay cash if they have it. If they have no cash and the Government attach their property, it should be open to their friends to buy the same. This will be an effective check on the cupidity of those who would profit by exploiting others’ loss and there will be no bad blood. One corrollary to this reasoning is that even as I had declared that every inch of immovable property sold or confiscated by the Government would have to be returned to the resisters, so will every rupee taken in fines have to be returned to them on the struggle ending. It follows of course that those who pay the fines will have to offer civil disobedience till they are safely lodged in jail. It follows also that those propertied persons who do not wish to run the risk of losing their property must not join this struggle. I hope however that patriotic people who believe in the efficacy of civil resistance will not fight shy of losing all their possessions. Let them remember the words of Sheth Jamnalal:
 I have long since come to realize that much too heavy a price has been and is being paid by the few for the enjoyment of wealth and for the apparent safety of life. The price paid is the blood of the famishing millions and the manliness of those who should be ready to shed their blood for the defence of themselves, their families and their country.

       January 	11, 1941  	I hope that every man and woman in India,  whether  Congressman or 	other, will realize the gravity of the struggle and will resolve on 	the forthcoming Independence Day upon dedicating himself or herself 	to the service of the country in  terms  of the millions. Swaraj 	based on non-violence does not mean mere transfer of power. It 	should mean complete deliverance of the toiling yet starving 	millions from the dreadful evil of economic serfdom. This can only 	be attained by the propertied few identifying themselves with the 	millions and by their readiness to sacrifice their all for the 	latter’s sake. It must be a day of fraternization, abolition of 	untouchability from our hearts, giving up spirituous liquors, 	self-spinning, and sale and spread of khadi and village industries. 	There is to be no civil disobedience that day. For, we  must   not  	invite  disturbance  of   our      
 meetings, processions and prabhat pherieslibtech_59_footnotelibtech_60_footnoteon that day. The day may begin with prabhat pheries, followed by flag-hoisting and flag-salutation. In the evening there may be processions terminating in public meetings where the pledgelibtech_61_footnotelibtech_62_footnotemay   be  explained  clause  by clause and administered by the Chairman and solemnly accepted by the audience. Where there are already restrictions they must  be  obeyed. From such voluntary obedience comes the strength for the right of civil resistance.
 PLEDGE libtech_63_footnote
 In view of the fact that individual civil disobedience has already commenced and that a large number of Congressmen have already been imprisoned all over India, it becomes the special duty of every Indian to concentrate with redoubled zeal on the constructive programme, without the fulfilment of which no civil disobedience, mass or individual, can help us to win and retain swaraj. Concretely expressed, constructive programme means the universalization of hand-spinning and khadi and popularization of village industries and village products. We recognize that effective spread of non-violence must bring communal harmony  and complete eradication of untouchability in every shape and form.

 MY DEAR IDIOT,
 Your wire has come in. I had fully intended to write yesterday. But it was no use. The interviews which began at 3 p.m. ended after the second dinner bell. So you were crowded out. But you had some
 
 letters redirected to you. That must have been some consolation.
 I hope you are having a profitable time therelibtech_64_footnote. You will insist on seeing Ambujam and on going to the Hindi Prachar Office.
 Ascertain the prices of the fruit you bring. You will bring coconut of course. But bring lemons (sour) too. They are scarce in the Wardha market. Das’s experiment is spreading. I have joined it with greater zeal than when you were here. I have given up cooked vegetables and the blood-pressure has dropped in a phenomenal manner. All the three times near or under 150 systolic and 100 diastolic. The reason is absence of gases.
 The notelibtech_65_footnoteI was drafting was finished today. You  may  see  it there or on your return journey.
 Shastriji is better. Remember me to your hostess. Love.

 SEVAGRAM, WARDHA,
 January 12, 1941
 Long   before   his   unexpected   arrestlibtech_66_footnotelibtech_67_footnoteMaulana   Saheb   had announced that before offering civil disobedience he would visit Sevagram and discuss with me important matters affecting the communal questions as also such other matters. But it was not to be. Non-popular rulers do not disclose their intentions to the  people. They allow them to be inferred from their acts. Perhaps it is a legitimate inference to draw from Maulana Saheb’s premature (from the Congress standpoint) arrest that they did not want him to meet me. There can be no cause for complaint in this. They  may  not  be expected to consult Congress convenience. But it is proper for Congressmen to realize that the rulers have no faith in Congress non-violence. Probably they do not consider me to be a knave, but they do consider me to be a fool. In so doing they only follow many others  who  think  that   Congressmen  fool  me   and  that   the  latter’s
 
 non-violence is but a cloak for hiding their violence, if it is not a preparation for it. Our struggle, therefore, consists in showing that our non-violence is neither a cloak to hide our violence or hatred, nor a preparation for violence in the near or distant future. Therefore our success depends not upon numbers going to jail but on the sum total of the purity and non-violence we are able to show in all our activities. Numbers can count only when they are of the right type. They will positively harm the movement, if they are of the wrong type.
 For me there is no turning back, whether I have many or very few satyagrahis. I would far rather be regarded as a fool but strong, than as a knave and a coward. Though the whole world may repudiate my claim, I must repeat that the struggle is God-guided. I am but a humble instrument in His hand. Without His guidance, real or imaginary, I should feel utterly impotent to shoulder the burden I am supposed to be carrying.
 Let me now say how I visualize the struggle. Maulana Saheb having gone, there is to be no successor appointed. Every acting President in a province must be approved by me. It is not necessary that there should be one. All representative Congressmen from members of village to provincial Committees are expected to be in jail if they are fit and approved by me. If they are not, by reason of health or otherwise, they cannot be expected to function except in rare cases and that too under my approval. No fresh elections are to take place to replace those who will have gone. The idea is ultimately for every Congressman to act on his own and be his own president but nobody else’s. That is the conception of a completely non-violent institution or society. Not much direction is required by those who have learnt the art of suffering. Everybody knows the conditions he has to fulfil for acquiring fitness for offering civil disobedience. They can be easily complied with by any adult who is sound in body and mind. No difficulty as to action arises so long as I am left free. For nobody can resort to direct action without my consent. My intention not to court arrest abides, but the rulers may have a different plan. If it comes, it will be the real time of freedom from external control be it ever so non-violent as also of true test for everyone. I am not to appoint a successor. Thus if I am arrested, everyone will be under the discipline of his or her own conscience. In theory, therefore, a time may come when millions will be judges of their own fitness to offer civil disobedience.
 This is not a struggle which can be ended quickly. We are resisting an authority that is in itself struggling to fight for life against a stubborn foe. The authority is related to a nation which knows no defeat. Those whose life is in danger either readily yield on what they regard as non-essential, or fight to the end on what they regard as essential. Its refusal to concede our demand shows that they think that our struggle comes under the latter category. Therefore our struggle must be coterminous at least with the European. Hence everyone who offers civil disobedience and gets a short term should know that on every release he has to repeat civil disobedience till the end of the struggle.
 There are two tactics demanding attention. I have already issued a notelibtech_68_footnotelibtech_69_footnoteabout fines without the option of imprisonment.
 The other is that of not arresting civil resisters at all. In each case the resisters should march on foot in easy stages in the direction of Delhi. It may be even two or three miles per day. The resister will march taking such food as the villagers may provide.

 As I sat down to reply to your letter of the 9th, I saw your letter of today. You have replied in this to your own previous letter. Ahimsa does not work in any other way. The defects that you have pointed out are there, but our Sangh is a mixed crowd. All sorts of people are there. If we can put up with them, we can bear with the world. If by keeping them with us we live happily, we can then some day hope for  a complete non-violent order.
But there are certain rules we have to observe. The question is
 how to put these rules into practice. As long as I live, the way I put them into practice becomes our rule. Look, patience will solve all problems. Don’t take to heart our shortcomings. It is enough if you know that they exist. You are trying to remove them. You are bound to succeed.
Even then speak out your mind.

 January 16, 1941
 
DEAR SIR GILBERT,
Many thanks for your letterlibtech_81_footnotelibtech_82_footnoteof the 4th instant.
 I am not going to write a serious reply to your extra serious letter. My letters are not written either for publication or for propaganda, They are written in pursuance of the effort to act non-violently. Nor are they written to a stranger. So much by way of preface.
 The language of officialdom is evidently a thing to be learnt specially. Your letter is an instance in point. In my own plain English I resolve your language thus:
 I forgot to tell you that His Excellency’s disagreement with you as to the estimate of the British connection was not the only reason for not complying with your request. It is inconvenient to give you the real or the whole reason. So please regard this correspondence as closed.
 Putting this interpretation upon your letter and reading it together with the last paragraph in it, I have finally decided not to contrive to secure publicity of the open letterlibtech_83_footnoteto Herr Hitler. I have accordingly asked my son not to make any use of the letter but to destroy it.
 I had toldlibtech_84_footnoteyou that I had not shown the letter to anyone else except  my  son.  I  have  since  shown  it  to  an  English  friendlibtech_85_footnotewho believes in my method. She is not to make use of her knowledge except among friends such as the Bishop of Calcutta. My hearty co-operation with His Excellency in preventing publication does not mean admission of the validity of the prohibition It is an earnest of my desire not to embarrass authority wherever it is possible for me to avoid embarrassment.
 
 But the action of the Censor in prohibiting the enclosedlibtech_86_footnotepasses comprehension. I entertain the fond hope that His Excellency knows nothing of the Censor’s action. I would like you very kindly to let me know whether it commands His Excellency’s approval. If it does and if I am to fall in with it, it will stop all open communication with the public. That would constitute an undue interference with the liberty of the Press, and would raise a grave issue. I shall hope that if it is at all possible, this will be avoided.
As the matter is very urgent may I expect an early reply?libtech_87_footnote

MY DEAR AGATHA,
 I have before me your letter of 30th October received yesterday. I do not write because I know not whether my letters will reach you at
 
 all. When they do they may be even out of date. And now one never knows what one may write. I do not mind the Censor reading what I write but I do mind his suppressing what one writes. And yet war is war. One must not grumble. Warriors want to win and they will not tolerate what in their opinion hinders their efforts. Knowing this, I am patient. I do not know what you can do. Here I am hampered at every step. I wrote what I thought was a good letterlibtech_90_footnotelibtech_91_footnoteto Herr Hitler. It has been suppressed. Of course I could secure publication at once. But I do not want to do so. I must bow to the Viceregal  judgment.  Evidently, he thinks it will interfere with their war-effort. Since open publication is possible only by their permission, I have deemed it proper not to seek publicity through defiance which must be initiated surreptitiously.
 But they have gone a step further. They are interfering with local publication of my statements which are necessary. I am, therefore, devising a method of securing publication. But no matter what hindrances are put, the struggle will continue. I can give you this assurance, if you need it, that nothing unworthy, nothing that may be even remotely called violent will be knowingly done. I have absolute faith that this non-violence will finally triumph. It must not be allowed to be suppressed. The M.P.s’ appeal has fallen flat.libtech_92_footnotelibtech_93_footnoteIt takes no note of the truth. Hindu-Muslim differences do not stand in the way of an honourable agreement. The will is not there. The old custom will not give way. They need not be blamed. They go on and, if they can, they do not stop to consider whether it is right or wrong. That is not rulers’ way. Theirs is but to rule.

But in such matters it is better to rely on faith rather than on reason. At least there is no harm in doing so. Charity must be prompted  by knowledge. I do not feel particularly tired.

  	I have your very kind letter. In it there is no acknowledgement of 	my cable replylibtech_107_footnoteto 	your cable referred to in your letter. My reply cabled 28thlibtech_108_footnoteOctober, 1940, was as follows:  All 	effort failed. Indian condition wholly different and unique. Press 	gagged. Have stopped Harijan 	weeklies. Restricting 	civil disobedience minimum requirements of non-violence.  	Since then I have sent you the following cablelibtech_109_footnotein reply to yours of the last week of December:      
 M.P.’s letter ignores facts. Frank open communication made impossible. God between us all.
I understand your argument. The Quaker attitude is individual.
 The Congress attitude has reference to a big organization. The Congress, as an institution based on non-violence, cannot distinguish between one species of violence and another. I do not think that the world will be any better if British arms are victorious over the German through the means employed by the latter. In the ultimate,  the  question before the Congress is how to do away with the use of arms as between man and man or nation and nation for the vindication of justice. The universal proposition is implicit in India’s fight for freedom through non-violence.
 You have rightly detected the flaw in the Congress attitude as reflected in the Poona resolution. That was when and why  I  had ceased to guide the Congress or take part in its deliberations. I  withdrew my opposition when the Congress retraced its steps through the later resolution at Bombay. In my opinion it reflects no discredit on the Congress that it could not abide by non-violence in all circumstances. Its policy is truth and non-violence. Above all else, therefore, it must be honest. When, therefore, it found the Poona demand flouted, it came round to its original position and invited me to lead the battle of civil disobedience. I had no hesitation in responding as I knew that the mass mind in India was by instinct non-violent. You seem also to have missed the fact that the Poona resolution would not have been passed at all but for my weakness of which I made ample confessionlibtech_110_footnotelibtech_111_footnotein the pages of Harijan.
 My experience is that the Congress has grown progressively, though slowly, in non-violence. And I would have  proved an unworthy exponent of non-violence if I had failed  at  the  right moment to express it through the Congress.
 The Congress is as much anti-Nazism as anti-imperialism. If the Government had not thoughtlessly forbidden the anti-war activity of the Congress and had not proclaimed it as pro-Nazi, they could easily have claimed the whole of India as anti-Nazi—both that part which followed the Congress non-violence and the other which believed in the use of violence. Had it not done so, much bitterness would have
 
 been avoided and the world would have profited by the lesson of tolerance and its moral opinion would have been on the  side  of Britain. It is never too late to mend one’s error.
 Whether, however, the error is admitted and mended or not the course of the Congress is clear. The conviction being purely moral it should be pursued irrespective of the immediate  result.  A  moral means is almost an end in itself. Is not virtue its own reward?

DEAR SIR TEJ BAHADUR,
 I have just finished reading your articlelibtech_112_footnotein the Twentiet Century. I quite agree with you that we have to settle our domestic troubles ourselves and without thinking whether the rulers will accept
our joint demands or not. Having that belief you should know that I
 specially wentlibtech_113_footnotelibtech_114_footnoteto Qaid-e-Azam Jinnah in Bombay and had   several talks, and then Subhas Babu went but we could make no headway. You perhaps know why. Then again, determined not to go to the Viceroy as strangers, I invited myself to his house in Delhilibtech_115_footnotelibtech_116_footnoteand from there we went together in his car but only to show our differences to the Viceroy. I would go again and again if I had not the knowledge that my going would cause irritation to him. I cannot crack a joke without exposing myself to being misunderstood. My impression is that he does not want a settlement till he has so consolidated the League position that he can dictate his terms to all the  parties concerned including the rulers. I  do not blame him for  having taken
 
 up that position, if he has. But with this impression it is useless for me to approach him. I often feel like writing to him but lose courage when it comes to the point of taking up my pen. But if you have faith why don’t you see him without being asked by anybody?
I hope you are keeping very good health.libtech_117_footnote

SHAHlibtech_120_footnote","
  	If it had been possible, I would have found some solution long ago. 	I smell some sort of a threat in your letter. If you wish to recover 	it through a court, why do you need my help? I have already written 	and told you that I have done all I could. I am helpless. You may do 	what you think best.  Vandemataram 	from  M. K. GANDHI [From 	Gujarati]  Bhavnagar 	Samachar, 17-12-1955       [Before January 26, 1941]libtech_121_footnote  	I am fighting the country’s struggle. The country includes 	students as much as other parts of the body politic. I have, 	however, a special claim upon the students and they upon me, for I 	regard myself still a student and also because, from the very 	commencement of my return to India, I have been in close touch with 	them and many of them have served the cause of satyagraha. 	Therefore, even if the whole of the student world were to repudiate 	me for causes which in their very nature must be temporary, I am not 	going to be deterred from tendering my advice for fear of rejection. 	Students cannot afford to have party politics. They may hear all 	parties, as they read all sorts of books, but their business is to 	assimilate the truth of all and reject the     
 balance. This is the only worthy attitude that they can take. Power politics should be unknown to the student world. Immediately they dabble in that class of work they cease to be students and  will, therefore, fail to serve the country in its crisis. And you as General Secretary would be ill serving the cause of the students if you take part in power politics.
 All communists are not bad as all Congressmen are not angels. I have therefore no prejudice against communists as such. Their philosophy, as they have declared it to me, I cannot subscribe to. I have great regard for Dr. Ashraf’s abilities. I have never questioned his love of his country but I am positive, he will one day be sorry for the wrong guidance he is giving to student world. But, inasmuch as he is enamoured of his views, as I am of mine, and we are equally obstinate, I despair of convincing him of his error and, therefore, never enter into argument with him. And he returns the compliment by avoiding me. But let the students remember that at the present moment I am fighting the country’s cause. I am not an inexperienced general, but a seasoned soldier of 50 years’ standing. Let them, therefore, think 50 times before rejecting my advice which is that they must not dabble in strikes without reference to me. I have never said or suggested that they may never resort to strikes. They should not forget my recent advicelibtech_122_footnoteto the Christ Church College students. I do not repent of that advice. Let them take full benefit of it.
 In   the   first   place   you   gave   me   nonelibtech_123_footnoteon   behalf   of   the Federation. In the second place, even if you had given any, I would not have taken it from you because you had no authority to give me assurance in advance.

70,"January 28, 1941",LETTER TO NEWSPAPER EDITORS,"
  
 SEVAGRAM,
 January 28, 1941
 
DEAR EDITOR,
 We have become so used to the Press gag that we hardly know that there is a partial paralysis of the Press. In the name of “war effort” all honest expression of opinion, if it is opposed to war effort as conceived by the official world, is effectively suppressed, unless an enterprising editor or publisher risks the loss of his Press. Thus my own effort, if my honesty be not questioned, is the true effort to end all war and therefore in no way anti-British or pro-German. If public opinion desired suppression, the Press would on its own initiative exclude news and opinions disliked by the public. But in India the majority of Indian Editors would gladly publish all the news about satyagraha if there was no gag.
 I wish to use my case by way of illustration. For the conduct of the campaign and for the sake even of keeping it within restraint, I have to issue statements from time to time. During four days two out of three such statements were suppressed. The reason assigned was as follows:
  January 	16, 1941. 	I am 	writing this 	to inform 	you that Mahatma 	Gandhi’s statement 	of January 12libtech_132_footnoteregarding 	continuance of 	the Civil Disobedience 	Movement was submitted 	for Press advice 	by two 	of the 	Press agencies 	but was not passed 	for publication. 	I am 	accordingly bringing the 	above fact to 	your notice.  January 	28, 1941. 	I am 	writing this 	to inform 	you that Mahatma 	Gandhi’s statement 	of January 10libtech_133_footnoteregarding payment 	of fines by 	satyagrahis, which 	was submitted for 	Press advice by 	two of 	the Press agencies, 	was not 	passed for 	publication, as 	being a 	prejudicial report 	containing incitement to 	carry on 	anti-war civil 	disobedience. I am 	accordingly bringing the 	above fact 	to your notice. 
 
 I used to send my statements through the usual news agencies. But when I found that they were censored, I had  to  send my statements to selected newspapers and so they found place in some of them. You can judge for yourself whether they were objectionable news. This method of sending statements on chance publication is precarious. As I had no intention of extending civil disobedience to the special Press laws and ordinances, I stoppedlibtech_134_footnotelibtech_135_footnotethe   three  Harijan weeklies whose chief aim was to propagate non-violence and what is known as the constructive programme. I do not want so far as possible to extend the scope of civil disobedience beyond the present limit. But I do not know that I can exercise that restraint if the Press abdicates its function of publishing relevant news. I therefore appeal to the Press not to succumb to the gag but to assert its independence by publish- ing all the satyagraha news in its fullness. Of course it is open to the Editors to criticize and condemn the movement or the statements that may be issued. Editors can signify their disapproval of the gag by either publishing the offending statements and risking prose-cution or even confiscation of the Press or by stopping publication of their papers altogether by way of protest. These are only two out of many ways for signifying your disapproval.
 I observe that the Standing Committee of Editors is meeting on the 1st proximolibtech_136_footnotelibtech_137_footnote. The Committee is expected fearlessly to vindicate the liberty of the Press. It must cease to be the power it should be, if it submits to suppression of free public opinion.
 I need hardly draw attention to the fact that in a subject country like India, the liberty of the Press is doubly precious. And your responsibility, if you represent British-owned Press, is very great at the present critical moment in the history of this country.
 I need hardly also draw attention to the fact that I represent unadulterated non-violence whose spread can do nobody any harm. It is false and cruel to suggest that I could have anything in common with Nazism or Fascism because I happen to oppose imperialism.
 Yours sincerely,
 M. K. GANDHI

 CHI. MANJULA,
 I got your letter. You did well in writing about Prabhashankar. I shall write to him.
 You say that all of you will come over in May. Why so late? It is very hot in May. If you are not afraid of the heat, it is all right. It will take time for your quarters to get ready. But I shall be able to accommodate you in the quarters that are getting ready and make arrangements for a separate kitchen for you. A suitable building for that will be ready soon. I will let you know as soon as it is ready. Anyway you can come whenever you wish to. As you can put up with inconveniences, I do not worry about you.
 Do observe the vow of brahmacharya which you have taken. I would be happy if you could observe it. After the birth of a certain number of children, everyone should observe brahmacharya. As this
 
 is not done, people resort to artificial means of birth-control. But the practice cannot but do harm in the end. It destroys  morality. According to me life without self-control has no meaning. Without self-control no real service is possible. Those who wish to observe brahmacharya should lead a simple and disciplined life. They should keep themselves physically and mentally well occupied all the time. One’s reading, too, should be such as will fill one’s mind with good thoughts. Both husband and wife should devote themselves to public service, so that they might not even feel the desire for pleasure. If you want to ask me anything more, do so. You should, of course, do nothing beyond your capacity. Only rare persons succeed in observing self-control., If, therefore, you two cannot observe it for a long time, what need I say? Hence both of you should think over the matter yourselves and do what you think best.
 Devdas told me that Magan was thinking of going to Poona. If you decide not to stay here, Poona would of course be better than Delhi.
Urmila is all right.

             SIR,     SEVAGRAM, WARDHA,  February 	10, 1941   Your 	word to me written so earnestly in your issue of February 
 7, 	demands a reply.  	In spite of your disbelief, I must adhere to my faith in the 	possibility of the most debased human nature to respond to non- 	violence. It is the essence of non-violence that it conquers all 	opposition. That I may not express myself that measure of non- 	violence, and the rest may express less is highly probable. But I 	will not belittle the power of non-violence or distrust the Fuhrer’s 	capacity to respond to true non-violence.  	The illustrations you have cited in support of your disbelief are 	all unhappy because wholly inapplicable. A man is not necessarily 	non-violent because he lays down his arms. The Czechs, the Danes, 	the Austrians, and the Poles may have all acted most wisely, but 	certainly not non-violently. If they could have put up successful 	armed resistance, they would have done so and would have deserved 	well of their countrymen. Nor is it for me to blame them for 	submission when resistance became vain. It was, however, order to 	meet such contingen- cies and in order to enable even the physically 	weakest persons not to feel powerless against physically strong 	persons fully armed with      Sind. 
 modern weapons of destruction that satyagraha was discovered and applied in South Africa in 1907libtech_171_footnotelibtech_172_footnote. And it has since been successfully applied under varying and even baffling circumstances. You  will  please excuse me for refusing to draw a distinction in kind between the forces I have had to cope with hitherto and what I may have to cope with if the Fuhrer attacked India. The prospect of his killing every satyagrahi causes neither terror nor despair. If India has to go through such a purgatory and if a fair number of satyagrahis face the Fuhrer’s army and die without malice in their breasts, it would be a new experience for him. Whether he responds or not, I am quite clear that these satyagrahis facing the army will go down in history as heroes and heroines at least equal to those of whom we learn in fables or cold history.
 You are, however, on less weak ground when you doubt the honesty or non-violence of my companions. You are entitled to throw the Poona resolution in my face. I have already confessedlibtech_173_footnotelibtech_174_footnotethat the Poona resolution would not have been passed but for my momentary weakness. As to the want of honesty or defective non-violence, I can only say that the future alone will show whether satyagrahis were only so-called or as honest and true as human beings can be. I can only assert that every care has been taken in making the selection to ensure a fair standard of non-violence. I admit, however, that hypocrites have undoubtedly crept in. But I entertain the belief that the vast majority will be found to be true. The Congress President has been frank enough to define the limitations of his non-violence.libtech_175_footnotelibtech_176_footnoteBut so far as I know his mind—and nobody does if I do not—his non-violence will be proof against any temptation within the limits defined by him. I should undertake to engage in non-violent resistance to the Fuhrer if I had companions with the Maulana Saheb’s circumscribed belief. Whether such non-violence can stand the test or not, is a moot question. I have achieved success till now with such material.
You are incorrect in attributing to me a demand for unfettered
 
 liberty of the Press or speech.libtech_177_footnotelibtech_178_footnotelibtech_179_footnoteWhat I have saidlibtech_180_footnotelibtech_181_footnoteis that there should be unfettered liberty provided that it is not inconsistent with non-violence. I am not aware that Congress Ministers’ restrictive action went beyond the proviso. If it did, it was certainly against the declared Congress policy and can be no guide or criterion for me.
 The unkindest cut is contained in the insinuation that  my  demand for free speech, subject to the proviso mentioned, was “a device for squeezing political concessions from the British”. There would be nothing politically wrong if political concessions were demanded even at the point of civil disobedience. But it is a matter of public knowledge that the Poona resolution has lapsed. And in so far as I am concerned, it remains lapsed so long as the war lasts. Civil disobedience would certainly be withdrawn if free speech is genuinely recognized and the status quo restored. I have never stated during previous movements that they were likely to be long drawn out. But I have done so this time because I believe that there  can  be  no settlement with the Congress, short of complete independence during the pendency of the war, for the simple reason that the  Congress cannot commit itself to active help in war with men and money. That would mean a reversal of the policy of non-violence which the Congress has pursued for the last 20 years. And independence cannot come through any settlement while the war lasts. Therefore so far as I know, the Congress will be satisfied with the fullest freedom to grow in non-violence. The Congress demand concerns all persons and parties.
 You ask me in the face of all these facts whether it is “fair or morally right to pursue his (my) present campaign”. You have answered the question yourself in the negative. But I may not accept your answer. In the first place, as shown above, I do not subscribe to your facts. Secondly, to accept your answer will be to declare my utter insolvency. I would be untrue to the faith I have unwaveringly held now for nearly half a century in the efficacy of non-violence. I may seemingly fail, but even at the risk of being completely misunderstood  I must live and act according to my faith and belief that I am serving
 
 India, Britain and humanity. I do not wish well to India at the expense of Britain as I do not wish well to Britain at the expense of Germany. Hitlers will come and go. Those who believe that when the Fuhrer dies or is defeated his spirit will die, err grievously. What matters is how we react to such a spirit, violently or non-violently. If we react violently, we feed that evil spirit. If we act non-violently, we sterilize it.
 You ask me to devote myself to internal unity. Well, my passion for it is as old as that for non-violence. Indeed, my first non-violent experiment outside the domestic circle was to promote that unity. And I had considerable success. I ask you, therefore, to believe me that my effort for unity is not suspended but intensified by the present movement. The great beauty of non-violent effort lies in the fact that its failure can only harm those who are in it, while its success is sure to promote all-round good.

 It is understood that Mahatma Gandhi has disapproved of the proposal of the Berar Provincial Congress Committee to start training camps for satyagrahis.
 Mahatma Gandhi is reported to have told Mr. Vamanrao Joshi, President of the Berar Provincial Gongress Committee, when he interviewed him recently, not to start such training camps as it might be banned by the Government and that he did not want to embarrass the Government.
 Mahatma Gandhi had no objection for starting centres for training purely constructive workers.

Have belief in service and work. This is a greater duty.
 Mahatma Gandhi, it is learnt, has insisted on the necessity for intensifying constructive work which is as equally important as satyagraha.
Do not flatter your opponents but try to win them over by work
 and love and convert them to your view or bring them into the Congress fold as true believers in the Congress programme.

 Your duty is to behave affectionately with all, and also not to allow breaches of the rule. It means that you are not to be a party, but should let me know when the rule is broken.libtech_198_footnoteBut what is the rule? Ekadash Vratlibtech_199_footnoteis of course there.

It is to put the urine bucket elsewhere. Tell me the difficulty you have on account of Anjanadevi. I will try to remove it. Her sons are good, specially Pratap.

  	I have your letterlibtech_203_footnote. 	I had to delay replying to you because I got your copy of Subhas 	Babu’s letter first and then his own letter.     
 The differences in our case are vital and fundamental. Subhas Babu knows them, and I expect you too know them. Independence secured through violence would have contents different from that secured through non-violent means. My notion of independence is independence of the poorest and the lowliest in the land. But  in political language, all of us—Communists, Socialists, Kisan- Sabhaites, Labourites and others must think of independence though all will have different meanings for the same word.
 So far as I am concerned, I have no objection to the whole of the correspondence being published.
 You will please let me know as soon as news about Subhas Babu’s whereabouts is known.libtech_204_footnote

CHI. MUNNALAL,
 You did well in writing to me. It is your duty to draw my attention whenever my interference hurts you. There is no question at all of my feeling offended. If I myself break rules, who will observe them? Hence behind my seeming breach of a rule you will discover that I really observe it. If I had known about Kripalani, I would have stopped him. Nevertheless it is our duty when a guest turns up unexpectedly that we should spare for him some food even from the measured quantity that has been cooked. One should exercise one’s discretion. The sparing of such food would be dharma only if it is willingly done by the person concerned. Ba’s interference is of course to be regretted. But that is part of her nature. We have, therefore, no option but to put up with it. Ba has changed herself a great deal with patience. If I made more effort, she would improve still further. But I save my time. Yet I will see.
 You must take charge of  datanlibtech_217_footnote. Anybody who uses one must pick it with his eyes shut. Nobody should select and choose. Those
 
 that are altogether bad should be thrown away.
 Personally I would certainly like your making a liquid solution of soap. I think we are using too much soap. I do not know how to prevent this. See if you can think of some way. The matter should be discussed with all. The use of 501 soap must be stopped. Why shouldn’t we ourselves make soft soap? See if you can do something about it.
I approve of the other changes you have suggested.
 I am not surprised to learn that the kitchen is working all the time. There should be some arrangement for looking after it. The persons in charge must be sthitaprajnaslibtech_218_footnote. If we have such persons, the whole set-up would function smoothly. If you need my help, ask for it. Do and persuade others to do everything with good humour. And be patient about what cannot be done.

 [Before February 19, 1941]libtech_219_footnote
 It is understood that Mahatma Gandhi has sent a letter to Ali Gul Khan, President of the Frontier Congress Committee, expressing his agreement with Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan’s suggestion that satyagrahis should remain in the Frontier Province to finish constructive work and thus there need be no march towards Delhi for the present.
 Referring to those satyagrahis who want to postpone satyagraha on some pretext or another, Mahatma Gandhi is understood to have advised that their names should be struck off the list unless their case is undeniable.
 Ali Gul Khan is forwarding the letter to Abdul Ghaffar Khan who is  at Utmanzai.

 THE GENERAL SECRETARY

 GAUHATI DEAR FRIEND,
 I showed your letter to the General Secretary dated the 16th February, 1941, to Gandhiji who has asked me to reply to you as follows:
 He sees no objection whatsoever to Congressmen helping in the prohibition campaign started by the present Government, provided it does not affect  the satyagraha campaign. That is to say, those who have signed the satyagraha pledge and are due to offer satyagraha on the dates given to them may not allow their decision to be affected by the campaign. You say: “Some Congressmen, mostly active satyagrahis, have been enrolled as members of prohibition committees and, in some cases, they have assumed responsible roles.” But Shri Chaliha in his letter to Gandhiji dated 15th February, 1941, writes: “Congressmen who are offering services for this work are almost (all?) non-satyagrahis, and out of 150 members there are only a few satyagrahis.” What is the truth? However, our duty is clear. Those who have not signed the satyagraha pledge may offer full co-operation to Government, and those who have, may do so until the date on which they are offering satyagraha.
 Yours sincerely,

Courtesy: National Archives of India, and 	Anand T. Hingorani       	The following seven chapters are a result of Pyarelal’s deep study 	of the status of the Princes of India. They should have been 	published in pamphlet form long ago, and would have been, but for my 	pre-occupation. The writer is himself behind jail walls. Therefore 	they are being published as they were written. They are an 	evergreen. They give to the busy public worker or student, in a 	compact form, an idea of the status of the Princes of whom there are 	nearly six hundred. The chief merit of the pamphlet is that it 	contains nothing but what is taken from authentic records. The 	existence of this gigantic autocracy is the greatest dis-proof of 	British democracy and is a credit neither to the Princes nor to the 	unhappy people who have to live under this undiluted autocracy. It 	is no credit to the Princes that they allow themselves powers which 	no human being, conscious of his dignity, should possess. It is no 	credit to the people who have mutely suffered the loss of elementary 	human freedom. And it is perhaps the greatest blot on British rule 	in India. But we are too near the event to realize the falsity 	called “Princes’ India” or “Indian India”. The system will 	break under its own intolerable weight. My humble non-violent effort 	is to induce all the three parties to wash the triple sin. Even one 	of them can take the decisive step and it will affect all. But it 	will be glorious if the three together realize the enormity of the 	sin and by a combined effort wash it.  M. K. GANDHI  SEVAGRAM, 	WARDHA, 	February 23, 1941  Status 	of Indian Princes "

 It would not be wrong if non-arrested satyagrahis tour the whole district for a month or two and then proceed to Delhi. Some may tour in the district and some may go to Delhi.
 Referring to illiterate Harijan satyagrahis, Mahatma Gandhi says that if they do not march to Delhi or return after going half-way, they should do constructive work and may also learn reading and writing.
 Mahatma Gandhi does not approve of the idea of batches of two, three or four satyagrahis proceeding to Delhi but wants everyone to go singly.
 Answering another question, Mahatma Gandhi says that those not proceeding to Delhi should offer satyagraha in their provinces.
 To another query, “When people are told not to give food to satyagrahis, what should they do?”, Mahatma Gandhi replied that they should buy food if they have money or starve or proceed further; no hard and fast rule can be laid down.

 a woman from that community should be given the chance, just as a Hindu woman or a Muslim woman should be chosen when it is the turn of that community.
 Women satyagrahis who are weak and diseased should not go to jail again. Moreover no woman can go to jail with her child.
 It is better if ‘A’ and ‘B’ class prisoners avail less and less of their special privileges. In fact our ideal is not to enjoy any additional facilities other than those enjoyed by ‘C’ class prisoners.
 The purpose behind payment of fine is only to remove the fear of fine as we have already overcome the fear of jail. It does not mean that fine should be paid by borrowing money. But we should not lose valuable things for a negligible price.
 We have to presume that the struggle will be a prolonged one. Talks of compromise only betray our weakness. Rest assured, ultimate victory is ours.

 BHAI GHANSHYAMDAS,
 I have your letter. My going there will serve no purpose and may even be harmful. Harmful because, if my visit results in failure, it may add to our disappointment. As it is, my meeting with Qaid-e- Azam appears to be an impossibility. But I have encouraged Rajaji to

 a great extent. He will of course try. We shall see what the result is. I think an agreement is not likely. We should do what we can without it. Inaction on our part in the hope of an agreement may result in serious harm. I am of the opinion that fruitful efforts can be made outside an agreement.
I hear your experiment is progressing well.

 The students cannot offer satyagraha unless they are ready to suspend their studies during the period of the Movement.
 Mahatma Gandhi added that those who could not go to that length might do constructive work, specially the promotion of khadi and communal unity. It was undesirable that communal virus should infect the brains of the students.
 Gandhiji also emphasised the need for discipline, which was necessary in any organization. Even violence, he remarked, needed discipline as was obvious from the example of Hitler.
 Regarding the strikes, Gandhiji reiterated his previous statementslibtech_246_footnoteand warned the students against entering into party politics prematurely. He urged that the students should keep an open mind and study ideologies. He stressed that the students could play an important part in bringing about communal unity.

 Your speed is not bad. You must have gone up to 300 rounds per hour. Please congratulate Asaf Ali and Deshbandhu on their spinning.
 I can well understand Brijkrishna taking the Gita class. I wish all of you will learn the two scripts—Urdu and Devanagari. It is a sad thing that Hindi and Urdu are going away from each other. It was not thus always. I wish you will all take common action in the direction.

 Door-to-door anti-war propaganda by Congress satyagrahis  has  been permitted by Mahatma Gandhi, provided the residents do not object. He added that this form of satyagraha would be resorted to from next week.
 Mr. Sankaran said that Mahatma Gandhi approved another list of 1,607 Congressmen for offering satyagraha. He said that 140 satyagrahis from the South including five ladies, are now marching towards Delhi. Mahatma Gandhi has insisted that satyagrahis from the South should learn Hindi if they are to march towards Delhi.

CHI. NARANDAS,
 I liked your letter very much. Your ideal is fine indeed; but Kanaiyo will not be able to reach it. His mind was firm before Abha came into the picture. People have noticed that since then he has been unconsciously letting himself be drawn towards her. When I asked him, he felt that it was true. We can put off the engagement for the present, but that would only be like deceiving the people.  The condition of Kanaiyo’s mind, so far as I can see, is as follows: ‘If I marry, it will be Abha, and if I cannot get Abha, I would prefer to remain unmarried.’ My view is that Abha should wait for three or four years. Abha is of course growing fast. Even after my death, he will marry nobody but Abha. He is not of such an unsteady mind that he may change it any time. Besides, Abha seems to me to be a noble type of girl. Though she is not highly educated, she is lively. She understands Gujarati even today. She always talks with Ba in that language. If both of them stay there, she will not spare herself in service. She would willingly serve anybody she is asked to serve. I shared your keen desire, but Kanaiyo does not have the strength to
 
 fulfil it. I now wish that both of you or Jamnalibtech_259_footnotealone may come here and see Abha and meet her father. If Kanaiyo must marry, then from our point of view Abha is the chosen one. She possesses the ideals we look for.libtech_260_footnote

164,"March 6, 1941",STATEMENT TO THE PRESS,"
  
 
 SEVAGRAM,
 March 6, 1941
 I must warn the public against journalistic flights of  imagi- nation. No importance need be attached to my visits to Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru and there meeting quite accidentally Kunver Sir Jagdishprasad, then Pandit Malaviyaji and the morning following Shri Vijayalakshmi Pandit and finally Maulana Saheb Abul Kalam Azad. They were all of them friendly visits wholly unarranged when I left Sevagram for Allahabad. I had gone for one mission and that alone. What little other work I did was purely accidental. I refer to my meeting some students and Garhwali workers. Sir Tej Bahadur I went to see because he was ailing. We are old friends. He was to have come to see me but when I heard that he was ill I insisted on going to him. No doubt, we talked about the political situation and even more about the Hindu-Muslim problem. Sir Jagdish who dropped in and who was to dine at Sir Tej Bahadur’s joined the conversation. But not the slightest political importance attaches  to  these  conversations.  We talked as individuals and not with regard to any mission. Sir Tej Bahadur is anxious (who is not?) to end the present deadlock. He would give anything to bring about Hindu-Muslim unity. He ascribes to me overmuch capacity for bringing about unity. Sir Jagdish is no less anxious. But the talks were no more than a friendly interchange of views. As to the visits to Malaviyaji Maharaj, the same thing happened. He has aged. He ought not to talk about current events. He is too weak. But the country’s affairs are his daily food. He will cease to think about them when he ceases to read and think of the Bhagvata
 
 and the Gita. These things are the breath of his life and they will stop with the stoppage of his last breath. Who knows but that he will take them where the disembodied spirit goes. It was a privilege to meet these friends but our talks have no bearing on the political situation in the country. And there could be none in the purely prison visits to the Maulana and Shri Vijayalakshmi Pandit.
 I know that the imaginary descriptions of such visits and the eagerness with which the public devour them show their desire for communal unity and a solution of the political deadlock. But mere desire will take us no nearer its fulfilment. For fulfilment can only come through common action on the part of those who share the desire. All are searching for common action. Speculation interferes with the search. So far as the Congress is concerned, its policy and action based thereon are well known. It is gross misrepresentation to suggest that the Congress is out for securing terms for itself. Freedom of speech is for all even as independence will be for all. The contents of the latter will be decided not by the Congress but by the vote of all. And if it is to be achieved non-violently it follows that the mere vote of the majority will have little play. The charter of independence must be the product of the willing consent of the minorities and other relevant interests which are not in conflict with the interests of the vast mass of Indian humanity.
 Be this as it may, in order that all the units may  have  full freedom of expression even against the war itself, the Congress has embarked upon civil disobedience. That is the contribution of the Congress to the fulfilment of the common desire. As an effort in direct action it must hold the field till a better is found.
 Strong objection has been raised against my interpretation of the Bombay resolution. I regard it as a true interpretation. But it is that of an individual. I have no authority from the Congress to interpret or vary the Congress resolutions. That is essentially the function of the President, the Working Committee and finally the A.I.C.C. The. only authority I have is to conduct the campaign of civil disobedience. But when the time for settlement comes it will be for the Working Committee to decide what the terms shall be. My contribution will be confined to advising the Committee. The Working Committee may reject the interpretation I have given. It or the A.I.C.C, may even alter the resolutions they have passed. Meanwhile let everyone whether Congressmen or others be guided by the Bombay resolution and not
 by my interpretation. I have, therefore, failed to understand the consternation created by my statementlibtech_261_footnotethat there can be no settlement short of independence during the pendency of the war.

  	I consider this a serious mistake. Regarding your honesty, have no 	doubt; but carelessness is a great defect. In accounts there should 
 not be a mistake even of a pie. A pie entered more or less in accounts can result in a mistake of a thousand, and it has happened before. Accounts should be written daily. Not only this, every item should be entered then and there, as is done in banks.
 It is not good that you have given up [writing the accounts] What Chimanlal said was correct, but by asking his pardon you should have kept the work to yourself. This can be done even now if you wish. The atonement for this is that whatever the deficit make it up by getting the money from home. Clearly specify the reason for doing so.
 There is no cause for shame. By accepting the fault publicly, your burden will be lightened, and others too will learn a lesson.
Ask anything more if you wish to.

 Your letter to Gandhiji has come. He is unable to attend to  much  correspondence these days. If you have read Harijan carefully, you would have known his views on the militarization of India or indeed any country. A satyagrahi who believes in out-and-out non-violence can never stand for militarization of India under any circumstances. But such are few and far between. The majority believe in non-violence for achieving our independence but cannot get as far as condemning war weapons and machinery for defence from external aggression. This, as you rightly say, requires boundless faith in non-violence as a living creed and the only way to save the world from destruction."

  [Before March 11, 1941]libtech_290_footnote  	If any employee of a local body desires to offer satyagraha, he must 	resign his post first.  Mahatma 	Gandhi appears to have argued that an employee of a local body, who      
 wishes to offer satyagraha, could not look for support to the employing local body.
 He should come in the field with clean hands, keeping full confidence in God.
 Mahatma Gandhi added that a local body with a Congress majority should not resist the policy of the Government of withholding grant to that  body  if  its employees were participating in the satyagraha movement.

BHAI PRITHVI SINGH,
 I have your letter. You need not feel sorry for Mirabehn. She believes that she had the same relationship with you in a previous birth and it will be the same in future also. That you have forgotten it in this birth is a matter both for sorrow and joy for her. Mirabehn has made this a spiritual thing and is doing tapasya. She reads Puranas and such other books and spins for hours daily. She spins at least 1,800 rounds and remains cheerful.libtech_291_footnote
 I have had a very bitter experience of Bhai Amrita Lal. But since your experience is contrary to mine, I do not wish to say anything. Follow the dictates of your heart.

  	Since the Gandhi Seva Sena is certified by the A.I.S.A.,  shouldn’t 	the latter have a place in the Khadi Patrika?  	Shri Gosibehn desires to work among Muslim women. She will work 	chiefly through khadi. Please, therefore, guide and help her.  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	a photostat of the Gujarati: S.N. 9798         The Parting of the Ways should have appeared when it was 	finished, i.e., immediately after August 10. By some mischance it 	has escaped publication till now. It has just come into my 	possession. I understand that some portions of the article have 	already appeared in Asia. I think it is too precious a 	document to be withheld from the public. I have shown it to Dr. 	Rajendra Prasad and Acharya Kripalani who are in Wardha. They agree 	with me that it should be published on behalf of the A.I.C.C. I know 	that Sarojini Devi, if she was here, would also agree.  	I believe that it correctly represents in moderate, though forcible 	language, the Congress position.  	The   passages   quoted   abovelibtech_306_footnoteare   key   paragraphs.   The   first extract 	shows what might have been. The second declares the author’s love 	for the British people. The third shows in the fewest possible words 	how the British Government in India is sustained by coercion pure 	and simple. The fourth paragraph shows that the independence India 	wants is neither exclusive nor antagonistic to any nation.     
 Though the author has said not one word about non-violence, he has led the reader to the inevitable conclusion that  the  independence of Jawaharlal’s conception, nay, Congress conception cannot be won except through unadulterated non-violence, and the present struggle is an attempt to keep the spirit of non-violence alive in the midst of the fratricidal inhuman carnage. If it is a contribution to India’s freedom it is no less contribution to world peace.

 must, of course, take the necessary legal steps. But the best remedy for the goondaism that you see is a vigilant public opinion. In order to cultivate it you should give publicity to incidents of that type.
 Your scheme for a building for the Vikasgriha is a good one. Of course, the utmost simplicity will have to be observed.

198,"March 17, 1941",INSTRUCTIONS TO SATYAGRAHISlibtech_312_footnote,"
    
 [Before March 17, 1941]
 Don’t bring persons from villages into towns for offering satyagraha.
 Satyagrahis, if not arrested, may do house-to-house propaganda but it should not take the form of picketing. Satyagrahis should not enter the houses where they are not welcome.
 Persons serving in local bodies should resign from  the  services  before offering satyagraha.
 When a Congress Committee is suspended, its work should be entrusted to an approved satyagrahi.
 Lady satyagrahis, if unable to march to Delhi, may tour in their own districts and province.
 Satyagrahis marching to Delhi should obtain a working knowledge of Hindustani.
 Satyagrahis charged under the Nuisance Act may not offer any defence. They may make it clear that their sole intention was to carry on anti-war propaganda, and plead not guilty to the nuisance charge.
 Harijan Congress workers should devote themselves to constructive work. Satyagrahi prisoners may refuse food only if it is unwholesome and uneatable.
 Satyagrahis who are let off with fines should continue the satyagraha without giving a fresh notice.
 Satyagrahis able to pay the fine may not evade payment, but are not bound to
 
 
 sell their property to pay it.
 For the facility and convenience of village folk, non-arrested satyagrahis should be provided with a certificate or a badge on the authority of the Provincial Congress Committee, testifying to his being an approved satyagrahi. The badge may differ from province to province.
 Satyagraha may not be offered in a place where Section 144 is in force.
 Fetters and handcuffs, etc., should be borne cheerfully when being transferred from one jail to another.
 Non-arrested satyagrahis marching to Delhi should, besides raising anti-war
 slogans and otherwise carrying on anti-war propaganda, propagate the constructive programme of the Congress. It must be explained to the masses that the best and most effective as also the easiest way in which they can help forward the struggle is by carrying out the constructive programme laid before the country by our leader.

Even as I had made that collection my special duty because of the 	promise made by me to Kamala when she went to Europe, as it turned 	out, to meet death, so is incumbent on me the duty of collection for 	the Andrews Memorial. I might have failed in collecting for the 	Kamala Memorial but for the tireless labours of Dr. Jivraj Mehta. I 	have no counterpart to Dr. Jivraj Mehta for the Andrews Memorial 	collection.  	The first anniversary of Deenabandhu’s death will be soon upon us. 	I am too weak and too occupied to travel about for collections. What 	is, however, tantalizing is the fact that the collections have not 	been coming promptly and spontaneously. Charlie Andrews was       
 everybody’s friend in need. He made no distinction between the high and the poor or Christians and non-Christians or Englishmen and others. He ungrudgingly assisted all who were in need of his help. He slaved night and day for humanity. He found his home and self-expression in Santiniketan. Dr. Rabindranath Tagore was his guru and friend. He was the chief collector of funds for Santiniketan. No more fitting memorial could, therefore, be conceived than that his home should never be in want and that it should have additional funds for expansion. Indeed the Gurudev himself should command all the monetary help he needs. He has brought lustre to India. Many men have derived signal assistance from him and his institution. Their children are receiving instruction in Santiniketan. His art decorates many an Indian home. His poetry, his novels, plays and his art enrich the minds of thousands of boys and girls, men and women.
 It is a problem why these two precious names have not brought forth spontaneous response. Why should there be  special  appeals made on behalf of a memorial which is its own compelling recommendation? A spontaneous response will delight Deenabandhu’s spirit and put new life into Rabindranath Tagore. What answer have students and teachers, friends of labour and lovers of art to make? Among them they can produce the paltry Rs. 5,00,000 in a day. Will they produce the amount before the 5th April, the day on which Deenabandhu, that true friend of the poor, took sleep from which he never awoke?

              DEAR 	SIR MIRZAlibtech_325_footnote,       SEVAGRAM, WARDHA,  March 	19, 1941 
  	I must thank you for your most affectionate letter. I have never 	doubted your personal affection for me, I was going to say even 	partiality. These are things I treasure. They please me but what I 	want is true co-operation, if my mission of peace and goodwill is to 	succeed.      
 Since you would know what I would like, I reduce to writing my thoughts as they come to me.
 I am quite clear in my mind that there is little real freedom of speech in British India, there is still less in ‘Indian India’ and there is no independent judiciary. Unfortunately you hold a different view. Hence there is not much prospect of co-operation. I am sure you will one day be convinced of this fundamental truth. Till then we must agree to differ. Your Chief Justice is wholly unfit for the  post  he holds. How can there be real justice ! I know that in British India too there have been unfit Chief and other Justices. My point is that they become worse on going to the States. I feel these things keenly  because I am the only true friend among public men of the Princes. This is a high but true claim. You are about to leave. How I wish you can see truth as I feel it!
 By way of palliative you can restore the sanads and redress the wrong done to those candidates who were rejected.libtech_326_footnotelibtech_327_footnoteSuch a step will be appreciated. It won’t be of much use because the lawyers have turned the punishment to good account and they have become workers. The rejected candidates have reconciled themselves to the rejection. But as a gesture, if you can take the step, it will have a value.
 Don’t please expect Bhashyam or others to seek an interview with you but send for them as friends. Trust will beget trust. Surely the first step should be yours.
I am asking Pattabhilibtech_328_footnotelibtech_329_footnoteto see you as early as he can.
 I know that even in your retirement, you will be doing useful service. May you have many years before you and may you be an instrument for doing some truly big work.
 Your sandal-wood box is always by my side and holds my odds and ends.
 This is a personal letter. I am not copying it. I have not written it for any public use, nor do I expect a reply unless you  feel  like sending one. My love to all members of the family.
 Yours sincerely,

 I got your letter three days ago but failed to reply by oversight. I had taken the letter to Allahabad. I could not get a minute there. Then it was buried beneath other letters. Today on Amtul Salaam reminding me, I got it out immediately.
 Compliments to you all for making good use of the time you have on hand. It should be so. Congratulations to all.
 You yourself have got this valuable opportunity for clarifying your thoughts. It is but natural that people expect a lot from you.
Maulana has somehow not been able to go beyond two parts.
 I am making Kishorelal responsible for the literature. He will send it.
 Superficial non-violence is when a man is not killed or even attacked physically. The subtle kind is when no one is hurt in thought, word or deed and when the welfare of all mankind is at heart. In normal circumstances the idea of non-violence is limited to man only. But truly speaking there is no limit at all. It can be extended to animals and even germs. But one does not go that far nor can one do so. But non-violence is normally extended to animals. I do not talk of such non-violence in respect of the Congress. Nor can one do so. It
 would not suit the Muslims. Nor would it suit Christians and countless Hindus. So the observance of subtle non-violence about which I talk is limited to man. I think it is enough if we reach that stage. Something is bound to come out of it in due time.

There has been greater concentration on impressing women in the national service and, therefore, regarding them as valued co-workers on a par with men. The widening and working of the constructive programme is the only way in which active non-violence can express itself. Civil disobedience comes, if it must, at the end of the constructive programme, never in the beginning. We saw through experience that we had to retrace our steps in 1919 as civil resistance had been resorted to without preparation through constructive service. Disobedience of laws can never be civil unless the resisters have learnt the art of voluntary obedience. This is impossible without tangible co-operative work requiring exact discipline and voluntary and whole- hearted obedience to rules and regulations.
 Civil resistance is merely lawful and obligatory only in some cases, whereas constructive work is obligatory on all who belong to a non-violent organization. And civil resistance can be effective only when it is backed by constructive effort on a mass scale. Success of civil resistance can be measured by the success of constructive effort. Therefore, I hope that all Congress workers will, during the National Week from 6th to 13th April, devote their time to the constructive programme. Khadi and other village industries have always played a prominent part in the programme. For, all young and old, men and women can take part in it and the work can be measured  in arithmetical terms. It is to be hoped that the response will be much greater than ever before.

  	What you said yesterday was correct, and was timely. If you are 	still not satisfied, ask again and again. The matter  is  important. 	Therein lies the test of ahimsa. Both were attracted towards each 	other. If this is considered a defect and they are turned out, their 	lives can be embittered. If we tolerate them, their self-control can 	increase, and they can progress step by step. Their progress depends 	on us. This line of thought is in favour of their staying [in the 	Ashram], and this should be sufficient.  	We should put up with the temper of others to the extent that we 	ourselves are not weighed down by it. A proof of this is that others 	are influenced by us. This is an outward proof. Inner proof is the 	testimony of the soul. If our fearlessness goes on increasing, it is 	ahimsa, otherwise it is cowardice.  	It may be said that in Kocharab [Ashram]libtech_350_footnotethe whole work was in order. The other things were 	subject to it. In outward work there was there the same discipline 	that I had in South Africa. I used to engage the visitors in the 	Ashram work or they left soon after they came. My physique could 	bear the strain of laborious work, so I could take part in every 	activity; and it may be said that I was in constant touch with all. 	There was one big living room. So it was easy to come in touch with 	others. This is about the early stage. Whole work means to fill 	water early in the morning, to wash clothes, to cook food, to clean 	grains and vegetables, to serve food, to teach, and so on. These 	things being one after the other were not troublesome.  	The rest of the questions were answered yesterday. Your letter is 	enclosed. Ask, if anything still remains.

Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	a photostat of the Hindi: G.N. 11693         	Deep inside me I have an ever growing faith that in the midst of 	this universal destruction due to bloodshed, I am carrying on an 	absolutely innocuous struggle which, however, is pregnant with great 	potentialities.libtech_386_footnote  	The movement, for the conduct of which I am responsible, may prove a 	vain effort, if I represent no one but myself; and if I remain true 	to my faith, I may be satisfied, but so far as world peace is 	concerned, the effort will prove inadequate in terms of the present. 	For producing the desired result during the lifetime of the present 	generation, it will be necessary to give an unmistakable 	demonstration that a substantial part of the nation is behind the 	effort. Much more    
 has to hope before such a demonstration becomes possible. The present movement is a humble attempt in that direction.
 Man can only make an honest attempt. In a satyagraha movement, the saying that God is the giver of the result is literally true. Therefore, it is faith that sustains me and it is faith that must sustain the other satyagrahis. We have only begun the battle. The real test, the real suffering, has yet to come. Let me repeat for  the thousandth time that, in this long and arduous struggle, quality alone will count, never quantity. In this there is no room for hatred, certainly not for camouflage.
 Despite my being the originator of this struggle, I venture to say that only through it can we hope for permanent world peace. Peace can never come through war.

It is good that you discovered some 	of them. As long as the devil possessed your mind, it was good that 	you wrote to me. That this happened was itself a fault. Someone    
 has to be a manager, and he is entitled to decide things. The powers belong to the office and not to the man holding it. So nobody need worry what sort of a man the manager is. This means “No blame attaches to the strong, my Lord,” says Tulsidas. In English it is: “The King can do no wrong.” Among us Indians this fault-finding is  almost universal. From where can we find a perfect manager ? It is needless to ask how Chimanlal is. His analysis of merits and defects was correct. If I can find time to go to that kitchen, I will certainly do so, and carry my milk with me, because I do not consider it second rate. That one is inexpensive and this one is costly. Perhaps there condiments are allowed and here they are not. In case no incon- venience is felt there, it would no doubt be good if anyone of us some time go there.
In view of his temperament what Chimanlal said to Sushila was
 proper. Now it is time to stop.

              DEAR 	IDIOT,       SEVAGRAM, WARDHA,  April 	5, 1941 
  	Mahadev in Bombay, Mira in Nasik and Anand Hingorani in front of me 	pulling the punka. He will be here a few days. It is now 10.35 	a.m.  	Here are three letters. Haskell’s I have read carefully. It is a 	good letter and requires a reasoned reply. Discuss the letter or the 	argument with Datta or any other learned Christian and send your 	answer. Even if you do not feel like sending it without discussing 	it with me, do have the discussion. See if you find a supporter for 	our position. I 	hope you got Pyarelal’s pamphlet.  	The weather has become less unbearable. The nights are cool. Love. 
   [PS.]  BAPU    	Your letter.  We  shall  discuss  what  should  be   done  about  	the "

Your 	draft too is good but mine is probably better.  BAPU  From 	the original: C.W. 4014. Courtesy: Amrit Kaur. Also G.N. 7323             SEVAGRAM,  April 	5, 1941   Democracy 		based on 		non-violence cannot 		come out of 		your suggestion. It 		is too mechanical.  Your 		suggestion about 		my taking 		a personal interest in everyone and everything is sound but since the Ashram exists for the     
 development of national satyagraha, I have to fit in everything with the main idea. Remember that after all it is God who is guiding this as everything else.
  I 	forgot to 	say that 	Mahila Ashram does not 	open before July, 	therefore, the 	girls cannot be 	sent there 	till then. 	What is 	wanted is 	their immediate 	withdrawal from the 	Ashram for 	their own good.  I have already toldlibtech_422_footnotelibtech_423_footnoteSailen, I would send him to Satis Babu if he 	throws in his lot with him.  All 	things considered, 	I think 	that for your 	own growth 	and that 	of the 	family it 	is worth considering 	whether you 	should not 	return to 	Bengal and 	reconstruct your 	life there. It 	is your natural 	place. With your 	temperament suffering 	jars in 	the Ashram 	at every 	step, my 	proposal is 	worth considering. 	Of course, 	in Bengal, 	too, I shall 	always be interested 	in your 	welfare. My 	sole concern is 	your all-round good.

  I 	have said my 	say. You 	will grow only if 	you find 	that the plus 	side is greater 	than the minus 	side. It is strange 	but true that a 	person is 	affected by 	a thing 	as he imagines 	it to be not 	as it really 	is. Thus 	the two Sikh 	brothers who lived here 	told me that the 	shortcomings they 	saw they were prepared 	for, but the new and 	good things 	they saw 	in the Ashram filled 	them with 	admiration. The Bengali 	detenu who was here (I 	forget his 	name) saw 	nothing or 	little that 	was good. The 	truth no 	one knows, 	not even I 	the author. 	God only 	knows what this place is.  Of 	course Vina and 	Abha can 	stay here, if 	they know the 	art of living 	in the midst 	of suspicion.  Sailen 	is a 	tough problem.

 I repeat my request that Editors will confer a favour on me if, before publishing interviews with me, they will make sure that I have authorized them. I would not mind any amount of misrepresentation, if it did not injure a public cause.

DEAR MAURICE,
 I have your letter. I never thought of your fast. I was under the impression that you were fed here. I hope you were none the worse for it. I was painfully conscious that I could not give you any satisfaction for your theory. The worst of it is that those who seek support for their theories cannot be easily satisfied, if at all, except when you agree with them. This is no drawback. It often means strength. Where would all the discoverers and inventors have been, if they had given in at the first sign of opposition. Therefore you need not be disappointed if you have a living faith in your theory.

     CHI. 	PREMA,  April 	12, 1941 
  	I had your letter written from Saswad. Yesterday I got the one 	written from jail. I was delighted to read the account of conditions 	there. I am sure that, if all the women live in harmony and do 	constructive work with faith, they will bring swaraj nearer.  	On the 6th everybody here, excepting the children and the sick, 	fasted for twenty-four hours. Today also we intend to do the same. 	Non-stop working of some charkhas, one carding-bow and several 	taklis is in progress. Babla and Kanu had a big hand in 	arranging this. All are working with zeal. And 	now for your questions:   All 		that I 		can say about 		fasting is 		that it 		is part of 		my life. A 		fast may come any time. 		At the 		moment, however, I 		am not 		thinking of any. 		But my strength comes 		from the possibility of my undertaking one 		and from my faith 		in the 		method. In 		the last resort 		a satyagrahi 		vindicates his honour 		by laying 		down his life, as 		one who 		believes in violence 		does by 		killing. What 		a big difference! 		 Let  nobody, 		therefore, look 		upon the possibility 		of a 		fast by 		me as the sword 		of Damocles. 		If the 		fast does come, welcome 		it and 		pray that 		God may grant 		me the 		strength to 		go through it.  Harijan was stopped because of an unexpected letterlibtech_453_footnotelibtech_454_footnotefrom 		Delhi. I 		could see 		from it 		that they were not 		well-disposed towards 		the paper, and I do not want it to be made an issue in this struggle.  The 		current political 		developments have had 		no effect 		on me, 		for I have realized 		that nothing is 		possible just now. That 		is why I have 		said that this is 		going to 		be a long 		struggle. On 		the whole 		our good 		lies in that.   	Mahadev has again gone today to Bombay for a day. He has gone 	leaving Durga ill here. Both are courageous. They have willingly 	sacrificed themselves. My 	blessings to all the women.    
 Ba is still in Delhi. She is improving, but will take time to get well completely.

          SIR,       [On or before April 14, 1941]libtech_458_footnote   Mine   is   a   case  	 somewhat   out   of   the   ordinary.   I   am  an 
  	ex-student. It is necessary to mention this fact in  these  days  of 	anarchy that prevails in the student-world. Though I am under 	eighteen, I have known enough of the student-world and the world 	outside to realize the necessity of discipline in everything. In the 	step I have taken I have, therefore, obtained the blessings of my 	parents and other elders. Under my parents I have had practical 	training in non-violence in every detail of life. I have just 	finished my matriculation examination. I began school work rather 	late in life. My parents had stopped our regular school work during 	the non-co-operation days of 1920 when I was not even born. My 	parents have brought us all up in a free atmosphere. And so when I 	was minded to go to school and go through the ordinary training, I 	was permitted to do so. When, however, the present struggle was 	started, my mind began to waver and I felt that the practical 	experience I should gain in the pursuit of freedom would be of far 	greater value than the ordinary schooling which every schoolboy 	knows is conceived not so much in the interest of the masses as that 	of the rulers. If in spite of that knowledge we go through that 	course, it is because it is the only one that has been in vogue for 	so many years and which serves the purpose of providing a status in 	life. Such is the fate to which we have been reduced through foreign 	domination. I have been attracted to the present struggle more for 	its moral worth than the political. I know that if India can present 	 a  completed example of non-violence, India will have made a unique 	contribution to human progress. It is a vision that holds my 	youthful mind and I would count no suffering too great to achieve an 	end so noble and glorious.  Panchven 	Putrako Bapuke Ashirvad, 	pp. 347-8

 My health is quite good and so is Kumarappa’s. Yes, I saw Maulana Saheb in Naini Jail. He was quite well, and so was Vijaylakshmi who has now been discharged. Sardar is keeping well and spinning during all his spare hours.

 I have your letter. How can writing to you be a trouble to me? I manage to write in the midst of work. If on occasion I cannot do so, I do not make any special effort to write. This happened yesterday. I apply mud-packs to the stomach. Then I feel sleepy. If the mail goes in the meantime the letter to you remains unwritten.
 I would like it if Ba could stay with you, whether in  your  hospital room or at your house. The only thing is that she should not be a burden on Mother. Make that change if Ba is willing. Her staying with you is certainly a different thing from your occasionally visiting her.
 Letters to Pyarelal have been received. I shall have them sent on to him if that can be done. He is not able to get over his touchiness. His touchiness has its reasons, if we look for them. But my teaching is that we must not be touchy even if there are reasons for it.

331,"April 19, 1941","STATEMENT TO “THE TIMES
OF INDIA”libtech_466_footnote","
    
 SEVAGRAM, WARDHA,
 April 19, 1941 I have very carefully listened to the advance Press notes of The  Times  of   India’s  leading  article   which   must   have   appeared   this
morning in Bombay. I acknowledge the friendly tone of the article,
and I wish I could have given an encouraging reply; but I cannot.
 I adhere to all that I said at the initiation of the strugglelibtech_467_footnote. When I launched out, I had no foolish illusion about a sudden miracle happening. It was conceived to be, and it remains, a silent declaration of unquenchable faith in the power of non-violence even in the midst of circumstances so terrible and so baffling as face the world today.
 I believe more in the efficacy of the incalculable force of inscrutable divinity than in the efficacy of the calculated and calculable forces that the combined powers of destruction can bring into play on this little planet. That incalculable force has somehow or the other to act through human agency. How and when I cannot say. Whether that agency is the Congress or not, I cannot say. I proceed upon the faith that today the Congress is the only organization, however imperfect, however wanting in faith as an organization, still the only organization that stands definitely for peaceful measures.
 That being my position, so far as I am concerned, there is no drawing back. Whether civil disobedience is offered by one or many is of no moment. It must continue against all odds. Congressmen can
 
 
 certainly repudiate it in more ways than one. It will then cease to be an organizational movement, and therefore I will admit it will cease to be effective in any shape or form. But I would be content if I still retain the faith to be the solitary witness of the power of non-violence.
 I must resolutely deny that this movement, whether in conce- ption or in execution, is communal or anti-Muslim or anti-English. There is sufficient evidence for those who want to notice it to show that extraordinary precaution is being taken to keep the movement within limits and absolutely innocuous.
 Many Government people have admitted that it is wholly ineffective according to their conception. The writer of the article has said as much from his standpoint. And both are right. It was never intended that it would create an appreciable impression upon the war effort, but it is a moral, and from that standpoint a grand protest against the conduct of the war in the name of a free people. It is a token of the yearning of a political organization to achieve the freedom of 350,000,000 people through purely non-violent effort  and therefore to affect the future destiny of the world. Again an ambitious claim, but it is there.
 If I can help it, the Congress will disdain freedom at the sacrifice of a single legitimate interest that is consistent with the interests of the dumb millions, whether they are Hindus, Muslims or others. I must deny that if the Congress had held on to office in the seven provinces the Pakistan cry would have been less loud than it is today; but the giving up of office had an infinitely more moral basis than the avoidance of a tussle with Muslim interests or any other interests. The fundamental basis was India’s dissociation from the war effort to which it was never invited to be party. This is putting it in its lowest term and in bald political language. As you snow, my own basis is still more abstract, still more moral and still more universal, but on that account none the less real or less practical.
 I make bold to say that when the clash of arms has ceased and we have settled down to peace, permanent or impermanent, history will record that the Congress fight in its totality was a supremely moral fight and free from any injury to man’s dignity.
 To conclude this very unsatisfactory reply, as it would appear, to a friendly gesture, I want to plead one thing. Would friends ask me at this supreme moment in the life of the world and my own life, to deny a faith that has sustained me for nearly half a century? And let me
 interpolate one thought, however unwelcome it may be: I am con- vinced that if Britain will only be true to India, then, whether the Congress withdraws the struggle or not, everything can be settled satisfactorily. But unfortunately British statesmen have chosen the wrong path and have put imaginary obstacles in the way of India’s freedom. But that is a chapter on which I have no desire to dilate.

 SEVAGRAM, WARDHA,
 April 19, 1941
 DEAR LALA DUNICHANDJI,
 I arrived here on the 16th evening but was only able to put your questions before Gandhiji yesterday.
  In 	regard to 	M.L.A.s who 	in spite 	of reminders 	do not 	court imprisonment 	the question 	had better 	wait for an answer 	in view 	of Mian 	Iftikhar-ud-din’slibtech_468_footnotepending early release.  The 	same applies to 	A.I.C.C. members 	whose date has already  been extended 	to the 	30th instant.  Gandhiji 	is agreeable 	to having 	the spinning 	and weaving 	of certified 	khadi test 	done by the 	A.I.S.A. appointees. He 	is, however, 	in agreement 	with you 	that those 	who cannot 	afford to or for some 	equally legitimate reason are 	unable to 	present themselves before 	the appointed 	examiners and who can get 	the necessary certificate 	of bona 	fides from the 	President or 	Secretary of 	District Congress 	Committees may be 	exempted from the 	A.I.S.A. test.  In 	regard to 	members of 	local bodies 	resigning, the matter 	had better 	wait till 	Mian Iftikhar-ud-din’s release.  The 	same as 	regards Congressmen of 	all grades 	who refuse 	to offer 	civil disobedience.  Members 	of the 	Provincial Congress 	Committees are included 	among the 	number that is 	to offer civil disobedience.  Members 	of Working Committees of 	all grades are to offer civil 	disobedience.  Gandhiji 	fears that no undertaking 	of loyalty 	to the movement 	will be worth 	anything with those who 	are determined to deceive. 
 
 Your list of 212 satyagrahis has come. I note that the names have been accepted by the local President or Secretary and you told me that you had seen to it that these officers are reliable persons. In any event we would like to have the answers to the questionnaire from each person from the local officers. And what about    a test for them? How soon can the A.I.S.A. arrange for the latter?
 There have been some complaints regarding the revisions undertaken by the Amicus curiae Bar Association Committee in Lahore. Gandhiji’s opinion is that the idea of such a committee in itself is all right. But it should be allowed to function on its own without any interest, instigation or interference in its work on the part of the satyagrahis. You should issue strict injunctions to the latter in this regard.
 I am afraid my programme must have tired you as it did me. I trust you are rested by now and well.
 With kind regards,

            MY 	DEAR KHWAJA,           SEVAGRAM,  April 	20, 1941 
  	I was much touched by your long letter. I had your note too from 	Delhi. I am glad you met Ba.  	You will have no difficulty in believing me that I am the same 	confirmed believer in unity that you saw in 1919. Let me correct you 	about  dates and facts. I presided at the Hindi Sammelan in 1918libtech_469_footnotelibtech_470_footnoteand 	that with the deliberate intention of making Hindi inclusive, not 	exclusive. There was no criticism then of my presiding.  Muslim 	friends were enthusiastic about my definition of Hindi. At that time 	it was only my definition when I presided. Again my definition was 	accepted by the Sammelan. How could there be criticism when I 	broadened the basis so as to give recognition to Urdu script on a 	Hindi platform? The first note of opposition was sounded when I 	attempted to use Hindi as a term synonymous with Hindustani. Again 	it was an attempt in the right direction. But I had  lost caste  by 	then and every act of mine had begun to be suspect. Into the causes 	for this phenomenon I need not go. But from the above narrative it 	is clear that nothing that I have done could possibly be a cause for 	the Hindi-Urdu controversy. But the controversy having arisen, I 	could not escape unscathed. I would not call the Sammelanlibtech_471_footnotelibtech_472_footnotea 	communal organization   any   more   than I would so   call t he 	Urdu Anjumanlibtech_473_footnotelibtech_474_footnote. Both forms exist and votaries of both also exist. 	There need be no rivalry between the two but the wretched spirit 	which has nothing to do with the languages pervadesevery department 	of life. When it goes, as it will and must some day, the languages 	will remain what they are but they will provide us no food for 	quarrel. Meanwhile both are subserving the common cause. In the end 	the extreme forms which have no living reality behind them will 	disappear or will exist as corruptions of a past age. Be that as it 	may, let us few keep our heads cool and do the right, cost what it 	may.      
 Your plan about the dictionary is good. I am discussing that and other points with Dr. Tarachandlibtech_475_footnoteand Pt. Sunderlalji.

I had sent Mahadev to 	Nagpur. He had a very satisfactory meeting with Pyarelal. He will 	give you a full account of the meeting. Of course, today he has gone 	to Wardha to receive Sarupbehn. He may be quite late in returning, 	because Prof. Trivedilibtech_477_footnotelibtech_478_footnoteis very ill. He will have to tarry for his sake. I am 	writing to you only about one thing. Pyarelal says that you should 	definitely not appear for the examination without full preparation. 	Hence, he would rather that you did it either in October or April 	next.  I feel that if you are confident, you should certainly appear 	for the examination in May. I for one believe firmly that medical 	service is a God-given gift in your case and hence you will easily 	pass whenever you sit for the examination. So far as knowledge is 	concerned you will go on adding to it all the time. You do not need 	anybody’s      
 certificate for that.
 Ba seems to have arrived there. You will of course inform me about her condition. We have started giving mango and milk to Sharda’s son. Because of that his bowels are moving. Now Madalasa remains to be treated. I am giving the same things to her also. She does keep well because of it.
 Durgabehn can be considered to be quite well. Today she is not having any fever either.

  	Your letter dated 18th instant. I shall do what I can. But relief by 	way of clothing or food has not much attraction for me.      
 The problem is why do riots take place in spite of Congressmen functioning in all the three places—Dacca,libtech_490_footnoteAhmedabad and Bombay? Congress influence is strongest in Ahmedabad, then in Bombay. You are under a handicap. Why were so many thousand people so helpless as to fail to defend their homes? They could have done it either violently or non-violently. Congressmen must not be satisfied with mere relief work. That is for social workers who have specialized in the field, such as the Marwari Relief Society. Congressmen have to find out the why and the way to combat the evil. You are a seasoned worker, no arm-chair man. I would like you to apply your mind to the task. We may not expect governments to help in such things. If there are people who can be easily frightened, there must be those who will put them in fright.

 I have your letter. I have received all your letters concerning Ba and I have replied to all of them. Since you had forbidden it, I have not written to Ba anything about her fever. I know that you would not regard Ba as a burden. Still, Ba does make demands on your time, does she not? It irks me that you have to visit her twice every day. Ba is only in your hands and so of course you will shower on her all you have. But what would be my own duty in the matter? And yet since Ba is there with you what more can I wish? Hence, what you write is absolutely correct.
 I am observing fast today.libtech_498_footnoteBy the time this letter is  in  your hand, there will be hardly four or five hours left to end the fast. I am not feeling anything today. I am taking a lot of water. If tomorrow passes the same way, there will be no cause for worry. Even if not, no harm can come in just twenty-four hours. The fast is undertaken on moral grounds. I have been greatly perturbed that Sharad and Abha resorted to lying. My conditions are such that they are bound to be broken, and when they are broken, one cannot help telling lies. Therefore, I had no recourse except to observe a fast for my mental peace.
 Give this information to Ba also. I have not let this get around. You too should tell no one except Ba. Do not mention this to Lakshmi [or] Devdas. I shall not be sending any telegram when the fast is broken. There is no cause at all for worry.

354,"April 	25, 1941",STATEMENT TO THE PRESS,"
         WARDHA,  April 	25, 1941  	I have read painfully the long report of the debate in the House of 	Commons on India. Distress has been known to have softened people’s 	hearts and made them mindful of facts. But Britain’s distress has 	evidently left Mr. Amery absolutely cold and untouched.libtech_499_footnoteThis callousness makes me more than ever confirmed in 	my opinion that the Congress must abide by its policy of 	non-violence in spite of the heavy odds facing it.  	Mr. Amery has rendered no service to Great Britain by his 	contemptuous disregard of the situation as it exists in India  and 	thefacts that stare one in the face. He talks glibly of British rule 	having given peace to India. Did he not know what was happening in 	Dacca and Ahmedabad? Who was responsible for keeping the peace in 	these two places? I hope he will not throw in my face the fact that 	Bengal, at any rate, has self-government. He knows what a mockery 	that self-government is. He knows what little power for such 	emergencies toy Ministers have, whether they wear the Congress 	label, the League label or any other.  	I ask the very pertinent question: Why has this long spell of 	British rule left the people so emasculated as to disable them from 	standing up against a few hundred goondas? It is a humiliating 	spectacle, more for the British than for us, to see thousands of 	people    
 running away from their homes through sheer fright, because a few hundred goondas have found a favourable atmosphere for resorting to arson, murder and loot The first act of any government worth the name would be to teach its people the art of self-defence, but the foreign British Government had no concern about this fundamental welfare of India’s citizens and so it deprived the people of the use of arms.
 All the handsome tribute that Mr. Amery pays to Indian troops falls flat on Indian soil, because, leaving aside Congress non-violence for the time being, if India had been equipped and trained for self-defence and if India had become a voluntary ally of Great Britain,  I hold that all European Powers combined for destruction would not have touched Great Britain.
 Mr. Amery has insulted Indian intelligence by reiterating ad nauseam that Indian political parties have but to agree among themselves and Great Britain will register the will of a united India. I have repeatedly shown that it has been the traditional policy of Great Britain to prevent parties from uniting. ‘Divide and rule’ has been Great Britain’s proud and ill-conceived motto. It is the British statesmen who are responsible for the divisions in India’s ranks, and the divisions will continue so long as the British sword holds India under bondage.
 I admit that there is unfortunately an unbridgeable gulf between the Congress and the Muslim League. Why do not British statesmen admit that it is after all a domestic quarrel? Let them withdraw from India and I promise that the Gongress and the League and all other parties will find it to their interest to come together and devise a home-made solution for the Government of India. It may not be scientific; it may not be after any Western pattern; but it will be durable. It may be that before we come to  that  happy  state  of  affairs, we may have to fight amongst ourselves. But if we agree not to invite the assistance of any outside power, the trouble will last perhaps a fortnight and it will not mean even one day’s destruction of human heads such as goes on in Europe today, for the simple reason that thanks to the British rule we are wholly unarmed.
 Mr. Amery, in utter disregard of truth, misleads his ignorant audience that the Congress wants “all or nothing”. Let me remind him that in order to placate British sentiment, the Congress descended
 to the Poona Resolutionlibtech_500_footnoteand when at Bombay it undid the   Poona Resolution,libtech_501_footnoteI authoritatively stated that the British Government could not at the present moment grant or declare India’s independence and that, therefore, for the time being, we should be satisfied with the complete freedom of speech and pen. Was that “all or nothing”? With Mr. Amery’s state of mind, I suppose it is too much to expect him to have the elementary grace to acknowledge the studied moderation of the Congress in its desire not to embarrass the British Government whilst it is fighting for its very existence. Not having that grace, he turns the Congress moderation against it and claims that the Congress civil disobedience has fallen flat.
 It took my breath away when I read his statement about India’s prosperity. I say from experience that it is a legendary thing. India’s millions are becoming progressively pauperized. They are miserably clothed and underfed. Because there is one man’s rule, he is able to produce a budget of millions. But I make bold to say that it is not only no proof of the prosperity of the famishing millions, but it is proof positive that India is being ground down under the British heel.libtech_502_footnoteIt is the duty of every Indian who knows anything about the distress of the peasantry, to rise in rebellion against this autocratic rule. Fortunately for humanity, India’s rebellion is a peaceful revolt and I hope it will be through exclusively peaceful effort that India will realize her natural destiny.
 But I must not carry any further the painful dissection of Mr. Amery’s performance. It hurts me to have to undertake even this very brief analysis of his speech. But it is so amazingly misleading that I felt I would be failing in my duty if I did not point out at least some of the most glaring discrepancies in that unfortunate  utterance. Surely he could have rested content with the undisputed sway that he exercises over the destinies of over four hundred million people.

355,"April 25, 1941",ANSWERS TO QUESTIONSlibtech_503_footnote,"
    
 [April 25, 1941]libtech_504_footnote
  In 	answer I 	must repeat 	my former 	statement that British 	statesmen and 	publicists have 	covered the 	whole Indian question 	with unreality. 	The reality about 	the Times 	[of 	India] 	criticism is that 	nationalist India, for 	some reason or 	other, is 	against co-operating in 	the war effort.libtech_505_footnotelibtech_506_footnoteBut when one understands that the whole of India is a prison 	and that the jailers 	are able to 	make the prisoners 	do what 	they Iike, 	it is small 	wonder that the British 	Government is able 	to impress 	what money and recruits 	they like. I 	have shown before 	now that the modern titled classes, 	including the ruling 	princes; are 	essentially a 	British creation.  If the proposalslibtech_507_footnotelibtech_508_footnoteof the Bombay Conference are accepted  in 	toto I 	shall admit that 	though the 	proposals are 	likely to 	be unacceptable by 	the Congress, 	their acceptance will be 	some evidence 	of a desire 	to part 	with power.  To 	describe me 	as a dictator 	is laughable, 	if only 	because I have no 	sanction behind 	my instructions 	save the willing and 	affectionate endorsement 	thereof by Congressmen. 	I have 	imposed no views on 	anybody. Imposition of 	non-violent views is 	a contradiction 	in terms. 	It is true 	that I cannot 	change what is described 	as my policy 	because my policy is my creed.libtech_509_footnote 
 I am amazed at Mr. Amery’s effrontery in saying that the Congress wants “all or nothing” and “refused even to discuss the matter”. He knows that the Congress descended so far as to make the Poona offer and he should know that at Bombay when the Poona offer was withdrawn the Congress realized that the Government could not be expected at the present moment to grant the Congress demand, and therefore the resolution asked for freedom of speech which has been categorically refused.
 
 Equally false is the description of the Congress as a totalitarian body with totalitarian ambitions. The essence of totalitarianism is that it should have violent sanction behind it. Mr. Amery knows that the Congress is pledged to non-violence and I challenge him to produce a single instance of an authoritative resort to violence by the Congress to impose its will upon its opponents.
 On a par with the foregoing two statements is Mr. Amery’s assertion that “the main constitutional task is inevitably for the moment far more in the hands of Indians themselves than in ours” when he knows that there is nothing in the hands of the Indians themselves, except to perform the almost impossible task of undoing the traditional policy of ‘divide and rule’. Imagine a Hitler in occupation of England and successfully dividing Englishmen as Indians are divided in India and then mocking at them by saying, ‘I will ratify an agreement among you.’ I assert that in India we have Hitlerian rule however disguised it may be in softer terms. And since he has chosen to disregard truth, I must not wonder at his deliberately misleading an ignorant audience by saying that individual civil disobedience has created a situation naturally embarrassing as it was meant to be. The written letter stands, and it is that the Congress by its civil disobedience did not mean to embarrass. That it has not proved embarrassing is acknowledged by Mr. Amery himself in his speech when he declared with great gusto that the Congress action has not affected the war effort in any part of India, “generous funds having flowed in from every class for every purpose of war or for mitigation of suffering”. Instead of paying a tribute to the exemplary moderation of the Congress, he has gracelessly accused a half-century old organization of doing what it has never intended and what, in fact, it has never done. It makes me sad to think that the distress through which Great Britain is passing today has not sobered Mr. Amery even to the extent of respecting cold fact.

 DEAR SIR,
You writelibtech_524_footnotelibtech_525_footnote:
 Mr. Amery may well retort that the “discrepancies” with which Mr. Gandhi charges him are also evident in the Congress leader’s statementlibtech_526_footnote. Certainly the accusation that India has been “emasculated” because of the alleged British policy of keeping her ‘‘wholly unarmed” comes strangely from the arch-protagonist of non-violence.
In  1908libtech_527_footnotewhen I first expounded the life-saving and the life-
 giving truth of ahimsa I wrote that disarmament was the blackest page in British history in India. I repeated the same thing in 1918libtech_528_footnotelibtech_529_footnotewhen I was collecting recruits for the British army with a zeal that brought me serious illness and a fair measure of unpopularity.  My  statement passed muster then. But times have changed and I have become inconsistent for stating an unchallengeable fact. I suggest that non- violence cannot be imposed upon anyone. It has to come from within. The British measure was undertaken to make British rule safe, not to make the people non-violent. It has made them impotent even for mischief. Good, impotent personslibtech_530_footnotelibtech_531_footnotecan never do. It is no matter for pride or credit that one representative of the British power can hold in abject subjection, say, a village of 1,000 souls. My non-violence does admit of people, who cannot or will not be non-violent, holding and making effective use of arms. Let me repeat for the thousandth time that non-violence is of the strongest, not of the weak. It is a force mightier than violence, though radically different from it in quality and effect.

378,"May 4, 1941",COMMUNAL RIOTS,"
    
 
 SEVAGRAM,
 May 4, 1941
 Hindu-Muslim riots that have broken out in many important places in the country must have saddened all sane people. My grief however is special. The Congress influence seems to have been practically unfelt during the dark days.
 We have proved ourselves barbarians and cowards in  these places. Arson, loot and killing of innocent people including children, have been common in almost all the places. Thousands have run away
 
 from their homes for fear of their lives.
 Congress influence was not to be measured by the number of members on the Congress register but by its leavening quality. It has been shown clearly that the influence is negligible in riots and the like. Individual cases apart, the Congress produced little or no influence over either the Muslims or the Hindus in the affected areas. From the accounts received it seems that Muslim fanatics in Dacca and Ahmedabad did their worst in inflicting damage on Hindu property by looting and burning with a deliberation that showed premeditation. Hindus, instead of boldly standing up and facing the mischief-makers, fled in their thousands from the danger zone. And where they did not, they were as barbarous as the assailants. These were all untouched by the Congress non-violence. And yet these are the men who form the bulk of the Congress meetings.
 If the Congress has no control over the masses on  such occasions, there is not much value in Congress non-violence as a positive force. The Congress cannot take charge of the Government if the British suddenly withdraw. They are not likely to do so without a desperate effort. But British valour cannot make Congressmen brave or fit for shouldering the responsibility of Government.
 At the present moment the British Government is preoccupied. It is a marvel how they hold sway over four hundred million people. Their amazing self-confidence and their skill in the use of destructive weapons enable them to hold India in bondage. But they may not be expected to keep the peace even to the extent they do in normal times. They will ensure their control anyhow but they willallow us to kill one another and come in only when that control is in danger.
 Congressmen’s course is clear. They must examine the contents of their non-violence. If it does not go as far as the regulation of inter-communal and such other relations, it is of no use for the acquisition of independence. I prophesy that without pervasive non-violence of the brave, when the question of real transfer of power comes, it won’t be the Congress who will have the privilege and the responsibility of delivering the goods. The power will descend  to those who are able to make effective use of violence.
 In Europe two forces, equally matched in destructive skill and bravery, are ranged against one another. The goal before both is domination. In spite of all the will in the world, I have found no difference in kind between the two. The difference in degree does not
 
 interest me. The British heel is bad enough for me. As a man wedded to independence and non-violence, I must fight Nazism and Fascism equally with the enslaving British Imperialism. But has the Congress really the non-violent strength even to fight this imperialism which we know through and through? Hitherto it was a case of seizing power bit by bit. But every Indian politician knows that there never was the slightest move on the part of the British to part with real power. And now we have it in its nakedness from Mr. Amery that we may expect no such thing peacefully from British authority. We have to fight for it either violently or non-violently, whether it is the Congress or the League or the Hindu Mahasabha that fights for it. I am satisfied that the two sectional organizations will never win independence for the masses, Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Sikh, Parsi, Jew. The Congress is the only organization that has laboured for national solidarity from the beginning. But that labour will be vain if the Congress does not prove true to its trust. I do not mind Congressmen changing their creed in spite of many leaders being in jail or openly leaving the Congress. I can see my way to rebuilding the Congress with five true men with whom there is neither Hindu nor Muslim nor any other. Religion is a personal matter. It ought not to affect the political field.
 Then what should a Congressman do? He must resolutely refuse to take sides and defend with his life and without the use of violence the person who is in distress as did for instance three women in Ahmedabad. I have no doubt there are many such individual instances unknown to me. Cowards will never bring peace or independence. He must therefore tell the masses never to fly from danger and that if they cannot follow his way they must defend themselves in the best way they can. What is required is a brave heart—a possession which is in nobody’s giving and which therefore can never be taken away. He must instil into his neighbours the lesson that even violence can be both decent and indecent. It is no bravery to kill unawares an innocent person because he does not belong to one’s religion or to burn his property. Those who do so disgrace their religion and themselves and positively mar the effort for independence.
 Let me give some further illustrations of what a Congressman should do in given circumstances.
 A Congressman has no enemy. While he will not seek the protection of the police or the military, he will not interfere with them in the performance of their duty but he will not hesitate to lose his life
 if need be in checking them when they are partial or exceeding their authority. This will appear a dangerous doctrine. But it is not if it is enforced fully. For if the Congressman concerned has erred, he will be the sufferer and not the police or the military. I know that a young man, because he was brave, by timely interference saved perhaps a hundred lives by simply holding the bridle of an officer’s horse and telling him in firm accents, that he may not give the order to fire and that he—the young man—would reason with the crowd and disperse them.
 Supposing there is a Hindu procession which has a right to pass through a Muslim locality and a Congressman has no influence over either, he will still give his life in begging a passage from the opposing Muslims. The immediate result may be zero. But the Congressman will have left a legacy of non-violent bravery. It will be good practice in non-violence. Let us learn from the British people the art of recklessly losing life and property. The same rule applies to a Muslim procession passing through a Hindu locality. We shall never learn the art of mutual forbearance and toleration till some of us, though perfectly innocent, have staggered Indian humanity by losing our lives.
 A crowd is bent upon setting on fire the property of one community or another or desecrating a mosque or a temple. Congr- essmen whether one or many will give their lives to prevent mob fury.
 A stray man attempts to stab a passer-by. At the risk of his life, a Congressman will pluck the knife out of the hands of the would-be miscreant.
 Congressmen may gasp on reading this note and particularly the illustrations and say ‘impossible’. Well, attainment of indepen- dence is still more impossible whether by violent or non-violentmeans. But what seems impossible to one lacking faith will become possible to those who have faith. And it is said that faith can move mountains. I know this, that neither independence nor communal unity is possible without ample sacrifice, bravery and self-confidence which is but another name for faith.

You are certainly making the 	best use of your time. I am glad too that you are all spinning.  	I do not mind your writing about me.libtech_551_footnoteBut you will offend all orthodoxy by bracketing me 	with the avatars or prophets and I think rightly. You cannot write 	of a living man in the same way as of the dead who, by common 	consent, have been acclaimed as great teachers.  	Your second question is difficult.libtech_552_footnotelibtech_553_footnoteI 	believe with those Muslims who think that the Prophet’s years in 	Mecca were the years in which he taught and lived pure non-violence. 	He became an administrator in Madina and thus ceased to be a pure 	teacher. In any case the net effect of the Koran is that 	non-violence is an obligation but violence is permissible. We are 	bound to accept as authoritative the interpretation generally given 	by the Muslim world and not the  one  I  have preferred. As 	to Krishna’s advice to Arjuna you should read my     
 introduction to Anasaktiyogalibtech_554_footnote. If you have not read it, you will tell me and I shall send you a copy.
 I would advise you alllibtech_555_footnoteto learn well both Urdu and Hindi. Then only shall we evolve an all-India speech.

         May 	6, 1941  CHI. 	NARAHARI,  	Now that Mahadev is there with you, this is not of much use. But I 	read your letter only last evening. As the matter is very important, 	I am giving a brief reply. Mridulalibtech_556_footnotelibtech_557_footnoteis 	of course made of steel. God will protect her.  	I will not be satisfied with watchmen. I am assuming that the truly 	non-violent can be counted on one’s fingers. The others should 	defend themselves. If this is not done, the same story will repeat 	itself. Keep this in mind in whatever you plan. Those who employ 	watchmen will not be able to rule. The few who can be counted on 	one’s fingers must of course meet the Mussalmans. They should try 	to win over as many of them as they can.  	If the Muslim community is bent on fighting, I would not reject the 	idea of boycott. I would consider boycott more decent than stabbing 	with daggers, burning houses, etc.  	The conclusion to be drawn from this is that we should guide even 	those who resort to violence as much as we can. As I am writing this 	with my left hand I have been brief.  	Add this to what Mahadev tells you or keep this in mind in whatever 	you do. Mahadev himself will fit it into what he advises.

        From 	a copy of the Hindi: Pyarelal Papers. Courtesy: Pyarelal         Blessings 	from  BAPU          SEVAGRAM,  May 	7, 1941 
  	I have just read an account of the unfortunate riots in Bihar. As 	soon as a wire was received on the 3rd instant by Rajendra Babu from 	Shri Sachidanand Sinha that a dangerous situation was developing in 	Bihar, he responded by hastening to Bihar.  	The account of the riots makes painful reading. I have studied the 	various statements regarding them also. Rajendra Babu has gone to 	Bihar to put in the whole of his weight in favour of sanity and 	peace. This is his first wire to me after reaching there:  Situation 	improving but still panicky uncertain. Mathura Babulibtech_559_footnote, Shah Sahiblibtech_560_footnotetouring. Myself 	proceeding with volunteers.libtech_561_footnote      
 I know that he will give a good account of himself. Peace will somehow be restored if it has not been already by the police and the military. But this can only be a superimposed peace. Rajendra Babu’s as every Congressman’s and for that matter every sane citizen’s business is to find out the cause of the riots. Unless this is done, there is no likelihood of permanent peace. I observe that the riots started with  the   resentment   over   the   observance   of   Anti-Pakistan   Daylibtech_562_footnote. Pakistan and anti-Pakistan observances and the like have come to stay. As national consciousness grows and ambitions rise high, such observances will multiply. But why can we not conduct ourselves decently in spite of these? Why should we be so utterly intolerant as not to suffer one another’s views? And then why should we show our intolerance as if we were savages?
 I am quite convinced that the chief burden for the voluntary preservation of peace lies on the shoulders of the Congress, the oldest, the best organized and the most popular organization in India. It must be admitted that the vast majority of Congress members are Hindus and Bihar is a predominantly Hindu province. Therefore it should be comparatively easier for the Congress to ensure peace there without the aid of the police and the military. It should be a point of honour for the stronger party to protect the weak against harm to life or property. It is a difficult task but it has got to be tackled. When I lay this burden on the Congress, I do not mean to suggest that  the Congress alone should or can do it. The Congress has to invoke the assistance of all parties, the Muslim League, the Hindu Mahasabha and others. Each may have its political programme. But if we are not intent upon imposing our respective programme on the opponents by force of arms, expressed today through goondaism, surely we may all agree that we shall settle all our differences through negotiation and peaceful effort including arbitration. The Congress may fail  to  produce joint action. If so, it will be a noble failure. It must, however, continue to work even single-handed, if its non-violence has any meaning in it.
 At present Bihar is the province that can lead the way and set the example. Rajendra Babu has a gentle and unique hold in his province such as no other leader has. He is the hero of the earthquakelibtech_563_footnotedays when the whole of India put its trust in him. May he have too the privilege of being the messenger of peace in Bihar and through Bihar
 
 maybe throughout India.

 in reply to your letter. I got it yesterday and could read it only late at night.
 How can I share your belief that, had I been in Ahmedabad, the riots would not have taken place? It is difficult to make such a statement about anybody today. I follow where God leads me. He has brought me and kept me here. I know there are many villages like this one in Gujarat and I could have settled in one of them.
 Manubhailibtech_605_footnoteis  showing  great  courage.  The  whole  family  was present at the prayers yesterday.
 Ba is in New Delhi just now. She is laid up. She is having fever. She writes and says there is no cause for worry. Yesterday I sent Lilavati to Delhi. Janakibehn’slibtech_606_footnotehealth is very good indeed. Why did Nandubehn say it was bad? These days she is taking long walks as she never used to do before. And she eats well.
 Kanu’s betrothal has been put off for the present. It may be assumed that it is not coming off in the immediate future. The girllibtech_607_footnotealso has gone home to her parents.

You are also correct regarding kitchen cleanliness, etc. If you have 	to incur some out-of-the-way expense the Committee should be 	consulted.

It is your duty to distribute to various people the work in your 	charge. The same people can work in other departments also. You 	should arrange for this with the head of the other department. 
 Remember that our duty is to discharge the responsibility. Whatever authority we need to discharge it will come by itself. This has been my experience throughout the last fifty years.
 You will have to arrange your work in such a way that a definite time is kept for supervising cleanliness. At that time you should have a small bucket, a shovel and a broomstick. The regular work would be done by others. But whatever faults you come across at the time of inspection you will yourself do as best as you can and draw the attention of the persons concerned. You will not try to do the bulk of the work yourself, and whatever you can conveniently do, you will not allot to others.

 CHI. MIRA,
 Your plan of disbandment reads well but means little. The cowshed is separate but Balvantsinha is not. The dairy is separate but Parnerkarlibtech_615_footnoteis not. The thing is that the world is inseparable from me. There are more Bhansalis than one. They all do not behave so handsomely as helibtech_616_footnotedoes. But there they are. You have not gone deeper into the thing. It is not the kitchen that is worrying me. The growth has been spontaneous and the destruction or the reshaping will have to be likewise. I can only help the process. Everywhere I have been overwhelmed. The Rajkot home gave place to the Bombay home. That to the Natal Home, the latter again to Bombay, then two in Johannesburg, then Phoenix, Tolstoy Farm, back to Phoenix, then Kochrab, Sabarmati, Maganwadi and Sevagram. I have omitted the intermediate shifts. All came in their due course. Heaven only knows
 
 where I am to be flung again. No, my safety lies in praying and waiting. “Lead Thou me on.”

 I had carefully preserved the draft of  Satyagraha Sathilibtech_620_footnotewhich you had prepared on August 9, 1940. I had resolved to find time to go through it. I fulfilled my resolve today, if only to respect your enthusiasm and selfless labour.
 I have experienced such disappointments regarding the Ashram that I have lost all interest in embarking on new ventures. I do wish that some of you should set up a brotherhood during, or even after, my lifetime. Let it be just a few in the beginning.
 The supplement is useful. It gives good guidance. It can be touched up and published even now. I have deleted two clauses on page 6. I did not think it necessary to list the different types of violence as they are countless. Moreover, the ones you have cited are superficial examples. Violence lies latent in our hearts. If in my curs cursory revision I have spoiled the draft, please make necessary corrections.
You will understand what I mean by the cross on page 10.

 DEAR SARANGADHAR DAS ,
 I was delighted to read your very interesting letter to Rajkumari. Yes, I remember having received your  statement. I can remember nothing that jarred on my ears. Rajkumari was then in the
Punjab.
 I am glad you came in such close contact with Harijans. ‘C’ class is undoubtedly best. ‘‘A” and “B” are [an] eternal sore. It is of our making. I hope you are none the worse for your experience.
 I know there is trouble outside. Rajen Babu cannot leave Bihar for the present. As I have already told Padhiarylibtech_624_footnotewe have all to learn the art of solving our own difficulties. libtech_625_footnote

  "
440,"May 15, 1941",“KHADI JAGAT”libtech_627_footnote,"
    
 The sphere of Khadi Jagat is co-extensive with that of the activities of the All-India Spinners’ Association. Theoretically speaking, the activities of the A. I. S. A. are unlimited. At present it provides employment to 2,24,421 spinners, of whom 1,67,996 are Hindus and 56,425 are Muslims, along with 20,643 other artisans, such as ginners, carders, dyers, weavers and washermen. The A. I. S.
 A. represents all those Hindus, Mussalmans, and others who are engaged in the various processes involved in the production of khadi, as also those who use khadi. Although these people are at present a mere drop in the ocean of Indian humanity, they are  numerous enough to be scattered throughout the length and breadth of the country. The A. I S. A. is entirely a philanthropic institution. It is the largest institution of its kind in India and perhaps in the world. If the expectations formed about this institution materialize, the A. I. S. A. should represent the whole of the dumb and semi-starved millions of India. And if that event comes about, it would represent the aspirations of the whole of the submerged world. The bloody massacre going on in the present war is probably a demonstration of the fact that industrialism will lead the world to destruction in the end. Enlightened revival of handicrafts alone can save it. But here I am talking of the future and God alone knows what the future has in store for us. All the same there is such a thing in the world as human endeavour, and the endeavour of the A. I. S. A. is to propagate the spirit of khadi throughout India. Then alone can we get rid of the grinding pauperism of India’s masses. The word ‘khadi’ must be taken in its wider sense here. For such extensive work, we require a much greater number of workers than have been hitherto available. Those who are already engaged in this work have to cultivate greater capacity for sacrifice. They must cultivate the habit of studying in a scientific spirit. Their knowledge must be steadily progressive.
 The wheel is the centre of this activity because it alone can give employment and living to the millions of women. The wheel includes the takli. It is  not  to  be  taken  merely  as  the  widow’smainstay.  It has been conceived as a symbol of India’s economic uplift,
 
 
 Hindu-Muslim unity and therefore even of her independence in terms of her millions. Thus the science of khadi is a lofty study. Many experts are required to dedicate their energies in an organized manner for the furtherance of the cause. These include economists as well as highly skilled mechanics. A mason can build a village house, but it requires an engineer to plan and build a big building or a big dam. Much more talent, knowledge, application and research are required to improve the village implements than to build a bridge  on  the Ganga. When we are able to attract people of this type by our renunciation and methodical research, we will be able to make rapid far-reaching progress, not till then.
 Looking at it from this point of view, Khadi Jagat is not an insignificant venture. It was because I regarded it as an ambitious venture that I supported the proposition of undertaking it. I hope, therefore, that all the articles published in this magazine will be of the required standard and be earnestly studied by the A. I. S. A. workers and those interested in the uplift of the villages.
 To carry on the activities of the A. I. S. A. we require workers as well as money. The responsibility of getting both rests upon the Present khadi workers. I think it will be well for me as the President of the A. I. S. A. at this stage to make a confession. The Association has suffered a loss of over two lacs because of my and a co-worker’s, call it carelessness, or overtrustfulness. Thinking him to be a good man, Shankerlal Banker took a certain person on the A. I. S. A. staff. He overtrusted this man and did not supervise his work as he ought to have. His failing health was partly responsible for this. Though the auditing of accounts was done regularly, this man very cunningly succeeded in outwitting everybody and misappropriating over two lacs of rupees. This was detected when Shri Jajuji took charge of A. I. S.
 A. offlce. The delinquent has confessed his guilt, though we have not succeeded in getting back the money as yet. We are still trying for it. The Sangh is following its traditional policy of avoiding the law courts as far as possible, but if it becomes necessary, there will be no  hesitation in going to the courts. The object of mentioning this incident here is to let the helpers of the A. I. S. A. learn of our carelessness and forgive us if possible. I make the confession also in order that we may become more vigilant. It is also hoped that as a result of this confession, workers of the A. I. S. A. all over the country will   realize   their   responsibility   and   know   that   every   pice  mis-
 appropriated is so much taken out of the mouths of the poor. It will be well if it can also awaken the guilty person to a sense of his duty. It will comfort Shri Shankerlal Banker who in his simplicity had put too much trust in this man.
 One thing I must not omit. The Association has increased the wages of the spinners without any demand from the spinners themselves and completely ignoring the market wages. This will be always looked upon as a creditable adventure for the A. I. S. A. The khadi-lovers have helped the Association in this philanthropic move. The price of khadi was bound to go up, but these friends willingly paid the extra price. Consequently, khadi-workers have a double duty to discharge. They must see that in the first place the spinners get the full wages according to the standard laid down by the A. I. S. A. Secondly the customer buying khadi should be charged the minimum price compatible with the rise in the wages. There should be  no attempt at making profit. If at some place profits have accrued they should be spent with the permission of the A. I. S. A. in lowering the price of khadi or otherwise in the interest of the poor. The progress of khadi does not depend upon the ups and downs of the market. It depends upon the purity of our transactions. If our transactions are pure they must result in at least three things.
 We 	will attract spinners and artisans.  The 	number of 	khadi-wearers will 	increase and 	the necessary money 	will flow in, and Greater 	number of workers 	will be attracted. 
 I say this on the strength of 55 years of public service. It will be the endeavour of the Khadi Jagat to achieve the three ends or in other words Khadi Jagat will strive to induce in the workers an ambition for greater purity, greater dedication and greater knowledge.

  	I have your letter. You have given very good news. Here also 	everything is fine. But Balkrishna’s health is not good.

442,"May 	15, 1941","DISCUSSION WITH D.
K. GOSAVIlibtech_628_footnote","
  From 	the Gujarati original: Pyarelal Papers. Nehru Memorial Museum and 	Library. Courtesy: Dr. Sushila Nayyar       May 	15, 1941  Q. 	Very few  names  from  the  third  list 	 of  satyagrahis 	 from  Maharashtra 	(193 out of 1,072) 	are approved and 	permitted to offer satyagraha. 	This permissionbusiness 	seems to 	be unduly delayed, and 	the satyagrahis are 	thus put to much inconvenience. A. 	 I  propose to introduce a  change in the technique about the  	passing of these lists of satyagrahis.libtech_629_footnotelibtech_630_footnoteFrom 	the date on which the name of a prospective satyagrahi is forwarded 	to me for sanction by the Provincial Congress Committee the 	satyagrahi concerned has to stop his private activities and has to 	devote himself wholly to the working out of one or more of the items 	of the thirteenfold constructive programme, which expression is to 	be understood in the widest sense as  explained  in  my  articlelibtech_631_footnotelibtech_632_footnoteheaded 	 ‘‘Implications  of  Constructive      
 Programme” in the issue of Harijan dated 18th of August 1940.
 Every prospective satyagrahi is expected to keep a log-book (or diary) in which he will daily enter the work done during the course of the day and the log-book shall be submitted to me through the P.C.C. concerned at stated intervals, say, fortnightly or monthly. After going through the diaries I shall grant permission for satyagraha to deserv- ing persons. Others will have to follow the said course till they get permission.
 The satyagrahi may not expect any financial help from the Congress.
 I know that on this very strict basis the number of satyagrahis will be reduced to a very large extent but what I am keen on is quality and not quantity. I shall not feel sorry if the number is reduced to any extent. Moreover, whilst so many satyagrahis are wandering about, I am anxious not to add to the list of wanderers.
 Don”t you feel that you are unfair to the prospective satyagrahis  in prescribing such a severe preliminary test to them only, while you allowed their predecessors in on a comparatively simpler test?libtech_633_footnote
 I don’t think I am unfair. One thing that you must remember is that the above movement is evolving. Exigencies of the situation may demand varying conditions.
 Has the President of the P.C.C. any duty towards the satyagrahis when they come out of jail?
 Yes, he certainly has. He has to ask them to repeat satyagraha and find themselves again in jail, say, within about a week from the date of their release. The P.C.C.s. need only report to me cases demanding special treatment and the instructions that will be issued by me in these cases should be followed and executed by the P.C.C.s.
 How long will this process go on?
 Indefinitely; that is to say, till we achieve our goal. Deep down in me there is a feeling that the struggle will become progressively fiercer, and we must pass through all such trials.
 In this respect we must take lesson from the British who, in spite of all the severe losses and heavy odds against them, have maintained fine morale and are determined to carry on. We may not do less.
 
 If any satyagrahi who has enrolled himself on the original basis feels unable to accept the new basis, which will be the honourable way out for him ?libtech_634_footnote
 He is free to withdraw his name and there is no disgrace attaching to any such honest withdrawal. I must not be deceived. To deceive me is to deceive oneself and the nation. Every honest person can and should withdraw his name. He may continue to render whatever services he can to the country. He does remain and does continue a Congressman as before. Congress does require and does appreciate his services also. But he cannot remain on the satyagrahi list as it is now envisaged.
 Can we start and develop a volunteer organization under the present circumstances ?
 By all means; the only condition is that it shall be organized only on the basis of non-violence—unadulterated non-violence.
 No trifling with non-violence will do and therefore no laxity in that respect can be tolerated. One more point. The said organization should be pro-Congress and yet independent of the Congress. It can be an allied institution like A.I.S.A., etc.
 Can decent violence in self-defence under emergencies by any member of such volunteer organization be tolerated as an exception?
 No, it cannot be. No such exception can be contemplated or provided against in advance, in an organization which is started specifically on the sole basis of non-violence. Such a person will have to leave the organization.
 Non-violent resistance is the best method; failing that, even violent decent resistance is tolerable but cowardice is unthinkable and condemnable”. That is what you have been preaching in this respect. But what you now say does not square with your above dictum.
 That dictum is meant for those millions that have not yet  accepted the creed of the Congress. It cannot apply to those organiza- tions that are founded on the basic creed of non-violence. Those who desire to effect a change in the basic creed of non-violence must either change their General or go out of the organization.
 The Congress being largely suspended as an organization, what should be our policy this year as regards the annual enrolment of membership?libtech_635_footnote
 
 Under the circumstances there can be no obligation to enrol membership in the usual manner. New applicants, if they so desire, must however be enrolled as members and there should be no  objection to realizing annual subscriptions from old members  wherever practicable.
 Do you desire the starting of peace-brigades?
 Certainly I do. Some time ago (vide Harijan 18th June, 1938) I made certain concrete suggestionslibtech_636_footnotelibtech_637_footnotein that respect. I know very few will be found, at least in the beginning, to enlist in such an organiza- tion. A beginning may however be made by any small number or even singly. Such an organization cannot be conducted on the lines of democracy. It can only be a body of persons with a definite purpose. If the pioneers are the right sort of people they may gather followers in due course.
 What should be our attitude towards elections to local bodies?
 As a rule, elections to such bodies should not be run in the name of the Congress. There may be no objection to Congressmen fighting the same on their individual responsibility. But this is a question which can be authoritatively decided only by Rajendra Babu and Acharya Kripalanilibtech_638_footnote.
 Can enrolled satyagrahis fight such elections individually?
No. I am quite clear on this point.
 What should be done in the case of those satyagrahis who have already put in their candidature for such elections?
 They have either to withdraw from the election or from the satyagraha pledgelibtech_639_footnote; they cannot retain both.
 What should be the Congress attitude towards the registration of voters to the Legislatures—both central and provincial?
 The Congress must pay full attention to this work. Congress may not ignore it.

 MY DEAR AMRITLAL,
 I see you have been again speaking to the papers.libtech_649_footnoteWhat you are reported to have said is wholly false. If you do not come out with a correct statement, I must repudiate you publicly.

        MY 	DEAR ANNADA,  SEVAGRAM,  May 	17, 1941 
  	I have not written to you as I promised. As a matter of fact I 	discovered that I did not want to say anything beyond what I said in 	my letter to Guhalibtech_650_footnoteand 	what he has published. It is not enough that we give relief. That 	work many can do and are doing, But who can give courage to those 	who are frightened and who can avoid hatred in spite of things 	happening which must generate hatred? Surely that is     
 primarily Congressmen’s work. I hope you are applying your mind to that problem.
 Now about Amrit Babulibtech_651_footnote. He has been riding the high horse. I never asked him to act as my agent or in any way to represent me.libtech_652_footnoteSince his daughters had to be sent away to Bengal and since I had no particular use for him I asked him to return to Bengal and advised him if he wished to go to Dacca and immolate himself as a silent worker without fuss and without in any way using my name. Instead he has appeared in the limelight as a star of the first magnitude. It has pained me much. If I can, I want to avoid having to repudiate him publicly. Please talk to him if you think it worth while and wean him from his vanity and falsity. In any case warn those who should be warned. Do you know anything of his work in Dacca?

 think 	the climate and water of that place are good.  	Jainarayan came and saw me. I accepted Vaze’s suggestion and so I 	told him to go to you and do nothing else. I have already 	communicated my view to you, namely, that the Standing Committee 	stands suspended and during the struggle the Emergency Committee 	should function. I certainly should not like the whole organization 	to remain under Amritlal Sheth’slibtech_655_footnotelibtech_656_footnotecontrol. 	I do not even like that the paper should run with his money. 	Jainarayan thinks that  the Emergency Committee was a private body. 	There was no report about it in the papers nor is it likely to do 	any work. It is the Standing Committee which must have the sole 	authority. I had asked Jamnalalji. He says that the Emergency 	Committee was formed with the consent of Jainarayanji and others, 	and, therefore, the Standing Committee remains suspended at present. 	It was Balwantrai, and not J., who was keen on the States’ 	People’s [Conference]. Jawaharlal has conveyed to Menon that he 	should abide by my advice. That is why I have taken interest in the 	matter. My opinion is as above. If you also agree with it there will 	be no need for you to come. If you differ, however, then it is 	desirable that you should come here. I think there will be no 	difficulty if the States’ People’s [Conference] is run 	independently. I     
 think we should meet and decide about that. I leave everything to you. I would certainly like your coming here. If you feel that anybody else should be present, you may arrange accordingly.

 [On or before May 21, 1941]libtech_666_footnote
 For four days, Mridulabehn, Gulzarilal and I have had talks to our hearts’ content. If you and Sjt. Jivanlal Divan could have been also present, it would have been very helpful to me in arriving at a decision.
 I gather that there are two opinions regarding what the Congress did, failed to do, and should do in future in case of communal disturbances. However that may be, everything considered, I am of opinion that, in a crisis like the present, an Advisory Committee (of which the personnel is given below) should be appointed, and everything should be done according to their advice. You will see that I have included Shri Mahadev Desai’s name on the Committee. He will not be able to be there on all occasions, but he will try to be there whenever you all feel that his presence is essential.
 Your first duty is to find out how many among our  Congressmen firmly hold that violent resistance against an opponent in defence of oneself or others is out of the question. Those who favour violent resistance must get out of the Congress and shape their conduct just as they think fit and guide others accordingly. I am firmly of opinion that, if the Congress does not clearly define its policy in this matter, it will end in proving itself to be a useless organization.
 
 If a majority of Congressmen hold that violent resistance against an assailant is a duty, and if they do not regard it ,as inconsistent with the creed of the Congress, they should openly declare their opinion and guide people accordingly. The absence of our leaders in jail should not deter anyone from declaring his opinion in this crisis. It can be revised in case it is found later to be wrong. The point is that no one should be in a state of indecisiveness.
 I am sure that, if all Congressmen had done their  duty,  we should not have had the goondashahi—the reign of the goonda—that we had recently.
 That people should flee for their lives for fear of the goonda should be intolerable. They ought to possess the capacity of resisting goondashahi violently or non-violently. If my interpretation of the Congress creed is correct, the Congress and Congressmen may offer non-violent resistance only, and they are sure to succeed. But we should tell the people, in the clearest possible terms, that running away in fear is cowardice. It is their duty to offer resistance—even violent, if they are incapable of non-violent resistance, which is a worthy way.
 Congressmen will not ask for the help of the Government, the police or the military. Those who believe in violent resistance will indeed ask for Government’s help.
 A Congressman may not directly or indirectly associate himself with gymnasia where training in violent resistance is given. But he will appeal even to the believer in violent resistance to observe certain rules of restraint. Even violent resistance admits of a certain amount of de- cency. Thus, for instance, murdering an innocent man in cold blood should be taboo. The fundamental thing to be borne in mind is that people should, under no circumstances, be cowardly or impotent. One need never be a goonda to fight a goonda. One who stabs another in the back and takes to his heels will never be counted as brave.
 A Congressman can have no prejudices, and so he would go out of his way to meet members of the Muslim League, the Hindu Maha- sabha and other bodies in the interest of peace, and persuade them to combine in ruling out the law of the jungle, no matter how great their political differences. That these endeavours may fail should not matter in the least. It is their duty to appeal to everyone, and to flatter none.
 The Congress will not claim compensation for losses sustained during the riots. That is not its concern. The people had to sustain losses as they lacked the capacity to defend themselves; and so they
 must bear them. I go so far as to believe that Government could not, even if they would, secure adequate compensation to those who have sustained losses.
 I think it is terrible to think of protecting ourselves with the help of the Bhaiyya, the Sikh or the Thakurda. To engage an ordinary durwan or gate-keeper is a different proposition. There should be no young man among the mercantile middle-class  community  who hasnot gone through training for self-defence, violent or non-violent. Engaging these foreign elements for defence, far from putting an end to goondashahi will put a premium on it.
 Hindus staying in Muslim localities must not leave them, but stay on there even at the risk of their lives. Muslims living in Hindu localities should be ensured the fullest protection by the Hindus.
 The practice of closing down shops at the slightest rumour of disturbance should be stopped and every shopkeeper should be ready for violent or non-violent self-defence. If they will cultivate this courage, the loss will be reduced to a minimum, and the riots would become a thing of the past. Riots such as we have in our country are unknown in the West, though there may be civil wars  there.  The reason is that the contending parties there are equally matched, and do not take to their heels at the sight of one another, nor do they ask for and accept police help. The use of the police is entirely for protection against thieves and robbers. In this respect  we  are  absolutely barbarous and even impotent.

467,"May 22, 1941",INTERVIEW TO “THE HINDU”,"
  
 [On or before May 22, 1941]libtech_668_footnote
 Replying to a question put by me, in the course of a special interview, whether he felt that the British Government would not come to any understanding with India, that they would prefer to continue the policy of drift, Mahatma Gandhi said:
I am afraid, I have to say, ‘Yes’. Quite; that has been their
 traditional policy and it seems that, even whilst they are fighting for their very existence, they do not or they will not revise their traditional policy.
 Asked whether in the present circumstances the Congress should be content with merely recording its moral protest when moral values seemed to be the first victim in the war, Gandhiji replied:
The Congress has no other value and no other influence. Whilst
 it is true that moral values are the first victims in war, in the end they will emerge triumphant if there is any body of people ready to represent them. And I have every hope that the Congress is at least
 
 one such body to represent moral values. If I am asked for proof, I can’t give it. Time alone will show.
 When I drew Gandhiji’s attention to the remarklibtech_669_footnotehe made in the course of his statement on communal riots that mischief-makers and their victims who failed to stand up to them were all untouched by Congress and yet these are the men who form the bulk of Congress meetings, Gandhiji replied:
 Yes, I have been obliged to say that because Congress has not been able to gain control over rowdy elements. It does not matter to me whether these elements are supported by powerful organizations or, as some hint, encouraged by the British authorities. I have no manner of doubt that the mass mind has to shed all  fear of goondaism. Whether that fear is shed violently or non-violently, it has to be shed before we can defend ourselves not only against British might but the world. The first condition of civilized life is that people are able to deal with goondaism, no matter how fomented.
 Asked whether the report that no further list of satyagrahis is likely to be approved by him is correct, Gandhiji said that satyagraha is temporarily suspended in places where there is tension due to communal riots and where there are a large number of satyagrahis who have not yet been arrested.
 To a question whether satyagrahis returning from jail will be required to offer satyagraha again, Gandhiji replied:
 Every one of them, I suppose, will go to jail from time to time until the whole question is settled for which civil disobedience is being offered, that is, until the object of civil disobedience is fulfilled.

Your health department seems to be doing excellent work.
Many find it a great help.
 You have given no news about your health. May I, therefore, take it that it is fine?
 You did very well in sending an extract from Jaiji’s letter. It is excellent. Tell her when you write that I remember her quite often. What she says about the virtues of the British is correct, but the description is incomplete. It is necessary for us to realize that their intoxication of power, highhandedness and blatant lies, seen here in India, show that their civilization is rooted in selfishness and love of pleasure. If we do not get angry with them despite this knowledge and cultivate friendship, then alone will our ahimsa be worth the name. We have not yet developed such ahimsa.
I hope everything is going on well there. My blessings to all.

 Sushila is having her examination from the 26th.  It  will conclude on the 31st. I have given her full encouragement to appear for the examination. There are strong reasons for it. By the grace of God she will pass.
 Ba, Devdas, Lakshmi, etc., will be arriving on the 24th. Lakshmi will be going to Madras. Ramdas will also be coming. Mahadev has gone to Ahmedabad today with Mridula and Gulzarilal. Durgabelon and Sushi have gone to Bombay for Durgabehn’s medical check up. They will be returning in about a week’s time.

 I 	have your letter.  	You do not have to worry about the opposition from your brother. He 	did not have the background to form an opinion. And then does he 	also not think that my decision should be taken as final? He told 	even Mahadev:“What have I got to say when Bapu has made the 	choice?” Moreover, at the root of his opposition is his love or 	att- achment. He wishes to see you at the top in everything. He 	would certainly not tolerate that you should fail. I would give no 	importance to your failing at all. The value of examination lies in 	giving prestige to a person. But those who fail do not lose their 	prestige, do they? 
 There are many reasons for one’s failing. Many clever persons are also known to have failed. But I for one cannot believe that you can fail.
 Both Durgabehn and Mahadevbhai will have arrived here by the time you come. Munnalal has already come in a sick condition. It is only malaria and he has been given cinchona and quinine. He is better today.
 I expect that Ba will be arriving the day after tomorrow. Lilavati writes that she may delay her coming by a couple of days because Ramdas has arrived there.
Do not worry about Ba. I shall continue your treatment here.

The best defence would be to surrender before the murderer 	and die. For such defence we should have unlimited capacity for 	forgiveness.

YOUTHS’ TRAINING CAMPlibtech_676_footnote","
       WARDHA,  May 	23, 1941  	It is but natural that nowadays I don’t feel like leaving Sevagram 	at all. If I express a desire to do so I get invitations to various 	places. But I am unable to complete the different jobs I have on 	hand at Sevagram. That is why it is not possible for me to take 	interest in other things. But 	then I thought to myself that so many boys are coming to    
 Wardha and I wouldn’t like it if I am not able to mix freely with them or crack jokes with them. So I myself agreed to come and attend the Camp.
 Today my mind is full of only one thing. I cannot think of anything except what has happened at Ahmedabad, Dacca, Bombay and in Bihar. Riots have again started in Ahmedabad. There are disturbances in Bombay, too.
 I ask you, ‘‘What part are the youths supposed to play in these circumstances?” Every Indian should ask himself this question.
 There are but two ways of facing this situation. One is  the age-old way of the world—meeting violence with violence. There is yet another way of defending oneself—that is, to peacefully endure the suffering and not to take revenge. The first way is considered universal. It is unmanly to run away from danger. Dumb animals run away when beaten. We should not be like them. It only befits us to face the danger like men and sacrifice our lives while doing so if the occasion demands. The Congress has shown the path of facing violence through non-violence. This is the only right way. If you are not able to accept this, then it is your duty to fight the enemy as much as you like. But do remember this—you have to fight only the assailant; to take revenge on innocent people is a sign of inhumanity and cowardice.
 I wish you to make yourselves worthy of accepting the new and better way—the non-violent way—of bravely dying for the cause. You should neither give blow for blow nor run away for your life. For the last twenty years we have been learning to put this supreme art into practice. Today the situation is such that it is a challenge to our faith in the new way of self-defence, i.e., non-violence. I hope you have been taught the art of facing such difficult situations.
 At the moment every Congressman is put to a severe test. If the Congress does not stand this test it will not have a right to exist as a national institution. What counts most is that we should be true to ourselves.

  	I can’t express myself in English. The reply is contained in your 	description ltself. If a man is passing through a forest alone, and 	someone stabs him in the back, he cannot do anything. But according 	to your description, men were stabbed in many residential areas; in 	such places the assailant could easily be caught, or would be 	killed, provided the people are not cowardly. The murder of one 	innocent person cannot be avenged by killing another innocent 	person. If ignorance is added to ignorance, the sum can be only 	ignorance. Think over this calmly and, if I have misunderstood the 	facts, let me know. You may write in English.  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	a photostat of the Gujarati: G.N. 5749

 I did not like your letter. Anyway it is good that you have communicated to me the thoughts that arose in your mind. But why did such thoughts arise? Whatever you have written could have been decided with patience by you and Chimanlal. Once you have realized your position you should have the art to retain it with dignity. I can set right everything, but you will not gain thereby. Chimanlal says that he will be glad even if he is removed from the post of manager. If there is no manager and each department is responsible for its own work, and no one is responsible for all the departments; this too is not proper. What have you to say now?

 If you have understood my letterlibtech_706_footnotelibtech_707_footnote, then the other two [questions] need no reply. The pity is that both [you and Chimanlal] are ready to give up work. What would you give up? Duty or right? Duty cannot be given up and there is no right. You cannot give up what forms a part of duty, what is left is only a burden. This applies to both you and Chimanlal. If Chimanlal does not enjoy the privilege  of a manager, then he is free, but what remains as part of duty has got to be done. For example, if Surendra steals, then power has to  be exercised to stop him from doing so. But if he insults anyone, the use of power should be shunned. Both of you should read this. Perhaps many things will then get solved by themselves.

 Manibehn arrived yesterday. She has grown very weak indeed. Even so, I would have asked her to return to jail, but I think she can do very useful work in Ahmedabad. I have, therefore, asked her to proceed there. She will spend two or three days in Bombay.
 She tells me that the condition of lavatories in the women’s ward is intolerable. You should fight about this matter there. It seems to be less a matter of expenditure than of indifference or lethargy. I think
 
 you can, through judicious intervention, get things improved. Mani says what Hansabehnlibtech_718_footnotehas written is not enough.
 Let not the riots worry you at all. What is destined to happen will happen. Personally I believe it is a civil war that has started. It remains to be seen how far it takes us. Nobody can influence the events now. I am not worrying at all. I am guiding people according to my lights. If necessary, I will go to Ahmedabad or Bombay or anywhere else.

We 	should take necessary precaution and give up fear. I do not feel 	satisfied by keeping Gorkha watchmen and so on. We may keep them but 	at the same time give up all fear, and learn to defend ourselves 	through violence or non-violence. We would perish if we depended on 	others. People are cowardly, and that is why they are scared by such 	things; and there are lots of people in the world to scare them. On 	this occasion my advice to you is to give up all fear, and tell 	others also to do so. Such disturbances will go on and will 	increase. They can die out if Hindus become brave in the true sense. 	Such bravery cannot be gained in a day or two. We can be secure if 	we understand  the situation and face it. It hurts me that our 	people even give up their moral stand.

 Our   talklibtech_720_footnotewas  not   for   publication.   Something   has   already appeared. It should not have. I do not understand Marathi well. But as far as I understand your notes, they faithfully interpret my answers. It would be however better for me to put forth the whole thing in a form fit for publication.
 If the socialist friends or any others resent my restrictions, of course it is open to them to take independent action. This they can do by resigning from the Congress. It would be rebellion, if they act independently while they remain in the Congress. Their rebellion will be justified, if they carry the bulk of Congressmen with them in their revolt. So you will see that my instructions in no way interfere with the independence of any single person.
 
 One word for yourself. Where are you? I have a feeling that you yourself do not like the restrictions I have suggested. If so, you will fail in Maharashtra. You won’t be able to carry on the struggle mechanically. You have to carry out the programme in faith and with resoluteness which comes from faith.
 If I have misunderstood you, the part of the letter which refers to you must be regarded as not written at all.

       BHAI 	GHANSHYAMDAS,    June 	4, 1941 
  	The letter has had no effect on me because I did not find anything 	new in it. If I had written anything about that, I would have given 	them another chance to tell lies, and it would have been of no use. 	The principle is that except for doing our own duty we should 	notbother about anything else. But my unwillingness had nothing to 	do with the principle.  	I am glad to know that there is no atmosphere of fear in Calcutta. 	It would be very satisfying if at the back of this fearlessness is a 	restraint in taking revenge. Perhaps the riots, etc., will increase 	but it will be good if neither party goes beyond limits; any other 	course 
 would do no good to the country. From today there is a change in the weather. A cool breeze has started.

 MY DEAR FAREED,
 I had your letter. The affliction that has befallen you must be regarded as our common lot. I hope however that your mother has survived the illness. Of course no son wants to be away from mother’s bedside.libtech_722_footnote
 The fact is helibtech_723_footnotelibtech_724_footnotewas a selfless friend and guide to so many. Such was his goodness. May his spirit sustain us and enable us  to  so conduct ourselves as to prove worthy of him.
 You vainly approach me for relief and strength. I have none of his great medical skill nor do I possess the knowledge of you all that he had. But I know God has given you strength and courage enough to bear the separation.
 The heat here too has been very great, hot winds blowing day and night. It seems to have cooled down a bit today.
 You know that Jamnalalji has been discharged on medical grounds. He is much reduced but purposely. The question is whether he will be able to get rid of his arthritis. He is in Sevagram undergoing the same dietetic course he was having in the jail. Of course there is no cause for anxiety.
 Is   Shaukatlibtech_725_footnotestill   in   the   same   place?   Please   send   me   his address when you next write to me. Both he and Zohra have beennaughty. For they have never written to me. I hope S. has been doing well.
 
 Dr. Gopichandlibtech_726_footnotelibtech_727_footnoteis likely to come here soon.
 I am glad to have the few lines from Brijkishen. He should get rid of his constipation. Satyavati wrote to me some time ago but she has been silent for a long time.
My love to you all.

I would like your reaction to my statements. If you 	have not read them, I would get the cuttings and send them. My 	remark that in Dacca and Ahmedabad the start was made by Muslim 	goondas has been specially resented. I wonder what you have to say 	to that remark. What disturbs me most are the indecent stabbings and 	the like. Whatever the political differences between parties  or 	communities, a resolute attempt should be made to avoid the use of 	the law of the jungle.       
 At first I had thought of writing simultaneously to Zakirlibtech_732_footnoteand Khwaja. But as I began to write, I thought to myself I would first confine myself to you.
 I know you will give me the whole of your thought. Love.

 CHI. MUNNALAL,
 Somehow all these days I could not reply to your note. I had nothing special to say. It would be a very good thing if you just now devote yourself to the dhanush takli and learn to make it. That will give you both peace of mind and knowledge, besides enabling you to serve Daridranarayana. Afterwards you will of course  appear  for both the examinations simultaneously. We will send Kanchan to Valod or Bangalore when Sushilabehn returns. Her own wish is to stay here till you have fully regained strength. Don’t hurt her in any way. She is a child, and you are mature and have seen life.

  Yours 	sincerely,  M. K. GANDHI  From 	a copy: Pyarelal Papers. Courtesy: Pyarelal         SEVAGRAM,  June 	9, 1941  	I have read and re-read with shame and sorrow an official account of 	the cool, calculated and unprovoked murder of a Muslim family 	including an infant girl, three years old. Though Rajendra Babu is 	doing glorious work on behalf of communal peace in Bihar, it is 	impossible for me to suppress my own opinion on this cruel crime. 	The perpetrators, whoever they may be, have done no good either to 	themselves or their religion, if they have any, or to this country. 	This I say apart from my views on ahimsa. I suggest that on no 	ground, even of violence, can such murders be defended. Repeated on 	a wide scale they must reduce our fair land to savagery and make the 	country’s freedom an impossibility. No government can cope with 	such crimes. They can only punish the miscreants after the event and 	that only if they are found. In the latter case, the punishment is 	likely to be as indiscriminate and savage as the crime itself. I, 	therefore, advise the perpetrators with all the force my words may 	possess to deliver themselves up unconditionally to the authorities 	for such punishment as the latter may think fit to award. This act 	of repentance, tardy though it will be, will somewhat recompense for 	the grievous crime committed. They will thereby purge themselves, 	their religion andtheir country to some extent of the disgrace that 	attaches to the crime. Such    
 a confession, if it is frank and wholehearted, may also serve as an example and possibly prevent a recurrence of such savagery.

It is but natural for a girl to wish to stay with her parents. It is not quite necessary that she should stay with you. You should remain here and do what you can.

 SEVAGRAM,
 June 15, 1941
 Shri K. M. Munshi wrote to  me  the  enclosedlibtech_748_footnotelibtech_749_footnotefrom  Nainital to   which   I   sent   a   replylibtech_750_footnotein   Gujarati   of   which   the   original   and translation are herewith enclosed. In pursuance of the correspondence, Shri K. M. Munshi came to melibtech_751_footnoteas soon as it was possible after his return to Bombay. In the course of the discussion, I discovered that whilst he accepted in the abstract the principle of ahimsa with all its implications, he felt the greatest difficulty in acting upon it, the more so as with his intimate knowledge of Bombay he was sure that he could not carry the Hindus with him, much less the Muslims. He knew that the numerous Hindus who were under his influence would look to him for guidance and would seek his advice. He saw no way of convincing them that they could defend themselves through ahimsa. As a political weapon and therefore of immediate use in the midst of the riots which looked more like a miniature civil war, he could not make any effective use of ahimsa. With him the question was not one of interpretation of Congress resolutions but of being truthful to himself and to the country. In view, therefore, of the following resolutionlibtech_752_footnotelibtech_753_footnoteby the A.I.C.C. explaining the Wardha statement, I advised that the only dignified and brave course for him was to resign from the Congress and attain freedom of action unhampered by restrictions entailed by the Congress non-violence.
 
 The A.I.C.C. has considered the statement issued by the Working Committee from Wardha on June 21, 1940, and confirmed it. The A.I.C.C. is of opinion that as explained therein, while the Congress must continue to adhere strictly to the principle of non-violence in the struggle for independence, it is unable, in the present circumstances, to declare that the principle should be extended to free India’s national defence. The A.I.C.C. desires to affirm that the Congress organization should continue to be conducted on the principle of non-violence and all Congress volunteers are bound by their pledge to remain non-violent in the discharge of their duty and no Congress volunteers’ organization can be formed or maintained except on that basis. Any other volunteers’ organization for the purpose of self-defence with which Congressmen are associated must likewise adhere to non-violence.
 I told him that there came a time in every Congressman’s life when being a Congressman dragged him down; that was when there was conflict between thought and action. For the spring of non-violent action was non-violent thought. If the latter was absent, the former had subjectively little or no value. Therefore it was good for him, the Congress and the country that he should resign and mould hisaction from moment to moment as he thought proper. And by his action he would open the door for those Congressmen to resign whose practice could not accord with their thought. The Congress was conceived to be a non-violent and truthful organization in which there should be no place for those who could not honestly conform to these two conditions. Strange as it might appear, the practice of non-violence seemed more difficult than of truth. For the fruits of untruth were more indetectable than those of violence.
 My advice appealed to Shri Munshi. And he has decided to accept it.libtech_754_footnotelibtech_755_footnoteHe will go because he could not be disloyal to the Congress he has so long served. And it does not at all follow that his resignation means that from being a meek and mild man he suddenly becomes a fierce man, vowing vengeance on those whom he may consider to be opponents, or that he becomes a communal anti-nationalist. I have no doubt that for him every non-Hindu whose only home is India is as much Indian as a Hindu, born and bred in India. I congratulate him upon taking the step he will and I have every hope that his resignation from the Congress will enable him to utilize his faculties so as to make a decisive contribution towards the establishment of lasting peace in Bombay.

540,"June 15, 1941","REPLY TO BRITISH
WOMEN’S APPEALlibtech_756_footnote","
  
 SEVAGRAM,
 June 15, 1941
 DEAR SISTERS,
 We have very carefully studied your message addressed to  India’s women. We write this in our individual capacity, as also that of representative  members  of the  A.I.W.C.  which,  as  you  know,   is  an organization of fifteen years’ standing. We mention this to show that what we state here is not only our deep personal conviction, but also, as far as we can judge, the conviction of a large body of India’s women.
 It is scarcely necessary to tell you that we  appreciate  the sincerity of your appeal. But we are amazed at the ignorance betrayed in it of the realities. Indeed your Prime Ministerlibtech_757_footnotelibtech_758_footnoteby contrast shows a grasp of realities which is refreshing, however painful it may be. He has no misgivings about the status that India occupies in the British mind. It is a dependency which can and is being utilized at the British will. He knows that he does not need the consent or co-operation of India’s thinking sons and daughters in anything that Britain wants for fighting her war. He takes care to pay tribute to the valour of the Indian soldiers who are part of the army of occupation in India. These soldiers you should know are wholly unconnected with the national life and activities. They may not freely see any nationalist without incurring heavy penalties, nor has your Prime Minister any difficulty in raising either by taxation or so-called voluntary contributions the money he wants. We cannot complain of this helplessness but we must not be blind to the facts. How can there be the association, in such a situation, of the India that is impatient of the foreign yoke with the forcible aid we have adverted to?
 The fact is that you are wholly wrong in your estimate of things. We are surprised at your quoting the untruth contained in President Roosevelt’s pronouncement. You quote: “Today the whole world is
 
 divided between human slavery and human freedom.”libtech_759_footnotelibtech_760_footnoteThe fact is that there is no such thing as human freedom for Asiatic races, certainly not for India, nor is there for the virile Africans. The result, whatever it may be, of the war will not alter their condition for the better, save through their own efforts. As we see the reality, it is this. It  is a war between the British Empire and Nazis and Fascists for world domination, meaning in effect exploitation of the  non-European races.
 We cannot be in love with Nazism and Fascism. But we may not be expected to be in love with British Imperialism.
 Now perhaps you will understand why we as women are against all war. Women’s part is just now to stand up for truth and non-violence as against the untruth and violence which surround us. We admire the self-sacrifice of the British women of which you write with just pride. Here we wish you could have taken a braver andprouder part by telling your men to wash their hands clean of human blood. You might not have succeeded all at once. But you would have led the way to the establishment of permanent peace. We take leave to doubt the wisdom of women aping men in the black art of human slaughter on a scale hitherto unknown.
 Lastly, let us point out the anomaly of British women asking India, though a slave nation, to help the slave-owner in distress instead of asking the slave-owner to undo the wrong and cure himself of the initial sin and thus ensure the moral justness of his position.
 This presentation of the picture may appear unpleasant to you but it is none the less sincere. And we could not answer your sincerity except by being equally sincere.

 The way to hand over the kitchen to Harijans is to train those men and women who work steadily and to leave the others out. In the beginning one of us should supervise their work. This sort of arrangement prevails in all institutions.
 
 The rules of the kitchen continue to be the same. The change is only in the case of fruit. It should be served to those who must have it and to others when available. Mangoes will go out in a few days now. Serve papayas when they become available. If you can give fruit to everyone by all means do so.
 Nothing is to be given to anyone because he likes it but Ba is exempted from this rule. Shakaribehn can prepare something for herself, if she desires. In the ease of others anything outside the menu may be prepared only if specially instructed by me. Of course you know about Shastriji.
This covers everything.

His radiant soul is immortal and pervades every 	particle of the      
 province of Orissa.
 Jivrambhai was rich. According to me he was an ideal trustee. He gave his money for the spread of the charkha among the poor of Orissa. He himself lived like the poor of Orissa and all the twenty-four hours his thoughts were full of the welfare of the people of Orissa. Shri Ishwarlal describes his last days thus:
 He suffered from diarrhoea for nearly three months. He stopped taking medicines from the 18th June, 1941. He said: “I have been taking medicines for the last three months and there is no improvement. So now let it be as God wills.” He was using mud-packs. He had completely given up food. He took mosambi juice which also he gave up later. Since the morning of the 23rd he did not take even water. He used to rinse his mouth when his throat went dry. I told him: “Please take some water”. He replied: “Don’t you see I am losing my breath?” This he said in the morning and till ten minutes to three he was fully conscious. Within ten minutes all of a sudden he was unconscious and lay stiff. Without any movement, slowly the breathing stopped.
Let us all become like him. May God grant us such a noble
death.

 Yes, I did receive your letter about Andrews’ sisters. Amrit it was who sent an acknowledgement. But who knows what letters reach addressees. The wonder is that in the midst of the terrible slaughter there is still so much order.
I have not yet been able to do anything about the sisters. Even
 
 
 the memorial is hanging fire. If I live long enough I shall collect the money.
 The riots, floods and the struggle have upset all my plans. The riots this time have no resemblance to the former ones. This time it is a rehearsal for a civil war. My faith in the authorities is daily receiving rude shocks. It seems they will never learn, never forget.
 The Secretary of State never speaks but to irritate almost everybody. The breach is widening. There is much make-believe. In spite of all this, I do not despair of my ahimsa working. Its effect is silent, torturingly slow, but sure. You may therefore be sure that no stone will be left unturned on this side to promote understanding and friendliness.

       	Along with his success, Shri Narandas’s ambition and en- thusiasm 	go on increasing from year to year. So should it be with all those 	who have faith. The scope for khadi is as wide, at least, as the 	boundaries of India. This terrible; suicidal war may perhaps show 	that khadi, i.e., the principle of self-reliance for meeting one’s 	needs, is of universal application. Be that as it may, for India, at 	any rate, the spinning-wheel is the sole means of ending 	simultaneously both poverty and unemployment. I, therefore, hope 	that Kathiawar will completely fulfil Narandas’s ambition.  	It should be remembered that the use of khadi is spreading in 	Kathiawar. It should, therefore, produce locally all the khadi it 	needs. This will necessarily require more money. In view of this, 	all the money received this time will be used for production of 	khadi.  	Narandas hopes to collect at least one lakh rupees in the coming 72 	days. May this hope be fulfilled!  M. K. GANDHI  SEVAGRAM, 	July 1, 1941  From 	a microfilm of the Gujarati: M.M.U./II.

 [July 2, 1941]libtech_809_footnote
 For  domestic  reasons  in   which   the   public  is  not   interested I had to come back to Bengal leaving my two elder sons under Gandhiji’s care. On arrival in Bengal I proceeded at once to Dacca as I had  thought  under  Gandhiji’s  instructions.  And  I  made a  long statement about my going to Dacca. On seeing the statementGandhiji in a telegramlibtech_810_footnotelibtech_811_footnoterepudiated it and said that he had never given me any instructions but that he had said that if I felt like it   I could go to Dacca on my own responsibility and without fuss immolate myself there whilst trying to serve both the communities. I am sorry I misunderstood his instructions. I well recall his repeatedly saying to me as to all workers that we had to work silently and selflessly. But in the impulse of the moment I forgot myself and was betrayed into making a long statement up to which I could not live. In Dacca I was in need of directions without which I could not do work. I wired to Gandhiji for them and he wired libtech_812_footnotesaying he could issue none and that I should come away and work for my living which I am trying to do.libtech_813_footnote

606,"July 6, 1941",STATEMENT TO THE PRESS,"
  
 SEVAGRAM,
 July 6, 1941
 When Mian Saheb Iftikhar-ud-Din, President of the Punjab Provincial Congress Committee, and Dr. Gopichand were with me the other day, Mian Saheb told me that there was some misunderstanding among some Congressmen about certain things which required clearing. I should have dealt with them earlier. But pressure of work and my limited capacity for disposal are responsible for the delay. I take them up now.
 When the Punjab Bar patriotically took up the honourable role of amicus curiae and decided to bring before their High Court for revision the cases of satyagrahis in which, in their opinion, obvious injustice was done, I was delighted, not for the sake of the relief such revision might bring, but for the sake of the Punjab Bar and of purity of justice. Whilst satyagrahis must be indifferent to the sentences pronounced against them, they must welcome exposure of injustice especially when it is brought about at the instance of disinterested parties. When, therefore, Ismet Begum wired and wrote to me that her husband was much displeased and disturbed over the prospect of revision, I urged her not to interfere and asked her to tell her husband that there was nothing wrong about the revision and that if he was discharged it would be open to him to offer civil disobedience again. Of course the matter wears a different and ugly  aspect  when satyagrahi prisoners request the amicus curiae that they should take up their (prisoners’) cases. Such conduct would be quite contrary to the satyagraha code.
 Complaints are being made in several parts as in the Punjab that the new lists of satyagrahis are not being passed as fast as they are sent. There is no lack of despatch in the Punjab or any other province as to the lists. But I am in no hurry to pass them. I repeat for the thousandth time that the present civil disobedience is not only not designed to embarrass authority but care is being taken as far as possible to avoid all embarrassment. The merit as also the strength of the struggle consists in reducing embarrassment to  the  minimum whilst the British are engaged in a deadly life-and-death war. Moreover, since our struggle is going to be indefinitely prolonged —I
 give no less than five years—there need be no hurry to fill the jails. Mere filling of jails can bring us no nearer our freedom than we are now. The virtue lies in the people learning through the restricted civil disobedience the necessity of discipline, suffering and self-sacrifice. Every true example of satyagraha acts as a leaven working itself in the mass mind. During the initial stages I was purposely lax in scanning the lists. The result was that many crept in who had done no constructive work. Some had even no faith in it. These are a burden on the organization and positively hinder the march to freedom. I have said repeatedly that constructive work is the foundation for civil disobedience. It promotes discipline and conduces to the growth of non-violence in the worker. As time advances Congressmen must therefore expect increasing stiffness on my part. The conditions will be the same. Strictness will be confined to the enforcement. This is but natural if we are to grow from strength to strength and if we are to make the struggle increasingly purer. I can conduct it on no other terms.
 Then Mian Saheb mentioned to me that some Congressmen had adversely criticized his move for achieving among all parties in the Punjab agreement about eschewing goondaism in the pursuit of their respective programmes. When the Mian Saheb told me that there was just a possibility of such an effort succeeding, I at once told him to make it and suspend for the time being his own civil disobedience and of those whose assistance he might consider necessary for the arduous task. Some Congressmen seem to have taken exception that Mian Saheb had invited to his meeting non-Congressmen and even communal leaders. The objectors forget that it is the essence of Mian Saheb’s move to bring together all the opposite elements and see whether they could agree to eschew goondaism for the achievement of their respective purposes. Nor could there be in such a meeting decisions by counting heads. The end contemplated could only be achieved by the willing consent of the parties. In any event Congressmen should know that Mian Saheb has undertaken this difficult mission in consultation with me and with my whole-hearted consent. I hope that he will receive the closest co-operation of all Congressmen.
 He is impatient  to  offer  civil  disobedience.  As  the  head of the Congress in the Punjab, he thinks that his primary duty is to offer civil disobedience. I have told him that there is no such universal
 rule. On the contrary it is his clear duty, and of those whom he mayselect, to refrain so long as he and they feel that they can  contribute their mite to the attempt to eradicate goondaism.
 There remains the question of those who were prematurely released owing to the Punjab High Court decision about the insufficiency for the purpose of conviction of mere notices to offer civil disobedience. When I learnt about the decision, I had informed Mian Saheb that he should not be in a hurry to send them to jail and that when he paid his contemplated visit to Sevagram I should discuss the question with him and decide. He came and I advised that those who were not wanted for the peace move should re-offer civil disobedience.

 I shall send you intimation about Jamnalal’s food when he is here. But nothing special. You have everything he can need. Fresh vegetables, fruit and milk.
 Mahadev says he reaches on 10th. With the breaches on the railway lines, nothing is certain.

  	Your letter. Both the language and the writing are good. And if you 	write your Hindi as quickly as English, the progress is marvellous.  	Jamnalal came in today. He looks very healthy. He wants to stay till 	15th at the latest. He wants to finish certain things. I do not want 	to rush him.  	You must not become cheap. I do not like the officers always sending 	you a polite ‘No’. It is a hint that you must not expect 	anything now that you have openly come over to me. From their 	standpoint I would justify their conduct. You cannot blow hot and 	cold. All this would be sound argument from their standpoint. They 	can have no other. But if you think otherwise, you should act 	accordingly. For there would be nothing inherently wrong in your 	writing to officials, The same argument applies in Bul’slibtech_846_footnotecase. After her notice they have asked her to await 	instructions from them. She has consented to wait till 10th. There 	too you should use your independent judgment. Love.

615,"July 	9, 1941",A NOTE,"
       July 	9, 1941  	I have read both the letters. Cariappa’s fault is clear. It is 	also proper that Munnalal has begged for pardon. But Munnalal’s 	views are wrong on many things. No one can be unworthy of living in 	an institution. The world itself is an institution. Can anybody stay 	outside it? The family is also an institution. It is a 	sub-institution; and in between the world and the family are 	institutions like ours. All are imperfect. The world is also 	imperfect. There is no such thing as a perfect institution because 	every institution is made up of imperfect    
 human beings. Only God is perfect. Hence Munnalal cannot run away from an institution; he has to live in one or another.

Who will manage the Ashram? I should like it if Nathibai came here. Give her the letter meant for her. Some memorial ought to be erected at the spot where Jivrambhai was cremated.

 CHI. MUNNALAL,
 Even a person who becomes perfect as a man does not become God. Even Krishna the man died a miserable death.libtech_849_footnoteHe may have been the best among men but was not God. Just as a frog may become the highest among frogs, so a man may be the highest among men. Any institution, therefore, created by man is bound to be imperfect.
 If, however, you feel unhappy in this institution, you must leave it. I merely wanted to say that what you had stated about all institutions was based on ignorance.libtech_850_footnote
 I would certainly welcome your staying in another institution, namely, the family. That is what poor Kanchan wants. She has not known the joys of family life. Make her happy and let her  feel satisfied.
 Here we do have freedom. I am certain that you will enjoy nowhere else the freedom that you do here. If you reflect over the matter, you will see that you cannot tolerate in others the freedom that you want for yourself. Cariappa was certainly at fault in refusing to do anything, but you should have respected his freedom to do that. Likewise, you should respect Chimanlal’s freedom not to keep Nimbarkar, just as he should respect your freedom to express your opinion. Whether justice or injustice is being done to Nimbarkar is for me to see. I shall look into the matter.

            DEAR 	SISTER,     SEVAGRAM, 	via WARDHA,  July 	14/16, 1941 
  	Your questions are good. In non-violent  war,  to  mix  poison in 	water or to burn grains, oil, etc., are forbidden, and should be so. 	 It is one thing to non-co-operate with the enemy and quite another 	to stop water, etc., to harm him. The non-co-operator  accepts 	suffering for himself. For example, a lawyer will starve because 	ofnon-co-operation.  Motilaljilibtech_862_footnotelibtech_863_footnotesacrificed 	 lakhs  of   rupees.   Students gave up their studies. Men working 	in offices gave up their jobs. We are not going to run away from the 	invaders and if we do so, unable to bear the sufferings, we would 	leave our property as the Dukhoborslibtech_864_footnotehad done in Russia. In following ahimsa there is no 	question of ever doing what Stalin was obliged to do.  	A satyagrahi is not to protect his property, instead he may give up 	his life. A satyagrahi should be a non-possessor and he can defend 	others by being so. That is why I said that Englishmen may lose 	England but not their self-respect. To save his self-respect while 	doing no harm to his enemy, a satyagrahi has, for the time being, to 	allow his property to be looted. Anyway in a violent war too he 	would, on being defeated, lose his property. The 	habit of getting help from the police has got to be tolerated   
     Canada   
 even though it is against ahimsa. To control a madman by force  would not be wrong if the man who holds him down has no  self-interest in it. All such cases should be examined independently.

  	Yesterday I was able to give you only a postcard. Here are two 	letters from your pupils. They would have been written earlier, if I 	had remembered your message. But your instructions to destroy your 	letters make it difficult for me to carry things in my head and 	reproduce them at the exact moment.  	Khan Saheb has returned from Nagpur less all his teeth. Some were 	too strong for removal but Bareto was determined to remove all. He 	suffered much pain. He is better today. He will go to Bul as soon as 	he is better.  	Mahadev returned with Ghanshyamdas yesterday. Ghanshyam- das goes to 	Nasik on Saturday for a change. He is not overwell.  	White ants have invaded our hut and so Ramdas is digging up 	everything for tracing the mother. It means rebuilding walls, etc. 	More money. Terrible to contemplate!  	Prabha is here and will be for a few days. She has to go to 	Jayaprakash again. 
 You need not bother about Sushila’s exam. Col. A. has written to her how she failed, why and what she should do to ensure success. Her clinical experience is not up to the mark. And so she has gone to Bombay for a fortnight. That is the beginning. It is a difficult job to earn and study. She has got to do the trick. For she will take no scholarship. She is very wonderful in this as in other directions. And she is growing. Amtul Salaam is better.

  	Yes, you should go to see Jawaharlal on 24th. Mahadev says Nandan is 	not going on 29th. I 	hope Jamnalal reached there safely. Though I asked for no 
 wire, I do expect.
 The summer months you now understand. I have anxiety about you which I have not about others because I have a responsibility about you towards Shummy who does not fully approve of your staying with me. My anxiety arises from the fact that I am not always clear about my duty regarding you at a given moment. But that is nothing.

  	You have asked a proper question. I do not feel like saying 	anything. In such matters I have always given the first place to 	Jawaharlal’s views and he is not here. His policy has been the 	policy of the Congress. Since he is in prison my mind does not work 	at all. Russia is not a country like Spain or China. The English are 	even now giving [them] help. I find a great difference between Lenin 	and Stalin. Lenin’s Russia is no more. But this is going into the 	merits and shortcomings. I may be wrong in my observation.

 What you say in your letterlibtech_877_footnotelibtech_878_footnoteis  true.  Don’t  be  eager  to  go  to Wardha for marketing. You may do that when you are all right, for you have a special aptitude for it. For the present, follow my advice and confine yourself to work in the farm— within the limits of your strength. That will restore your health. Give up all worries.  Live chiefly on milk and curds. Eat whatever fruit you can get. Eat very little of bread, but eat greens in plenty.
 Your second letter is fine. The best way of winning people’s trust is through selfless work and service. The secret of this lies in “seeing oneself in all creatures”. If this truth abides in your heart, nothing will make you unhappy. My plan regarding your expenses is this. I wish to draw from the money Iying in your name for all extraordinary expenses till the amount is exhausted. You two will begin to progress rapidly only when it is fully exhausted. As long as the money is there, interest in possession will remain and you will continue to harbour the sense of proprietorship. Though it is true that both of you have practically gifted away the money, the knowledge that you own it does you harm. If you do not understand this distinction, ask me.
 Let not the arrival of Kanchan disturb your peace of mind in the least. It is indeed a good thing that she has come. Stop regarding her as your property. You may start living as husband and wife after some time, but if you accept her right to enjoy the same freedom that you do, you will not get angry with her for anything she does. You may let her serve you, but you must not feel in the least offended if she does not do that to the extent you would like her to do. You wish to win her trust, too, don’t you? Please remember that unbroken cheerfulness is the most important condition for your keeping good health.

It offers useful suggestions to those who have become acquainted 	with the subject. I would, therefore, call it Kantanarne Upayogi 	Soochanolibtech_900_footnoteor 	 simply Kantanarne.  	Your instructions are incomplete in some ways. You have assumed that 	the spinner can tell when a spindle is bent or can judge about the 	point. My experience is that 95 spinners out of a hundred cannot do 	that. You should, therefore, explain what a bent spindle and a good 	point are. You should similarly explain about slivers, etc.  	The third and easiest method of determining the count of yarn is not 	what you have suggested. The count is equal to the number of rounds 	in one-anna weight of yarn. The method you have explained does of 	course include this, but a beginner will not be able to see this.  I 	found from experience that the method suggested by me was the best. 	I hit upon it while trying, day after day, to determine the count of 	my yarn in Yeravda.  	You have suggested the use of cocoanut oil. My experience is that it 	smells and also attracts ants. I used to mix with cocoanut oil 	one-fourth or a little more of kerosene. This keeps away ants and 	less of dirt gets mixed with the oil.  	From the above you will be able to think for yourself about other 	revisions. I had noted other points in my mind, but I don’t     
 remember them now. After saying all this, I do hold the booklet to be a fine one. I have made the above suggestions because I wish to see it perfect.

Both of them can be 	said to have forgotten their duty. Anyway all this is over now. But     
 onreading your letter, I almost felt like weeping. You started writing by dipping your pen into a cup of venom and poured out the whole of it in the end. Why all this? I was sure that Dr. Arundale would come over. Had he come, he would have certainly spoken in English. It was with hesitation that I permitted Vishwanathdas to speak in English but I would have gladly permitted Dr. Arundale. You just cannot have any concrete reason to doubt this. I have no hostility towards Dr. Arundale nor towards any Englishman. I had none against General Dyer and I was a worshipper of Mrs. Annie Besant. Perhaps you might not have been born when I began to idolize her. This was in 1889-90. I beg your pardon if you were born about this time. I do not remember at all about the meeting where Shri Iyengar was present. Why should I oppose putting up a statue of Mrs. Annie Besant? I do not remember anything at all. I shall be obliged if you will give me the evidence you have.
 In the end you have exceeded the limits. You have insulted the English language the way you have abused your own people. Perhaps you could not have poured out so much venom in Gujarati. As I have good relations with your family, your letter has shocked me. Your letter is full of rudeness and ignorance. Go through my letter carefully and pray to God that He may remove your ignorance.

SEVAGRAM,
 July 22, 1941
 BHAI GHANSHYAMDAS,
 I finished reading Bapu Just now. At two or three places the facts are wrong though they do not detract from the views expressed. I have marked the passages. Of course you can always put forward your   own   arguments   about   the   calf   incidentlibtech_908_footnote.   But   I   findsome fundamental defect in it. The killing of the calf has no similarity with the killing of Ravana and so on. I had no self-interest in killing the calf, the only motive was to free it from pain. Primarily there was self-interest in the killing of Ravana and so on. There was burden on the earth and it had to be lightened. His destroyer was God in the form of Rama. Here the destroyer was no supposed incarnation. I hold that everyone in my situation can do what I did. Inspired and encouraged by me, Ambalal killed forty dogs. There was however some material advantage. But there is a lot of difference between the killing of Ravana and so on and this. And I have given a special meaning to these things. A discussion of it was necessary there. More about it on another occasion if considered necessary. The language is sweet. At some places the argument is repeated. This could have been
 
 corrected in proof-reading, and the flow of the language would not have suffered. Perhaps others may not have even noticed  this repetition.
 I hope you are well now."

  When 	I asked 	Gandhiji, who was at work 	on his charkha 	when I called 	on him, 	whether he had read the 	communiquelibtech_909_footnote, 	he said he 	had not and asked me 	to read it. 	With his hands 	busy operating 	his charkha, 	stopping only now 	and then to 	wind the 	thread, Gandhiji listened as 	I read 	the communique 	including the personnel 	of the 	National Defence 	Council. When 	I concluded reading, 	Gandhiji looked 	up  and, laughing 	loudly, asked whether I 	had finished. I 	said I 	had, and 	asked him 	whether he 	wished to say anything. Gandhiji said that he had no statement to make and added: I 	would rather observe silence, Monday silence, whatever it may mean 	and you can say so in the papers.  When 	I asked him whether it could be taken that he was not interested in 	the announcement, he said: I 	can’t say so. That will be pedantic.  Then 	I handed him a sheet of paper containing a few questions drafted by 	me earlier. Gandhiji read the questions and remarked:  	I can answer some of these questions. But I don’t know what 	purpose it will serve.  Pressed 	further to say whatever he wished, Gandhiji replied to  my  first 	question, whether the 	Government of 	India’s announcement 	affected the stand 	taken by the Congress and whether it met the Congress demand to any extent.  	The announcement does not affect the stand taken by the Congress; 	nor does it meet the Congress demand to any extent.  To 	my next question whether the members of the A.I.C.C., if released 	from jail, will be permitted to consider the present situation in 	the light of recent    
 developments in the country, Gandhiji replied:
 I understand you to mean whether I shall permit A.I.C.C. members, if they are released, to consider the present situation. If that is the meaning of your question, I can at once say that I have no authority to prevent members of the A.I.C.C. from doing anything they wish. The authority given to me by the A.I.C.C. does not permit my interference with the fullest freedom of its members. And in any case the body that gave me the authority can at any time refuse it or withdraw it.
 I certainly consider the demand made by the Mysore Legislative Councillibtech_910_footnoteas not only modest but any day opportune.
 When I asked him whether the present situation in the country was an  opportune one for embarking on the programme, Gandhiji added:
As a matter of fact it should have been made long ago. The
 present situation in the country cannot be allowed to interfere with elementary justice being done to Harijans.
 When I asked him whether non-arrest of satyagrahis shouting anti-war slogans can be construed, as some people seemed to, as amounting to grant of liberty to preach against war, Gandhiji said:
There is no warrant for the belief implied in the opinion. Some
 Provincial Governments have clearly stated that they do not want to arrest unimportant members. But they are arresting those whom they consider important enough if they recite anti-war slogans.

  4 	p.m. to 	4.20 p.m., July 	23,  1941  After 	the usual 	salutation, I waited 	just a 	minute when 	Mahatma said 	that he was 	[all] attention to 	me. And I 	began referring to 	the Poona 	resolution of 	the Congress, 	and invited 	his opinion 	to the 	possibility of 	arriving at 	an understanding on 	the basis 	of that 	resolution, if 	a way 	could be 	found for 	reconciliation. To 	this, Mahatmaji replied that the Poona resolution would not be revived. The psychological     
 time is gone. I mention to him the restlessness that is becoming evident in the country, and if the Congress were not to revise its stand, it may lose ground. To this he said that even if the Congress were to find itself in the desert, it would prefer to be there, to sacrificing the country’s interest and humorously said that sometimes the desert air did good. I mentioned to him that by the withdrawal of the Congress ministry, the little good that was attempted to be done had to be given up. He replied that weighing matters in the proper way, it was not worth while to put much emphasis on the attempted progress, when considerations far weightier were at stake. When Congress was out to put down imperialism, all these things were insignificant. Even if the Congress gave up non-violence, it had been found that as a purely political measure, the Poona resolution could not be revived.

       SEVAGRAM,  July 	24, 1941  DEAR 	DR. GOPICHAND,  	This is about your letter of 14th. I have found you to be weak in 	action and that out of your overgoodness. Overgoodness leads to    
 weakness. It means a disposition not to offend people even at the cost of suppression of truth. My firm advice to you is that you should talk to Mian Saheblibtech_916_footnotewith the utmost candour and he will respond. If he has suspicion he will tell you so. He is young and in experienced but straight and brave. This is my analysis of him. You should have gone to Solan and Simla. When he definitely asked you not to go to Manorlal, it was well to respect his wishes. But you were not bound always to carry out his wishes except in strict Congress matters. Youmust build up your opinions and enforce them when enforcement becomes a duty. It is wrong to seek imprisonment in order to gain relief from squabbles or suspicion fancied or real of one’s chief. Such imprisonment is harmful.libtech_917_footnote
 I refrain from guiding you in the matters referred to by you, till you have become even with Mian Saheb. If you have really forfeited his confidence, my advice would be for you to retire from  the Congress activities without any fuss. You have ample other useful work. Men like you cannot work half-heartedly or under shadow of mistrust or suspicion.
 I have not heard from Mian Saheb at all for weeks now. I do not think I had anything from him save one letter to Rajkumari after the last visit.

I 	hope the District Committees will work so that Punjab may become       
 proof against goondaism. If the effort succeeds, it will produce a tremendous impression on the whole of India. I regard this work of yours as most important—much more than jail-going.
 If those who have been discharged as a result of appeals do not go again you need not worry. Their names should be removed from the lists.
 No member has asked me for permission to remain on. I should not think of giving such permission. Every case of this type or any other I have invariably referred to you.
 I have read all about Dr. Satyapallibtech_941_footnote. You should accept his resig- nation and of others who have copied his example. You have done well to refer to Rajendra Babu about the Parliamentary resignation. But it follows that if [he] gives up the four-anna membership, he should resign all other offices.
 I personally think that you should ignore his Press statements. You are quite right in doing what you have about Brahma Datta.
He has written to me saying that he has apologized for his conduct.
He is very impulsive.
 If I have kept a copy of my letterlibtech_942_footnoteto Lala Dunichand, I shall send it to you.
 I share your grief about Lala Shamlal. I shall not accept any resignation directly. I enclose a letter of a Bhiwani correspondent. He complains that you gave too short a time to Bhiwani when you went there during your tour. He is afraid that the atmosphere is tense there. You will see.
 Farooqi is angry with me because I did not approve of his statement of his visit to me. I told him that his statement was in the nature of an advertisement and sent him a brief one. He retorts that mine is an advertisement (I suppose for myself!)
My love to you and Ismat.

 DEAR FRIEND,
Apologies for the delayed reply.
 I have not asked for suspension of respective activities. I have only asked for eschewing goondaism for enforcing claims. Thus the Muslim League may pursue their claim to Pakistan and the antis their objection so long as each party does so non-violently. For the time being I have not aimed at agreement on issues. I have aimed at agreement on non-violence, i.e., calm discussion.

 The tone of Balvantsinha’s letter did not suggest [that the refuse] was burnt out of enmity. His letter expresses nothing but grief. Almost all the refuse is manure except broken glass. I feel that what Balvantsinha says is correct; it would have been better to have asked him before getting the refuse burnt. When he had asked for help, it should have been given. It is true that a farmer would be deeply hurt if his manure is burnt. Try to pacify Balvantsinha.

 I had no talk with Balkrishnaji apart from polite enquiries after his health and so on. Where was the time? I did tell him to see me at four but he did not want to say anything.
 I think I had replied to Bhai Kotwal. I do not in the least relish the idea of his going to jaillibtech_949_footnotelibtech_950_footnote. And there is absolutely no need to come here. Why should he at all go to jail? Let him do whatever constructive work he can in Indore. If he does not get my  letter,  he  should  consider this my reply to him.
 Mishrilal has lost much weight. Now he should take it easy. The same is the case with Kanhaiyalal Khadiwala. Many useless persons have gone to [jails] in the U.P. I know it.
 It is good that you gave news about Harilal. I am keeping fairly fit these days.

		TIMES OF INDIA”","
           DEAR 	SIR,     SEVAGRAM, WARDHA,  July 	31, 1941 
  This 	is the concluding portion 	of your leaderettelibtech_951_footnotein The  Times of India, 	[of the] 29th 	instant:  Either 	he has been lax in interpreting his own rules of satyagraha or he 	has been deceived by the majority of those whose names were 	submitted. Mr. Gandhi can best say which of these alternatives is 	the right one.     
 I suggest a third alternative. I have neither been lax in the interpretation of my rules of satyagraha nor have I been deceived by anybody. You have omitted to read one sentence in my admissions: “It is inevitable.” From the very inception of the movement in 1920 non-violence has been a policy and not a creed. I saidlibtech_952_footnotelibtech_953_footnotein Bombay speaking at the A.I.C.C. meeting on the reversal of the Poona resolution that with the majority non-violence was a policy. The weak- ness was therefore inherent in the movement. It should not be for- gotten that I am trying the great experiment of using non-violence for the political freedom of the country. With me no doubt non-violence is an end in itself, though it is also a means for the attainment of the freedom of the country. With the vast majority of Congressmen it is and must remain a means. The weakness is thus inherent though none the less regrettable. The marvel is that in spite of the weakness, twenty years’ experience has not weaned Congressmen from the non-violent policy, though it is open to it to change it any time.
 In the light of the information I have provided, you will perhaps admit that the case you have made up against the Congress and me falls to the ground.
 I am, Yours sincerely,

VIDYALAYA","
  
 WARDHA,
 August 1, 1941
 We want to achieve the welfare of the world by truth and non-violence.
 I want you, students of this Vidyalaya, to devote yourselves to a scientific study of the charkha and khadi and make improvements by new inventions and serve the villagers.
 Just as the sun is the centre of the planetary system, so is the charkha of our economic or village structure. Without the sun, the world will perish; so without the charkha, which is our saviour and bread-giver, we shall lose.
 If khadi comes to stay, everything will be all right; for the progress and improvement of khadi utilize both your intellect and hand-power. This khadi mantra manifested itself in 1908 when I was in South Africa along with the late Maganlal Gandhi who had made experiments for improving its technique. We are not opposed to machinery, but we must meet it by new inventions in our  khadi  science and by providing work and food for the villagers. Make your mind and intellect scientific, so that you students will always search for new things for the betterment of your country. Our prayer should be for serving all, Hindus, Muslims and other communities. By serving India, we can serve the world, as our object is non- exploitation, non-suppression and non-hatred. This requires penance which will add to our knowledge.
 We have to exert ourselves more for passing the test of service to Indians and later to humanity. The Charkha Sangh is the central force or the centre of the All-India Village Industries’ Association and the Talimi Sangh just as the sun is the guiding force on the solar system (suryamandal). Our small beginning with this Vidyalaya may attain or produce better results and our dreams will be realized if you systematically and scientifically study khadishastra (science) for serving the poor villagers, for giving them food and clothing by your sacrifice, suffering, penance and purity of character; by this we shall not only serve India, but also the world.

  	Kanaiyo is terribly upset. Do console him, please. I need him badly 	here but if he wishes to stay on there or if you feel the need to 	keep him there, you need not worry about me. I have always regarded 	it as my dharma to take whatever work I can from those persons who 	feel the need to be near me. Any other course would not be  	compatible with scrupulous adherence to truth. Realization of God 	also is impossible in any other way. The renunciation of 	grihasthashrama is inspired by the same ideal. It follows, 	therefore, that it is my duty to think of Kanaiyo’s welfare and 	take into consideration what will suit you. The rest Kanaiyo will 	tell you.

         SEVAGRAM, 
  August 4, 1941libtech_969_footnote  	Khurshedbehn Naoroji is the youngest grand-daughter of the late 	G.O.M.libtech_970_footnotelibtech_971_footnoteof  India.  In  common  with  her  other  sisters,  she 	 has dedicated herself to the service of India, in truth, of 	humanity. She felt the call some years ago to go to the Frontier  	Province.  and workamong the Pathans there and spread the gospel of 	non-violence. She took part also in the last civil disobedience 	campaign. The last time she was in the Frontier was in connection 	with dacoities and kidnappings. She is a brave and fearless woman, 	and so she had planned to work, if she could, even in the tribal 	area, and come in contact with the dacoits, and wean them from their 	error. For months she worked within the Province and was trying to 	cross the border with the permission of the Government. But she did 	not get the permission, though the authorities with whom she came 	into contact recognized her worth, transparent honesty, and utter 	absence of secrecy about her movements in the Frontier Province. 	This is clear from the letters she holds from the officials. Being 	tired of waiting she notified the Frontier Government of her 	intention to cross the border. But she was arrested, tried and 	sentenced to a fine of Rs. 100 or imprisonment for three months in 	default thereof. She preferred the latter and on her finishing the 	term of imprisonment she was externed  from  the Frontier Province, 	and interned in the Island of  Bombay.  She protested against the 	order and corresponded with the authorities. I give below her 	letters: 
       SIR 	RICHARD 	TOTTENHAM,  78 	NAPEAN SEA 	ROAD, BOMBAY,  March 31, 1941 
  ADDITIONAL 	SECRETARY 	TO THE GOVERNMENT 	OF INDIA 	HOME 	DEPARTMENT, 	POLITICAL (I)  NEW 	DELHI     
 dated 18th February, 1941, which was served on me just before my release from the Peshawar Central Prison on 4th March 1941, I have to state as follows:
 I consider the language of the order vague and the restrictions unjustifiable, in view of the activities in which I was engaged. I place these few facts before you.
 For nine months prior to my arrest on 4th December, 1940, I had been working in the Bannu District of the North-West Frontier Province, trying to instil into the minds of the people the ideal of non-violence. I went about from village to village meeting Pirs, Maliks, Khans, as well as dacoits—all honour to many of them—who gave a patient hearing to my talks. I spoke to them on the cowardice and cruelty of carrying away or killing defenceless men, women and children. I argued with dacoits and tribesmen on the inhumanity of killing one’s fellow-beings. I strove to make villagers responsible for the collective security of the villages. I asked the Hindus to show more courage, and try and create a living bond of sympathy between themselves and their Pathan neighbours. I begged of the Pathans to live up to their traditions of protecting the weak and opposing brute force even from their own kinsmen. The above-mentioned facts may be verified through Government officials in the district concerned, in the North-West Frontier Province.
 After due intimation to the authorities, I was proceeding to Walo Tangi in Tribal Territory on 4th Dec. 1940, to try and obtain the release of some Hindu kidnappees, among whom was a woman, when I was arrested. I had intended to spend some time there, if necessary, until I had accomplished my object.
 During all my talks, private or public, to the Frontier villagers as stated above, at least one C.I.D. officer was always present and heard what I said, and which in all probability was reported to the Government  department  concerned.
 I, therefore, take the liberty to ask if my conduct or speech in the N.W.F. Province, such as I have described, could by any stretch of imagination be considered to be prejudicial to the efficient prosecution of the war, to the defence of British India, or to the public order.
 I regard my work in the Frontier Province to have been essentially humanitarian.  I  feel   sure  that  I  could  not  have   been   banished   from   the
 N.W.F.P. for the activities described by me. If the Government have information to the contrary, they have been entirely misled. I should be given
 an opportunity of rebutting evidence which has led to the passing of the order against me.
 May I expect an early reply?
 Yours truly,  
 Sd/- K. A. D. NAOROJI
 The authorities turned a deaf ear to her protest. So she decided to break the order of internment if she could not get relief and consequently gave the following notice to the authorities:
   DEAR 	SIR,      With 	reference to your last letter after careful consideration I have 
  failed 	to find the slightest justification for restricting me to the Island 	of Bombay.  I 	am prepared to understand in these times of stress for the British 	Government the prevention of my entry, for the time being, into the 	Frontier Province. But I find it hard to reconcile myself to being 	cooped up in the Island of Bombay. My whole soul rebels against what 	I hold to bemanifestly unjust and wholly unnecessary. It insults my 	intelligence. Unless, therefore, the restriction order is confined 	only to the Frontier Province and my freedom of movement is left 	otherwise undisturbed and unless I receive an answer amending the 	order as requested by June 30, I propose to disobey it.  Yours 	truly,    Sd/- K. A. D. 	NAOROJI  	For very shame,libtech_972_footnoteI 	suppose, and probably also because they felt that they could not 	justify their high-handed action in confining the internment to 	Bombay they relaxed the order so as to cover the whole of the Bombay 	Presidency.  	That brought her no relief. She resented the underlying distrust. As 	will be seen from the correspondence I have reproduced, she was 	quite willing to accommodate the authorities by not going to the 	Frontier Province. But she could not possibly tolerate the idea  of 	being confined to the Bombay Presidency. There was no reason 	whatsoever why she should not be allowed to go to Wardha to confer 	with me, or to go to Allahabad to see the Kamala Nehru Hospital of 	which she was till the other day one of the active trustees and    
 secretaries, or to travel to any other part of India, where she has many friends, and where she could be of great service in many of the constructive activities going on in the country. At last being utterly dissatisfied with the inexplicable treatment meted out to her she gave notice to the Commissioner of Police, Bombay, on 31st July, 1941, of her intention to proceed to Wardha on the 1st of August if she was left free. So on the morning of the 1st she was without trial, shall I say, kidnapped, to the Yeravda Central Jail.
 This action of the Government baffles me, and is a significant and searching commentary on the so-called expansion of  the Viceregal Council and what not. The public should understand that Khurshedbehn’s action is no part of the war resistance. But the public is hardly aware of the fact that many persons have been arrested and detained without trial although so far as I am aware there is no charge against them of having offered war resistance either as part of the Congress campaign or outside it. They are being detained for reasons of which neither they nor the public have any knowledge. Is Khurshedbehn’s case an index of what has been done in these other cases?

You are bound to succeed, if you have 	the right type of workers with the proper spirit of perseverance.  	Do you manufacture your own tools? You ought not to depend upon 	Sabarmati or Nalwadi.

 Did I ever ask you to go to Quetta and advise the Baluchistan Congress about constructive work? Maulvi Abdus Samad is the President or Secretary. I promised that I would ask you to proceed there and give a few days. I have the notion that I sent you a hurried line about this. But as you make no reference to the matter, I wonder what happened.

 WARDHAGANJ,
 August 5, 1941
 I have read a Press summary of a letter said to have been written to me by 48 persons from the Gujrat Jail (Punjab). The question asked in the message is: “Would it be possible for any member of the Congress to use violent means against a violent dacoit under grave and provocative conditions, and yet remain in the Congress fold?”
 Of course it is possible, it is even possible for people to remain in the Congress although they deliberately break every Congress rule. But if I am asked whether such persons should remain in  the Congress, my answer would be an emphatic ‘No’. That is for public conduct. No law has been laid down by the Congress as to private conduct. The Congress will refuse, as it should, to judge the conduct of a person who resists by force a robber robbing his property, or an assailant molesting his daughter.
 However, the Congress Resolution passed at Poona clearly lays down that volunteer organizations for the purpose of self-defence organized by the Congress or with which Congressmen are associated, must adhere to non-violence. Whether persons who break the rule or even preach the use of violence by Congressmen in such cases should be turned out of the Congress is a different question.
 My personal attitude is clear. I would not necessarily turn out such persons from the Congress. My letter to the Delhi President of the Congress Committee has  been  misquoted  or  misunderstood.libtech_978_footnotelibtech_979_footnoteI deliberately advised against expulsion from the Congress. I  have always held that it is an action to be adopted in rare case.
 I   know   some   persons   have   interpreted   my   advicelibtech_980_footnoteto   Shri Munshi as expulsion. I regard the step taken by him as that of a high- souled man. He had taken no overt action. He had conscientious scruples. He referred to me for advice and, in his own interest and that of the Congress, I advised him to go out of the Congress. There was no coercion, even remote or indirect. His retirement was wholly
 
 voluntary and dictated by purely moral scruples. I have no reason whatsoever for repenting of my advice, which I should unhesitatingly repeat in every such case.
The rest of the message does not call for any notice.

         CHI. 	SUSHILA,     August 	6, 1941 
  	I have received your two letters together today. You are 	unnecessarily worrying about me. I am well enough to be able to say 	that God will look after me. I have no fear. I have already written 	that  I have increased the milk quota and started taking onions and 	garlic. Do not worry. Concentrate on your studies and see that you 	not only pass but there is nothing in the field worth knowing that 	you do not know. I want you to have the ability to formulate a plan 	for a small or big hospital and to say what it should be like, and 	to map out a plan for rural health. All this is possible only if you 	become a sanyasini for one year.  	Sharma’s case is as you describe. But I have the impression that 	he is honest. There is no need to ask Mahadev because I know his 	opinion. You can be of great use if you can control yourself. But if 	your joining this interferes with your studies, I do not wish to 	involve you. Hence, instead of leaving it to me, give your 	independent view.  	Let Tari be here for the present. If her health deteriorates I shall 	send her there. She seems to be happy that she is able to live 	independently. I meet her every morning.  	On second thoughts, I feel that I should not involve you in the 	Sharma affair. Forget it. You should not be saddled with that 	responsibility.

 In the death of Rabindranath Tagore, we have not only lost the greatest poet of the age, but an ardent nationalist who was also a humanitarian. There was hardly any public activity on which he has not left the impress of his powerful personality. In Santiniketan and Sriniketan, he has left a legacy to the whole nation, indeed, to the world. May the noble soul rest in peace and may those in charge at Santiniketan prove worthy of the responsibility resting on their shoulders.

  	I have your letter. What a letter! Why this despondency? You have 	not failed and left me. Why do you allow yourself to be affected by 	what other people may say? That is not scientific thinking. A good 	doctor should be of steadfast intellect. Hence, you will truly be an  	M.D. when you develop a sense of detachment and do not let yourself 	be affected by anything whatever. This is also something that 	medical science has to deal with. You will not find any cure for if 	in the Materia Medica. You have to discover it 	yourself. You are  now  making up for your previous inadequate study 	for the examination. You are surely going to study well this time. 	If you remain disturbed and do not concentrate on your studies like 	a true seeker, not only you but I too will have to lose face. Hence, 	prepare yourself. Get rid of the despondency and concentrate on your 	studies.  	As for a medical job, I certainly advise you to take permission to 	spend three months at Lahore. I am not in the least troubled that 	you will give up your job to gain experience in different hospitals. 	Let me bear the expenses whatever they may be. It will be no burden 	to me. After all in the end you have to work for me.  	I shall think about Tari. Ultimately I may have to send her to you. 	Kanchan is bed-ridden. She is running temperature. I have not given 	her quinine yet. I am giving her milk and mosambi juice. 
 I shall see about Kaka. The rakhi duly arrived. A.S has taken it and gone to meet him. She will give it to him.

But even if that be so, I 	would expect you to have that knowledge, because I have observed 	that medical skill is a god-given gift to you, so that you are able 	to turn your reading and observation into something good.  	Had I known that you would be so upset by your failure I would not 	have allowed you to appear for the examination at all. I should have 	respected Pyarelal’s knowledge of you and gone with his advice. But 	I thought in my pride that I too knew you well. I also assumed in  	my pride that you had developed detachment to a certain extent after 	being in contact with me. But it is no use crying over spilt milk. 	Now as far as possible try to forget your failure at the last 	examination and work hard to pass the next examination. There should 	be no obstacle to it.  	I commend your resolve not to seek any financial help. But even 	there, stubbornness would not be proper. If you need to have more 	free time for the sake of your examination, then you must accept 	such help. 
 I am treating Kanchan myself. Her fever is decreasing but not completely gone. Even water tastes bitter to her. That is why I am not giving her food. I shall give her everything when she recovers. I shall
not keep her just on milk and fruit.
 I have understood about Anasuya. Increase in weight by 3 1b. is quite good. It will be nice if the progress can be maintained. Do not think it is your duty in any way to call Kanchan there. Call her only if you can do so without trouble. I am of course taking good care of myself. I do not tire myself by walking.

        WARDHA, 
  August 	12, 1941  	The seventeenth instant is the shraddha day of Gurudev. Those 	who attach religious significance to the shraddha ceremony 	will no doubt fast for the day by abstaining from food   altogether  	or confining themselves only to fruits, and devote themselves to 	prayer. The prayer may be individual or congregational. Every city 	and every village which has partaken of Gurudev’s uplifting 	message delivered through his writings and lived in his life will 	meet at an hour best suited to them and contemplate the noble life 	and dedicate themselves for the country’s service.  	Gurudev stood for peace and goodwill. He knew no communal barriers. 	I, therefore, hope that all sections will join together in observing 	the solemn day and promote communal harmony.  	I would like all further to remember that the bulk of the 	Deenabandhu Memorial still remains to be collected. Sad to say, it 	has also become Gurudev’s Memorial, for the simple reason that 	collections of the Memorial are to be solely devoted to the upkeep 	and expansion of Santiniketan, which includes the Visvabharati and 
 Sriniketan. This does not exclude a separate and special memorial for Gurudev, but it would be a mockery even to think of one before the memorial conceived by Gurudev himself has been fulfilled. It would be a fitting finish to the solemn day if the workers and organizers make it a point to collect for the memorial and send them to Messrs Bachraj and Company, 51 Mahatma Gandhi Road, Bombay.

Mahadev did write to me about your health 	having suffered. But your letter suggests that it has got much 	worse. If that is so, what is the use of having Dr. Gilder there? If 	he cannot improve your health, you will be dismissed.  	Personally I would prefer your living for some time on fruit juices. 	It would clear the obstruction, if any, in the bowels. If you take    
 as much juice as you can of grapes, mosambis , pomegranates and pineapples, you are bound to benefit. If you can take the juice in sufficient quantity—say, 60 ounces—there is no reason why you should grow weak. And along with it if you apply mud-packs on the abdomen at night, I am sure it will do you good. It must not become necessary to release you because of illness. Keep me regularly informed. Drop a postcard if nothing more.
 The workers in Gujarat are being tested well. They seem to be working all right. Mahadev also is gaining fairly good experience. I don’t experience any difficulty, since Kishorelal is staying here. He is indeed a great help to me. My health may be said to be generally good.
 Ba has regained good strength. She walks about three quarters of a mile every evening, besides working the whole day. She is able to eat well. There is no cause at all for worry.
 Jamnalal also is better. He is having change of air in Simla. He is regaining strength. He is Rajkumari’s prisoner there, eating the food she permits, walking eight miles a day, playing chess and enjoying himself. He has the atmosphere he wanted.
 Janakibehn and Madalasa are with me and they have their meals with me. Both are well. Janakibehn can run fast for four or five miles. Madalasa is in the family way. It is the seventh month. She had ulcers in the mouth, but they have disappeared now. This time the delivery is likely to be normal.
 Gurudev having passed away, I have had to take up the responsibility of collecting the Deenabandhu Fund as quickly as possible. God’s will be done.

 APPENDICES
 
 APPENDIX I
 LETTER FROM SUBHAS CHANDRA BOSElibtech_1038_footnote
 CALCUTTA,
 December 23, 1940
 When Mahadevbhai saw me in the Presidency Jail, I took the opportunity of conveying a message to you. I requested him to tell you that, if you launched a movement, then our services would be entirely at your disposal, for what they were worth. I also waned him to request you to take the initiative in settling the dispute in Bengal, so that the Province could throw its whole weight into the movement. Since you have been appointed Dictator, you could easily take up this matter on behalf of the Congress. So, I thought.
 At the time, my fond expectation was that you would launch a mass movement,  as you had done in 1921, 1930 and 1932, though Mahadevbhai told me that you had been thinking of individual civil disobedience. Today it is clear that the movement launched by you is not on the issue of our national demand for independence. Nor is this movement a mass struggle. If the Government were to permit anti-war speeches,  it appears to me, the movement would come to an end. Nevertheless we would like to co-operate with such a movement, despite its restricted scope and form, so far as it lies in our power consistently with our political stand. We would like to know if you would accept our co-operation for what it is worth—and if so, what you would like us to do in pursuance of this offer of co-operation. This proffered co-operation is unconditional in the sense that whatever grievances we may have  against  the Congress High Command will not stand in our way. If and when the High Command deal with us unfairly and unjustly, we shall have to react accordingly. We may have to fight the arbitrary and high-handed action of Maulana Abul Kalam Azad at the present time. But this can never blind us to the larger issues before the country, and there you can have our fullest co-operation, consistently with our political stand. I beg you to accept our offer of co-operation.
 Regarding the Bengal situation, I had told Mahadevbhai that if you desired unity, you could have it for the mere asking, and all that was necessary was a talk between you and my brother, Sarat Babu. Since then the situation has deteriorated. You have chosen to remain silent and indifferent. The Maulana has been rushing
 
 
 headlong along the mad path of what he calls disciplinary action. I am not bothered about it, because if he wills it and seeks it, we are ready to meet him on his own ground. He cannot affect our public position in the least, and he has only been making himself ridiculous before the public of this province and thereby dragging the name of the Congress to the dust. Since the Maulana’s action seems to have your tacit approval, I am not seeking your intervention in this matter. All that I desire is that, despite this unfortunate side-show which has been forced on us, we should co-operate where larger issues are concerned. and so far as we are concerned, we are anxious to co-operate. In all sincerity, I am offering you our co-operation.
 I am sending this letter through a relative who is going to Nagpur. I am asking him to wait for a reply.
 How is your health? The papers again give disquieting news. I am progressing, but slowly.

 VICEROY’S CAMP, SUNDERBANS,
 January 4, 1941
 DEAR MR. GANDHI,
 Thank you for your letter of the 30th December, which I have laid before His Excellency. You must not regard my letter of the 27th December, which dealt solely with your request for the Viceroy’s personal assistance for intervention and action in the transmission of your message, as in any way an exhaustive exposition of the reasons which have necessitated the decision of which you complain, and the observations contained in it as to His Excellency’s personal feelings could quite clearly have no relations whatever to the matter of publicity in India. It will, however, be obvious to you that so far as a personal request such as you made is concerned, it would be out of the question for the head of the Executive Government, merely on personal grounds, to take special steps to facilitate the transmission of a document which, in the respects alluded to in my letter, any other relevant considerations apart, he cannot but regard as containing an unfair presentation of very important facts to its addressee.
 His Excellency asks me to add that as this correspondence which started on an
 
 
 entirely personal basis is clearly taken by your letter of the 30th December into the official field, and as he thinks it important that the official and personal fields should not overlap, he feels that he has no option, in the interests of avoiding misunderst- anding, but with great reluctance, to conclude that the present channel of communi- cation had better not be further pursued in regard to the present matter.
 But he asks me to take the opportunity to add an expression of his apprecia- tion of the attitude displayed in the concluding paragraph of your letter under reply.

 THE VICEROY’S HOUSE, NEW DELHI,
 January 28, 1941
 DEAR MR. GANDHI,
 Thank you very much for your letter of the 16th January which I have laid before His Excellency. He is very glad to note your decision, and he asks me to say that he much appreciates the emphasis you have laid in your letter on your attitude towards the embarrassing of authority.
 I see that you are under some misapprehension as to the manner in which the statements enclosed with your letter failed to appear in the Press. There is no such thing as the censorship of matter intended for publication in the Indian Press nor has any prohibition been issued in respect of your two statements. In view, however, of the provisions of the Defence of India Rules regarding the publication of prejudicial reports, Press agencies and editors have the option of voluntarily submitting for advice messages in regard to which they feel any doubt. In giving advice on such references the Press Advisers have regard only to the question whether the matter submitted contains any prejudicial report, the publication of which would render the person concerned liable to prosecution under the Defence of India Rules. You will see, for instance, that both the Congress Pledge and your own statementlibtech_1041_footnoteabout Independence Day, although similarly referred for Press advice, were passed for publication, because they had no direct connection with movement intended to
 
 interfere with the prosecution of the war. On the other hand, both the statementslibtech_1042_footnoteenclosed with your letter were, I regret to say, of this nature. Although considerable portions of them could have been published without objection, at least from the point of view of the war, each of them contained numerous passages which were clearly intended or likely to encourage and instruct persons engaged in your  civil disobedience movement. This movement in its present form consists of the uttering in public of slogans purporting to dissuade the public from participation in the war effort and thus in the words of the Defence of India Rules “to influence the conduct or attitude of the public or any section of the public in a manner likely to be prejudicial  to the defence of British India or to the efficient prosecution of the war”. In so far as they contained such passages, the statements in question could not have been published without exposing the editor or Press agency concerned to the risk of prosecution and the Press Advisers were only performing their clear duty in advising the Press against their publication. The Press were of course not obliged to take this advice, but you would not expect them, I think, to take a risk of which they were warned and you will see the dilemma in which they are placed when they receive such statements from you for publication. His Excellency feels sure that you  will  appreciate that the liberty of the Press does not and cannot in any country mean the right to publish anything without prosecution, more especially at a time of grave emergency such as this, and that without any interference with such liberty the Press Advisers were fully justified in giving the advice they did and the Press in accepting it.

  APPENDIX IV  LETTER FROM T. 	B. SAPRUlibtech_1043_footnote        January 28, 	1941 
   DEAR 	MAHATMAJI,  I 	thank you for your letter of the 25th of January, which I received 	yesterday. I am glad to know that my article in the Twentieth 	Century had attracted 	your notice.       
 I read in the papers that you had gone to Bombay to see Mr. Jinnah but I do not know what exactly passed between you and him there. I met Mr. Jinnah by the merest accident at Dr. Berger’s Clinic in Bombay on the 6th or the 7th of August last. He came up to me and asked me to have tea with him. Accordingly I went to him the next day and I had a conversation with him lasting for about one hour and a half. He told me what had transpired between you and him at Delhi and of the differences which arose between you and him in the presence of the Viceroy. My impression was that though there was a general conversation between you and him on some of the political demands of the Congress, the communal question did not specifically form the subject of discussion.
 You are, if I may say so, quite right in saying that we have to settle our domestic troubles ourselves and that without thinking whether the British will accept our joint demands or not. That has always been my view. I am afraid, the communal situation has been allowed too long to deteriorate from bad to worse and I very strongly feel that that is the one question to which every one of us (and particularly you with your influence) have to address ourselves. For so long as these differences last among ourselves, I am afraid, real self-government is difficult to achieve and still more difficult to maintain.
 During the Christmas Week Nawab Mohammad Ismail and Nawab Liaquat Ali Khan were here in connection with the session of the Provincial Muslim league. The former, who is an old friend of mine, came to see me and I met the latter at the house of a common friend. We talked freely and pleasantly and the impression left on my mind was that though the task of settlement would present great difficulties, it was by no means hopeless. I had no talk with Mr. Jinnah on the question of Pakistan. I believe the word ‘Pakistan’ is a convenient phrase which has been adopted by the Muslim League to cover a multitude of political and constitutional ideas. If it means a partition of India then I do not mind saying that I am very strongly opposed to it. If it means a reconsideration of certain political ideas and readjustment of some constitutional provisions then I should not rule out their discussion. In any case, however, for the purpose of conversations intended to achieve  a  communal settlement, it would not be right for any party to impose on the other any kind of conditions precedent. I can see no reason why Mr. Jinnah should decline to meet you. Not only would it be rude on his part to decline to meet you but it would also put him positively in the wrong, if he were to adopt that sort of attitude.
 You say in your letter that “he does not want a settlement till he has so consolidated the League position that he can dictate his terms to all the parties concerned including the rulers” and that you “often feel like writing to him but lose courage when it comes to the point of taking up my pen”. You are, however, a man of infinite courage and you are big enough to rise superior to petty considerations of a
 conventional character. I see no reason why you should not write to him a perfectly courteous letter—as you always do—telling him that in the interest of the country you should like to have an opportunity of meeting him and discussing the whole situation so as to see whether an honourable settlement, which will be satisfactory to all the parties concerned, is possible. If he makes a satisfactory response, I think, you should take the step forward. That will heighten and strengthen your position and the position of the Congress and of the Hindus at large. If he makes no response to your request or adopts a truculent attitude that is bound to recoil on his head and on the party which he represents. My own belief is that the farther away the parties can be from each other, the greater is the misunderstanding and the more difficult the task of reconciliation.
 You then say in your letter: “But if you have faith why don’t you see him without being asked by anybody?” As a private individual I should have no objection at all to meeting him or anybody else but the real difficulty that I feel about my position is that I cannot pretend to represent the Congress or the Hindus. I can write to him (and am quite willing to do so) suggesting that he should meet you or that if you write to him saying that you want to meet him, he should receive you and talk to you. I should not, however, write to him without your permission. If you will permit me, I can also write to Nawab Mohammad Ismail, who, I know, is a very good man and who, I feel, will sincerely welcome peace and harmony. You may be sure that whether I write to Mr. Jinnah or to Nawab Ismail or to anyone, I am not going to commit you or anyone to any position. I can only throw out a suggestion for the initiation of conversations. Hitherto I have written no kind of letter on the subject to Mr. Jinnah or any other Muslim friend and I have scrupulously avoided during the last one year and a half writing to the Viceroy or any British official at Delhi or Simla. Last time that I saw the Viceroy was in September 1939. Holding the views that I do, I feel verystrongly that it is no use my seeing him or writing to him in the midst of these differences, which divide one party from another and one set of politicians from another. It is because of this feeling that both in the statement that I issued last month to the Press and in my article in the Twentieth Century I have laid emphasis on the desirability of a communal settlement and of your meeting Mr. Jinnah. Speaking for myself I do not attach much importance to the general criticism of British policy that the Secretary of State and the Viceroy have given a veto to the minorities. Whether they have done so or not, it is up to us to set our house in order and once we have done that, I think, we shall have gained the strength which it will be impossible on political grounds for anyone at Delhi, Simla or Whitehall to resist.
 It is my misfortune that on some political questions I differ from many of my countrymen and have very strong convictions but I should do everything that lay in my power to pave the way for the communal settlement to which I attach far greater
 importance than I do to mere academic discussions of this political theory or that. In short, if you permit me, I am quite willing to write to Mr. Jinnah and some other Muslim friends. I would much rather that you took the lead at a suitable opportunity of calling a conference than that any outsider or common friends howsoever well-intentioned assumed responsibility for such a conference. Some friends have written to me about it but I am not yet convinced that it would do any good for any private individuals to call such a conference or to wait on the Viceroy. This must be left to you and Mr. Jinnah and I feel very strongly that if you take the lead in this matter, good may result.
 With my best regards,

   DEAR 	MAHATMAJI,  I 	received your 	letter of 	the 9th of 	February yesterday. I 	was, however, surprised 	to know 	from you that my last 	letter of 	the 6th of 	February had 	somewhat disconcerted you. I see no reason why it should have. . . .  In 	your letter of the 1st of February you say: “Qaid-e-Azam Jinnah 	says, I can only talk to him as a Hindu for Hindus. I cannot do it. 	If I write to him that I want to meet him, he won’t decline to 	meet me. But I know the result.” In the present state of feeling I 	admit that it is quite understandable that he should think that you 	are the greatest stumbling block. Towards the end of that letter you 	wrote to me: “But of course you should pursue the subject after 	your own style with whomsoever you may think fit.” This sentence 	led me to believe that I was at liberty to write to Jinnah in my own 	style and to suggest to him that he should meet you.  I 	am herewith enclosing a copy of my letter to Jinnah. You will find 	from it that among other things I have written to him as follows: 	(a) “I represent neither the one party nor the other. I can 	neither offer nor accept terms. I can only appeal to you    
 in my individual capacity—in the capacity of one who strongly and genuinely holds that the Muslims are an integral part of India and that their willing co-operation with other communities must necessarily condition the nature, extent and speed of the progress of the country.” Then I wrote to him: (b) “I think conversations, or if I may use a hackneyed phrase, heart-to-heart conversations, may possibly lead to some satisfactory results.”
 My suggestions to him are contained in the following sentences: “I am, therefore, venturing to suggest on my own account, without committing any other person, or any other party, to my views or suggestions that (1) you should agree first to meet Mr. Gandhi, and then the process of private talks could be extended to others.
 (2) If you and other leaders then think that it would serve the best interests of the country to invite a joint conference, then you all could take the necessary step. If your reply to my suggestion is that you will be prepared to see Mr. Gandhi and talk over matters with him, I shall write to him and press it on him that he must see you at Bombay or any other place that may suit your convenience. I hope very strongly that he will be quite willing to see you in Bombay or any other convenient place and discuss things with you.”
 After careful consideration of the whole position I do not see any reason to regret the letter that I have written to Mr. Jinnah. I could not reasonably ask him to give me the undertaking that he would certainly come to a settlement with you when you met. The basis of a settlement is for you and him and others to decide; but in my opinion it would not be right for any party to impose any kind of conditions precedent on the other or to have any such assurances.
 I do not wish my letter to him at all to interfere with any other line of  action that may possibly be under contemplation or in progress; and I  have, therefore,  decided  to  drop  the  matter  altogether.  If   Mr.   Jinnah   writes   to   me any  letter  and  if  it  is  of  a  satisfactory   character,   I   shall   communicate   the same to you and leave it to you to come to your own decision. But in view of your last letter to me, I shall not, as I have said above, pursue the matter any further.
 With kind regards,
 Yours sincerely,

 EXTRACTS FROM “PARTING OF THE WAYS”libtech_1045_footnote
 In the mind and heart of India there was a conflict. There was an intense dislike  of Fascism and Nazism and no desire to see them win. If India could but be convinced that this war was being fought for a new world order, for real freedom, then indeed India would throw all her weight and strength into it. But imperialism and we were old acquaintances, very old, with many generations of contact. We knew each other, suspected each other, and disliked each other thoroughly. There was this background of one hundred and eighty years of hostility, of exploitation, of bitterness, of promises unfulfilled, of disruptive and reactionary movements encouraged, and attempts to break up the national unity of India. It was no easy matter for us to get over these tremendous hurdles, or remove the complexes that had grown up. Yet we said we would do it, but we could not even attempt it unless a great psychological shock was given to the people, a pleasant shock, which would suddenly change the air of India and get rid of fears and complexes. That pleasant shock could only come by an unequivocal declaration of independence and immediate steps to give effect to the popular will in the carrying on of the administration. Unless this was done, no man in India, nor group, could make the people move in the direction of willing association with the war. Wars today required mass support and even authoritarian countries have to whip up their people by ceaseless propaganda. No war can be fought effectively by a professional army in an atmosphere of public ill will or indifference. So even from the narrower point of view of organizing India’s defence or India’s participation in the war effort, a popular representative government was essential. Imperialism can coerce; it cannot win public approval and goodwill.
 I repeat that it is incorrect to say that there is any new parting of the ways, for our ways never lay together. But this declaration of the British Government means the final breaking of such slender bonds as held our minds together, it means the ending of all hope that we shall ever march together. I am sorry, for in spite of my hostility to British imperialism and all imperialisms, I have loved much that was England, and I should have liked to keep the silken bonds of the spirit between India and England. Those bonds can only exist in freedom. I wanted India’s freedom for India’s sake of course; but I also wanted it for England’s sake. That hope is shattered and fate seems to have fashioned a different future for us. The way of co-operation is not for us; the hundred-year-old hostility will remain and grow in future conflicts, and the breach when it comes, as come it must, will also not be in friendship but in hostility.
 The British Government says, it will not coerce an important group to impose
 
 a system of government which this does not like. The alternative surely is that it will coerce other groups who want that particular system of government. What exactly has the function of the British Government been, and what is it today, in India? It is to coerce the Indian people as a whole, every group, in order to maintain its own hold and special position. It is to suppress Indian industry in favour of British industry in India. It is to maintain an army of occupation whose chief function is to coerce the Indian people. It is to uphold Indian princes by coercing their subjects into  submission. It is strange to be told that the British Government does not want to we coercion. What else does it do in India?
 That is the goal of India—a united, free, democratic country, closely associated in a world federation with other free nations. We want independence, but not the old type of narrow, exclusive independence. We believe that the day of separate warring national State is over.

 MAHADEV DESAI’S LETTER TO DESMOND YOUNGlibtech_1046_footnote
 
SEVAGRAM, WARDHA,
 March 22, 1941
 DEAR MR. YOUNGS
 On return to Warda I have had some talk with Gandhiji over our correspondence about the restarting of the Harijan. Shri Srinivasan was also here, especially to urge Gandhi to restart it. And it is after some deliberation that I am writing this.
 While there is in the correspondence little to encourage us to revive the Harijan, there is no doubt that there was enough in our informal talks—both between you and me, and between Sir Richard Tottenham and Shri Srinivasan —which could help a favourable decision. Above all there is the urgent desire of Shri Srinivasan and many of the members of the Standing Committee, as also of the general reading public, which Gandhiji cannot possibly ignore. He has, therefore, come to the concl- usion that it would now be discourteous, if not improper, not to comply with the wish so generally expressed. We propose to bring out the first issue on the 29th March.
 But before we do so, I owe it to you to tell you again that both Gandhiji and I are completely identified with the satyagraha movement, and our editing of the Harijan cannot but bear the colour and impress of that identification, though it will be solely with a view to keeping the spirit of non-violence alive in a world of strife and
 
 bloodshed. If you feel therefore that we had better not to restart the paper, you have but to send me a wire. I will not misunderstand it, and say nothing in public about it, for the simple reason that I have not yet announced the decision to restart the paper.

    APPENDIX VIII  NON-PARTY 	LEADERS’ CONFERENCE RESOLUTIONlibtech_1047_footnote  March 14, 1941  While 	India should not take advantage of Britain’s difficulties in her 	heroic struggle, the Conference is equally desirous that India’s 	domestic problems should not be pressed to her disadvantage. As a 	first step towards the removal of the present deadlock and until a 	permanent constitution is brought into force, the Conference desires 	to emphasize the immediate need for the reconstruction of the 	Governor-General’s Executive Council.  The 	Conference considers that the present Council, which consists of 	three European members of the Indian Civil Service, and three 	Indians of whom two are non-officials and one is a member of the 	Indian Civil Service, in addition to His Excellency the Viceroy and 	His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief, is neither adequate nor 	sufficiently representative to organize and direct India’s war 	efforts at this moment of grave period. This Conference is anxious 	that India’s defences should be put on a firm basis and that 	resources of this great country in men and material should be used 	to the fullest advantage not only for defending her own frontiers 	but for helping the British people to the fullest extent possible 	consistently with the best interests of India.  For 	the reasons mentioned 	above, this Conference 	is of the 	opinion that 	the whole 	Executive Council should consist of 	non-official Indians 	drawn from important 	elements in 	the public life of 	the country. This would 	naturally involve the 	transfer of 	all portfolios, including the vital ones of finance and defence, to Indians.  The 	Conference would be content during the period of the war that the 	reconstructed centre remains responsible to the Crown, and so far as 	defence is concerned, the position of the Commander-in-Chief as the 	Executive head of the defence forces of the country should not be in 	any way prejudiced. At the same time    
 the Conference is strongly of the view that the reconstructed Government should not merely be a collection of departmental heads, but should deal with all important matters of policy on a basis of joint and collective responsibility. In regard to all interimperial and international matters, the reconstructed Government should be treated on the same footing as the Dominion Governments.
 The Conference is further of the opinion that with a view to create a favourable atmosphere for the working of the reconstructed Central Government, it is necessary to remove the doubts and misgivings of the people of this country as regards the genuineness of the intentions of His Majesty’s Government by making a declaration simultaneously with the reconstruction of the Government that within a specified time limit after the conclusion of the war, India will enjoy the same measure of freedom as will be enjoyed by Britain and the Dominions.
 The Conference authorizes its President, the Rt. Hon. Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru to communicate the terms of the resolution to His Excellency the Viceroy and the Secretary of State for India and to take such other steps as may be necessary to achieve its objects.

 SIR RICHARD TOTTENHAM’S LETTER TO MAHADEV DESAIlibtech_1048_footnote
 
Confidential	HOME DEPARTMENT, NEW DELHI,
 March 27, 1941
 DEAR MR. MAHADEV DESAI,
 
 Mr. Desmond Young has shown me the correspondencelibtech_1049_footnotewhich he has had with you about the publication of the Harijan and it will, I think, be convenient if I make the position of the Government of India clear. In the first place, there is no question of Government advising against publication. The decision whether or not to resume publication of the Harijan, must of course be entirely a matter for Mr. Gandhi himself, and is one which the Government are not concerned to influence in any way. In the second place, you are of course aware of the limits imposed by the Defence of India Rules on the publication of news or comment which may fall within their mischief; and you will not, I am certain, misunderstand me if I add, in the most friendly way, that these Rules must necessarily be of general application. I am, however, glad to
 
 
 infer from your correspondence that should Mr. Gandhi in fact decide to resume publication, it will be in the hope of assisting rather than of causing embarrassment to Government.
 Yours sincerely,

 DISCUSSION WITH R. S. RUIKARlibtech_1050_footnote
 
[On or before March 30 1941]libtech_1051_footnote
 GANDHIJI: Shall I congratulate you upon your defence and acquittal in appeal ?
 RUIKAR: I have not been able to understand the fundamental difference between you and Sjt. Subhas Bose.
 G. Is it not clear in the first letter of Mr. Bose which he wrote to me ?
 R. No, it is not clear to me.
 G. The fundamental difference is about non-violence.
 R. So far as the present struggle is concerned, Sjt. Bose and the Forward Bloc agree that it has to be carried on non-violently.
 G. No. Non-violence means that you must believe in the emblem of non- violence—which is charkha, Hindu-Muslim unity and removal of untouchability.
 R. So far as the last two items are concerned, we believe in them.
 G. No. The real emblem of non-violence is the charkha which Sjt. Bose ridicules.
 R. What about Pandit Jawaharlal and Maulana Azad?
 G. But Pandit Jawaharlal has agreed to abide by all the conditions imposed by me. It was only when he agreed and conveyed his acceptance that I allowed him to be the second satyagrahi. Even now he sends reports from jail that he is regularly spinning and has therefore faith in the charkha, so far at least as the present struggle is concerned.
 R. Suppose a man has faith in non-violence and is prepared to work for Hindu-Muslim unity and removal of untouchability but does not believe in charkha would you say that this is a fundamental difference between him and you ?
 
 G.  No. If I am the General of the Army, I choose my own emblem, and, so far as I am concerned, charkha is the emblem of non-violence.
 R. Gandhiji, your philosophy of non-violence is a world philosophy and world policy, would you put Hindu-Muslim unity as one of the emblems in America or England?
 G. No; obviously it could not be. So far as India is concerned, the emblem of non-violence is charkha and one who wants to join the army must accept the  condition of the General.
 R. Mahatmaji, do you not contemplate some compromise with the Muslim League at some stage or other?
 G. Yes.
 R. Do you expect the Muslim League to accept charkha as the emblem of non-violence and to co-operate with them?
 G. No.
 R. On what condition will you have compromise with the League?
 G. On common grounds on which we can work together.
 R. Don’t you agree with me that there are more common grounds of agreement with Sjt. Subhas Bose and the Forward Bloc than with the Muslim League ?
 G. Yes; I agree that there are more common grounds of agreement between Sjt. Bose and me than between the League and me; but because Sjt. Bose insists on working inside the Congress, I cannot work with him. If he goes out of the Congress, then there will be more common grounds of agreement between us.
 R. Are we to understand that the only hope of co-operation with Sjt. Subhas Bose is that he should go out of the Congress?
 G. Yes; I admire him as a great man  and  if  he  is  out  of  the  Congress,  there will be more chances of co-operation with him than if he is inside the  Congress.libtech_1052_footnote

 INSTRUCTIONS TO SATYAGRAHISlibtech_1053_footnote
 June 17, 1941
  A 	released satyagrahi must 	seek to offer 	satyagraha as soon 	as possible. 	If for any reason 	he is unable 	to do so he must 	apply through the 	President or officer-in-charge 	of the Provincial 	Congress Committee for 	 exemption  from 	Mahatma Gandhi and he should state the reasons for such exemption being granted.  From 	the date 	on which 	the name 	of a prospective 	satyagrahi is forwarded 	to Mahatma 	Gandhi for sanction, 	he is to suspend 	his private 	activities and 	devote himself 	wholly to working 	out one or 	more items 	of the 	following thirteenfold 	items of the constructive programme: 
 Hindu-Muslim 	or communal unity. Removal 	of untouchability. Prohibition. Khadi. Other 	village industries. Village sanitation. New 	or Basic Education. Adult education. Uplift 	of women. Education 	in hygiene 	and health. The 	propagation of Rashtrabhasha.  Cultivating 		love of one’s 		own language.  
 (m)	Working for economic equality.
  Every 	prospective satyagrahi is 	expected to 	keep a 	diary in 	which he 	will enter 	the work 	done by him 	during the 	day and this diary will 	be submitted 	to the 	Provincial Congress Committee concerned at 	fortnightly intervals. 	Permission to offer 	satyagraha shall be 	granted only 	to such 	workers who 	have proved their worth 	by their 	everyday work.  The 	new restrictions in 	passing lists of 	satyagrahis are 	considered  necessary in 	the interest 	of the 	struggle as 	it is likely to 	develop in 	future and 	will become 	progressively more arduous. New 	satyagrahis that come in 	should, therefore, 	be such as 	can stand 	the new test. 	Complaints have 	been received in 	the office 	of undue 	delay in passing 	names. Those who have 	given their names need not, however, 	feel impatient 	at the 	delay. They 	should devote the 	interval to 	carrying out the 
 
 
 If any satyagrahi who has enrolled himself on the original basis feels unable to accept the new terms, he is free to withdraw his name and there will be no disgrace attached to any such withdrawal. He may continue to render whatever other service he can to the country. He remains a Congressman as before.
  Enrolled 	satyagrahis cannot 	contest elections to 	the local 	bodies. Those who 	have put in their 	candidature for such 	elections, before 	being enlisted 	as satyagrahis, 	have either 	to withdraw 	from election 	or from 	offering satyagraha. As 	satyagrahis they 	cannot be 	in both places.  No 	released satyagrahi who 	is a 	member of 	a local 	board, unless specially 	exempted by Mahatma 	Gandhi, can attend 	its meeting. 	If he does, 	his name will be expunged 	from the list 	of satyagrahis.  Unarrested 	satyagrahis who are 	touring in 	their districts 	and those whose 	names have been approved are not to attend meetings of local bodies.  During 	the monsoons 	a satyagrahi 	may, if 	necessary, establish 	himself in a 	village, not 	his own, or a 	group of 	villages and 	carry on 	satyagraha and 	constructive activities.  Unarrested 	satyagrahis, either touring in 	their districts 	or marching 	in the 	direction of 	Delhi, should send 	fortnightly reports 	of their 	work to the 	provincial office. 	The Provincial 	Congress Committees in 	turn will send a 	consolidated report of 	their work to the 	All-India Congress 	Committee office at 	stated intervals, 	fortnightly or monthly.  Complaints 	have been received 	about the 	intemperance of 	language of 	certain satyagrahis. 	Satyagrahis should know 	that vituperation and 	abuse are 	against both the spirit and letter of satyagraha and must, therefore, be invariably avoided.

                 MY 	DEAR BAPU,  APPENDIX XII  LETTER FROM K. 	M. MUNSHIlibtech_1054_footnote         NAINITAL,  May 26, 1941 
  Please 	excuse the language, but as my thoughts have, in this instance, 	taken shape in English they had best be expressed through that 	medium. I am seriously perturbed since yesterday morning when I read 	your letter to Shri Bhogilal Lala in the morning papers. I will 	quote two marginal paras:  Those 	(Congressmen) who favour violent resistance (by way of self-defence)    
 Those (Congressmen) who favour violent resistance (by way of self-defence) must get out of the Congress and shape their conduct just as they think fit and guide others accordingly.
 A Congressman may not directly or indirectly associate himself with gymnasia where training in violent resistance is given.
 Forgive me if I cannot reconcile myself to these injunctions. Since Pakistan has been in action at Dacca, Ahmedabad, Bombay and other places, it is clear that such riots are going to be the normal feature of our life for some years. If war comes to India’s frontiers or the British machinery of maintaining order weakens, they will perhaps grow more frequent and intense if a division of India is sought to be enforced by internal or external agencies through organized violence. If life, home and shrine and honour of women is threatened by goondaism,  organized  resistance  in self-defence appears to me to be a paramount and inalienable duty, whatever form such resistance may take. Do you include akhadas in the gymnasia where training in violent resistance is given? I may inform you that for the last fifteen years and more I have been associated with the akhada movement in the presidency, both directly and indirectly. I presided over two conferences, one at Bombay and the other at Poona to organize it on systematic lines. I have still unofficial connections with several akhadas. I deem them an essential machinery for training our race in the art of self-defence. During the last many years they have played a great part in giving us some self-confidence to resist goondaism. In spite of the great efforts which I have made since yesterday, I have failed to convince myself that my views as expressed in an article I wrote a fortnight ago and published in the Social Welfare of the 22nd May, 1941, require a revision. I am sending you a copy of the article for ready reference.
 Since I came to you in 1930, you have been more to me than a political leader. You have been to the whole of our family a father. You have been a beacon for the last ten years lighting me on the path of the little spirituality that I can lay claim to. Hence the pain I feel in confessing that I have searched in vain for a way out of this conflict. I can, of course, keep quiet or can acquiesce in what you say or can, for fear of losing my Congress association and your confidence—both precious possessions of my life— voice your sentiments and go my way or do nothing. But something in me rebels against such a course. You have been to me the embodiment of truth and I would lose my self-respect, my right to pray to God, if I pretend to follow you with such mental reservations. I cannot pledge myself not to preach, hold, organize or sympathize with organized resistance to violence in self-defence by all possible means. I do not want to be dishonest to myself nor to the country whose integrity is now threatened, nor do I desire to deny myself your inspiration and guidance in this dilemma. Please let me know what I should do.
 My wife is leaving Naini Tal on the 28th and has already written to you. I am leaving again for Kausani. I will start from here on June 9 and will be in Bombay on the 11th. Will the 12th or the 13th suit you to see me at Sevagram? My eyes are still
 profound respect.
 
 Yours,
 K. M. MUNSHI

I do not know who Miss Rathbone is, but I take it that she 	represents the mentality of the average ‘well-intentioned’ 	Britisher. Her letter is mainly addressed to Jawaharlal and I have 	no doubt that if that noble fighter of freedom’s battle had not 	been gagged behind prison bars by Miss Rathbone’s countrymen, he 	would have made a fitting and spirited reply to her gratuitous 	sermon. His enforced silence makes it necessary for me to voice my 	protest even from my sick-bed.  The 	lady has 	ill served the 	cause of 	her people 	by addressing 	so indiscreet, 	indeed impertinent, 	a challenge 	to our conscience. 	She is scandalized at our 	ingratitude,—that 	having “drunk deeply at 	the wells of 	English thought” we 	should still have some 	thought left 	for our poor country’s 	interests. English thought, in 	so far as 	it is representative of 	the best 	traditions of 	Western enlightenment, has Indeed 	taught us much, 	but let me add, 	those of our countrymen 	who have 	profited by it have 	done so despite 	the official 	British attempts to 	ill-educate us. 	We might 	have achieved 	introduction to Western 	learning through any 	other European 	language. Have 	all the other peoples 	in the world waited for 	the British to 	bring them 	enlightenment?  It 	is sheer insolent self-complacence on the part of our so-called 	English friends to assume that had they not ‘taught’ us we would 	still have remained in the dark ages. Through the official British 	channels of education in India have flowed to our children in 	schools not the best of English thought but its refuse, which has 	only deprived them of wholesome repast at the table of their own 	culture.  Assuming, 	however, that the English language is the only channel left to us 	for “enlightenment”, all that “drinking deeply at its wells” 	has come to is that in 1931, even after a couple of centuries of 	British administration, only about one per cent of the population 	was found to be literate in English,—while in the U.S.S.R. in 	1932, after only fifteen years of Soviet administration, 98 per cent 	of the children were educated. (These figures are taken from The 	Statesman’s Year-Book, 	an English    
 publication, not likely to err on the Russian side.)
 But even more necessary than the so-called culture are the bare elementary needs of existence, on which alone can any super-structure of enlightenment rest. And what have the British who have held tight the purse-strings of our nation for more than two centuries and exploited its resources done for our poor people?
 I look around and see famished bodies crying for bread. I have seen women in villages dig up mud for a few drops of drinking water; for wells are even more scarce in Indian villages than schools. I know that the population of England itself is today in danger of starvation and I sympathize with them, but when I see how the whole might of the British navy is engaged in convoying food vessels to the English shores and when I recollect that I have seen our people perish of hunger and not even a cart-load of rice brought to their door from the neighbouring district, I cannot help contrasting the British at home with the British in India. Shall we then be grateful to the British,   if not for keeping us fed, at least for preserving law and order? I look around and see riots raging all over the country. When scores of Indian lives are lost, our property looted, our women dishonoured, the mighty British arms stir in no action, only the British voice is raised from overseas to chide us for our unfitness to put our house in order.
 Examples are not wanting in history when even fully armed warriors have shrunk before superior might and contingencies have arisen in the present war when the bravest among the British, French and Greek soldiers have had to evacuate the battle-field in Europe because they were overwhelmed by superior armaments—but when our poor, unarmed and helpless peasants, encumbered with crying babes, flee from homes unable to protect them from armed goondas, the British officials perhaps smile in contempt at our cowardice.
 Every British civilian in England is armed today for protecting his hearth and home against the enemy, but in India even lathi-training was forbidden by decree. Our people have been deliberately disarmed and emasculated in order to keep them perpetually cowed and at the mercy of their armed masters. The British hate the Nazis for merely challenging their world mastery and Miss Rathbone expects us to kiss the hand of her people in servility for having riveted chains on ours. A government mustbe judged not by the pretensions of its spokesmen but by its actual and effective contribution to the well-being of the people.
 It is not so much because the British are foreigners that they are unwelcome to us and have found no place in our hearts as because while pretending to be trustees of our welfare they have betrayed the great trust and have sacrificed the happiness of millions of India to bloat the pockets of a few capitalists at home. I should have thought that the decent Britisher would at least keep silent at these wrongs and be grateful to us for our inaction, but that he should add insult to injury and pour salt over our wounds passes all bounds of decency.

 APPENDIX XIV
 DISCUSSION WITH K. M. MUNSHI AND OTHERSlibtech_1056_footnote
 (9 to 11 a.m.) June 12, 1941
 MUNSHI: (a) War is coming on India’s frontiers, when the internal machinery of order will be weakened.
  Pakistan 	is in action 	and will 	be so for some time in the shape 	of premeditated riots. Pakistan 	can only be conceded on our dead bodies.  The 	question of freedom and of the territorial 	integrity of 	India are academic. The 	real question is 	whether in 	the coming 	years of 	trouble we 	will have 	strength enough to protect our homes, lives, etc., from internal disturbances.  Few 	Congressmen can 	follow the 	programme of 	self-immolation. I 	will only lead to hypocrisy in the Congress or make other elements more powerful.  If 	Congressmen can’t 	take any 	part in 	 this  way, 	 then  what 	 are  they  to 	do? They must cease to 	play any effective 	part in 	the most acute problem 	of the 	day. 
  Gandhiji 	discussed the general situation.    GANDHIJI: 	(a) I do not expect any settlement with Government.  Jinnah is not likely to settle; and the riots will grow.    (12 	Noon) 
   Congress 		as constituted 		at present 		can have 		no place 		in riots. 		At the 		same time it will be extinct if it does not tackle the riot situation.  If 		I continue, 		with even some men, it 		may enable the 		masses, in 		a conceivable event 		when they are tired 		of the 		present methods, to 		seek me 		outfor a 		solution. Anyway, we 		may leave 		behind us a tradition 		which will help the 		country in 		future.  Any 		attempt to 		organize violent 		self-defense will 		attract an 		attack on 		the Congress by Government. The problem is an all-India one and cannot be ignored.   MUNSHI: 	I do not want to part from you. But you should tell me what I should 	do in 	view of 	my limitations and 	the situation.  GANDHIJI: 	As for the Congress some people must get out to have a free hand. It 	will be dangerous for the organization to do anything in the riots, 	for it will give Government an opportunity to destroy it.  (3.00 	to 5.00 p.m.)  Rajendra 	Babu and Mathura Babu described the conditions in Bihar.  RAJENDRA BABU: 	(a) I am losing my hold over Bihar.  The 		Muslims are frankly aggressive.     
  The Hindus are equally aggressive, and are organizing themselves. The 	Hindu Mahasabha is gaining ground.  The 	Peace Brigade does not appeal to Congressmen and few will be found 	to follow it. 
 GANDHIJI: I admit that the Peace Brigade idea is not likely to attract Congressmen. Even Mahadev has got no response in Ahmedabad so far.
 Shri Gopichand Bhargava described the position in Punjab.
 RAJENDRA BABU: These are preliminary skirmishes, in my opinion, to see how the Muslim community is affected. Very soon, the full force of the campaign will perhaps begin.
 MUNSHI: It’s a civil war. An effective part must be played by the Congress.
 RAJENDRA BABU: Not a single Mussalman leader is coming forward to condemn the Muslim atrocities, nor will he join in saying that we should immolate ourselves.
 (9.30 to 11.00 a.m., June 13, 1941)
 GANDHIJI:  (a)   Congress as an institution cannot organize violent  self-defence.
  At 	the same 	time it may 	become necessary for 	the Congress to 	encourage the 	efforts of 	those who 	conscientiously believe 	that this ‘war’ 	should be stopped 	in some 	other way.  He 	can always 	insist on force 	being used in 	self-defence or 	in a decent 	manner. For instance, shrines, women and children may not be touched in any case. 
 Dr. Gopichand then stated the Punjab situation.
 In the Punjab, the northern part is predominantly Muslim, central Sikh, eastern Hindu. So there is scarcely any equality. But the real quarrel is between agriculturists and non-agriculturists. Muslim attitude discussed.
 (2.30 p.m.)
 Discussed the reaction of leading Muslim Congressmen to the modification of the principle of non-violent defence in (a) international matters and (b) in domestic disputes.
 GANDHIJI: Maulana accepted that violent defence is necessary in (a) but would not accept it for (b).
 DR. GOPICHAND BHARGAVA: Asaf Ali had said that Gandhiji’s letterlibtech_1057_footnoteregarding non-violent self-defence to Bhogilal was not a correct interpretation of the Congress creed, which only dealt with the movement for swaraj, not with internal affairs.
 GANDHIJI: But he sided with Maulana in opposing the use of violent defence in internal matters.
 MUNSHI: They don’t want the Congress Hindus to defend violently; they can’t stop the Muslims from violent aggression. The result is that the Hindus will be
 
 divided and unable to oppose the Muslims in a civil war.
 RAJENDRA BABU: The Muslim Congressmen now outside may be consulted.
 GANDHIJI: It is not necessary. Khan Saheb is for pure non-violence; Maulana also is.
 Bombay position discussed.
 GANDHIJI: I have thought over the whole question. For Munshi the path is this:
  If 	he can throw 	himself heart and soul 	in the 	Peace Brigade, he 	would be 	able to work it up very well.  If 	he can’t he may retire into the Himalayas or somewhere for a few 	months and 	watch the 	situation and 	find out what way his mind works 	and whether 	he could 	adopt the 	first course.  If 	he comes to 	the conclusion 	that the 	first course is 	not possible, 	he should 	leave the Congress 	and organize 	the Hindus 	for violent 	self-defence. Whatever 	course you 	may take, our 	personal relations will 	remain the 	same and I will 	take the same 	interest in you as now. 
 MUNSHI: As you know my attachment for you, I do not want to part from you. I will think over the alternatives with my wife and let you know. But of one thing I am positive; I cannot retire in the way you mention. I am in public life for years. When God willed that I should be out of jail at this time when I feel my country, community and culture are in danger, I cannot forgive myself if I shrink back. (I broke down here.)
 That is out of question. If, however, you think that the interest  of  the Congress or the country requires my abstention from public life I am willing
 to 	go back to 	jail; or retire 	into exclusive professional activities. 
 GANDHIJI: I do not want you to go to jail nor to retire into practice,
 MUNSHI: Then as regards the first course, my whole being protests against the idea. If I undertake it, I must take it up thoroughly and offer myself at the first instance. I feel that I can’t do it: (a) I haven’t that spiritual strength; (b) I know it’s useless and I won’t take it up hypocritically. My inner urge is my country and culture are in danger. I want to fight for them, so far as I can, though I know it won’t be much, as I have neither the health nor the ability to do anything effective. But I will struggle to acquire the necessary spirituality for the first course.
  Bombay 	Congressmen still 	believe that Gandhiji 	will work a 	miracle; Congress will get into power; so they must retain their vested interest. Scarcely 	anyone will be found to immolate himself.  Several 	Congressmen helped and do 	help new 	organizations which 	defend their 	localities violently.  The 	Muslims have 	their mosques and 	their organization. In 	riots, for 	the first 	few days, the Hindus are at a disadvantage. 
 
  Peace 	Brigades in 	Bombay will not 	succeed, as 	it is an industrial town 	with an underworld which 	would not mind killing anybody. 
 GANDHIJI: Your freedom may by itself be effective
 KRIPALANI: It is necessary at this stage that some Congressmen should go out and do the work which the institution cannot do.
 GANDHIJI: If Munshi can’t take to the first course, it is in the interests of the Congress that he should go out and do as he is prompted to do. I will issue a statementlibtech_1058_footnoteto clear his position. He should also discuss the matters with his Congress friends and see whether they would join him in going out and organizing defence.
 Dr. Gopichand Bhargava read out the passage in Bhogilal Lala’s letter giving local option.
 Gandhiji was inclined to the view that the Congress workers in Bombay should consider whether they want the right of violent self-defence. Rajendra Babu pointed out that that would destroy the integrity of the Congress.
 Munshi concurred. The idea was given up.
 GANDHIJI (to Munshi): You go to Bombay and come back after seeing your friends, etc. Then we shall finally decide.
 MUNSHI: This is a new idea. Going out is not so easy and I shall have to discuss the matter with my wife.
 GANDHIJI: I have told her to help you in your work, whatever it is.
 MUNSHI: But she may prefer to be with you than with me.
 GANDHIJI: I know she will be with you.

 APPENDIX XV
 K. M. MUNSHI’S STATEMENTlibtech_1059_footnote
 I had the benefit of detailed discussion with Gandhiji and many friends on the present situation in the country. After mature deliberation, I feel that the interests of the country demand that, with my views on the question of self-defence, I should not continue any longer to be a member of the Congress. Any other course would neither be honourable for me nor fair to the country or the Congress.
 Gandhiji would not think of my offering satyagraha in the present uncertain
 and enfeebled condition of my health. I could not think of working a Peace Brigade in Bombay, not having the requisite spiritual strength. At the same time to pursue any work other than that of helping to arrest the progress of the blood feud that is going on before one’s eyes is flying away from duty. I feel that in the dark days which lie ahead of India I would be of no use to the country unless I pursued the path of duty in
 
 the light which God has been pleased to vouchsafe to me.
 This decision has been rendered rather difficult by the personal bond which subsists between Gandhiji and several leading Congressmen on the one hand and myself [on the other], but I would not be worthy of their confidence if I remained in the Congress with a mental reservation on the cardinal point of Congress faith as Gandhiji understands it. My only satisfaction has been that Gandhiji, with his usual generosity, has helped me to reach a decision which is consistent with my own view as to the direction in which immediate duty lies.

 APPENDIX XVI
 “MR. GANDHI’S ADMISSION”libtech_1060_footnote
 Mr. Gandhi, in an interview with an American news agency, makes a candid and significant admission. When asked how many of his followers who are now in jail sincerely subscribe to his own belief that violence can never be right, he replies:  “I do not mind it being said that the majority are non-violent only out of policy. That is the weakest part of my campaign. ” Impartial observers of Mr. Gandhi’s civil
 disobedience campaign have suspected as much from the beginning, and  their suspicion has been confirmed of late by the departure from Mr. Gandhi’s ranks of men like Mr. Munshi and Dr. Satyapallibtech_1061_footnote. Mr. Gandhi himself has now publicly recognized, and for the first time, that the non-violent slogan is being exploited politically. He also admits by implication that such exploitation is distasteful to him, and, indeed, weakens his campaign.
 When the campaign was first launched, it was widely believed that only those who were in full agreement with Mr. Gandhi’s interpretation of non-violence should offer themselves for jail. And yet, as we now know, a majority submitted their names, not out of conviction, but “only out of policy”—some of them through a sense of loyalty to the party organization, others from more questionable motives. Nor can Mr. Gandhi escape the largest share of the blame for allowing this inconsistency to develop. He is personally responsible for sanctioning the names of satyagrahis, and  it is reasonable to suppose that in some instances at least he accepted nominees who he knew did not fulfil the conditions which he himself had laid down. If the presence in jail of those who went “only out of policy” has weakened Mr. Gandhi’s campaign, then Mr. Gandhi has proved that he is among his own worst enemies. Either he has been lax in interpreting his own rules of satyagraha or he has been deceived by the majority of those whose names were submitted. Mr. Gandhi can best say which of these alternatives is the right one.
