One school holds, and openly says, that as a programme of action ahimsa is played out. It has done its work, which was to awaken the masses, and has set the stage for the final struggle for independence. In this struggle, force of arms cannot be excluded. The other school, while professing belief in ahimsa, says that there is room for modification and further elaboration in its technique.

libtech_560_footnote,"1The report said that this was in answer to the statement made by L. S. Amery, Secretary of State for India, during a debate in the House of Commons on July 28. According to The Indian Annual Register, 1944, Vol. II, p. 308, Amery had said: “ . .. So far as India’s future constitution is concerned . . . an agreed constitution could only be arrived at if the predominantly Muslim provinces were free to adhere or stand out.... Apart from that particular issue . . . one central demand upon which he does not leave any room for ambiguity . . . is the demand for the immediate recognition of India’s independence under a provisional government, in which the only powers reserved to the Viceroy are those which deal with the control of active military operations. All reserve powers indispensable to ensure that the various functions of administration are co-ordinate with war effort and also those indispensable to safeguard the constitutional position for minority elements—all those are to disappear. Well, that is, after all, just the demand upon which the negotiations with the Congress broke down two years ago and were bound to break down. I will only invite the House to read Mr. Gandhi’s statements side by side with those then issued by Congress leaders, to see that, in this respect at any rate, there has been no real advance. Indeed Mr. Gandhi now adds the further stipulation that India is to bear no part of the cost of her own defence. So long as those are the basis for his proposals, they obviously do not form even the starting point for a profitable discussion either with Lord Wavell or with the interned Congress leaders.”"

According to The 	Transfer of 	Power, 	Vol. IV, pp. 1138 and 	1191, this reply from the Viceroy 	was an 	outcome of 	hectic correspondence 	between Delhi and London, 	and led almost 	to a direct 	collision between 	Churchill and Wavell. 	The draft reply proposed 	by the 	Viceroy contained, 	among other conciliatory 	sentiments, the following 	sentence: “You and Mr. 	Jinnah have 	my good 	wishes for your 	approaching discussion.” The 	War Cabinet pruned the 	original draft and, after 	considerable give and 	take, Wavell dispatched 	the final 	draft. At one 	stage, during this heated 	debate, Churchill telegraphed to 	the War Cabinet: 	“I hope 	the Cabinet will 	stand firm 	and not be disturbed 	by the 	attitude of 	the Viceroy. 	He thinks 	that because 	Gandhi wrote a 	letter to 	him, he 	is entitled to 	reply in 	terms which 	do not 	commend themselves to 	the War Cabinet. 	As a matter 	of fact, 	he has 	no right 	to negotiate 	with Gandhi 	at all, 	considering he 	was responsible 	for passing 	to us 	the medical opinion on 	which we 	were told that he 	would never be 	able to 	take part 	in politics 	again. The root 	of the matter 	is that, 	after what Wavell said about Gandhi’s 	state of 	health, he 	has no 	right to 	enter upon 	correspondence with 	him which cannot 	fail to 	wear the aspect 	of a 	great parley between the 	Viceroy and 	newly released invalid.” 	Vide also 	“Letter to Secretary, 	Home Department, Government of 	Bombay”, 3-5-1944."
