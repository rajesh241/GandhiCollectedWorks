 M. S. ANEY’S STATEMENT DISCONTINUING MASS CIVIL DISOBEDIENCElibtech_768_footnote
 July 22, 1933
 Having considered very carefully the recommendations of the informal conference recently held at Poona and the discussions among Congressmen in the Conference and outside, and the advice tendered by Mr. Gandhi, I have come to the conclusion that the country’s best interest will be served by the following instructions being carried out:
 Firstly, the civil disobedience campaign should not be unconditionally withdrawn in the existing circumstances..
 Secondly, mass civil disobedience, including no-tax and no-rent campaign, should be discontinued for the time being, the right of individuals who may be ready for every suffering, and are prepared at their own responsibilities to continue civil disobedience being reserved.
 Thirdly, all those able and willing to offer individual civil disobedience on their own responsibilities without expectation of any help from the Congress organization are expected to do so.
 Fourthly, secret methods followed hitherto should be abandoned. Fifthly, all Congress organizations, including the All-India Congress Committee office, should cease to exist for the time being, provided however that wherever possible dictators in the provinces and all-India dictators should continue.
 Sixthly, all the Congressmen unable for any reason whatsoever to offer civil disobedience are expected to carry on individually or corporately such constructive activities of the Congress for which they are fitted.
 I regret it has not been possible to call off the movement, and it has become necessary for me to issue these instructions. I share with many others, Congressmen or others, the disappointment that Mahatma Gandhi’s very simple request, unaccompanied by any condition, for an interview with the Viceroy in order to explore peace possibilities, was summarily rejected. His Excellency  has  very wrongly allowed himself to be influenced by unauthorized reports of confidential proceedings of the informal conference which for the sake of furthering peace efforts
 
 were purposely held back from publication. His Excellency should know that at the conference overwhelming opinion favoured seeking such an interview for honourable peace. I hold it impossible for any Congress organization or its representative to accept the terms peremptorily laid down by His Excellency as a condition precedent to peace conversation. I hope the nation will compel revision of this attitude by developing requisite strength, whatever the cost be.
 Despite the instructions, suspension of the campaign till the end of this month stands.

 CABLE FROM RABINDRANATH TAGORE TO SIR NRIPENDRANATH SIRCARlibtech_769_footnote
 I  REMEMBER  TO  HAVE   SENT   A   CABLE   TO   THE   PRIME   MINISTER   REQUESTING   HIM NOT SO DELAY IN ACCEPTING THE PROPOSAL ABOUT   COMMUNAL  AWARDS   SUBMITTED TO   HIM   BY   MAHATMAJI.   AT   THAT   MOMENT   A   SITUATION   HAD   BEEN    CREATED WHICH   WAS   EXTREMELY   PAINFUL   NOT   AFFORDING   US   THE   LEAST   TIME   OR   PEACE OF MIND TO ENABLE US TO THINK QUIETLY ABOUT THE POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES OF THE POONA       PACT       WHICH       HAD       BEEN       EFFECTED       BEFORE       MY       ARRIVAL, WHEN    SAPRU    AND    JAYAKAR    HAD    ALREADY    LEFT,    WITH    THE    HELP     OF MEMBERS AMONG WHOM THERE WAS NOT A SIN SINGLE RESPONSIBLE REPRESENTATIVE FROM  BENGAL.  UPON  THE  IMMEDIATE  SETTLEMENT  OF   THIS   QUESTION   MAHATMAJI’S   LIFE  DEPENDED  AND  THE  INTOLERABLE  ANXIETY  CAUSED   BY   SUCH   A   CRISIS   DROVE ME   PRECIPITATELY   TO   THE   COMMITMENT   WHICH   I   NOW   REALIZE   AS   A    WRONG DONE  AGAINST  OUR   COUNTRY’S   PERMANENT   INTEREST.   NEVER   HAVING   EXPERIENCE  IN   POLITICAL   DEALINGS   WHILE   ENTERTAINING    A    GREAT    LOVE    FOR    MAHATMAJI AND   A   COMPLETE   FAITH   IN   HIS   WISDOM   IN   INDIAN   POLITICS   I   DARE   NOT   WAIT FOR FURTHER CONSIDERATION  NOT  HEEDING  THAT  JUSTICE  HAD  BEEN  SACRIFICED  IN CASE  OF  BENGAL.  I  HAVE  NOT  THE  LEAST   DOUBT   NOW   THAT   SUCH   AN   INJUSTICE WILL   CONTINUE   TO   CAUSE   MISCHIEF    FOR    ALL    PARTIES    CONCERNED    KEEPING ALIVE   THE   SPIRIT   OF   COMMUNAL   CONFLICT   IN   OUR   PROVINCE   IN    AN    INTENSE FORM  MAKING  PEACEFUL   GOVERNMENT   PERPETUALLY   DIFFICULT.   THAT   THE  MINISTERS  OF  THE   BRITISH   GOVERNMENT   SHOULD   BRUSQUELY   REFUSE   TO RECONSIDER THIS  SUBJECT  OF  A  VITAL  IMPORTANCE  TO  US  WHILE  ALL  OTHER PROPOSALS   CONTAINED   IN   THE   WHITE    PAPER    ARE    BEING    FREELY    REHANDLED DOES NOT SURPRISE OR HURT ME TOO MUCH. FOR HAVE THEY NOT OFTEN
 
 EXULTANGLY   PROPHESIED   OF   THE   EVIL   DAYS    WHEN    WE    MIGHT    BE    LEFT    TO FIGHT  THE  FRATRICIDAL  TURBULENCE  WITHOUT   THEIR   AID   AND   FAIL?   AND NATURALLY  THEY  MAY  LACK   TODAY   ENTHUSIASM   TO   HELP   US   IN   MAKING   OUR PATH   TOO    SMOOTH    TOWARDS    COMMUNAL    RECONCILIATION.    BUT    THAT    THE INDIAN   MEMBERS   OF   THE   CONFERENCE   BELONGING   TO   PROVINCES   OTHER   THAN OURS SHOULD NOT  ONLY  REMAIN  APATHETIC  BUT  ACTIVELY  TAKE  PART  IN AGGRAVATING    BENGAL’S    MISFORTUNE    IS    TERRIBLY    OMINOUS    PRESAGING     NO GOOD FOR OUR FUTURE HISTORY.

PROTESTS 		  WERE MADE  AT  THE  TIME  ON  BEHALF  OF   THE   ORTHODOX   HINDU 		  COMMUNITY,   WHO   DID NOT  AGREE  WITH  MR.  GANDHI’S  POLICY  		IN  THIS  MATTER,   AGAINST   HIS   BEING  ALLOWED  FACILITIES  TO  		CONDUCT   PUBLIC   CAMPAIGN   FROM   JAIL,   AND   IT   MIGHT 		WELL   BE   ARGUED   THAT   MR.   GANDHI,   		HAVING    NOW    AFTER    A    PERIOD    OF FREEDOM   COURTED    		IMPRISONMENT    AGAIN    ON    A    PURELY    POLITICAL    ISSUE, 		SHOULD   NOT   BE   ALLOWED   ANY   SPECIAL   TREATMENT 		  THAT.   IS   NOT   GIVEN   TO OTHER   A-CLASS 		  PRISONERS.   NEVERTHELESS   THE   GOVERNMENT   HAVE   BEEN 		RELUCTANT TO TAKE ACTION WHICH COULD BE REGARDED AS UNREASONABLE

GANDHI  IS  BY   HIS   OWN   DELIBERATE   ACT   A PRISONER  CONVICTED  FOR  A  BREACH   OF   THE   LAW.   IN   SPITE   OF   THE   INCONVENI- ENCE  TO  JAIL  DISCIPLINE  AND   THE   ANOMALY   OF   THE   POSITION,   THEY   HAVE ALLOWED  MR.  GANDHI  FACILITIES  FOR   PURSUING   HIS   WORK   ON   ANTI-UNTOUCHABI- LITY  WHICH  WILL  ENABLE  HIM  TO  MAKE  AN   IMPORTANT   AND   EFFECTIVE CONTRIBUTION   TOWARDS   IT.   IT   WAS   NOTICEABLE   THAT   WHEN    MR.    GANDHI    WAS AT LIBERTY HE DID  NOT  APPEAR  TO  DEVOTE  THE  MAJOR  PART  OF  HIS  TIME  OR ATTENTION  TO  THIS  MOVEMENT.  HIS  MAIN  ENERGIES   WERE   EMPLOYED   ON   POLITICS AND  ON  THE  CONTINUANCE  IN  WHATEVER  FROM  MIGHT  BE  POSSIBLE   OF   THE MOVEMENT  OF  CIVIL  DISOBEDIENCE.  HIS  PRESENT  CLAIM  THAT  HE   SHOULD   BE  ALLOWED FROM PRISON TO CARRY ON  HIS  HARIJAN  WORK  “  WITHOUT  LET  OR HINDRANCE”, AMOUNTS TO A REFUSAL TO ACCEPT FOR HIMSELF THE NORMAL CONCOMITANTS OF      IMPRISONMENT,      EXCEPT      RESTRICTION      ON      HIS      ACTUAL      PHYSICAL LIBERTY, AND IN EFFECT IS A CLAIM TO DICTATE THE TERMS OF HIS IMPRISONMENT.
 THE GOVERNMENT  ARE  SATISFIED  THAT  THE  FACILITIES  THEY  HAVE  ALLOWED ARE AMPLE TO ENABLE MR. GANDHI TO CONDUCT  SUCH  WORK  IN  FAVOUR  OF  THE REMOVAL OF UNTOUCHABILITY AS IS  IN  THE  CIRCUMSTANCES  REASONABLE.  IF  MR.  GANDHI   NOW   FEELS   HOWEVER   THAT   LIFE   CEASES   TO   INTEREST   HIM   IF   HE   MAY NOT DO HARIJAN SERVICE WITHOUT  LET  OR  HINDRANCE,  THE  GOVERNMENT  ARE PREPARED, PROVIDED MR. GANDHI IS WILLING TO ABANDON ALL CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE ACTIVITIES AND INCITEMENTS,  TO  SET  HIM  AT  LIBERTY  AT  ONCE  SO  THAT  HE  CAN DEVOTE HIMSELF  WHOLLY  AND  WITHOUT  RESTRICTION  TO  THE  CAUSE  OF  SOCIAL REFORM MR. GANDHI HAS BEEN INFORMED ACCORDINGLY.

  APPENDIX XIII  LETTER FROM V. S. 	SRINIVASA SASTRIlibtech_772_footnote         COIMBATORE, 
     DEAREST 	BROTHER,  August 	27, 1933 
  Government 	might well have given you the old facilities. A curse has disabled 	them from generous or timely action.  But 	they haven’t conferred a right on you or made you a promise. What 	they conceded to you at one time and in one set of conditions they 	are not bound to    
 concede to you at another time and in another set of conditions. The order made after the Poona Pact, from which you quote, does not amount to an irrevocable or unconditional promise. You indulge in special pleading of a bad type when you charge them with a breach of promise. The addition of the words ‘made to a prisoner in their custody’ loses the point it might have had otherwise.
 It might be said by an observer who wasn’t prejudiced against Government that, while Harijan uplift was dear to you, putting blame on Government was dearer. It has been said in my hearing by well-disposed persons that you would love nothing so much as to die in gaol and leave Government burdened with the responsibility.
 Behind and beyond your present tussle with Government lies the future of the country. How can Congress best secure that future? Your answer is clear. But another answer is taking shape in people’s minds. It is that civil disobedience, both mass and individual, must be given up. A new policy, aiming at constructive national good in legislation, finance and administration all round has long been overdue and must be tried, over and above what is now called the constructive programme of Congress. I believe this feeling is common outside Congress, and is gaining ground inside Congress. How can this orientation be brought about?
 It is so different from your present policy, in look so opposed to it, that one doubts whether you can undertake it. Perhaps your whole preparation and equipment lie in a different direction. It is no disparagement to anyone that he is not fitted to lead the nation in all contingencies and in all directions. Unfortunately no man, however big, can be always trusted to know his limitations and make room when the cause to which he is devoted requires it. His very greatness stands in the way of change. And as I have told you more than once, you have out-topped all other leaders so long and so decisively that there is no man in sight to take your place at once. What a blessing it would be if you could be transformed and re-made, as it were, for the fresh era! But you are too good, too true to yourself to pretend you are the same teacher when the creed is no longer yours and the ritual is something you have never conducted.
 In this sore strait, the country looks to you to play a greater part than you have ever played. (Pardon me: what I mean is the greater part of the country as I figure out the parties.) Save your individual conscience, pursue civil disobedience, seek the gaol and embarrass Government as you like; but leave Congress free to evolve a new programme. It simply cannot do so, while it has to give authority and countenance to individual disobedience. You remember I begged you to adopt this course when I was last with you at Parnakuti. You told me you put it to the Working Committee, but they would have none of it. Naturally and in a way properly too. The Committee couldn’t face the odium of abandoning you. I don’t wonder the thought was abhorrent to them. The moment is come—in my opinion it came long ago— for you to say, ‘I set
 
 Congress free to try other methods. I have plenty of God’s work to do, for the nation’s welfare, with Harijans.’
 There, then, I have told you the truth as it seems to me. May one hope that you will see the problem from a new angle? I know one thing. There is no self-effacement to which you are not equal. The only thing is, it must seem to you to be called for.
 All that a friend and brother can do is to give an indication.
 Yours affectionately,
 V. S. SRINIVASAN

   LETTER FROM 	JAWAHARLAL NEHRUlibtech_773_footnote        	‘PARNAKUTI’, 
     MY 	DEAR BAPU,  September 	13, 1933 
  In 	our recent conversation 	you will remember that 	I laid stress 	on the 	 reiteration and 	clearer definition of 	our national 	objective. The objective 	of political 	independence has been 	finally laid down by the 	Congress and 	there is 	nothing to 	add to 	it or take away from it. 	We stand 	for complete 	independence. Sometimes a 	little confusion 	arises because of vague 	phraseology and 	misleading propaganda and 	it is 	therefore as well 	to remove 	this confusion 	by a 	reiteration of 	our political 	demand. Even 	the word 	‘independence’ is 	used with a 	variety of 	meanings. Obviously it 	must include, 	as the Congress 	has clearly 	and definitely 	laid down, full control of 	the army and of foreign relations, as well as financial and economic control.  In 	regard to economic matters, the Karachi Congress by passing the 	important resolution on ‘Fundamental Rights and Economic Policy’ 	gave a lead and pointed out the direction in which we should move. I 	attach great importance to that resolution but I would personally 	like to go much further and to clarify the position still more.  It 	seems to 	me that if 	we are to 	improve the 	condition of 	the masses, 	to raise 	them economically and 	give them freedom, 	it is inevitable 	that vested interests 	in India 	will have to give 	up their 	special position and 	many of 	their privileges. 	It is 	inconceivable to 	me how else the masses 	can rise. 	Therefore the  problem of  achieving 	freedom becomes one of 	revising vested interests 	in favour 	of the 	masses. To 	the extent 	this is 	done, to 	that extent 	only will freedom 	come. The biggest 	vested interest in India is that of the British Government next come the Indian Princes; and    
 others follow. We do not wish to injure any  class  or  group  and  the  divesting should be done as gently as possible and with every effort to avoid injury. But it is obvious that the divesting is bound to cause loss to the classes or groups which enjoy special privileges at the expense of the masses. It is also obvious that the process of divesting must be as speedy as possible to bring relief to the masses whose condition, as you know, is as bad as it can well be. Indeed economic forces themselves are acting with amazing rapidity today and breaking up the old order. The big zamindari and taluqdari system in the United Provinces has largely collapsed, though it may be kept up for some time longer by outside agencies. Even the condition of the zamindars is very bad and the peasantry of course are in a far worse position.
 We are all agreed that the Round Table Conference and its various productions are utterly useless to solve even one of India’s many problems. As I conceive it, the Round Table Conference was an effort to consolidate the vested interests of India behind the British Government so as to face the rising and powerful national and economic movements in the country which threaten these interests. Essentially, in international parlance, it was a fascist grouping of vested and possessing interests, and fascist methods were adopted in India to suppress the national movement. And because the mere preservation of all these vested interests in India cannot possibly solve our economic ills, whether those of the masses or even of the middle classes, the effort is foredoomed to inevitable failure. Even from the point of view of a democratic nationalism, as you yourself stated at the Round Table Conference, democracy and autocracy can ill go together.
 Another aspect has to be borne in mind. The problem of Indian freedom cannot be separated from the vital international problems of the world. The present crisis in the world’s affairs is having its repercussions in India. At any moment it may result in a complete breakdown or in a violent international conflagration. Everywhere there is a conflict and a contest between the forces of progress and betterment of the masses and the forces of reaction and vested interests. We cannot remain silent witnesses to this titanic struggle for it affects us intimately. Both on the narrower ground of our own interests and the wider ground of international welfare and human progress, we must, I feel, range ourselves with the progressive forces of the world. This ranging ourselves at present can of course be ideological only.
 These are some of the larger issues that fill my mind and I am convinced, not only that we ignore them at our peril, but that a true appreciation of them will vitalize and give new meaning to our struggle for freedom which we must continue till the full objective is achieved.
 These wider issues are of great importance but at present, as you know, the minds of large numbers of our countrymen are greatly exercised over immediate national problems and especially the question of carrying on the struggle. The
 
 statements that you and Sjt. M. S. Aney issued some time ago to guide the country have, I am afraid, produced some confusion and there has even been some resentment in regard to particular directions contained in them. There is a vague talk, in quarters which ought to know better, that the Congress has been dissolved. It is obvious that nothing of the kind has been done or could be done under the constitution. Your directions and those of Mr. Aney were, I take it, in the nature of advice or suggestions to meet a certain position that had arisen. The Congress continues as before but it is clear that it cannot function normally when Government declare its committees to be illegal. There can be no regular offices or open activity. To recognize this fact and to adapt ourselves to it is not to wind up any Congress Committee, much less the Congress organization as a whole.
 A necessary consequence from this was to avoid the possibility of a few newcomers who formed committees, when the old members and other reliable workers went to prison, or even individuals, committing the Congress to an undesirable course of action. As is known, we have had to face this risk in The past and unreliable persons have come to the helm of affairs in some local areas with the intention of obstructing and even stopping the very activities they were supposed to further. It thus becomes desirable to prevent such unreliable persons from exploiting the name of the Congress Committee. This of course does not prevent Congress workers in any area from co-operating together in an organized way for the furtherance of our programme.
 Confusion has also arisen in the country about the implications of individual and mass civil disobedience. I appreciate to some extent the difference but this difference does not appear to me to be a fundamental one, as, in any event, civil disobedience is essentially an individual affair. Individual civil disobedience can develop into mass civil disobedience. Besides, you told me that if an organization felt strong enough to undertake the responsibility and the risk, it could, of its own initiative, take up mass civil disobedience. Indeed you were of opinion that a local organization could, in this manner go ahead in any direction which was not contrary to Congress methods or policy.
 Stress was laid in your previous statement on the undesirability of secrecy, although you pointed out that there was nothing inherently illegitimate in secret methods. I think that most of us agree, and certainly I am of that opinion, that our movement is essentially an open one and secret methods do not fit in with it. Such methods, if indulged in to any large extent, are likely to change the whole character of the movement, as it has been conceived, and produce a certain amount of demoralization. Agreeing with this, some of us feel that, to some extent as for instance in communicating with each other or sending directions or keeping contacts, a measure of secrecy may be necessary. Perhaps secrecy is hardly the word for those activities and privacy would suit them better. Privacy of course is always
 open to all groups and individuals. Secrecy or the avoidance of it, as you said, cannot be made into a fetish.
 But secrecy is certainly involved in the production of printed or duplicated news-sheets and bulletins. These bulletins have often served a useful purpose in the past in keeping contact between headquarters and districts and in sending information or directions. You pointed out to me the difficulties and undesirable consequences of running these secret presses and duplicating machines. Many good workers are tied up and have to avoid aggressive action; money has to be invested in such machines and frequently they are taken away by the police. Even from the practical point of view this continuous rain and tying up of workers is not desirable, and undoubtedly it sometimes results in demoralization. You suggested that the best way was to have hand written copies of bulletins, etc., containing the name of the  publisher.  Generally, I agree with all this and appreciate the force of your argument. But I do feel that under certain circumstances it may be desirable for a local or Provincial committee or group to issue bulletins of directions, etc., secretly. This must not be encouraged; indeed it should be discouraged, but a certain latitude in exceptional circumstances might be permitted.
 There is one other small matter which seems to me rather ridiculous. It was
 right and proper, if I may say so, for you to court imprisonment by giving previous intimation of your intention to do so to the authorities. But it seems to me to be perfectly absurd for others, and even Congress volunteers, to send such notices or communications to the authorities. Any person desiring to offer civil resistance should openly carry on activities which further our cause and thus court arrest. He must not forget or ignore these activities and merely ask to be arrested.
 This letter has become long enough. I do not mention here the many other matters which I had the privilege of discussing with you.
