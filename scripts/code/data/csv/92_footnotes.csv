libtech_232_footnote,"1This was intended to enable the Muslim League to join the Interim Government, which was to consist of 14 members—6 from the Congress, 5 from the League and 3 representatives of minorities to be nominated by the Viceroy. Jinnah put forth the condition that there should be no Muslim among the nominees of the Congress. Gandhiji therefore accepted the formula laid down in the agreement. As it was, it found no approval from other Congress leaders, notably Nehru, who found the formula “not happily worded”. In a letter to Jinnah he was prepared to concede to the Muslim League “the right to represent the Muslims of India, provided that  for identical reasons the League recognized the Congress as  the  authoritative organization representing all non-Muslims and such Muslims as have thrown in their lot with the Congress.” He further suggested that no formula was necessary. In the event the Congress list contained the name of Asaf Ali and the League nominated Jogendranath Mandal."
