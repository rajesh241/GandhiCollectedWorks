      CHI. 	JIVANJI,  December 	7, 1945 
  	I got your proof-copy of the pamphlet on constructive work 	yesterday. I wanted to use that copy here and did so. But I had 	already gone through the proof earlier. As there is no letter accom- 	panying it, I don’t quite understand why you have sent it. You 	have given a heading to my preface but there is no heading on the 	page on which the pamphlet itself begins. I infer from this that 	final touches still remain to be given to the printing. I have of 	course asked Pyare- lalji to write to you about this, but I think it 	is better to dictate this just now in the morning.  	I have the impression that I have already written to you about the 	cover. My suggestion is that the eighteen headings which you have 	given in the pamphlet should be reproduced on the cover in their 	proper order, with the page number given against each. This will 	help the reader and we shall be able to show what topics have been 	covered. The topics can also be shown on the cover in the form of a 	circle. We can have a drawing of the spinning-wheel in the centre 	and the head- ings can be printed round it like the planets round 	the sun. There is one difficulty in this, of course. How can 	communal unity be repre- 
 sented as a planet? If it is so represented, my original conception would be vitiated, for the basic conception is that khadi is the chief handicraft and that the other industries take their place and revolve round khadi like planets round the sun. If now we can find a place in this scheme for Adivasis, kisans, students and communal unity, then the conception will have been worked out. It might be better, there- fore, to give up the idea of the circle, or to form the circle only with khadi and cottage industries. But we need not waste any time over this, for it is essential that the pamphlet should be published as soon as possible. It is also necessary that the translations should be published simultaneously. It would, also, be good if at the end a supplementary list of other books to be read with the pamphlet are given.  For example, Rajendra Babu’s book, Gulzarilal’s essay, etc. You may drop this also, if you cannot recollect the names of the books imme- diately. Pyarelal will most probably send you a wire today saying, “Send another copy proof.” The idea behind this is that if I have to correct the proof, the time which would be taken by an ordinary letter may be saved, for the copy which I have passed on is not likely to come back to me now.libtech_1_footnote

 SODEPUR,
     CHI. 	AMIN,  December 	7, 1945 
  	I got your letter sent with Sushila. She arrived the day before 	yesterday. You do not seem to have calmed down yet. You can render 	great service if you calm down. Take up only a little work there. If 	you bring credit to it, it will be greatly appreciated.  	What you write is absolutely correct. Greatness lies in becoming 	small and smallness in assuming greatness. We should therfore only 	serve by becoming as small as dust particles.    
 Your camera is to be sent only with somebody going there, is that not so? I am sure you are not in a hurry.

While 	waiting for the car Gandhiji turned to Maulana Azad and remarked :  	Maulana Saheb, these press reporters and photographers are having a 	good time and detaining our car.  A 	hearty laughter followed. 	A Press 	correspondent drew Gandhiji’s attention 	to the 	announcement from 	New Delhi that the Viceroy 	had agreed 	to see 	Mahatma Gandhi. 	The correspondent inquired whether it suggested that Gandhiji had 	sought the interview.  Gandhiji 	replied the news had appeared in the newspapers and he declined to 	make any further comment.

10,"December 7, 1945",SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING,"
  
 SODEPUR,
 December 7, 1945
 Gandhiji said that he noticed that the people became quiet only after he arrived at the place. That was not ideal. The place where a prayer was conducted, he said, should be considered as a temple and only in prayerful mind should they present themselves there. They should come silently and maintain calm and should leave the place in the same mood.
 If, however, those who joined in the prayer would remain quiet and peaceful he would be only too glad to see the whole of Calcutta assembled there.
 Proceeding, Gandhiji said that there were incorporated in the service Bengali songs as the majority of those present were Bengalees; but for the benefit of others he wished to get a booklet including all songs and other prayers printed in both Devanagari and Urdu scripts. This proposed booklet which might be priced two pice would be of permanent benefit to the readers who could then be acquainted with the texts whenever they so wished.

Satish Babu brings me the story that potato-growers cannot get seed 	potatoes and the planting season will be over in a week’s time. 	Seed potatoes are there in the market under Government control. But 	the grower cannot get them.  	There is evidently something radically wrong if  the  news brought 	by Satish Babu is true. I wonder if you can do anything. You were 	telling me about the clever Mr. Dey whose services you have enlisted 	for such matters. Can you make him over to me or some other officer 	who can attend to this immediate affair? I 	am having this letter delivered at once. The question is small     
 enough on the large Bengal canvas but is all in all to the poor growers whose livelihood is at stake.libtech_10_footnote

14,"December 	8, 1945",LETTER TO R. G. CASEY,"
           DEAR 	FRIEND,     KHADI 	PRATISHTHAN, SODEPUR,  December 	8, 1945 
  	I have just finished reading your broadcast to be  delivered  today. 	It makes interesting and informative reading. If the waters of the 	rivers can be captured and utilized by the people  of  Bengal,  	instead of being wasted in the Bay, it would be a great gain. But it 	is a long-term proposition. The millions, meanwhile, must be taught 	to utilize every minute of the working hours for their own benefit. 	If they learn this art they will make good use of the captured 	waters. You have well said :  The 	tens of millions of farmers of Bengal are idle more than half the 	time. They constitute the biggest problem of unemployment in the 	world and the biggest waste of potential human effort.  	I have provided you with a complete answer which can  be worked out 	today with a very little outlay on the part of the Govern- ment. 	Regard human labour more even than money and you have an untapped 	and inexhaustible source of income which ever increases with use. If 	I had been your adviser, before the speech was printed I would have 	suggested the insertion immediately after, “Let us exa- mine the 	problem”, of a paragraph or two, showing the way of imme- diate 	utilization of human effort. You could then have followed it up with 	your entrancing scheme as a long-range proposition. Is 	your peroration right? You say :  The 	answer to my mind lies not in our politics, our religion or our 	individual ambition, but in the abiding factors of our environment, 	i.e., the land and water of Bengal.    
 This is a gross error or thought and consequent action, handed down from generation to generation by the British official element. Your gigantic project will come to nothing until the whole mass of the people of Bengal is interested in the Government of the province. Therefore, religion and even individual  ambition  are  intermixed. They are as much abiding factors of our environment as the land and water of Bengal, and they are equally shifting.
 You asked me for my reaction to your thoughtful speech and I have given it as it has come to me.
 Very many thanks for your prompt actionlibtech_11_footnoteon my letter of this morning on seed potatoes.

28,"December 8, 1945",SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING,"
  
 SODEPUR,
 December 8, 1945 Congratulating the congregation on its maintaining an ideal condition for proceeding  with the prayer straight away as soon as he reached the place, Gandhiji
 explained the significance and gradual development of the system of mass-prayer at
 Sodepur Ashram.
 In 1936 about a dozen Japanese monks paid him a visit when he was staying at Maganwadi, Wardha.  The leading monk suggested to him that he intended to send one  or two of his disciples to the Ashram, a proposal which he approved. First came one and later on another. Of the two, one was staying with him till the war with Japan broke out and as a result he was taken into custody. This Buddhist monk used to do all the tasks he was given very punctually and methodically. In between his work he used to spend the time at his disposal in singing religious songs in the Japanese language all the time beating a little drum. This he did while taking his rounds. This was a Buddhist religious song in praise of the Infinite. Gandhiji said that he incor- porated the song in his prayer. This was the first item of the prayer.
 The second item of the prayer was a Sanskrit sloka and was, according to him, universal in its appeal. This was an invocation to Mother Earth, sustainer of man. If there was any objection to it on any score he would plead that he was helpless. To him all faiths were welcome. He believed in all faiths but he saw no reason to give up his own faith. Possibly, said Gandhiji, this Sanskrit sloka was symbolic, but, according to him, many noble thoughts and ideas were couched in symbolic language.
 Thirdly, there was the prayer quoted from the Koran. It was incorporated at the instance of daughterlibtech_16_footnoteof Abbas Tyabji, the well-known Congress  leader.  She possessed a gifted voice. When on a visit to the Ashram she expressed the desire to propagate the teachings of the Koran to the Ashramites, he readily agreed. She suggested a verse from the Koran for inclusion in the prayer and it was done.
 The fourth item of the prayer was taken from the Zend-Avesta written in the Pahlavi language. When he was fasting in the Aga Khan’s Palace, Dr. Gilder was there as were also Dr. Bidhan Roy and some other medical men. Dr. Gilder was a Parsi and from him the verse from the Zend-Avesta was taken and included.
 So far as bhajan songs were concerned, said Gandhiji, there was no hard and fast rule. It all depended upon the time and place of the prayer. As the prayer was for the moment being held in Bengal and Bengalees in larger numbers were present, Bengali songs had to be included in the prayer daily.
 It was Gandhiji’s desire to get all the prayers included in a booklet with their meanings given in Hindustani. He wished it to be printed both in Devanagari and
 
 Urdu scripts and, if possible, in Bengali too.
 He asked the assembled people to follow the prayer in a proper spirit and to live up to the lofty ideals it inculcated.

 It is a matter of regret that the money advanced by the Charkha Sangh has not been returned so far. They should get it back now. It belongs to the Trust. And how can the Trust write it off ?

44,"December 	10, 1945",SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING,"
       SODEPUR,  December 	10, 1945  	When we are making a supreme effort for the realization of our goal 	let nobody have any opportunity of pointing it against us that we 	are not disciplined and therefore not fit for swaraj. Either today 	or tomorrow the power must come to our hands. But how are we going 	to exercise that power unless we are disciplined ?  The 	British Government, he reminded the people, was not the last hurdle 	to be got over. If the people were not disciplined then even if 	power came to their hands they would not be able to retain it and 	someone else would be there to snatch it away from their hands.  It 	was only wild animals which were not disciplined and took recourse 	to unreasonable and meaningless climbing. But if men also took 	recourse to such tactics how could drivers and guards of trains 	manage their affairs.libtech_25_footnoteIt was also often 	found that small boats which had only limited capacity often gave 	way and sank because of overcrowding. They were crores and perhaps 	for that reason they did not notice the loss they sustained in such 	catastrophes. If they could not board a train they should just wait 	for the next to travel instead of overcrowding the first and thus 	make it impossible for the driver and the guard to run it.    
 Proceeding, Gandhiji said that they must learn discipline. There were two ways of learning it. The soldiers learnt it by having drill exercises. But there was the prayer to teach them the other way. Prayer not only secures for them their salvation for the next world but also in this world. If they failed to secure their salvation in this world, could there be any possibility of securing the salvation for the next? In the circumstances, concluded Gandhiji, they should conduct themselves as thinking men.

 Addressing the gathering outside Government House, Gandhiji said that when he entered Government House in the evening he found a crowd of people around his car. Hence he had come this time walking to them.
 He asked them to be calm and peaceful. He was an old man and could not bear  the strain of demonstrations. If they did not allow him to go by car, he would have to walk on foot to Sodepur.
 Gandhiji added that he had come there to serve them and the country. He urged on them the need for discipline. India had attained a great position in the past because of her great message of shanti. They could attain freedom only by peace and discipline.
 Referring to the prayer meeting at Sodepur Ashram, Gandhiji said  that thousands and thousands of people came there to join the prayer, but perfect silence was maintained.
 Gandhiji then asked the gathering whether they would allow him to go by car. The crowd respectfully replied in the affirmative and Gandhiji got into his car while a corridor was made for him to pass through. Sitting with his  hands  folded  in salutation, Gandhiji then moved out in the car to his Ashram at Sodepur.

 [On or before December 11, 1945]libtech_28_footnote
 After the arrest of the  principal  Congressmen  in  the  August of 1942, the unguided  masses  took  the  reins  in  their  own  hands and acted almost spontaneously. If many acts of herosim and sacrifice are to their credit, there were acts done which could not be included in non-violence. It is, therefore,  necessary for the Wor-  king Committee to affirm, for the guidance of all concerned, that the policy of non-violence adopted in 1920 by the Congress continues unabated, and that such non-violence does not include burning of public property, cutting of telegraph wires, derailing of trains and intimidation.
 The Working Committee is of opinion that the policy of non- violence as detailed in the Congress resolution of 1920, since expan- ded and explained from time to time, and action in accordance with it, has raised India to a height never attained before.
 The Working Committee is further of opinion that the construc- tive activities of the Congress, beginning with the spinning-wheel and khadi as the centre, are emblematic of the policy of non-violence and that every other Congress activity including what is known as the parliamentary programme, is subservient to and desi-gned to promote the constructive activities as explained by Mahatma Gandhi.
 The Working Committee is of opinion that civil disobedience, mass or any other, meant for the attainment of freedom, is inconcei- vable without the adoption of the constructive programme on the widest scale possible by the masses of India.

 I 	have your letter of 10th instant, for which I thank you.  	I  have  not  discountedlibtech_29_footnoteyour  irrigation  scheme.  I   have   only suggested 	an addition to it so as to bring almost immediate individual relief 	to the crores of villagers by occupying their admitted leisure 	hours. In your written note you seem to be in entire accord with my 	proposition. Where then is the difficulty in the Government of 	Bengal sponsoring the scheme and at once creating a hopeful 	situation so far as the shortage of cloth is concerned? I have never 	suggested that attainment of happiness is possible without the 	control of physical surroundings. But I have no desire to enter into 	any argument. If you have immediate regard for home-spinning and 	weaving and other village crafts, I have suggested a way out. That 	each cultivator should grow his own cotton is not a sine qua non 	of my scheme and certainly no cultivator should be compelled or 	even advised to grow cotton to the detriment of any staple crop. The 	question is one of utilizing waste labour, as under your scheme it 	is one of utilizing waste water.  	If you favour the idea as practical and capable of immediate 	application, I could furnish you with a detailed scheme which, as I 	have told you, can be worked with the help of the various khadi 	organizations controlled by the All-India Spinners’ Association.

He 	would not 	 be frightened 	then. But 	if his 	companion then 	drew his attention 	to the 	fact that it 	was not a 	piece of 	rope but 	a living 	snake that he passed 	by, he 	would at 	once be 	frightened. Was 	it not 	curious, asked 	Gandhiji, that 	although the 	same conditions 	prevailed, at 	one time the individual 	had no 	trace of 	fright in 	him and at 	another he 	would be awfully 	frightened and would thank God for his miraculous escape.  Drawing 	the moral from the illustration, Gandhiji concluded that the source 	of     
 happiness and woe, therefore, did not lie elsewhere but in one’s own mind. In his reply to Arjuna as to who had attained illumination, Krishna explained the nature of such a man by stating that he only was self-illumined (sthitaprajna) who was not affected either by a feeling of happiness or woe.libtech_38_footnoteThis was possible only on the part of that individual who was self-controlled.

They must concentrate their minds and only then would they realize the existence of God in their hearts. But if they kept quiet because he (Gandhiji) had asked them to do so, they would derive no benefit from the prayer. By concentration, their hearts would be purified and their inner knowledge would grow. Everybody should think that they were going to the prayer metting for self- purification. Only then would their intellectual progress be uninterrupted and they would get real peace by controlling their passions.

 Your letter of 2nd instant came into my hand only this morn- ing. When, after the conferencelibtech_41_footnote, you find that you   have  to  go  to Mysore for Kasturba work, after due notice of yourproposed entrance and that you will proceed to Mysore for that definite purpose, you should enter the State and take the consequences.

 About those who will be thrown out of work,libtech_42_footnoteis not Jawaharlal developing some central scheme or, it may be, the Congress? I have only a hazy notion. But I know this much clearly that it is a big pro- blem not to be tackled by any single individual. The Talimi Sangh can only take in the smallest number possible, and then they are to be specialists having love for the work. The A. I. S.

DEAR FRIEND,
 A correspondent writes from the United Provinces to the effect that   manufacture   of   gurlibtech_43_footnotelibtech_44_footnoteis   prohibited   there.   Gur-making   is   a village industry. It is manufactured on their fields by cane-growers from juice extracted by means of village  kolhuslibtech_45_footnotelibtech_46_footnoteand boiled in village pans. I, therefore, thought that my correspondent must be mistaken and asked him to send me a copy of the order on which his obser- vations were made. He has sent me a copy of the enclosed startling order.libtech_47_footnotelibtech_48_footnoteCane-growers have since passed resolutions protesting against the order and threatened to disobey it if it was not withdrawn. As a result the authorities relaxed the order. A copy of the relaxation order is also herewith enclosed. I doubt not that you realize what this means to the poor people. The original order could not have been issued for the protection of sugar mills but must have been meant to secure judicious use and distribution of sugar as gur or refined. If so,  it defeats the purpose. The modified order, though less bad than the first, does not really serve the purpose, considered in the light of the villagers. There should be no licence for gur made in village.
As this is not a mere provincial matter but applies to all India
 
 
 wherever cane is grown, I venture to approach H. E. the Viceroy for relief.libtech_49_footnote

What you have said in your letter is good enough for city 	mentality. What you and I have to do is to think out suggestions in 	terms of village mentality unless, of course, you have reached the 	conclusion that the village and village mentality are to go if they 	have not already gone. My conclusion emphatically is that if the 	world is not to end, the village and village mentality alone will 	save it. In spite of their glamour the city and city mentality are 	going before our eyes. Therefore, I have left for me no other 	alternative but to think of ways and means for sustaining the 	village life. What 	is your concrete suggestion about Muslim unrest?

 KHADI P RATISHTHAN, SODEPUR,
 December 15, 1945
  	I got your letter of the 10th yesterday. You seem to be very 	impatient. You ask my blessings by wire. We are after all poor 	people and trustees of those much poorer than we. And how can we so 	much as wish for blessings?  Even if we have such a desire, how can 	we have  it met telegraphically? So thinking I refrained from 	sending a wire. Why should you need any blessings? Here is the 	secret of blessings. When we are engaged in a work which is worthy 	of blessings, then the work itself is a blessing; it does not wait 	for blessings from others. Seeking blessings from other people is, 	there-fore, meaningless; it is nothing but self-deception. It no 	doubt has a meaning in that bless- ings act as a stimulant from 	which a weak person derives momentary encouragement. But this kind 	of encouragement is not of much help.  If you understand this and 	still really need my blessings, you certainly have them for your 	work of producing the tools necessary for making khadi provided it 	is done intelligently. When I say intelligently I mean that we 	should not manufacture spinning-wheels, winding frames, taklis, 	etc., just to sell; we should make only as many as are needed 	and see that they are so perfect that no one may find fault with 	them. Our aim should be—and is—that all the things are produced 	locally. Only then will the villages prosper. What I am now saying 	is covered by the new line of thought on khadi that I am 	propounding. Whatever  I have not elaborated may be deduced from the 	aforesaid.  	Yesterday Sardar was here. He wanted to know why he was not informed 	about your leaving the khadi shop. I could not give him a 	satisfactory answer. I take it that you must have gone through all 	the formalities since you are so alert. However, if you have 	anything to say in this regard, write to Sharda. I see from your 	letter that Sharda is with you. Is she doing anything ?

  	Literature about your prisoners is pouring in on me.libtech_55_footnoteAccor- ding to the papers in my possession, you 	have over twenty-five pre- Reform prisoners, all of them having 	undergone sentences above ten and most of them above fifteen years.  	Then you have untried detenus, detained only on one-sided secret 	evidence which they have not seen, and some convicts, all of them 	political. Among 	these prisoners are two women cooped up in a small cell. I 	am told that there is no terrorism to be feared. The prisoners  	are all likely to be public-spirited. But that can be no reason for 	keeping them behind prison bars. I 	submit that they should all be discharged without the slightest ado. I 	plead for a little grace before, as you and I hope, the trans- ference 	of power comes. I 	have offered, and still do, to see these prisoners, if it is thought     
 desirable.
 I leave for Santiniketan on 8th instant, returning here on the 20th evening.

 as being the most important, but since I have already accepted responsibility for all other arrangements except medical attention I should certainly like you to take up that work also. So do take up whatever work you can without coming into conflict with anybody.
 Though I shall not be there on January 1, from that day the institutionlibtech_61_footnotewill be run only for the poor and on behalf of the poor. From that day the management of all departments except the medical will be considered to have become my responsibility. I trust you will take up the responsibility on my behalf. But you must assume the responsibility for only as much work as you can easily attend to. Let me know what jobs you are not able to take up.
 After January 1, there will be no wealthy patients there. If there are any, they will not be treated as wealthy men.
 Dr. Dinshaw had said that he would himself see about the furniture. He wanted it for his clinic in Bombay. There will be very few poor indoor patients for the present. Maybe there will be none. Hence, though we shall keep facilities ready for a large number, the hospital is not likely to get filled in the immediate future. We shall have to use our judgement in the matter of furniture. Ascertain Gulbai’slibtech_62_footnotelibtech_63_footnotewishes. Don’t insist on ordering things which the two do not want.
 From among the patients there, those who wish to leave may be permitted to do so. From January 1, really speaking, the only patients will be Balkrishnalibtech_64_footnotelibtech_65_footnote, Vanulibtech_66_footnotelibtech_67_footnoteand Zohra. You will have no difficulty in looking after them. You must have realized by now that it is no easy job to shoulder the responsibility of that institution. The task would easily test the capacity of any man.

  December 	16, 1945 The 	tendency of learning English rather than one’s own language was deprecated by Mahatma 	Gandhi. “If we could stop this tendency we would be free from  one 	of our slaveries,” said Mahatma Gandhi, adding that he could not 	express how this tendency of some people talking and writing in 	English damaged them and the country. But in England, whenever a 	good book was published anywhere in the world, within a few days it 	would be translated and would reach the hands of the 	English-speaking public. Mahatma Gandhi asked : Should 	we not do the same thing in India? Although it would  	take time for all people to understand the rashtrabhasha, 	there were languages of the locality and any good book could be 	translated and presented to the public in their mother tongue.  The 	Hindu, 18-12-1945       December 17, 1945 I see 	that I have overstayed my time in Calcutta. I found I had  more work 	in Calcutta than I had expected.  And then events  com- pelled 	 me   to   work  more strenuously  than I  had  counted  upon.  	The result is that, much to my and my fellow-workers’ disappoint- 	ment, I have been compelled to cut off the places I had originally 	conceived and tentatively discussed with friends who were arranging 
 the tour. But let no one think that the curtailment will affect my study of the Bengal situation. The visit to Santiniketan is more by way of a friendly visit than study. I do not expect to see or meet visitors. They will oblige me by abstaining from wishing to see me during my very short stay there.

MEETINGlibtech_87_footnote","
        SODEPUR, 
  December 	17, 1945  	We have come so close together and you have been observing such 	exemplary silence that it will give me a wrench to be away from you. 	God willing I shall be leaving for Santiniketan on Tuesday. I hope 	to return and again join you in the prayer on the 21st.  	The hymn that has been sung on Monday is particularly appro- priate. 	It says that he who gives his all gets all without asking. As 	against this he who grabs what he has no right to, loses all.  	I have been told that some  of  you  travel  without  ticket  on 	trains  and  even  stop  trains  by  pulling  the  alarm chain at   	will. The report has pained me. Both these things are illegal. But I 	do not want to dwell upon the legal aspect. These practices are 	contary to the spirit of the prayer. All I can say is those who 	indulge in these pract- ices have not grasped the meaning of prayer. 	If they will reflect on the hymn that has just been sung they will 	realize that they may not travel     
 without ticket or pull the alarm chain without legitimate cause. I hope that such things will not occur again. If we continue to indulge in this kind of behaviour it will neither bring us independence nor enable us to retain it after it has been won. May God guide us aright.

  	I have very carefully read your letter of the 15th and the note you 	left with me when we last met. Dr. Sushila Nayyar added that after 	best thought you had come to the conclusion that it would not be 	proper to worry me in the matter, at least for the time being. If 	this last news is accurate, I need not say anything more. However, I 	want to say that in popular estimation anything which the Government 	either directly or indirectly supports is considered to be 	anti-Independence and there is, at some stage or other, a clash 	between the people and the power that keeps the former from their 	cherished goal. This has happened often enough within my own 	experience. Therefore, ‘non-     
 political’ has come to mean non-Indian, i.e., anti-Independence.  Hence the unpopularity of movements connected with the Govern- ment. This is the crux. Association with war has a meaning with me but not with the average man. Everything British is certainly not bad if it is not synonymous with the Government; as C.F. Andrews, from top to toe British, was not bad. There are many organizations under Democracy which are not themselves run democratically but are not anti-democratic. Thus, a bank or a hospital would require experts to run it even though they may be run by democrats in the interest of democracy.

  	Owing to my many preoccupations, I have not been able to write to 	you of late. I hope you are getting on well. You must be learning 	Hindustani.  	Enclosed is a letter from Vrajlal. Read it and preserve it. Give it 	to  me  when  I  return.  I  have  replied  to  Vrajlal  and  told 	him that if he finds it convenient he may go to Sevagram even in my 	absence. If he can persuade you to marry him, he may by all means do 	so. As  I understand you, you do not even countenance the idea of 	marrying. But my judgment of you may be wrong. Can any man or woman 	really know his or her heart? Does not God alone know it? If, there- 	fore, you change your mind after meeting Vrajlal, believe yourself 	to be absolutely free to do what you like. Don’t be obdurate 	through a false sense of shame. Obey the promptings of a pure heart. 	I shall welcome your writing to Vrajlal, and if you do write, send 	the letter to 
 me. I will forward it to him. If you are not very eager to write, I shall not press you to do so.

  	I have received all your letters. The letter written on  rough  	paper is also lying with me. Today I shall answer whatever I 	possible can. I 	am doing quite a bit of work here.  	As for hand-carding I believe that this makes the cotton very clean. 	It is not so well cleaned either by machine or by any other means. 	By all these other means the fibre does become somewhat weak. In my 	view land-carding is a grand process. Combing should be given a 	place in it. Hand-carding teaches us cleanliness  and patience. 	Adding the time spent in hand-carding [to that of the whole process] 	the speed of spinning the yarn seems slow. But that does not matter. 	Hand-carding of course cannot provide a livelihood. But it has a 	very significant part in self-reliance. As the process of hand- 	carding has not been very much in vogue, we have not had a real 	estimate of its power. We shall have an idea of its power if large 	numbers of people take to hand-carding. Show this letter to Vinoba 	also Hand-carding is his discovery. He has also had a wide 	experience.  I would like to know if I am mistaken in this.  	Because the sadhu had gone away, it was quite proper that he was 	asked to leave the Ashram. In my view this does not mean that it was 	quite wrong to have kept him in the Ashram. This will enable you to 	understand my argument.  	I have no doubt that there should be separate classes for women. As 	for Om Prakash I shall be content with whatever you think right. It 	would not be proper for me to write anything about this.  	I think the proper thing would be for me not to lay down limits as 	to the expenses of the people who are staying in the Ashram and 
 who come as visitors. For my experience these days should be regar- ded as limited. In my view you have all  gone too far ahead.  And  when one has left a thing behind, one’s view of it becomes less acceptable. The	same applies to me. A doctor, however great a
 specialist he may be, does not regard himself as a specialist when he has given up practice. Others, who have acquired degrees later would be considered more competent. Hence, if it is decided to limit the expenses, let me first know the amount now being spent. Then I shall provide whatever light I can.
 As for quarters for workers in the Ashram, I have discussed the matter at length with Shantabehn. But I am neutral. Shantabehn must be well now.
 I shall not write anything from here about the work of Kamle and Om Prakashji. It would be improper for me to write. But I shall be ready to write to them when you write to me that I can place your views before them.
 I understand what you say about Kailasbehn. It would have been better if I had asked you to be present when I spoke to her. I admit that what happened was improper. But I was dealing with things under such pressure that, much as I should have wished it, I could not have kept you with me all the time. This does not imply that I should not be warned again. Even a cautions person is likely to commit mistakes. Hence, it is a good policy to give a discreet warning.
 It seems to me that however much we may get to know Vinoba, there is still more to learn. Do take the girls and the boys with you. Let there be one rule in this matter, that is, there should be no undue pressure on Vinoba. We should value his time.
Do you want a wall clock or a timepiece ?
 As a general rule, the new entrants should bear their own expenses. If it is decided to keep anyone free of charge, it should be done after recording the reason for doing so. I hope you have kept some such book there.
 What decision did you want from me with regard to Chakrayya?
 What do you want now ?

SANTINIKETAN,
 December 18, 1945
 Gurudev (Rabindranath Tagore) was like a great bird, wide and swift of wings, under which he gave protection to many.libtech_94_footnote
 Under the warmth of his wings Santiniketan has been nurtured to its present size. Bengal is full of his songs. He has glorified the name of India throughout the world not by his songs only but also by his pen and brush. We all miss the warmth of his protecting wings. But we must not grieve. The remedy lies in our own hands.
 True monuments to the great are not statues of marble, bronze or gold. The best monument is to adorn and enlarge their legacy. A son who buries underground his father’s legacy or wastes it will be adjudged unworthy of his inheritance.
 Whilst on Rathi Babulibtech_95_footnoteand his colleagues must primarily rest the sacred duty of making Santiniketan truely worthy of Gurudev’s great tradition, that duty rests no less upon all those who, though they may not be directly connected with Santiniketan, received the warmth of Gurudev’s wings.
 All mortals must quit this world one day. Gurudev has gone, having achieved all that a human being can expect to in life. His soul now rests in peace. It is for you now, the workers and inmates of Santiniketan—as indeed all those who are imbued with Gurudev’s spirit—collectively to represent his ideal.
 Santiniketan has been the abode of peace to me and since my family was given shelter on arrival from South Africa it  is  a pilgrimage to me and whenever I got the opportunity I came here to seek peace and tranquility.
 It is indeed sad that we no longer have his protective wings on us. But I find solace in the fact taht he has left own memorial in the form of many gifts that he has bequeathed to the nation.
 It is our duty to receive those gifts with humility and gratitude and to see that they go on increasing. If we can continue his work and prove ourselves true to the task he has left us, I do not see why we should mourn his passing away. I feel in my heart that his soul is
 
 somewhere in this Ashram and in perfect peace.
 His songs that you have sung to me, although their meanings are not accessible to me just now, were full of sweetness and inspiration. I very much wish I could prolong my stay here in your midst, but I am afraid it is not possible this time, because I have other urgent duties to attend to.
 Druing the last few years, India has passed through a great ordeal and none has suffered so greatly as this province of Bengal. The news of Bengal’s agonies reached me when I was in jail— powerless to do anything. I all along prayed to God to send me to serve Bengal and to help the distressed people. My visit this time, therefore, was undertaken with a view to serve and to work for Bengal. That is why I am very sorry that I shall not be able to prolong my stay. I shall take my sustenance of peace and inspiration from this place and then go away. I hope you will understand and forgive me.

 SANTINIKETAN,
 December 19, 1945
 Santiniketan is no new place to me. This Mandir too is familiar to me by old association. On more than one occasion I have come here and addressed the inmates. Santiniketan is like a home of my own. The world is in need of the ideal of peace which is the ideal of Santiniketan. That is why I expect a great deal from this place.
 Gurudev lives on in his own creation. He has fulfilled his mission. It is we who have certain duties which we owe to him. If we fail to fulfil them we shall be failing in our duties.
 The message of Santiniketan is urgently needed for the world in travail. Gurudev travelled from one quarter of the earth to another to bring about peace and conciliation. In a way he has designed Santiniketan for bringing peace to the whole world. His father foun- ded the Ashram and it was left to the son to bring its benediction to the whole world.
 When we come to a place of worship of our minds should be calm so that our hearts can be receptive. That is why we close our eyes during prayers. But today I would rather keep my eyes open to see the vision how the students of this place are getting ready to carry the message of peace as couriers of goodwill and brotherhood of the world.
 Students of Oxford, Cambridge and other well-known seats of learning carry their own hallmark. I would like to see the students of this Ashram invested with that hallmark of peace and fellowship. I would like to see, moreover, how alert they are to receive the world and how unperturbed and calm they are in the face of difficulties.libtech_98_footnote
 
 The world has now grown a small place. England is no longer seven seas away. It takes hardly three days to reach the heart of England. We have come so near that we can share our joys and grief with all. The War has ceased. The Allies have won, but turmoil is still there, the pain and sufferings are on a very large scale. Winter is coming. We who belong to the tropics cannot even imagine what hardships will have to be endured by the people of the West in the face of dire winter there. Thousands have died and there is death staring in the face of many other thousands. They die of the severe cold and we of famine. What further suffering is in store for humanity nobody knows.
 In the midst of this world-wide turmoil this Ashram should carry out its ideal of peace. All of you should carry the message of peace and brotherhood and dedicate yourselves to the cause of removing pain and suffering of the poor. You should prepare yourselves for that task from now on. You should be resolute and at the same time unperturbed. It is for you to fulfil the hope and trust that Gurudev left upon you.

 SANTINIKETAN,
 December 19, 1945 Birth and death are the obverse and reverse of the same coin.  They are not distinct.  They are different aspects of the same thing.
But out of  our ignorance we  welcome the one and shrink from  the
 other. This is wrong. Mourning over the death of dear ones, espe- cially those like Charlie Andrews and Gurudev who have done their part so nobly and well has its root in our selfishness. Deenabandhu is blessed in death as he was in life. Death of people like him cannot be an occasion for sorrow. Speaking for myself, I may say that I have almost forgotten to mourn the death of friends and dear ones and I want you to learn to do likewise.libtech_100_footnote
 Between Deenabandhu and me there existed love like that between two brothers. I remember how Deenabandhu came out to South Africa at the instance of Mr. Gokhale and with the blessings of Gurudev, and how he repeated from place to place with deep feeling the mantras Gurudev had given him. Today I have laid the foundation of the hospital in memory of Deenabandhu Andrews—a title which has been bestowed on him by the grateful poor who need hospitals.
 Being situated midway between Sriniketan and Santiniketan, it will serve not only these two places but also the villages round about. I have been very much touched by the cordial welcome given me by the representativeslibtech_101_footnotelibtech_102_footnoteof the villagers.  It is symbolical of their blessings with which are joined the blessings of you all.
 Gandhiji referred to the high prices of building materials and said that it might take some time before the hospital could be erected.

110,"December 19, 1945","DISCUSSION WITH HEADS OF DEPARTMENT, SANTINIKETANlibtech_103_footnote","
  
 December 19, 1945
 Regard me as a blank slate. So far I have had only hearsay and hearsay has very little place in my life. Solid facts are what I want. Without a full knowledge of facts I shall be able to do little to help you.
 It is not that you have nothing to say. That would mean that the institution is perfect. But nothing in this world is perfect. Speak to me freely about the shortcomings. Good things speak for themselves, not the bad things, at any rate, not to me.
 I have followed every word of what you have said with the keenest interest and I have learned a lot from it. I do not propose to make detailed observations on what has been said or to  give expression to all that is welling up in me just now but shall confine myself to one or two remarks of a general character.
 As I listened while Nanda Babulibtech_104_footnoteand Kshiti mohan Babu were speaking, I said to myself: ‘Here is a real difficulty; but it is a diffi- culty of our own making.’ If a person conducts a big department he  is expected to transmit what he stands for to someone who can be termed as his successor. Yet it is the dominant cry of the two stalwarts that they are unable to find a suitable successor for their respective departments. True, these are departments of a special character. I know these departments and I know too Gurudev’s views about them. Speaking generally, may I venture to suggest that there is no difficulty but can be overcome by tapascharya? It is almost an untranslatable word, the nearest approach to its true meaning being perhaps ‘single- minded devotion’. But it means much more than that. When-ever, in the course of my multifarious activities, I have been con-fronted with a difficulty of this character, this single-minded devotion has solved my difficulty in a manner which I had never expected. During my twenty long years in God-forsaken South Africa, where under cir-
 
 cumstances of the worst kind conceivable I found my God, it was my invariable experience that the right helper appeared at the right moment.
 It is my conviction, which I arrived at after a long and laborious struggle, that Gurudev as a person was much superior to his works or even this institution where he soared and sang. He poured his whole soul into it and nurtured it with his life’s blood and yet I dare say that his greatness was not fully expressed by it or through it. That is perhaps true of all great and good men—they are better and greater than their works. If, then, you are to represent that goodness or great- ness for which Gurudev stands but which he could not express fully even through this institution, you can do it only through tapas-  charya.
 There is a remarkable string of verses in the Tulsi Ramayana to the effect that what is not possible through other means becomes possible through tapascharya. This is said with reference to Parvati. Narada had prophesied that she would have for her companion-in-life one who answered to the description of Siva. If instead of Siva those characteristics were met in the person of a rogue, her life would be ruined. How to avert such a calamity was the problem and it is in that context that the verses to which I have referred come. I commend these verses to you for your careful perusal. Only you will have to strip them of their orthodoxy.
Finances were mentioned by you in the course of discussion. I
 will plead with you to dismiss from your thoughts the word ‘finance’ altogether. I am convinced that lack of finances never represented a real difficulty to a sincere worker. Finances follow—they dog your footsteps if you represent a real cause. Here, let me utter a warning. A worker may be real and yet the cause he represents may not be real. His handicap in that case will continue. There are, of course, seeming exceptions. The world is full of fools and successful rogues. But speaking of sincere men and women, it is my faith that if their cause is as worthy as their means, the handicap of finance need never deter them or damp their ardour. It is a big thing you have undertaken and in future you may have to undertake still bigger things and  the question will be raised, ‘What about the finances ?’ and you will find that the difficulty lies somewhere else rather than in the lack of  finances. Set it right and the finances will take care of themselves.
 Yourslibtech_105_footnoteis a common difficulty.  You cannot ride two horses at the same time. If you mix day-scholars with full-time students, the former will overshadow and spoil the training of the latter. Your ins- titution was not designed for the mixture.
 Then it was said by Krishna Kripalani that they did not know what they were aiming at or stood for, what the sum total of the energies of Santiniketan and Sriniketan signified. My answer is that the ideal before you is not to represent Bengal or even India; you have to represent the whole world. Gurudev’s claim was not smaller than that. He stood for humanity as a whole. He could not do that unless he represented India with its destitute, dumb millions. That should be your aspiration as well. Unless you represent that mass mind of India you will not represent Gurudev as a man. You may represent him as a singer, as a painter, or as a great poet but you won’t represent him, and history will say of Gurudev that his institution was a failure. I do not want history to give that verdict.
 I agree that if my claim that I am one of you is to be fully vindicated I ought to be here in your midst for a longer time.libtech_106_footnoteI would love to do so. But my future dispositions are in the hands of God.

 SANTINIKETAN,
 December 20, 1945
 I want to hear from your lips what inspires you to be here and what are the difficulties that confront you.
 Q.	Should Santiniketan allow itself to be drawn into politcal work ?
 A. I have no difficulty in saying that Santiniketan and Visva- Bharati ought not to be mixed up with politics. Every institution has its limitations.This institution should set limitations upon itself
 
 unless it is to be cheap. When I say that Santiniketan should not get mixed up with politics, I do not mean that it should have no political ideal. Complete independence must be its ideal, as it is that of the country. But that very ideal would require it to keep out of the present-day political turmoil. I was asked this question when I was here thirty years ago and the reply I then gave was the same as I have given today. In fact it applies with even greater force today.
 Q. In order to make Visva-Bharati really an international university, should  we not try to increase the material resources of the university and provide greater facilities and ordinary comforts of life to attract scholars and research workers of outstanding merit from all over the country ?
A.	By material resources I suppose you mean finance. Let me
 then say that your question is addressed to person who does not swear by material resources.‘Material resources’ is after all a comparative term. For instance, I do not go without food and clothing. In my own way I have tried—more than perhaps any other man—to increase the level of material resources of the average man in India. But it is my firm conviction that Visva-Bharati will fail to attract the right type of talent and scholarship if it relies on the strength of the material resources or material attractions that it can offer. Its attraction must be moral or ethical, or else it will become just one out of the many educational institutions in India. That was not what Gurudev lived and died for. I do not mean that creature comforts should not be pro- vided to the staff and workers who work here. There are ample material comforts in evidence here already. If I stayed here longer and had my way they might be considerably reduced. As Visva- Bharati progresses and more and more gifts and donations begin to pour in, in due course it will be able to provide more attractions to scholars and research workers, if it wants to. But if I were asked for advice I would say: ‘Do not yield to this temptation.’ Visva-Bharati must take its stand on the advancement or moral worth. If it does not stand for that, it is worth nothing.
 Q.	What must be done so that the institution might not lose its high moral appeal? What remedy do you suggest for it ?
A.	Every one of   you  should  understand  the   significance  of
 moral worth. Moral worth is easily distinguished from material worth.The one leads to devotion to moral value, the other to Mam- mon-worship. What distinguishes man from the four-footed beast is merely the recognition of moral worth, i. e., the greater  the  moral
 worth of a person the greater his distinction. If you believe in this ideal, you should ask yourselves why you are here and what you are doing.
 Every worker must have, of course, food, clothing, etc., for himself and his dependants. But you do not belong to Visva-Bharati merely because Visva-Bharati feeds, clothes and finds creature com- forts for you. You belong to it because you cannot do otherwise, because your moral worth increases day by day by working for its ideals. Therefore, every defect that crops up, every difficulty that obs- tructs its working, will be found to be ultimately traceable to some defect in your outlook in regard to moral worth. I have been con- nected with many institutions for over sixty years and I have come to the conclusion that every difficulty in their working was traceable to a defect in the understanding of moral values.
 Q. We are trying to serve villagers. We find that at every step our activity is blocked by the social environment in the villages. The joyless routine of life there, the stagnation and the incubus of evil social customs obstruct our efforts. Should we not work for the eradication of these before we can hope for success in our other activities, and if so how can it be done ?
A. Ever since I came to India I have felt that social revolution is
 a much more difficult thing to achieve than the political revolution, by which I mean ending our present slavery under the British rule. There are some critics who say that India cannot attain her political and economic emancipation till we get social emancipation. I regard it as  a snag and a conundrum set to puzzle us, because I have found that the absence of political emancipation retards even our efforts for bringing about social and economic emancipation. At the same time  it is also true that without a social revolution we will not be able to leave India happier than when we were born. I can however indicate no royal road for bringing about a social revolution except that we should represent it in every detail of our own lives.
 Force has been used to alter the structure of society in some countries. But I have purposely eliminated it from our consideration. So my advice to you is: Try again and again and never say that you are defeated. Do not get impatient and say, ‘the people are no good.’ Rather say, ‘I am no good.’ If the people do not respond within the time limit prescribed by you the failure is yours, not theirs. It is thankless and laborious work. But you do not expect thanks for your work. Work that is undertaken for love is no burden—it is pure joy.
 Q. In an ashram, does the introduction of salary system raise or degrade the ideal of the institution ?
A.	I have no difficulty in saying that it makes no difference
 whether you pay a fixed salary or your expenses are paid for you. Both methods can be tried. The danger to be guarded against  is this:  if you pay a man his bazaar price you do not carry out the spirit of the Ashram. We should rather do without talent and ability, be it of the highest order, if it demands its bazaar value. In other words, we should wait till talent is attracted to the institution, not for money but for something else for which the institution stands. Nor should you let the principle of “according to want” take you even beyond bazaar values. The salary system in Visva-Bharati is not a thing to complain of. The difficulties to which you have referred cannot be removed by mere tinkering. You must find out and remove the causes  which  are  at the root of the defects you have in mind.
 Q. How can we make headway against cynicism or lack of faith that we find among the youngsters ?
 A. I heave a sigh of despair when you ask me that question. When you find that your pupils are without faith you should say to yourself: ‘I am without faith.’ I have found that again and again in  my own experience. And each time the discovery has been like an invigorating bath for me. The Biblical saying ‘remove the beam from thine own eye before ye point out the mote in thy neighbour’s’libtech_108_footnotelibtech_109_footnoteis even more appropriate in the case of pupil and teacher. The pupil comes to you to find in you something infinitely better than himself. Rather than complain, ‘Oh! he has no faith. How can I implant faith in him,’ it would be far better that you resigned from your job.
 Q. The intellectual tradition of Gurudev is being fairly well maintained here  but I am afraid that the idealism for which he stood does not find full scope. There must be something wrong in an organization that leads to such a result. What is the remedy? Secondly, should our institution only to make culture available to the man in the street? This is your ideal. At the same time should not there be a place where higher culture can be preserved for the initiated? This was Gurudev’s ideal. Such an institution will necessarily be exclusive and for the select only. I am a follower both  of yours and Gurudev’s ideals and I am torn by the conflict between the two.
A.	To take the second question first, it is a  reflection both  on
 Gurudev and myself.   I have found no real conflict between us.  I
 
 started with a disposition to detect a conflict between Gurudev and myself but ended with the glorious discovery that there was none.
 Regarding your question, all I can say is that the feeling, ‘I am all right but there is something wrong with the institution,’ betrays self-righteousness. It is a killing thing. When you feel within yourself that you are all right but everything around is wrong, the conclusion which you should draw for yourself is that everything is all right but there is something wrong within you.libtech_110_footnote

 Hindu-Muslim unity can come only by selfless service of Muslims untainted by political motives.
 They (Muslims) are just like us and we must be friends with them. The same applies to Harijans. We cannot survive if we are un- just to them. By all means let all those go who want to go to the
 
 Assemblies but even there they must make it their business to work the constructive programme. In any case, the bulk of the work of Con- gressmen will be outside legislatures and they must devote themselves whole-heartedly to the new, enlarged programme of constructive work.
 In reply to his enquiries Mahatmaji was informed that the population of the district was about eleven lakhs including two lakh Mohammedans and about 73,000 Santhals. He asked the workers to include the Santhals also in their programme of service . . . .
 In regard to the shortage of cloth the workers informed Gandhiji that there were 500 spinners in the district before 1942. But cotton yarn had always come from outside, as Bengal had never grown enough cotton for her needs. Gandhiji said that the lack of cloth in any province could not be looked upon as an insurmmountable difficulty and cited the example of England, which though it grew no cotton, was the biggest exporter of cloth.

 Mahatma Gandhi emphasized the need for removing untouchability from the Hindu society. It was a terrible blot on Hinduism, he added. They must feel that every Indian was their brother—their own flesh. They must banish from their hearts all distinctions between Hindus and Muslims, Harijans and Bhils and Santhals. If they could learn these lessons they could banish a good many of the evils that beset society.
 Mahatma Gandhi regretted that all of them could not understand Hindustani. They must, of course, know the language of their province. But, he pointed out, if they wanted to travel all over India and wanted others to come to them, they must have a common language and that language had to be Hindustani.
 Explaining the language, Gandhiji said that Urdu was one form of Hindustani and the other form was Hindi. The difference was that Urdu contained more words of Arabic and Persian origin and was written in Persian script, whereas Hindi contained words of Sanskrit origin and was written in Devanagari script. It was not so always but he would not at this moment enter into the history or the causes of the present division. Gandhiji emphasized that those who wished to serve India must learn both
 
 the scripts and forms of the language. If they loved their country and its people they would not mind the trouble and it was not a hard task either.
 Urging the people to wear khaddar, Gandhiji observed that after 30 years’ experience he could say that if they had the will to produce their own cloth they could overcome the scarcity of cloth in no time. It was strange, he remarked, that they could not or did not produce cloth in their country where cotton grew in abundance and did not spin and weave their own cloth.
 Gandhiji referred to the prevalence of malaria in the district and said that one reason for this was their terrible poverty. But if they used their leisure hours rightly, Gandhiji thought, they could lessen their poverty also. They must give up their insanitary habits and it was the duty of all their workers to know how to preserve their own health and teach people the way to do so.

 Gandhiji asked them to be peaceful as, he said, freedom could not be achieved by shouting slogans. Peace was their only weapon for non-violence which alone could bring independence. He advised them also not to think in terms of Hindus and Muslims.

 We are all travellers. I had been to Santiniketan for two days. I have returned and will stay here for two or three days and again I will go to Midnapore.
 We are all travellers. Sooner or later we will have to undertake a long journey. This is the preparation for the long one. We must not be sorry for any travelling, short or long. But we do feel sorry for the long journey because we do not understand the significance of life and death, which are equal.
 Today’s song conveys the idea appropriately (“ Ai Korechho Bhalo Nithur, Ai Korechho Bhalo”). This is a prayer to God to burn our passion. And only when we have succeeded in that, shall we have no sorrow for the long journey.

CHI. RATHI,
 It was a matter of pure delight for me to be in Santiniketan and to study all I could during my very brief stay. I told you that I would put down in writing some of the things I was unable to say there either to  you  personally  or  during  the  conversationlibtech_115_footnotewith  the   heads   of departments.
  Just 	as I 	do not 	like day-scholars, 	I do 	not like 	preparing boys 	and girls for 	university examinations. 	Visva-Bharati is its 	own university. 	I ought 	not to 	be in need of 	a charter 	from any Govern- 	ment. As 	it is you are giving 	Visva-Bharati degrees side by 	side with 	preparing students for 	the chartered 	university. You have a 	 high  ideal 	to live 	for and live 	up to. 	University degrees 	are a 	lure to 	which you cannot afford to fall a prey. Concessions that Gurudev 
 
 made to weakness with impunity, Visva-Bharati without him cannot make. Concessions to weakness began with the introduction of the orthodox matriculation examination. I was unable even then to reconcile myself to it and I do not know that we have gained anything by it. I am not now thinking at all in terms of non-co-operation. I am just now anxious for Santiniketan to represent the  highest  that Gurudev stood for.
  Music 	in Santiniketan 	is charming, 	but has 	the professor there 	come to the conclusion 	that Bengali music is 	the last word in 	that direction? 	Has Hindustani 	music, i. e., 	music before and 	after Muslim 	period, anything to 	give to 	the world of 	music? If 	it has, it 	should have 	its due place at 	Santiniketan. Indeed, I 	would go 	so far as 	to say that 	Western music which has 	made immense strides should also blend with the 	Indian. Visva-Bharati is 	conceived as 	a world 	university. This 	is merely 	a passing 	thought of a 	layman to 	be transmitted to 	the music 	master there. 
 One questionlibtech_116_footnotelibtech_117_footnoteabout music.   I have   a  suspicion  that  perhaps there is more of music than warranted by life, or I will put the thought in another way. The music of life is in danger of being lost in the music of the voice. Why not the music of the walk, of the march, of every movement of ours and of every activity? It was not an idle remarklibtech_118_footnotewhich I made at the Mandir service about the way in which boys and girls should know how to walk, how to march, how to sit, how to eat, in short how to perform every function of life. That is my ideaa of music. So far as I know, Gurudev stood for all this in his own person.
  You 	will not 	have real rural 	reconstruction unless you 	begin with 	the basic craft, which 	is hand-spinning. 	Weaver’s art without 	hand-spinning is 	a dead 	art. You know 	that I pleaded 	for it 	with Gurudev; at 	first in 	vain, later on 	he had begun 	to see 	what I 	was driving 	at. If 	you think that I 	have interpreted 	Gurudev aright in the matter of 	spinning, you 	will not hesitate to 	make Santiniketan 	hum with 	the music of the wheel. 
 The spinning-wheel and all it means lends itself to the exhi- bition of all your skill. Do you know that the spinning-wheel is consi- dered to be solace of the poor widow? And it is the Annapurnalibtech_119_footnoteof the
 
 hungry. When you adopt spinning by way of a sacrificial rite you are immediately in tune with the dumb masses."

 We do not want to live on the mercy of anybody except God.
 Gita teaches us to be fearless.  If you could learn that, nobody would
 
 be able to keep you down. If anybody asks me to bow down my head—I am an old man and anybody can push me or knock me down—but if I say, ‘I won’t,’ the utmost he can do is to kill me. This fearlessness is swaraj. If everybody acts in the same way or feels in the same spirit, swaraj is there. It, however, does not mean that Government will go away today but it means that no power can make us bow down our head. We would not achieve independence  by  simply repeating the word like a parrot. Our deeds must be on the same line.
 Explaining the evening song, Gandhiji said that it was not an easy task to select an appropriate song out of the many composed by Gurudev. In this particular song, the Poet asked them not to be cowards. They were in a small boat and God was their helmsman. When God was their helmsman they should not be afraid of  anything. His hands were not shaky and He would safely escort them to their destination.
 Gandhiji asked his audience to have faith in God. They would have to swim across the ocean of life. After all, what was fear? The word itself frightened them. He, therefore, advised them that they must take the essence of the song to their heart. Gandhiji asked them not to leave him, nor would he leave them, so long as he was in Calcutta. He also advised them to take part in the prayer by singing in chorus with them.

Or don’t you yourself experience any contradiction in becoming a director of the mill? I shall expect your reply to this before I arrive at any decision. Write to me frankly. Send your reply to the address men- tioned above. I shall be in Bengal and Assam till the 20th of January, but my headquarters will continue to be Sodepur.
 I got your letter after I wrote this, which all the same covers all the points.

129,"December 	23, 1945",LETTER TO MUNNALAL G. SHAH,"
    
 
        CHI. 	MUNNALAL,  SODEPUR,  December 	23, 1945 
 I 	got your letter of the 16th and postcard of the 19th.libtech_129_footnote  	No fee is to be charged from the poor who may be admitted as indoor 	patients, but we shall accept what they can offer. In other words, 	we shall follow the practice obtaining in Sevagram. At present even 	our expenses on food are so heavy that no person of ordinary means 	can meet them. We shall have to consider what diet we can devise for 	those people which will cure them and help them to keep fit.   Along 		with the poor 		we shall 		admit only such wealthy patients 		who agree to live as the poor do. I can see no place for them in this     
 sanatorium if they have to be provided special facilities. I shall not permit even providing a special room for a rich patient  simply  because he is rich. The plan of constructing new rooms, etc., does not appeal to me just now. For we shall know only from experience how many poor patients will seek admission or how many of them we shall admit. We shall see what to do when we run short of accomodation. My view, therefore, is that we should incur no expenditure just now except what is absolutely essential.
  The 	chairs, etc., will 	of course 	have to 	be removed. The 	Doctor himself 	wished to 	buy up 	some of 	the furniture. 	I do 	not know 	whether he still 	wishes to do so. 	If he does 	not, I am 	afraid I 	shall have to 	arrange for 	their disposal. I 	can only 	hope that I shall 	be able to 	do so. We 	shall have to 	make do 	with the number 	of beds 	we have at 	present. I 	see that there 	will be 	no occasion in 	the immediate 	future to 	admit a 	large number of patients. The reply to this is contained in what has been stated above.  If 	the boiler 	for heating 	water has become 	useless, it should 	be replaced 	by a new 	one. I 	did have 	some talk with the 	Doctor about 	it, but I 	forget what decision 	we took. 	If it is necessary 	to seek 	the help 	of the 	mill-owner in 	the neighbourhood 	or of Birlaji, 	I shall 	be ready to do so. Do what the Doctor suggests in this matter.  There 	is no 	reason to 	believe that we shall start getting 	patients right 	from January 1. We shall 	need to make 	arrangements only for those 	who are already 	there. And they can even 	sit on the 	floor and 	eat off porcelain plates.  I 	have made arrangements 	to buy 	the required quantity of 	khadi. If, 	therefore, you 	let me know 	the requirements, 	I shall 	be able 	to supply 	it. You yourself 	suggested five to seven 	rolls for three 	dozen bed-sheets. Will 	that number suffice?  Please 	consider whether 	those  among 	 the  workers  there 	who have 	their own arrangements 	for meals 	can continue 	the practice. 	I think 	it is our 	duty willingly 	to have 	meat served to those 	who are 	used to 	it and whose 	need we 	ought to 	supply. I 	see no 	harm or 	pollution—no one 	should—in the 	two kinds of food 	being cooked in 	the same 	kitchen. The idea 	of pollution 	is a mere 	excrescence [on our 	religion]. Those who 	are vegetarians should 	follow their dharma. It 	is self- 	evident to 	me that utensils 	used for cooking 	meat should 	not be 	used for cooking vegetables. In this matter I think we ought to res- 
 pect the wishes of the Doctor and Gulbai. There should not be even the slightest suspicion that we are indirectly trying to introduce vege- tarian food. But we welcome anybody accepting vegetarianism on his own as being good for him.
 I think it will be our duty to supply meat or eggs to those patients for whom the Doctor may consider them necessary.
 The selection of medical assistants will rest with the Doctor. Calls 	for no reply.  Just 	  now 	  I 	  would 	  regard  Balkobalibtech_130_footnoteas  representing  the 	standard for 	poor patients.  I 	agree with the 	Doctor that ultimately 	we shall 	have to shift 	to some 	large place. I have 	the fullest 	faith that God will 	make our path clear.  There 	is no need 	just now to call 	anybody from 	Sevagram. I 	have already written to 	you about Manibhai. He 	will come whenever 	we send 	for him.  The 	expenditure will 	have to be met 	by me. 	Is there 	no balance in 	the bank 	account there? I think 	I asked 	this question in 	a previous letter too. Probably it was in a letter addressed to the Doctor. I 	have always held the view which you have expressed. 
 I think I have now replied to all your questions. If, however, there is anything you do not follow, do write to me. Address the letter  to Sodepur.
 I got you postcard today. The reply to the question you have asked in it is contained in what I have said above.
I have not revised the letter.

        CHI. 	PREMA,  SODEPUR,  December 	23, 1945 
  	Your letter of Decemebr 17 is strange, and so is its language. This 	is the first such letter I have had from you. You are very busy. How 	surprising and sad that, though you claim to be a public worker, you 	feel embarrassed to have to ask for money from time to time? Why 	need one feel embarrassed to ask for money for public work? You 	have, I am sure, seen me putting out my head through windows of 	railway carriages and begging a pice each from the people. You have 	even helped me in this. And still the letter to which I am reply- 	ing seems to have been written by a millionaire. I can understand 	your feeling embarrassed if you were asking for money for yourself. 	But how can it be too much to ask for money even a hundred times for 	a public cause? You have asked for an additional sum, but have not 	sent me a copy of the letter. If you have addressed the letter to me 	in my capacity as Chairman, you should have addressed a formal 	letter to the Secretary too. I can immediately reply to a letter 	received through the Secretary. If you have written to me as to an 	elder, you should give me enough details to enable me to send the 	money to you without delay.  	I sought your advice as from a daughter, co-worker and one who was 	more than a sister to Sushila. Instead of giving the advice I asked 	for, you have written as if we were utter strangers. I do not 	undertand what all this is. Address your reply to Sodepur. I shall 	be touring in Bengal, and they will redirect the letter from here.

137,"December 23, 1945",DISCUSSION WITH POLITICAL WORKERS1,"
    
 SODEPUR,
 December 23, 1945 The first [question] was from a lady who wanted to know when the remaining prisoners would be released.  Gandhiji was reported to have talked with H. E. the
 Governor about them. Some of the prisoners were important workers without whom the great organization could not be said to be in full working order.
 Gandhiji said he had naturally discussed with His excellency many questions, but he could not allow himself to be cross-examined. He could only hope with those present that if they were on the eve of liberty these prisoners must be set free sooner rather than later. But he warned the lady questioner not to worry about them if she believed with him that prisons for patriots were gateways to liberty. Was not India in bondage one vast prison ?
 To a student who wanted to know what part students were to play Gandhiji said that he could not understand  student  organizations  antagonistic  to  one another.  Students should all be lovers of freedom and therefore all Congressmen   in thought. But their first work was study. They were all servants of the nation. They  should  have  no  communal  taint  nor  could  they   harbour   untouchability. They were bound to follow the constructive programme and, through the charkha and all it meant, ally themselves with the  millions  of  poor  villagers  of  India.  For the rest they should hear everything and everyone respectfully, weigh everything and  follow   what   they   thought was  right.	But they must keep out of party politics.
 To the question whether “Vandemataram” should be  replaced  by  the  new song “Qadam, Qadam”, Gandhiji said that a song that carried such glorious asso- ciations of sacrifice as “Vandemataram” could never be given up. It would be like discarding one’s mother. But they could certainly add a new song or songs like the one mentioned to their repertoire of national songs after due thought and discrimi- nation.
 Q. Was there violence by the people in 1942 ?
 Gandhiji referred the questioner to his replylibtech_139_footnoteto the Tottenham pamphlet and added that had the people as a whole not remained non-violent, India would have gone back. He also thought the Government had senselessly put the principal Congress-
 
 men in prison and thus provoked the people who were not yet restrained enough for complete non-violence. He had seen nothing to alter his conviction that the Government excesses far outweighed what the people had done in the way  of  violence.
 Q. What could Congressmen do to draw Muslims to the Congress?
 Gandhiji said that in the presence of the prevailing distrust there should be no attempt to enlist Muslims or any other group or individuals. What however every Hindu could do was mutely to serve his Muslim or for that matter every non-Hindu neighbour as his blood brother. Such selfless service was bound to tell in the end. That was the way of non-violence, otherwise called love.
 Asked as to what the position of the Congress in relation of class struggle between the capitalists and the labouring class was, Gandhiji replied that he could speak only in his individual capacity as he was not even a four-anna member of the Congress. His own relations with his capitalist friends, he remarked, typified the attitude of the Congress towards the capitalist class. He  freely  accepted  the hospitality of capitalists like the Birlas and made use of their money to serve the cause of the poor, but the latter did not expect anything in return from him. On the contrary, they were glad to be exploited by him in the interests of the poor. His relationship with them was ethical. He could never give up his associations with the capitalists because of fear of anybody. To do so would, in his opinion, amount to a betrayal of the cause of the poor.
 Similarly, whilst the Congress accepted the financial help and cooperation of the capitalists in its fight for independence, it never was and never could be a capitalist organization. The Congress was pledged to defend the rights of labour against anyone who might attempt to encroach upon them. From its very inception  it had stood for the poor, and consciously or unconsciously striven to become an organization of the masses. In this connection he referred to Dadabhai Naoroji’s monumental work Poverty and Un-British Rule in India, which showed the deep concern of the Grand Old Man of the Congress for Indian masses.
 They could now understand why he asked them to rally round the Congress. They should all identify themselves and serve the Congress, irrespective of whether they were on its membership register or not. The Congress tricolour symbolized truth and non-violence. It was the only flag worthy of being adopted by them. There was no power in the universe  greater  than truth.  Bereft of truth man was no  better than the four-footed beast. If they made truth their staff and ahimsa their shield they would be irresistible.
 Continuing, he told them that he considered himself to be a labourer just like themselves. He did not think that there was any essential antagonism between capital and labour. In fact he held that labour alone was true capital. All the gold of
 the capitalists could not provide them with one morsel of bread. Collaboration of labour was necessary before capital could bear fruit. Again the gold and silver of the capitalists had only a limited currency but labour was universal currency. The capitalists could be robbed of their wealth but no one could rob the labourer of his wealth, namely, industry.
 Moreover, capitalists were after all few in number. The workers were many. But capital was well organized and had learnt to combine. If labour realized its inherent strength and the secret of combination it would rule capital instead of being ruled by it.
 He commended to them the Ahmedabad Labour Union as a model organization to copy. It was perhaps the best organized labour union in the world. It ran its own free hospital, schools for children and cheap grain shops out of the union funds. It had conducted several successful strikes. The essential condition of a successful strike was that the strikers should not be dependent on public charity for their sustenance during the strike. They must have an alternative occupation to fall back upon in a crisis. He recalled how during the 23 days’ strikelibtech_140_footnoteof Ahmedabad labour workers, he had offered them work but had refused to give them doles. The latter would have demoralized them. Spinning was an occupation par excellence for their purpose. He therefore asked them to learn and practise it in their homes. Concluding, he observed that a strike should be organized not out of hostility towards the employers but for the restitution of the just rights of labour. Rights and duties were reciprocal in their nature, the former accrued only from a due performance of the latter.

They should 	understand the meaning 	of the 	song. It depicted 	one who had lost his 	way and was penitent for 	going on a wrong track.

  BAPA,   I am going to 	accommodate all the topics in one letter. I am 
 writing 	this on the steamer taking me to Midnapore.  	You have written to me about Kuttimalu Ammalibtech_149_footnoteof Malabar but I am afraid she may not be able to 	complete our job if she becomes a member of the Assembly.  	I have written to Purnima telling her that I very much doubt if  she 	can be an Agent if she wishes to enter the Assembly.libtech_150_footnoteI dis-- cussed the same point with Jawaharlal also. 	If, however, you think that this will not present any difficulty I 	might revise my opinion.  	I think anyone wishing to take up work among  women, especially 	village women, will have no time for and no interest in the 	Assembly. For my part, I would suggest that you write to Kuttimalu 	Amma to give up her longing for the Assembly; only then will she be 	able to work whole-heartedly for the K. G. N. M. Trust.  	Now your second letter—regarding Ram Swarup Khanna. I do not 	remember if the words “as far as possible” were dictated by me 	or by some other trustee. But they were added during the meeting 	itself. If you are inclined to delete the words I shall not say no. 	But if  the words are to be removed we ought to obtain a formal 	consent of all the trustees. I 	do not yet have Shyamlal’s letter in this connection.  	I have gone through Hariji’s report on Midnapore and I am 	proceeding there.  	Sucheta has sent a very good and exhaustive account of the camp at 	Sahibnagar. The girls of the camp also came and saw me. We are 	likely to gain some worth-while experience from  it.  You should 	however write to me only at the Sodepur address. Midnapore district 	will take eight days. On the 3rd I shall return to Sodepur. After 	having spent there a few days I shall go to Assam, where I     
 expect to spend seven days at the most. After that to Madras via Sodepur. The date fixed for Madras is 23rd January. Let us see what happens there. Will you be going to Madras ?
I ask this because we had some talk about the K. G. N. M. Trust.
 Spending a day in Orissa does not appear possible.

 December 25, 1945
 DEAR SISTER,
 I have your letter. Did you have the purse you had brought specially for the Bengal Harijan Sevak Sangh? Anyway it does not matter whether or not you have it. For my part, I have collected a fairly large amount. How much would you require? Please let me know. If you say that no sum will be too much I am going to look upon you as a lazy person. Workers who only know how to spend and cannot produce what they spend cannot do any work. This has been my experience over the past sixty years. It began with myself. In England we formed the Vegetarian Society in the Way’s Hotel, but did not collect funds from amongst the members, with the result that we achieved nothing. I occasionally exposed myself to laughter but I don’t remember anyone having been converted to vegetarianism because of my activity. My later experience gradually proved sweeter because I then decided that funds would be collected from those amongst whom we proposed to work. That balanced the two sides. The result was I became a “Mahatma”. I am pointing out the golden way in case you want to become one. This by way of jest. I am dicta- ting this on board the steamer taking me to Midnapore. That is how I could get some time. About meeting Harijan workers you may decide after I return.

 DIAMOND HARBOUR,
 December 25, 1945
 Gandhiji had already had one blessing from them. They had gathered there  in thousands but there was no noise and they were sitting there quietly and peacefully under the scorching sum. If he left them after two hours, he would be going to serve them elsewhere. If they realized that in their heart he would be really happy.
 So many of them, men and women, were spinning there. That was a sight very pleasing to him. He also desired to thank them for the purse of Rs. 25,250 which they had given him for work in this sub-division. It was still more pleasing to him that this money had been collected from 3,900 persons. He was giving it to Charu Babulibtech_157_footnoteand was sure that it would be spent wise with maximum benefit. He hoped that the work would be taken up with this sum as capital.
 He had read and heard of the calamities suffered by the people of this sub- division due to flood, famine and pesstilence. He also knew that unless they bore such calamities with fortitude, they would not be able to survive in this would. Calamities occurred at every moment in some place or other and humanity all over the world had to pass through such sufferings. Today humanity was suffering in one form or other all over the world. But if people thought of them as misfortunes falling on them and broke under them, they would not be able to reap good out of evil.
 The songs sung at Khadi Pratishthan at prayer-time every day had one central message and that was that even those who suffer get the blessings of God hidden in those sufferings.
 
 It pained him to find that thousands of villagers were still coming there from distant places. It had been decided that he should come there at half past three and remain with them for two hours. If he had done so his progamme of work would have been disturbed and he would not have been able to serve them as he desired.
 He had a faith and it was still with him after he had come there. That was about the charkha. He had been saying from the very beginning that if we did not have faith in the charkha and realized its inner meaning, we would not be able to live peacefully in Hindustan. He had been saying this for 60 years, and this was true not noly for Hindustan but for the whole world, wherever humanity lived, whether it was a small or big community or country. Humanity could not live peacefully unless it accepted the creed of truth and non-violence. It needed to be said that hooliganism or rowdyism would not enable us to bring swaraj or do anythiny good for humanity. He was convinced that if the 40 crores of people in India were truly imbued with this spirit of truth and non-violence then sawraj would be in our hands.
 He would also tell them briefly the significance of the charkha. They would see that the poorest of the poor could have a charkha and spin. He had not seen any other machine which could be as useful as the charkha. Spinning was a form of labour. If a person did not work for his bread, he would be like a thief stealing the property of others. The charkha gave them scope for honest labour.
 In our country persons who knew English and who were said to be educated told us that our people, who had no work to do for six months, could have nothing in store for them but begging. He would tell them that they would have to  use  intelligence in spinning too. A few minutes earlier he was spinning. The charkha was good but there was something wrong in it. He had to mend it before he could spin. In this way, if there was anything wrong in the machinery used by the people of India, then we would not be able to reap the maximum benefit out of it. Here one charkha went wrong. What would be the fate of Hindustan if 40 crores of charkhas went wrong? Those who believed that swaraj could be won by the charkha, would necessarily have the blessings of God. So long as we did not believe in God we would not be able to banish fear from our mind. A person or people who was not fearless could not be free. That was a simple truth.
 He  desired  to  thank  them  again for  they   had   listened   to   him   quietly. He  hoped  they  had  listened  and  realized  what  he  had  said.  If,   however,   they had not been able to follow him, he hoped what he had said would be translated into Bengali and circulated among them. When he heard that they would be glad if he held  his prayer there he was greatly delighted. He would hold his prayer for a few minutes and then would take leave of them. That did not mean that his work there was finished. He would go to the launch and hold discussions with their representatives. If he could work according to his plan, he would know his duties towards them. Concluding Mahatma Gandhi said :
 
 I would request you to be quiet at the time of prayer. You should be wholly given to meditation of God while praying. Prayer is not parrot-like repetition of words. It is meaningless without single- ness of heart.

154,"December 25, 1945","DISCUSSION WITH CONGRESS
WORKERSlibtech_158_footnote","
    
 MAHISHADAL,
 [On or after December 25, 1945]libtech_159_footnoteI cannot say that all that has been done has been well done or ought to have been done. On the contrary, much of it ought not to
have been done. That the people did not remain inert is a matter of
 satisfaction, but the fact that after all these years  they  should  not have known what the Congress stood for  is  a  matter  for  sorrow. What they did was thoughtless. By its very nature it could not be sus- tained.
 You have graphically put in your reports how you blew up a railway track, put roads out of use, burnt a kutchery, seized a thana, set up a parallel government and so on. This is not the technique of non-violent action. People committed the mistake of  thinking  that  all that did not involve killing was non-violence. Sometimes killing is the cleanest part of violence. If you kill the mischief-maker out- right, there is an end to it as far as he is concerned, but harassment is worse. It did not put out mischief. On the contrary, it brought the mischief on our own heads. The authorities became vindictive. Per- haps, you will say that they would have been vindictive anyhow, but that is not what we should desire or aim at. It does not pay us to let them go into panic.
 In August 1942, the authorities became panicky. We gave them that excuse. But they  are  a  people  who  do  not  know  what defeat is; their cowardice is not fundamental. So, they let such things as thanas, kutcheries, panchayat courts, etc., remain in your hands for a short while as toys but as soon as they had completed their dis- positions they turned the full blast of their machinery of retaliation against us. It is not in this way that India will attain her independence. We cannot afford to repeat it.
 
   ment”     
 Today you have to reckon not with Britain alone but the Big Three. You cannot successfully fight them with their own weapons. After all, you cannot go beyond the atom bomb. Unless we can have a new way of figting imperialism of all brands in the place of the out- worn one of a violent rising, there is no hope for the oppressed races of the earth.
 Let nobody be misled by the Russian parallel. Our tradition is wholly different from Russia’s. The historical setting too is defferent. In Russia the whole population was under arms; Indian masses will not take to arms even if they could be given the necessary training. But it is useless to think that our rulers will let us give them that training when they have at a stroke disarmed a first-rate military State like Japan. Today Japan lies prostrate at the conqueror’s feet. But non- violence knows no defeat. It must however be true non-violence, not a make-believe. I would not shed a single tear if I alone were left to represent such non-violence.
 Q. After all that we have done and suffered, we have begun to doubt whether our energies have flowed in the right channel, whether the mass awakening was not misdirected. But is not non-violent rebellion a programme of seizure of power ?
A. Therein lies the fallacy. A non-violent revolution is not a
 programme of ‘seizure of power’. It is a programme of transforma- tion of relationships ending in a peaceful transfer of power. If the people had fully carried out the five steps outlined by me in my 8th of August speechlibtech_160_footnotein the A.I.C.C. in Bombay, and had there been a perfect atmosphere of non-violence, the Government’s power and repression would have been sterilized and it would have been compelled to yield to the national demand.
 If under the impact of foreign invasion or some such. cause the ruling power abdicates and a vacuum is created, the people’s orga- nization will naturally take over its functions but such jatiya sarkar would have no other sanction except that of non-violence and service of the people to enforce its fiats. It will never use coercion. Even those who might hold contrary views will receive a full measure of security under it.
 As an instance of the infinitely greater efficacy of the non-violent technique as compared to the technique of coercion, he mentioned the case of Bardoli. In Midnapore whilst they succeeded in capturing a few symbols of power in the initial
 
 stages, they could not retain the fruits of their success. But in Bardoli the satyagrahis were able fully to retain the gains of their struggle.
 Moreover, you have seen that all your bravery could not prevent the violation of women. Now that is intolerable. No one should be able to cast an evil eye upon them. This requires inculcation of a higher form of bravery, i. e., that of non-violence which can hurl defiance at death and against which the power of the aggressor cannot prevail. This is what I am trying to do. It may take time. It takes a long time to infuse this kind of higher courage among the millions. Whether this kind of non violene will ever come into play or not I do not know. But you who have had training in non-violence for all these years ought to realize that in your hands non-violence should show all the brilliance that is inherent in it.
 They next wanted to know as to how they could start on the right lines. Gandhiji in reply prescribed to them the spinning-wheel as “the symbol and central sun of the 8-fold constructive programme”. It was the best way of achieving social solidarity and non-violent organization. The technique of non-violent action consisted in isolating and sterilizing the instruments of evil. Jatiya sarkar based on non-violence would not put Government servants under duress but would effectively isolate them so that they would either have to align themselves with the people or be reduced to the necessity of carrying out the foreign Government’s writ through undiluted barbarism of which they would soon sicken and tire. Even their relations and dear ones would desert them.
 This presupposes that no section among the people is labouring under a sense of injustice and wrong at the hands of the others. Untouchability, exploitation and communal rancour can  have  no place under a jatiya sarkar, or it will be like a house divided against itself which must fall.

Both of them are learned 	men and thinkers and are taking the utmost interest in constructive 	work. They are not men who would obstinately cling to their own 	ideas; they would go wherever the quest of truth leads them. Neither 	of them has    
 been impressed by tractors, nor very much by electrically operated flour mills. Since I myself am temperamentally cast in adifferent mould, I leave out myself. I asked Satis Babu to reduce his opinion to writing and am sending his note in the original. Annanda Babu has definite proofs in support of his view and he will collect them and prepare a note after the present tour is over. I will send it to you. I think that ultimately the gulf between the two opposite views will remain unbridged, and everything will depend on experience alone. Meanwhile, you should cling to the view which you hold so firmly and act on it. I have always acted on what I believe to be true and it seems but right that I should continue to do so. Keep on writing to me if there is anything which you feel might change my views.

 MAHISHADAL,
 December 27, 1945 If	we can conduct ourselves unitedly as we have done in maintaining the rhythm of the bhajan sung, then whatever injury is
inflicted on us and however wronged we may be as the result of the
 visitation of Nature or policy of the State, we will be the master of the situation and keep our head unbent. History provides many such instances.
 Proceeding, Gandhiji referred to the bhajan sung at the meeting and stated that  it would not distort the meaning of the song if in the place of ”temple” the word “liberation” was used.
 But, asked Gandhiji, what was exactly that liberation which the Poet in the song and they as well wanted to attain? Was it the liberation or salvation that came to man after his death or was it the liberation from all vestiges of bondage that a human being suffered under in this world ?
 The congregation, Gandhiji hoped, would agree with him that they all wanted the liberation from bondage in this world. If that was the hankering then they must appreciate the significance of a unitedly given rhythm.
 They were suffering under a bondage of foreign yoke and consequently they were anxious to be liberated therefrom. There might be, if not equally, strong powers or influences in their country which also were anxious to keep them down in bondage. They were anxious to get rid of all these bondages but,  added Gandhiji, the worst type  of bondage was that which enabled one to submit himself to any form of slavery.
 Man was a slave to may things— his property, his desires, They should seek deliverance from all these things. If they could press forward their claim for liberation from all these bondages in the same way as they did in maintaining the rhythm of the chorus of the bhajan, they would, he hoped, realize his message.
 When they kept rhythm by a movement of the hands, the feeling of such a movement came from within. In other words their hearts were attuned to the outside movements. That was exactly the thing prerequisite to the attainment of salvation.

  SODEPUR 	 (24 PARGANAS),  December 	28, 1945   CHI. 	KAKA,  	I can only dictate the reply to your letter. Just now I have to be 	content with what I can dictate or write after the morning prayer. I 	therefore do not think it necessary to stretch out the hand from 	under the quilt to write to you.  	I can think of only one thing regarding you, and that is, you should 	go on doing what I tell you—though you may make any suggestion you 	like. This is exactly what you say in your letter too. Even if your 	interpretation is the only correct one, I would say that it would be 	safer not to exercise the right which has been granted to you but to 	consult the committee. At any rate you will lose nothing  thereby, 	nor is such procedure likely to result in any delay, especially when 	you can consult them by correspondence.  	Let us forget the affair of the Vidyapith library, for I never think 	about it. And, in any case, what is the use of recalling it ?  	I see no need for you to resign from activities in Gujarat. The 	whole thing seems to be your imagination. Moreover, Amritlal takes 	interest in them. It was you who made him what he is. Without your 	support his interest would dry up. He is a straightforward and hard- 	working man. From among your discoveries, I consider him as the one 	who has proved his worth. So you can leave only after convinc- ing 	him fully. You have as good as left, since Amritlal will never do 	anything against your wishes.  	Thirdly, though you had intended Prof. Banhatti for B. B. Mandir and 	told him so, there will be no harm if you take him away for the 	Adhyapan Mandir. The latter needs his services for work  which is 	already in progress, whereas nothing is definite yet about B.  Mandir’s work.   	I did not like your falling ill. I see no need to work at such speed 	and expense of energy. Do what you can without overtaxing yourself. 	I can understand your desire that nothing should be over- looked 	through lethargy, but I am not at all ready to grant the neces- sity 	of working with speed. I remember in this connection the couplet: 	“To be impatient is to be confused and to be patient is to be 	self- possessed.” It is for you to know who the author is. 
 I experience supreme peace here even in the midst of meetings attended by thousands. This is a new sight altogether. I even believe that this is the result of the work we have been able to do in Sodepur. Moreover, the people no longer ask for speeches from me, but want prayer meetings. On one side we have this, on the other, I read in newspapers the reports of the goondaism that is going on. Who can say what the outcome of all this will be, or what God will do? Is it not enough that we should cheerfully shoulder the burden of the small tasks that fall to our lot ?
Let this suffice for today.

 Do you still have the ‘big’ monied patients or have they left? If they have stayed on, will they agree to be in the same line with the poor ?
 What did you do about the hospital fruniture? Did you get the pieces you wanted for your Bombay unit? Or shall I have to see to the matter myself? I know I shall have to put up with the monthly expenditure there. A number of questions have been raised in this connection; I shall remit the appropriate amount after I get a reply.
 I do not expect a large number of indoor patients moving in soon. I take it that those who have already applied to you will be the rich ones. There is no question of our admitting them at the moment. It will be a different matter if we admit them after the new norms are established and the rich agree to stay with the poor.
 Of course, I strongly feel that you should adapt yourself to the new pattern in full knowledge and faith.
 I hope Gulbai is fine. I expect it is now nearing time for her confinement.

 BHAI DADA,
 I have gone through your letter, also that of Gopalrao. After taking into consideration everything. I have  arrived  at  the  follow- ing decision: Because all your friends want it, you may seek election to the Assemby if it can be done without any exertion on your part and on the clear understanding that it will be a bed of thorns and not of velvet. If something good comes of it the credit will go to the electorate or to God. If nothing comes of it we lose nothing because,  if you remain outside it  will  be to serve truth and if you go in, it  will be also to serve truth. I understand what Vinoba says. I am giving this opinion knowing very well his views. Refrain from all arguments and discussions, observe silence, and if even then people elect you go to the Assembly, You should not make any effort on your part to get elected.
 I am not writting a separate letter to Gopalrao. This is meant for him also.

 I have your letter. I have gone through it and also discussed it. I shudder at the thought of your programme. You seem to have taken it for granted that I can keep running about if I live for another 49 years. But it is not so. I can live perhaps for 125 years if I stick to one place and work within my limits. I had agreed to give seven days to Assam, inclusive of the time taken by the journey to and fro. You have arranged for seven day’s programme in Assam itself. And two days will be spent in going and coming, which makes it nine days. How can I spare so many days? You will listen to everything and then
 decide whether my stay at two place will serve the purpose or not. If does not then forget about it."

  	It is my firm view that we should demand yarn for the khadi required 	by the Congress. It calls for tact and efficiency. Those who wear a 	uniform must learn to spin. The question implies that those wearing 	uniforms did not wear khadi and did not spin. Will they do so now? 	The presidents of the Congress committees will have to be patiently 	persuaded. It is they who want to destroy khadi, and they may if 	they can. By efficiency I mean we may provide yarn in cases where 	spinning cannot be started right now. I always have quite a large 	stock of yarn and I am willing to spare some.The only provision is 	that I will give yarn only to those who are willing to give it but 	are not able to do so immediately as they do not know spinning. But 	they should accept the condition that they will spin and do as 	required. And they should collect yarn for the khadi required in 	future. If we observe these rules faithfully we shall know whether 	khadi will bring us swaraj or will only remain a provider to the 	poor. You may send this letter to Vichitra if you want.

He explained to the teacher that the aims of 	Wardha scheme of education was not merely to teach the boys 	arithmetic and a few other things. The Wardha scheme of education, 	Gandhiji emphasized, moulded the life of man to a new form. Why 	should they sit with their face bent down? They should be taught to 	sit erect. Remember 	if they are properly reared up they will be the best  	soldiers of Hindustan. Why should the boys put on dirty dress after 	having undergone Wardha training for six months ?

 Mahatma Gandhi said that if it was necessary to use the plain red flag of the A.

182,"December 	28, 1945",SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING,"
          MAHISHADAL, 
  December 	28, 1945 Gandhiji 	stated that he had noticed that ordinary rules of business of an assembly were not 	observed. If one was to attend a meeting it was expected of him,  whether 	he liked the proceedings or not, that he should remain till the end. 	If this procedure was not followed and if he left abruptly while the 	meeting was going on he would only disturb others. He had been told 	by many women attending such meetings that they had only a limited 	time at their disposal for attending such functions because they had 	to attend to other household duties. Undoubtedly it was a strong 	argument in their favour but his reply to them would be that in such 	cases they should consider beforehand whether they had the time or 	not at their disposal to sit till the end of the meeting.  If 	they at all decided to attend the meeting they should be there till 	the meeting was dissolved. There are many who arrived at the meeting 	after it had commenced. In such a case the attendant should stay 	outside the assembly.  All 	these rules of 	conduct were applicable 	in respect 	of an ordinary 	assembly. But 	they are obligatory in case of prayer meetings.  Because at the  	prayer they wanted  to 	be in meditation. During 	such a time 	anything disturbing from 	outside was 	un- welcome. 	 He would particularly draw the attention of  the organizers of such 	meetings  to the 	observance of 	these general rules of 	conduct. They 	should circulate 	amongst the 	people before- hand 	these rules  for 	their observance.  If 	they could 	 train up 	people in 	this respect 	they would be 	rendering a 	public service and 	will be able 	to organize 	themselves better, advance the 	cause of 	public decorum and 	give new 	inspiration.    
 Referring to the charkha demonstration participated in by about 500 spinners, men and women, Gandhiji said that he noticed that there were two types of charkhas in use. The older one was the wheeled one and the latter was called the box-charkha. The latter was introduced by him and the reason for its introduction was that for the convenience of men like him who were regular spinners and had to travel, this type of box-charkha was suitable. But let them not forget, he said, the golden rule for charkha that its price should be cheap and be made from materials available in the particular locality. Crores of persons could not be expected to use one uniform type of charkha. Nor should its manufacture be limited to one central place. If they developed a central supply store of charkha how would it be possible for them to supply it to the 40 crores of people ?
 So far as the strength of the charkha was concerned he could assert that there was no other machine which was more powerful than it. To him the charkha was the symbol of swaraj, ahimsa and annapurna.
 Referring to the bhajan sung Gandhiji said that its composer maintained that it was through sufferings that a man could realize God. What was the method prescribed  for the realization of God was also true for the attainment of swaraj.
 There was no instance in the world to show that swaraj could be had without undergoing sufferings. Not only swaraj, they could not acquire even knowledge with- out undergoing hardships. If there was anything which was available to a man with- out undergoing hardships he could not fully prize or appreciate the same. Therefore,  if they had followed the bhajan of the day they should remember that for the sake of God they had to put up with all sufferings. As it was true that without suffering they could not realize God so was it equally true that without suffering they could not attain freedom. They should also remember that for the sake of swaraj whatever they had suffered had not been in vain. They had all paved the path towards their attaining swaraj.

            CHI. 	KANTI,       MAHISHADAL,  December 	29, 1945 
  	It is 6 a. m. just now. It is pitch dark all around. The prayer was 	over at 5. After the prayer, instead of returning to bed I read or 	heard letters and started writing. I thus reach your letter at 6 a. 	m.  	Chi. Shanti will get well. Every householder passes through such 	experiences, bitter, sweet, sweet and bitter. 
 I would like your doing whatever work relating to spinning comes to you unsought at home. If you have skill, proficiency, firm- ness of mind, purity of character, devotion to God and humility, then the work you do at home will be like the Ganga flowing by your door-step. I will regard such work done during student life as more than enough.
 If by fulfilling your family obligations and doing service to others while studying you have to take two years instead of one to complete your studies you need not feel unhappy at all. It would certainly be a matter of shame if studies were neglected from lethargy or love of pleasures. Those who believe that it is impossible to do public service during student life are mistaken. The student’s stage of life is also meant for increasing one’s capacity for service. If, there- fore, the immediate opportunity for service is neglected, the student’s life becomes as it generally is today, a selfish one instead of one dedicated to service. Moreover, present day education by and large is antagonistic to the spirit of service or patriotism. Add to this the burden of learning through English. And the subjects of study also include some which are unnece-ssary and exclude some which are essential, such as spinning. According to me, spinning, which means both its science and craft, should be introduced as  the  principal subject right from the earliest stage. But that is not done anywhere. Our boys, therefore, who study in Government institutions must determinedly make good this deficiency, as you have been doing. If that is not done, one would be guilty of the vanity of claiming perfection. You should not, therefore, in any circumstances abandon
 spinning and its science. Show and explain the whole of this letter to Saraswati. It will help her to understand and realize how much service, and nothing but service, is contained in spinning. If she is still not able to understand, let me know. I will try again to explain the point to her. Besides, you will also have received my previous letter written from Sodepur.
 I followed what you wrote about the politics there. You should remain detached and go on doing what you can.
 I could perhaps have revised the English of your report and sent it to you, but the news you had given in it was so good that I felt I must convey it to Jajuji and so sent on the report to him. I do not very much care if your English is not of the highest class. I am more interested in your being in the highest class as a human being and
 
 acquiring wide knowledge of Indian languages. I would, however, like it if at the same time you could also write grammatically correct and chaste English. That is why I dropped the hint in my letter.
 Here I have been enjoying the highest peace. Tomorrow I will go to Contai. The programme there, too, is for four days. I expect to return to Sodepur on January 3. From there I  will leave for Assam on the 8th and return to Sodepur again on the 16th. We are a large party but we experience no difficulty on that account.
 Address your reply to Sodepur. I shall probably reach Madras on the 23rd.

  December 	29, 1945  Gandhiji 	replied that he had been asked the same questionlibtech_176_footnotein 1920 and 1921 	and he could only repeat the reply which he gave then. The question 	betrayed ignorance of non-violence and also of swaraj of his 	conception. He did not want swaraj at the cost of women’s honour. 	If what passed as non-violence did not enable them to protect the 	honour of women or if it did not enable the women to protect their 	own honour, it was not non-violence. Believe 	me, it is something quite different.  And 	he described what he had written in Hind 	Swarajin 1909. 	Gandhiji obser- ved that experience had added force to the argument. After 	all who protected Sita from Ravana? The poet tells us that  	her purity was such that Ravana dared not compass his end without 	her consent.     
 He warned them in the end that if anybody came to him with the plea that they could not protect the honor of their womenfolk because they had taken the vow of non-violence, he would give them no quarter. Non-violence should never be used as a shield for cowardice. It was a weapon of the brave. He would rather they died fighting violently than became helpless witnesses to such atrocities. A truly non-violent man would never live to tell the tale of such atrocities. He would have laid down his life on the spot in non-violent resistance.

 "
189,"December 	29, 1945",SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING,"
          MAHISHADAL, 
  December 	29, 1945  Gandhiji 	paid a glowing tribute to the affection and painstaking care that 	the men and women volunteers who were in charge of the camp, had 	shown is looking after him and his party. Gandhiji congratulated the 	gathering on the exemplary silence and order which prevailed during 	the public prayers at Mahishadal. It had given him the deepest 	satisfaction. The peace of mind which he experienced there exceeded 	even what he had experienced in Sevagram or Sodepur.  Referring 	to the events in connection with the 1942 struggle, he said that as 	a result of all that he had heard and learnt during the last few 	days, he had come to the conclusion that whilst people had shown 	singular courage and endurance, they had also committed some 	mistakes, especially in their understanding of the principle of 	ahimsa. He added :  	Besides, there were some acts of high-handedness amongst our- 	selves. There must be some difference between a national organi- 	zation and alien rule. In our national organization there should  	not  be any differences amongst ourselves. I should go further today 	and say that those outsiders who lived near us should be made to 	realize that our organization was superior to the alien organization 	because we did not want violence. We wanted to carry on our work 	through non-vilence.libtech_177_footnote  Under 	a national 	government, even the 	opponents or 	those who 	held contrary views 	ought not to 	experience a 	feeling that 	the ideal had 	not been 	attained in Midnapore or, 	for that matter, in 	any part of 	India. It 	might even be 	said that it 	was a  tall order. 	But if 	he did not point 	out their 	faults or place 	the undiluted 	ideal before them, they could never hope to reach their ideal. Gandhiji continued :    
 If you do not do it, I won’t be able to do anything, even if I carry our claim throughout the world. I won’t succeed if I do not make these things clear to you. During my work for the last 60 years  it has been the practice with me that I do not praise those who work with me. I make their mistakes known to others and I think, by doing so, our mistakes would be rectified.libtech_178_footnote
 Gandhiji reiterated his conviction that India had lost nothing, but on the con- trary had gained in every way as a result of the adoption and practice of truth and non- violence during all these years. If they had not attained the goal which they had set before themselves, the fault lay not in truth and ahimsa, but in themselves.
 For instance, if they had fully imbibed the principle of ahimsa, they would be completely free from the feeling of discrimination against the votaries of religions other than their own and regard them and serve them all with equal love. It had pained him to learn that, in the Mahishadal area, Harijans were still not being admitted in the temples. He hoped they would completely rid themselves of the taint of untouchability. It would be a big advance in ahimsa.
 Referring to the song that had been sung, he pointed out that, in it, the devotee prays to God to purge him of the cowardice which springs from doubt, as well as the cowardice that results from fear of misfortunes. To harbour doubt is to insult God. To shrink from misfortune, is to run away from Him.  He, therefore, prays  for spiritual as well as physical courage, so that he might be completely  rid  of  all fear.

 CHI. CHHAGANLAL,
 I have your letter. About  me  you  must  be  getting  all  the  news from the papers. I hope there was no dejection underlying the statement that Prabhudas had had yet another daughter. If we really see no difference between a boy and a girl and if we do not, out of a false sense of attachment, consider a girl a liability there will be no cause either for dejection or for a feeling of being burdened with responsibility. It will be sufficient, if we bring her up, train her to think independently and become self-reliant an  teach  her,  in  case she wants to marry, the art of finding herself a mate and also help her, if she wants, in her search for one. Moreover, we shall, in addition, master the art of bringing up daughters and set an example for others
 to emulate.
 Pass this on to Prabhudas for his perusal. If possible Prabhudas and Amba should now practise continence. If they fail to practise it their capacity for service is going to be greatly limited.
 I am not surprised at Kashi’s lack of strength. Her weakness will persist because she continues to be ever so restless. Otherwise I know she can partly get over the cold weather by keeping herself warm. My suggestion to her to go to Bombay for the cold season did have flaws. All the same I did make the suggestion which she rejec- ted. I hope the cold has abated now.
 Rajkumari is in Hyderabad (Sind). She will be relieved from there on the 2nd.
I hope you yourself are well.

 Children should spin well. They must learn the processes pre- ceding and following spinning. Children should know and observe the rules of cleanliness. It is essential to keep the posture when sitting or standing. Truth and non-violence should come to them easily and naturally.

  	You have now really grown big. You too must aspire to live 125 years 	in the service of others, and strive towards that end.  	If Durga’s health is as good as you describe I shall say you have 	truly grown up. Sushi, I am sure, will be quite well.  	As for the wedding, in my opinion the longer it is put off the 	better it will be. I 	keep on hearing that you are grown in body as well as in

  	I have your letter. How can you afford to be cowardly? You should 	endure your fate. I can bear, even understand, your refusal to look 	upon Vajubhai as your husband. But he is a brother to you, is he 	not? And why need one fear one’s brother? How can you refuse to 	discuss the subject with him? He has committed no fault. If anyone 	is at fault, it is you. You do not want to abide by custom. I see no 	harm even in that. One who wishes to disregard custom must generally 	display great firmness of mind, purity of character and gentlness. 	Moreover, you aspire to rise even higher. You are resolved to have 	as husband no ordinary man but only God. Your stiffness does not 	become your noble resolve.You should, therefore welcome Vajubhai. 	Then alone can you uplift both him and yourself. I am glad, that you 	believe yourself to be still weak. You should, therefore, carefully 	observe the restraints which a weak person should. These restraints 	are only not to be alone with Vajubhai and not to touch him. It is 	no part of a sister’s duty to a brother to touch him freely. If 	she chances to touch him, she does not run away nor does the 	experience any passion because of it. But when a girl is weak, even 	touching one’s blood brother may sometimes have to be avoided. You 	will learn to look upon God as husband and be accepted in His large 	court only if you understand all these subtle distinctions. 	Otherwise you are bound to fall by the wayside like a mere pebble.  	Go to Vinoba when you can. There you will get affection and 	knowledge and your determination will grow firm.  	If you do not want, I will  not  send  you  the  letters  from 	Father or Vajubhai. But I would like  you  to  remain  unperturbed 	even after reading those letters. Yesterday we had a Bengali bhajan. 
 Daily in the evenings a  Bengali  bhajan  is  sung  here  and  that  is only proper.The first  line  of the  bhajan  was:  “Lord,  save  me from weakness even when I am assailed by doubts.” That destroy
 is, destroy every doubt in my mind. Your vow is a hard one. You have taken it of your own free will. You will not be  able  to  deep  it without God’s grace. I am dictating this letter with great care in the early morning in a boat, hoping that it may remove your igno-rance and strengthen you. There can be no peace except through absorption in service. You can show this letter to Vinoba. He will be able to explain my ideas better and if there is anything lacking he will make up for it.

  	Two of your letters came more or less at the same time—one of the 	24th addressed to me and the other of the 26th addressed to Sus- 	hilabehn. I am planning to reach there on January 23, 1946.

I do not remember having talked to Sitaramji. I did have some talk 	with Kamalnayanji. I shall try to talk to Sitaramji when I return to 	Sodepur.

Monday is obviously a silence day and on 	Thursday, Saturday, Sunday and Tuesday I observe silence at 9.

  	It is good that you have started hand-carding. Vinobaji’s new 	attempt is actually a very old thing. It can be perfected by 	practice. Somebody gave a demonstration at a public meeting. He 	separated the cotton from the seeds and pulled the cotton on all 	sides with his hands, made slivers from the same and started 	spinning. He did the spinning on the takli. His yarn was very 	neat. One woman had started spinning without separating the seeds 	from the cotton. But I do not value all these things much. I value 	Vinobaji’s experiment very much becase he says that he is doing it 	scientifically and from the point of view of social benefit. Hence, 	I would always be eager to know the results of the new experiment.  	I understand about Gitailibtech_179_footnotelibtech_180_footnoteand 	other things.  Just as Vinobaji has written about sleep to Balkobaji 	and made it into a beautiful article, he should also write about 	observing silence while walking and follow it in practice. I 	understand its significance, but even so I am not prac- tising it in 	this tour. I am caught by desire and temptation. But I know that if 	one wants to live up to 125 years, desire, etc., should necessarily 	be given up. I shall not write anything more about it today.  	I am glad that Kanamlibtech_181_footnotehas 	 gone  to  Paunar.   But   it  is  rather disconcerting that Vinoba 	should spare one hour for him.  	It is good that Balvantsinha has gone to Kharangana. Let him 	continue the same way. It will do him good. I also infer from this 	that Hoshiaribehn is doing well and she has completely regained her 	balance.  	I understand about Om Prakash. He must be provided sufficient money 	for travel. Vasumatibehn 	must be in good health.  	Shantabehn will be all right. It would be nice if Hoshiari, Kailas, 	Shanta and others wrote to me.     
 Let Chakrayya get himself trained there. Let him learn there. Everything is bound to be well if his mind and body are in good shape.
 We had elaborat recitations from Gita on Ba’s death datelibtech_182_footnote.   And we did spinning. Some outsiders also did spinning with us for an hour.
 I am not in the least interested in keeping that sadhu any more. I have realized too that my suggestion to keep him arose from unworthy attachment and temptation.

201,"December 	31, 1945",SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING,"
           CONTAI, 
  December 	31, 1945  Gandhiji 	congratulated the people of Contai on successfully rivalling other 	places in Bengal, where he had been of late, in maintaining 	exemplary discipline. He hoped that they would show the same spirit 	of discipline in the event of any other leader coming in their 	midst.  Gandhiji 	recalled how in 	1934, when he 	was touring 	in Orissa 	in connection 	with the 	Harijan programme, a 	German Nazi, Herr Buto, 	had requested 	to be allowed to accompany 	him on 	his tour. 	He professed 	himself to 	be an ardent admirer of 	Hitler. Having 	heard how Gandhiji’s 	method was 	exactly contrary to 	Hitler’s and 	how in 	South Africa 	he had 	led a successful 	struggle against General Smuts 	with only 	a handful 	of Indians 	and no 	other weapons 	than that of 	non-violence, he 	was curious 	to meet the author  of  that movement  and 	 study  his  method 	 at  close quarters. 	Gandhiji had granted 	him his request 	in the 	hope of 	converting him 	to non- 	violence, but 	when Herr Buto saw 	the undisciplined 	behaviour of Orissa 	 crowds,  he told Gandhiji that 	 he  could  now  	understand  how  a  handful  of  Britishers 	 in  India 	could keep a 	nation of 	400 millions 	in bondage. 	As a 	result of 	his experience, 	he had 	become sceptical of 	India ever winning 	freedom through non-violence. What 	India needed, he thought, 	was a Hitler. Gandhiji, however, had drawn a different moral from 	the same 	events. What 	India needed was 	discipline, no 	doubt, but 	not of the 	Hitlerite variety. It 	had to 	be of the non-violent 	type and, therefore, 	voluntary. His experience 	in Bengal 	during his present 	tour had confirmed 	him in 	his faith 	that the 	latter was infinitely 	superior to the 	former. If 	six and a 	quarter crores 	of Bengalis 	could show the 	same discipline which the 	present gathering had 	shown that evening, 	not even a thousand Hitlers would be able to deprive them of their freedom.  Commenting 	next on Gurudev’s 	song that had been 	sung, he observed 	that, in that 	song, a 	devotee pledges his 	soul to 	Truth and 	prays that 	Truth may 	always triumph. He 	prays further that Truth 	may give 	him strength 	so that 	neither misfortune nor 	fear of 	direct punishment may 	force him 	into untruth in 	thought, speech or 	action. For fulfilment 	of that 	pledge, he 	longs to 	lay down his life and 	all. If the 	song that  had 	been sung came really 	from their heart and not 	merely from their lips, 	it ought 	to transmute 	their entire life 	and they should see 	the sovereignty of 	Truth in their 	lifetime.  Referring 	next to repression, followed by the havoc caused by cyclone and 	floods through which the people of Midnapore had recently passed, he 	told them that all that had filled his soul with anguish. The song 	which they had just sung was surely a message for them in their 	present misfortunes too. 
 As regards the triple problem facing them, namely, shortage of food, shortage of clothing and lack of drinking water, he told them that it would be easily solved if they could throw off their inertia. It was no use waiting idly for Government help. They must show capacity to help themselves. He was afraid that, so far, they had not done all that they might have. If all the people of Contai and the neighbouring areas took to spinning in right earnest, they could solve the problem of cloth shortage. He observed that their success in that would be followed by amelioration in other respects too.
 Concluding, Gandhiji remarked that if the Government had recognized in their behaviour in 1942 the legitimate longing to be free and co-operated with them instead of trying to thwart them, the history of India would have been written differently. That was not to be. He, however, refused to shed a single tear over the past and wanted them to do likewise. The present was enough to claim their energy and attention, and that evening’s song indicated the spirit in which to approach the problem.

 You must flatly refuse to give any secret help. It would be altogether wrong. The fact will never remain secret. No one would or should accept such help openly. This whole thing needs to be care- fully considered. Such important decisions should not be taken in haste or through hope of gain. Never mind if we are defeated. Let the British give them Pakistan if they wish.

 I did send you a longish letter. I have asked S. to send you a copy. I have before me two letters from you. The one about Dharma- dev Shastri has been sent to Bapa. It would be a sad thing  if  he  proves untrue. But you know what havoc rumour works. Your long letter covers many points. I do not wonder at the bitter experience about Vaidyas. Many of them are impostors. You should write to Chandiprasad about the person sent by him. I do hope you will come upon a  good man. I  would  have  none  but a  proved man. That that man has proved a failure is bad and that the cow he brought has proved a burden is also bad.
 Then you do not get a good worker. How will you pull on? I do not know that all this does not point to retracing your steps or at least so ordering your life as to enable you to live there without anxiety or worry. I would advise you to have a servant or two to carry out your instructions and look after your pony and a cow if you must have one for giving you pure milk. I would even go without either and be content with the good milk you may buy there. You should move away to a cooler place in summer. This should be easy. Do not think of having a summer haunt for yourself. You must not use up the last penny and then feel compelled to come to Sevagram or go elsewhere as a failure which you will be if you have to give up your place after using the last pice. Do not regard this as a doleful picture. If it is unwarranted by facts as you see them, throw it away.
 About P. I must not say anything. I am prejudiced. I only hope that God will be your guide in this as in everything else. Only in the latter case I might offer helpful criticism.
 Of the atmosphere what you say is about right. But the things will shape themselves right. Anyway I am trying my best. Here I am daily witnessing a mighty change. I had this evening a meeting atten- ded by probably a lac of prople. I was able to have prayer in perfect silence. It would have done your soul good to witness such a scene. This commenced at Sodepur. My first meeting was somewhat boister- ous. As days went on things were changed. And yet I build nothing on this. Only this experience is a balancing factor.

About the samadhilibtech_196_footnotethe Aga Khan had sent a wire saying “Will Meet.” 	There has been no other communication. I understand his

 I am reaching Sodepur on the 3rd. On the 9th I leave for Assam, and shall be back to Sodepur most probably on the 18th. After that I shall be leaving for Madras on the 23rd. I have spared a maximum of two weeks for Madras. After spending a few days in Sevagram if you permit me I shall go to Poona. Otherwise I shall first go to Bardoli and then to Poona.

  	I have your letter.  Ramdaslibtech_201_footnotehas left.   It is as well.   But I now realize my 	mistake. Even though you yourself were willing I ought not to have 	put his burden on you. In the event of his not being taken care of 	or his not submitting to being taken care of the way he was, I 	should have had him taken back to Mysore or allowed him to stay in 	whatever position he was. Wouldn’t I have done the same to my own 	son? I should also have considered your unsuspecting nature. This I 	did not do and entrusted him to your care.  Dasappalibtech_202_footnotewas certainly at fault but it was my responsibility 	to rectify the mistake. Dasappa had pledged that he would leave 	Ramdas to my keeping. There is no         
 dearth of people making pledges, but those who keep them are rare. Well whatever was destined has happened; I am not going to entertain Ramdas any more.
 May your tour—and Kakasaheb’s—be a success, and may he keep up his health.
 I think you can manage the examination work in Wardha in addition to your work in Gujarat. Again, if Kakasaheb’s responsibility comes to be entrusted to you his blessings will give you the strength to cope with it too. All the same let me warn you that you must not do anything at the cost of your work in Gujarat, because if the work in Gujarat suffers I am certainly going to take you to  task  and Kakasaheb, too, will take you to task because you took up the Gujarat work in the nick of time and you have no right to let it break up.

BHAI VAIKUNTH,
 I have your letter. I accept most of your arguments. Aren’t you a dweller of  Vaikunthlibtech_203_footnote? Or are you its king? But whether you are a simple dweller in Vaikunth or its king or its gift, there is no doubt that you are a saviour at need. If, therefore, it is found nece-ssary that you should go in order to help them out of their difficulties, we shall think over the matter.
 My tour of Bengal and Assam will end on the 20th at the latest. After that I leave for Madras on the 23rs. There I will spend 15 days  at the most. After that I will go to Sevagram. We shall have, therefore, enough time to think over the matter. Offer your name as a candidate
 
 for the Assembly, on the condition, however, that you will not have to spend a single pie and will not have to go begging for votes. It may not perhaps be possible to apply this rule in all cases, but it should be applied in yours.

 I have your letter. It is straightforward. I do not want to dam- pen your interest. You have the aptitude for it. Nor would I consider your going into the Assembly a bad thing. After all someone has to go there. What I mean is that neither you nor anyone else can ride two horses at the same time. A similar case from Malabar has come to me.  In that also I have given the same opinion.  The ladylibtech_204_footnotelibtech_205_footnotein question is competent—perhaps as much as you are. Bapa is favourably inclined. But I have advised her that if she goes into the Assembly our work will certainly suffer because working for rural women is not a small thing at all. We have to respect the feelings of those women.  It is a drawback if they cannot go and live in villages but all of us suffer from that drawback. I am confi-dent that you are rural at heart. If that is true, in my view your place is at Wardha. It is surprising that you do not have anything more to give me. I have a vague impression that it has appeared in the news-papers. Even then I enclose a copy and should like you to send in your acceptance. If you cannot, then suggest the name of some other woman.

220,"January 	1, 1946",DISCUSSION WITH CONGRESS WORKERS,"
         January 	1, 1946 Gandhiji’s advice 	to ladies was that they could serve the country even by doing 	household duties. Generally, they hankered after making their 	daughters fit for  marriage 	and sons for earning. Such families could not be said to be serving 	the country. Married men and women could give much time for the 	service of the country even after looking after their children and 	doing household duties. Instead, they passed their days in enjoyment 	of life and thus ended the span of life. There were some who were so 	addicted to pleasure that they used contraceptives.  Asked 	how women 	whose husbands were imprisoned could serve the 	country, Gandhiji 	said that they should no 	doubt spin. But 	this might not 	be sufficient for 	their living. 	They should take to some 	means of earning 	money. They could still work for 	the country. 	Under no circumstances, 	Gandhiji emphasized, should women earn their 	livelihood by 	sacrificing their 	honesty and purity. 	Mahatmaji was 	faced with the 	problem of 	spending annually one 	crore and 	25 lakhs of 	rupees of 	the Kasturba Fund. 	Althouh he was 	trying hard to 	utilize the 	money in 	the best 	possible way still 	enough women 	workers could not be found.  Gandhiji 	advised women living in 	towns to 	serve the 	villages. He 	appealed to 	them to 	search their hearts 	whether they were really ready and 	then begin work when 	they found response in 	their hearts.  Addressing 	the students, he said that the question which was put to him was not 	new. How the students could serve Harijans should not have been 	asked so late. If 
 they were ready to serve the Harijan they could easily do it. They could go to villages, mix with the Harijan and educate them.
 As regards inter-dining and intercaste marriage, Gandhiji said that so far as he understood the mind of the Congress he knew there was no difference of opinion about inter-dining but he thought that so long as one could not think himself one of the Harijans the poison of untouchability could not be removed. If anybody was not prepared to marry a Harijan he found no occasion of giving his blessings to that marriage. The question of marrying a Harijan was not so difficult but the difficulty was only mental.
 Replying to the question whether girl students should have a separate organization, Gandhiji said although the life of men and women was not quite different so long a woman remained a woman there might be necessity for a separate organization for their work. In his Ashram men and women lived together and worked together, still there might be such necessity.
 Discussing the constructive programme, Gandhiji said  that besides  the charkha there were several other items in his fifteenfold programme and women could take to any of them as they liked. Women could take a large share in the freedom movement of the country as they always had done specially in Midnapore and other places of India during the Salt Satyagraha. So he thought that it was needless to question what share the women could take in national movement.
 As regards reorganization and rehabilitation schemelibtech_206_footnoteMahatmaji said that the people and workers should depend more on their own strength an endeavour than on the Government. Regarding the drainage problem he had talks with the Governor Mr.
 R. G. Casey and was trying to do whatever was possible in that respect.libtech_207_footnoteIf they could take up any item of work themselves and could fulfil it other things would follow.

  January 	1, 1946  Thousands 	of Hitlers 	would neither be able 	to win 	their hearts nor 	take away their freedom if six and a half crores of Bengalis lived peacefully, as they were beha-     
 ving at the prayer meeting, and carried out all instructions given to them.
 He was very happy during his present visit, because the people made no noise and remained quiet. He recalled his visit to Orissa some time ago when people gathered in large numbers and shouted and stopped his car. He was accompanied then by a Nazilibtech_208_footnotewho had arrived at Wardha from South Africa. This Nazi noticed the incidents and told Gandhiji that he did not like Gandhiji’s way of non-violence. Hitler’s method, he said, was the best, and if Gandhiji wanted peaceful swaraj he would not succeed.
 Referring to Midnapore’s sufferings, Gandhiji said that the area was still suffering. They had no cloth to wear, no food to eat and no water to drink. There were two ways of removing these sufferings, one by Government relief and the other through their own exertion. If they were to be fit for swaraj or wanted to get swaraj, it was their duty to solve these difficulties by their own exertion.
 Success in one effort brought them further strength and this strength would help them to succeed in other things. The Government of the country would come in their hands. He had no doubt about it.
 If troubles like those of the flood and famine days came, they should all stand together and face the danger.
 Gandhiji suggested that teachers, both in schools and colleges, should under- stand the real significance of mass prayer and teach it to students. There should be no compulsion in any case, and those students who wanted to join prayers willingly, might do so. There was a magnetic power in prayer. As magnet attracted iron, so would prayer attract all, especially students.libtech_209_footnote
 Gandhiji said that he was told that they came to hear his voice and not to join the prayer. If it was so then he would be very sorry. He wished that they understood the real significance of prayer and felt that through prayer one could get one’s desired things.

 MAIN CAMP: SODEPUR,

 January 2, 1946
 CHI. SHIVABHAI,
 Your letter is good. Instead of replying ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ to your questions, I think I shall be able to explain my point of view more clearly if I state my own ideas. If any institution has not become self- supporting on the lines suggested by me, the fact can be interpreted in two ways; either that the workers were not efficient enough, or that my calculations were erroneous. If any institution has not succeeded so far, I will begin to doubt only my calculations. But Probably you will be able to see that both these inferences are irrelevant.  I  have  advocated self-reliance in three matters: (1) for the workers in villages,
 (2) for basic education and (3) for institutions. In regard to the first, my view is that any individual or family who settles in a village must earn their subsistence by working in the village itself. For instance, the person may start some industry—that is, without entering into competition with anybody else engaged in a similar industry—or may join an existing industry. If the person becomes popular with the local population, the people themselves will meet his needs. In either case I will describe the worker as self-supporting. (2) As regards basic education, I am of the view that the rent of the school building, the teacher’s salary and the running expenses of the school should be met from the pupils’ labour during the seven years of their stay in school.  I am doubtful about including the expense incurred on the pupils’ food in the scheme of self-reliance. Third, any institution will be considered to be self-supporting if the people for whose benefit it is run provide its expenses. For instance, if the money for Indian Christian institutions comes from America, then the Indian Christians will have proved their incapacity. Those institutions must be supported by the local Christians. I think this should answer all your doubts. But the three rules. I have suggested should not be interpreted to mean that any activities which do not conform to them should be treated as useless and be wound up. I have thought deeply and long about our institutions and formulated a code on the basis of experience. We shall be able to render better service to the extent we are able to live up to it, and will not become a burden on others. I think it would be danger- ous to take the prevailing prices as the basis for any calculations. That
 is, if you produce cotton, foodgrains, vegetables, fruits and milk on your own land and consume them, need you concern yourself with their market price? I would exclude for the pre-sent the expenditure on cows, seed and bullocks. I think on the basis of this you will your- self be able to answer the questions you have raised. If you have any more questions yet to ask, you may do so.

 January 2, 1946
 Gandhiji, while taking the salute of the volunteers, asked whether they belon- ged to any permanent corps or were recruited temporarily. On being told that they were recruited on the occasion of his visit there, Gandhiji said that they should have a permanent volunteer corps for their own good and for the service of the people. The volunteers, he said, should be wedded to the cult of non-violence and should serve the people and not harass them.
 They should spin charkha regularly and know the rules of cleanliness. That means, Gandhiji emphasized, that if they found dirt anywhere they should try themselves to clean it. They should look at every human being with an eye of love and should do their best to alleviate the sufferings of the people. Their whole life should be dedicated to prayer and they should realize that prayer would instill a power in them which would enable them to face anything.
 Gandhiji put a number of questions to Sj. Sudhir Chandra Das, G.O.C. of volunteers and asked them why they did not have uniform dress. Knowing that their volunteer group was temporary and due to  shortage  of  time they could not have uniform dress, Gandhiji told them that volunteers must get such instructions so that wherever and whenever they were required they all must be in the same uniform.

229,"January 2, 1946",DISCUSSION WITH MIDNAPORE POLITICAL WORKERSlibtech_218_footnote,"
    
 CONTAI,
 January 2, 1946
GANDHI: How long would you take to learn it then ?libtech_219_footnote
 A WORKER: One year.
 G. Since Hindustani is one out of the 18 items included in the constructive programme and since the carrying out of all these items in their fulness is swaraj, how long at this rate would you take to attain swaraj?
 In independent India, continued Gandhiji, they would need to have a lingua franca which could be understood by everybody. He was an admirer of the English
 
 
 language, but it could never take the place of the national language. There was a saying in English to the effect that matter out of place was dirt. English had its place in international affairs. But he could not tolerate the introduction of English in our day-to-day business, in our domestic life. The lingua franca of India could only be Hindustani, i. e., the language written in Urdu and Devanagari scripts and so simple that it could be understood without any difficulty.
 The  workers  promised  that  they  would  all  learn  it  within  six  months. After that  Gandhiji  took  up  the  questions  which  had  been  submitted  to  him before the meeting.
 The first question invited suggestion as to how they could make a success of the constructive programme and how they could overcome the obstacle in their way.
 Replying, Gandhiji enumerated the various items of the constructive pro- gramme. The spinning-wheel, though he gave it the central place, must not be on the brain. There were 17 other items. Communal unity was one of them. Did they regard  all communities as one? Then they had to get rid of untouchability root and branch. Similarly, they must realize the importance and place of the mother tongue. Their mother tongue alone could be the language for the domestic affairs and day-to-day business. He was in his 77th year and yet he had set his heart on learning Bengali. He hoped to learn to read Bengali before he left Midnapore. Nothing would give him greater pleasure than to be able to talk to them in Bengali. He could hope to touch their hearts through Bengali, never through English.
 Then there were the Adivasis (called Aboriginals). The 1935 Act had separated them from the rest of the inhabitants of India and had placed the “excluded areas” under the Governor’s direct administration. It was a shame that they had allowed them   to be treated like that. It was up to them to make the Adivasis feel one with them. The other items were prohibition, village industries, basic education, adult education, women’s education in health and hygiene, economic equality, kisans, labour,  students, and village sanitation. The last was most important and at the same time most difficult. He almost despaired of our people ever observing the  rules  of sanitation voluntarily when he saw the riverside fouled without hesitation even by those who should know better. He continued :
 The execution of the constructive programme in its entirety means more than swaraj. It means Ramarajya, Khudai Sultanat or the divine kingdom. I am thirsting after such Ramarajya. My God does not reside up above. He has to be realized on earth. He is here, within you, within me. He is omnipotent and omnipresent. You need not think of the world beyond. If we can do our duty here, the ‘beyond’ will take care of itself. This necessarily includes political indepen- dence.
 Such independence could only be achieved through non-violence and truth exemplified in constructive work. The Working Committee had realized the
 importance of constructive work. Even Subhas Babu would admit his (the speaker’s) thesis. He did not believe that Subhas Babu was deadlibtech_220_footnote. His feeling was that he was hiding somewhere and would appear at the right moment. He admired his courage and patriotism. But he differed from him with regard to the means. He was convinced that real freedom, freedom for the man in the street, could never be achieved through armed revolt.
 For him, the parliamentary programme was only a means of promoting constructive work. The Congress had adopted it because they did not want self-seekers and enemies of India’s freedom to go to the lgislatures and hinder the struggle for freedom. He would feel happy if they sent patriotic scaveners to the legislatures. Their real job would be to keep the undesirables out.
 If India won its freedom through truth and non-violence she would not only point the way to all the exploited Asiatic nations, she would become a torch-bearer for the Negro races that inhabit the vast continent of Africa, and even to Europe. The smaller nationalities lived in fear of losing their freedom. In fact they had no freedom. India’s independence through any other means could never have that result.
 He had heard harrowing tales of what the women of Midnapore had suffered. The shame was not theirs but the menfolk’s. God would take them to task for having been helpless witnesses to those atrocities. The only atonement they could make was whole-hearted execution of the constructive programme.
 Another friend asked him what he thought of the class struggle which was ineitable in labour work.
 Gandhiji’s reply was that class struggle there had been always. It could be ended if the capitalists voluntarily renounced their role and became all labourers. The other way was to realize that labour was real capital, in fact the maker of capital. What the two hands of the labourer could achieve the capitalist would never get with all his gold and silver. Could anyone live on gold? But labour had to be made conscious of its strength. It had to have in one hand truth and in the other non-violence, and it would be invincible. Labour and capital, classes and masses, are as old as the hills. The whole trouble arises from the fact that neither labour nor those who are guiding the labour movement realize the dignity and strength of labour. It is like the lame leading the blind.
 Gandhiji was asked about Karl Marx. He got the opportunity and privilege of reading Capital, he told them, whilst he was in detention. He entertained high regard for his great industry and acumen. But he could not believe in his conclusions. He had no faith in violence being able to usher in non-violence. World thought was moving and was outdating Karl Marx. That, however, did not detract from the merit of the
 great man’s labours.
 Gandhiji concluded by saying that non-co-operation and civil disobedience in terms of swaraj were not to be thought of without substantial constructive effort. Either without the latter will be body without soul, as good as dead.

230,"January 2, 1946",SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING,"
    
 CONTAI,
 January 2, 1946 Summing up his experience of prayer gathering in Contai and elsewhere in Bengal, Gandhiji said that he had been noticing phenomenal changes in behaviour of
 crowds taking place before his very eyes. He was not surprised at it. Bengal had given birth to that prince of devotees, Chaitanya, and a host of other God-intoxicated saints. He longed for the day when the example of the crowds would be taken up by the whole of India.
 He had felt overwhelmed by the consideration that had been shown to him, by ensuring him as much peace and quiet as was humanly possible, and the way in which he had resolved to repay his debt of gratitude was by devoting every moment of leisure accruing therefrom to learning Bengali. He had been doing that ever since he came to Bengal most systematically. In Contai he hoped that the love for all Indian languages which that resolve symbolized, would fill them too.
 Before coming to the meeting he had been told that carcasses of about 700 cattle and 300 human beings, out of many more which had perished in a cyclone, lay buried indiscriminately together where the prayer gathering was held. Dust had returned to dust, and there was no mark to tell the tale, as Gurudev had observed in one  of his songs. God mercifully hides man’s tragedy on earth under a mantle of greenery. Nevertheless, it betrayed lack of human feeling on the part of those who were responsible for it. The common practice was to give to each dead body a separate burial and the ground in which the burial took place became consecrated ground. This was where cremation was not in vogue. While, therefore, he respected sentiment, he did not make a fetish of it and he even derived satisfaction from the fact that common calamity had united men and cattle in death, thereby symbolizing the essential unity of all life. Thought of it ought to humble man’s pride and bring home to him the insignificance of human existence with its illusions, whichlibtech_221_footnotelibtech_222_footnoteheld him a prisoner in
 
 their net till man had learned to break through this net of illusions and make the fulfilment of one’s dharma the pole star in life’s pilgrimage.
 Explaining the significance of prayer Gandhiji told them that it ought to result in self-purification and it ought to transmute their entire conduct. If anybody thought that it gave him licence to do as he liked during the rest of the day, he deceived himself and others. That was a travesty of the true meaning of prayer.
 Commenting on the song that had been sung at prayer, Gandhiji said that in it the devotee prayed to God that he might be able to see Him face to face. Through single obeisance it betokened an indefinable strength of faith in man. With such faith nothing in the world would be impossible of attainment. Faith in God to be real, however, had to find expression in work. In his opinion the eighteenfold constructive programme which he had placed before the country was prayer through work since it was based on the principles of truth and ahimsa. If they fulfilled that programme in its fulness not only would they be free, but their example would serve as a beacon light to all the oppressed and exploited people of the earth.

 BHAI VALLABHBHAI,
I got your note. I have telegraphed as follows :
 “Leaving Bengal 20th and Madras about February 8. Very anxious to go Poona before Bardoli. Will middle March be suitable Bardoli ?”
 The Bengal programme is not exceeding the limits I had set. According to me much work has been done here. The result is in the hands of God. I am dictating this letter in a boat. I shall reach Sode- pur this evening. This letter will be posted from there tomorrow morning. I have to go to Assam on the 8th after four days in Sode- pur. The Assam tour, including travelling, will take eight days. I shall then to go Sodepur and thence to Madras on the 23rd. I must reach Madras on that date at the latest. We must, therefore, leave Sodepur on the 21st. In the wire I have mentioned 20th.
 I suppose I shall  meet  the  peoplelibtech_223_footnotefrom  Britain  in  Bombay, Poona or Wardha. It would be unseemly to speak disparagingly of them. There would be no harm whatever if we use kind words. There are some good men among them also. I do not see much point in condemning them in advance.
 You will have received my previous letter. After I take charge of the work in Poona, I must give some time there. I have therefore suggested the middle of March for my Bardoli visit. But I shall be guided by your wishes in the matter. I presume that you will definitely not keep me in Bardoli for more than 15 days. You may even release me from the promise to go there. There is also the possibility that you yourself will be engrossed in the Congress affairs. I take it that you will call me to Bardoli only if my presence there is necessary. This is just to let you know how my mind is working. The final decision must be yours. After all you are the Sardar. Are you not? That too of Bardoli. And now of India.

 I got your letter of December 30, 1945, on January 3, 1946, at Contai. I read it in the boat and am dictating this reply, too, in the boat. I understand what you say regarding khadi. If I can know how much will be available there, I can think and decide immediately. I am going to supply as much as is needed.libtech_224_footnote
 I can understand the Doctor [Dinshaw] not being satisfied with my reply. But I am helpless.
 I will try to return as early as I can. I will arrange about the Bank account. I will arrange for the transfer of the money, too, as soon as I reach Calcutta.
 We should certainly admit all patients who will mix with the poor. Nobody can be given a special room merely because he is rich. Will the patients who wish to be admitted be paying ones? If there are any, apart from our own people, who can mix with the others and observe the rules, I will not object to their being admitted.
 The equipment at Sinhagadh has been covered by the Trust and I, therefore, believe that we can use it for our purpose and transfer any item from there.
If the Doctor thinks otherwise, I should like to know his point of
view.
We have no intention of starting any other centre outside Poona
in the immediate future. I will write to Vanamala.
 Kanchan is with me in this very boat. She has got a slight cold but is in fine spirits.

Courtesy: Pyarelal         SODEPUR,  January 	4, 1946  Gandhiji 	said that he had 	come back in 	their midst after some 	time. He would again 	go out 	to Assam 	on the 	8th. The prayer would be 	held here till January 	7. He 	did not know if he would be able to hold prayer here again on his return from Assam.  He 	had been on a pilgrimage to Midnapore. The tour was so peaceful, the 	orderliness was so impressive, that they were unique. He had been to 	three or four places: Diamond Harbour, Mahishadal, Kakra and Contai. 	In each of these places the orderliness of the people was 	praiseworthy. At prayer-time the gathering went up to about a lakh 	of people. Many people came from long distances. Every one of them 	was quite  peaceful and none disturbed the orderliness. From Diamond 	Harbour he witnessed this orderliness.  Gandhiji 	said that Ramanama was so attractive that it could absorb man’s 	whole thought and self into it. That was why he had asked them to 	clap their hands  
 rhythmically when taking Ramanama. As they went on clapping their hands they got absorbed in the prayer. They knew soldiers were so trained that they were disciplined and learnt to work together. Discipline being the most essential thing, there was an English saying—‘disciplined soldier’.
 They were also soldiers of freedom. Soldiers of a State received salary and they maintained discipline. Soldiers of freedom did not get such payment; but they acquired strength by maintaining discipline. In the words of Badshah Khanlibtech_233_footnote, they were all Khudai Khidmatgars or servants of God. They were to maintain discipline and that was why he had introduced the practice of clapping hands while praying.
 Explaining the bhajan sung at the prayer Gandhiji said it was very sweet. The Poet—Rabindranath—said that if nobody responded to their call they must not despair but continue to work for their ideal. Even if failures met them they must not be broken. They should go on working irrespective of whether their hopes and aspirations were realized or not. One who was devoted to God did not feel despair; he went on knocking at heaven’s door for entrance to the kingdom of God.
 Swaraj had not yet come, but he had not given up hope. They must keep on knocking and one day swaraj was bound to come.

  	I have remitted Rs. 10,000 to you yesterday. With this amount open 	an account in the name of the Trust in any bank you like and issue 	the cheques yourself, because I have remitted the amount to you as 	Trustee and Director. I hastened with the money because I under- 	stood you had no funds left with you. I am sorry I was under the im-     
 pression that you usually had a large balance lying with you and, indeed, an important account such as yours ought to have such a balance. Had I known that the account hardly ever had a balance I would have arranged for an amount before leaving Poona—but let it be.
 I have a letter from Gulbai, which has alarmed me. She is un- happy. Do not cause her unhappiness. It seems she is hesitant about getting Ardeshir vaccinated whereas you seem to be insisting on it. I don’t have any faith in vaccination. I am writing to Gulbai accor- dingly. If I were in your place I would respect Gulbai’s wishes. After all a mother has a stronger claim over the children. Once the seed is planted the man’s job is over. It is the mother who carries the child for nine months and then suckles it while it grows. But that is not what pains Gulbai; it is your behaviour that pains her. We had already had a little talk on the subject. Please talk to her patiently and explain things to her.
 You appear to be squeamish. I would still suggest that you draw a salary from the Trust. I am aware that the Deed does not provide for this, but the three Trustees can agree to make the necessary change. You may take up some other occupation if you like. A man’s first duty is to be honest with himself and to be truthful. One who does not do this is no good for anything. He turns into a hypocrite or cheat. You made up your mind to go by my advice. Understand the signi- ficance of this. Anyone who decides to defer to another either sees the point of what he is told or accepts the advice on faith. Such faith, again, proves more productive than understanding. And when it does not, the person is ill at ease. May you never come to such a pass. I don’t want you to lose your fire. I shall be satisfied only if you rise higher and higher as a result of my contact.
 On further reflection I think I had better send you Gulbai’s letter so that you can understand her feelings and know what pains her. Be calm and patient with her.
 I shall reach there by the evening of 21st February, or on the 23rd, because 22nd is Ba’s anniversary and I should observe it at a fixed place. This cannot be done on a train where it would be diffi- cult to read the whole of the Gita.
 It appears Chi. Sushila Gandhi has written to you. Have you not replied to her? If not, please write to her. She is now in Delhi at Devdas’s. She does not seem to have benefited [by your treatment].
 
 What could be the trouble with her? Was she administered thyroid extract? I have forgotten all.

251,"January 	5, 1946",LETTER TO GULBAI D. MEHTA,"
    
 SODEPUR,
     CHI. 	GULBAI,  January 	5, 1946 
  	I have your letter. I was thinking of writing a third letter when 	yesterday I got your letter. I certainly have no faith in 	vaccination. My views have not changed. They are firm. Therefore if 	I had my way I would not have Chi. Ardeshir vaccinated. I would risk 	an attack of smallpox. But I know Dinshaw believes in vaccination. 	His views on nature cure differ considerably from mine. I cling to 	him in  spite  of this knowledge for I regard him as a man of truth. 	In the case of a man of truth either I accomodate him or he accommo- 	dates me. There is no trace of obstinacy in me. Firmness I certainly 	have, as I should have. A man devoid of this quality can never cling 	to truth. He does not worry about the risks that confront him 	because a satya- grahi has faith only in God. Therefore do what you 	think right about vaccination after mutual consultation.  	I have sent your letter to Dinshaw because it is a nice letter 	worthy of you. Dinshaw however should know that it expresses your 	pain. I hope I did not do wrong in passing on the letter to him. When 	is your confinement due ?  	Please don’t worry about the nursing-home. It is for me to think 	about the expenses. Only yesterday I sent a sum for the expen- ses. 	According to my reckoning, it will not be necessary for us to keep 	the account we maintain for the poor going for long.  	I see no need for Maji to move into the house which Balkrishna used 	to occupy. She may continue to live where she is or wherever she 	wants to till my return. I would suggest that Maji should live in 	the quarters that I used to occupy. When I return you may put me up 	there if you like. Since the party accompanying me will camp in 	tents the arrangement will cause you no inconvenience. In this way 	the 
 room that you allot to me, with attached bath-room and the adjacent room will suffice for me. Let us see when Dinshaw comes by any new income. It is desirable that he does not go in for any fresh expen- diture. I would be far from pleased if he accepted defeat for one reason or another.
I hope you and Ardeshir are well.

  	I got your postcard. Why in English? I shall not be going to 	Dhanbad.  Yours,  M. K. GANDHI  From 	a copy of the Hindi: Pyarelal Papers. Courtesy: Pyarelal         January 	5, 1946 After 	enumerating the various items of the 18-fold constructive programme 	as mentioned in the revised and enlarged edition of his brochurelibtech_243_footnoteConstructive  Programme, 	Its Meaning and Place, 	a copy of which had come into his hands only on the day before, he 	asked them to take note of the fact that the charkha and khaddar was 	only one—though by no means the least important—out of the 18 	items in that programme.  Civil 	disobedience had been mentioned at the end of the 18 items. It had a 	place there since the theme of the brochure was the constructive 	programme not merely as an economic activity but as a means of the 	attainment of swaraj.  Civil 	disobedience was 	of two 	types, individual 	and mass. 	Individual civil 	disobedience was 	everybody’s inherent 	right like the right 	of self- 	defence in normal 	life. No special 	sanction was 	needed for the practice of this 	kind of civil 	disobendience. Just as a man in normal life would use his dagger, revolver or even     
 fisticuffs to foil a sudden attack, even so civil disobedience would be resorted to by the constructive worker as a non-violent equivalent to the use of fisticuffs or arms. It did not need sanction or permission from anybody. As an illustration of how civil disobedience could be used to overcome Government’s opposition to constructive work he took up the hypothetical case of a worker engaged in the service of the Adivasis. If the Government prevented him from going among them he would simply disobey the order. The Government might put him in prison, he would wel- come it. It would be a most auspicious beginning for his work. The very fact that he had gone to prison in order to serve the Adivasis would enshrine him in their hearts.
 Mass civil disobedience was for the attainment of independence. For if the fulfilment of the constructive programme almost in its entirety was an indispensable preliminary condition. The ‘Quit India’ resolution of August 1942 might be cited as an exception to this dictum, he remarked. His reply was that it was justified by exceptional circumstances into which, however, he did not propose to take them at present. Moreover, the movement had never been started.
 Gandhiji then took up the first two items from the constructive programme and showed how they helped the struggle for independence. The first was communal unity. If they could achieve true heart unity among all the communities, not as a political expedient to be cast aside when its purpose was served or as a token of their common dislike of the third party, no  power  on  earth  would  be  able  to  sow  division amongst them as at present. And even a child would understand that an India united would be an India free. The same held true in regard to the removal of untouchability.libtech_244_footnote
 In the course of his remarks Gandhiji referred to the report of Sarat Babu’s recent speechlibtech_245_footnotewhich was to the effect that since with Gandhiji he believed in non- violence of the strong—not of the weak, he felt that military training was necessary to inculcate the spirit of discipline, without which true non-violence could not be practised.	Commenting upon it, Gandhiji  said  that  he  did  not  know  whether  Sarat Baba had been correctly reported or not. He himself had often suffered from bad  reporting.	But the statement as it appeared lent itself to an ambiguous interpretation.
 It was only a half truth to say that military training was an aid  to  the  practice of non-violence. The statement was true if by military training was meant inculcation of perfect discipline, but if by military training was meant training also in the use of arms and the art of killing it could have no place in his (Gandhiji’s) programme of non-violence.
 
 He Himself had been advocating the necessity of non-violent discipline in his prayer meetings and had even been trying to impart it to the people wherever he went. He considered this kind of discipline to be superior to what was known as military discipline inasmuch as the latter was enforced by penalties while the disci- pline of non-violence was absolutely voluntary and called for the strength to face death without killing.
 If he found that his views were opposed to Sarat Babu’s views and he people of Bengal asked him as to which of the two sets of views they should follow, he would unhesitatingly tell them to follow Sarat Babu’s views and discard his, since Sarat Babu was the leader of Bengal and not he. But in the present case he felt sure that there was no difference between their views as Sarat Babu had himself told him in the course of his recent talks with him that in the matter of non-violence he wantd to go the whole hog with him. Therefore, he was of opinion that Sarat Babu’s advocacy of military training held good only in the context of non-violence. In no other sense was it compatible with the Congress faith much less with non-violence as he (Gandhiji) understood it.
 Gandhiji then proceeded to answer questions :
 Q. You have asked the charkha workers to keep themselves detached from the political work of the Congress. From experience the questioner finds that such centres fail to make the people conscious fighters for swaraj. On the other hand, other centres, where workers have been working in double  functions—both  as charkha as well as Congress workers—give a better account of themselves during civil disobedience. So please make your directions in this respect clear.
GANDHIJI: It is a good question but it betrays want of clear
 thinking. All I have said is that a khadi worker will not be able to do full justice to his work if he has too many irons in the fire. Khadi work demands one’s undivided attention. But that does not mean that it should be done mechanically. No khadi worker can afford to be indifferent to other things with which khadi is interrelated or lose sight of its correlation to the struggle for independence. Experience has shown that wherever intensive charkha work had been done the people had shown greater grit, unity and capacity for organization in the struggle for independence.
 Q. You have often repeated that charkha without its full implications means nothing. Supposing we do not associate the charkha with political work, then, how will people understand its full implications ?
G.	‘Full   implications’does   include   political    work,   but	it
 includes many more things. The charkha has an undoubted value as a means for providing economic relief to the masses but as I have so
 often reiterated, khadi activity, stripped of its significance in terms of India’s independence means nothing to me today.  At the same time  if you take up charkha work merely for gaining political ends, it will defeat its purpose and you will make a mess of it in the political as in the economic sense.
 To say that unless we associate charkha work with Political work it will have no political value, betrays a thorough ignorance of the non-violent technique. Let me take ‘service of the lepers’ which is another item in the 18-fold constructive programme. Surely, it cannot be associated with any kind of political work in the accepted sense. Yet it would be absurd to say that it has no value in terms of swaraj. Under the non-violent technique every real service renderd,  every right act performed does bring the country nearer to the goal of political indepedence though in itself it may not have any direct political significance.
 If you were to tell me that you have lost faith in non-violence as a means for the attainment of swaraj, I would agree that the charkha or constructive work have no use for you. Nor would you have any use for me in that event. But since you have discarded faith neither in ahimsa nor in me, your indifference to charkha and constructive work is a sign only of your laziness and inertia. It is my conviction that the phennome-nal awakening that has taken place in India during the last 25 years is entirely due to the adoption of non-violence and the charkha as its symbol.
 To the extent to which we have neglected the charkha and cons- tructive work we have failed in the attainment of our goal.
 Q. On December 23, you have advisedlibtech_246_footnoteHindu workers  to  offer  selfless  service to the Muslim masses, for it will tell in the end. That might be termed a long- term policy. Should we then do nothing political among the Muslim masses? Apart from its effect on the Muslims, is not the policy of non-interference and political aloofness likely to engender in the non-Muslims a new attitude of exclusiveness towards the Muslims and thus serve the ver purpose of those who are trying to divide the nation ?
 G.  With due deference to the framer of  the  question  let  me say that I fail to understand it. If millions of Hindus regarded non- Hindus as their blood-brothers and sisters and treated them as such without the slightest tinge of a political motive, it must result in
 the complete political unity of India. Is it a ‘long-term’ effect? The
 
 
 framer of the question does not seem to know how ahimsa works. What I have deprecated in the present poisoned state of our communal relations is the attempt on the part of Congressmen to draw non- Hindus into the Congress fold, as it would only accentuate the existing mistrust. But supposing I make friends with Badshah Khan how does  it widen the gulf between the communities? On the contrary, it imme- diately eases communal tension to that extent. Multiply this picture a millionfold and it will be seen that the difficulty posed in the question is altogether chimerical.

 Why do you write ‘people’libtech_247_footnote?   ‘Peoples’ means ‘nations’.   Are we ‘nations’? And if we are, how many nations are we? And where? Great Britain had one people, but Europe has many peoples with their own different countries. Is such the case with India ?

Courtesy: Pyarelal         January 	6, 1946  Meeting 	Gandhiji on the 	second day 	of the 	conferencelibtech_250_footnotethe Bengal 	workers found 	in him 	a hard customer. 	Instead of waiting 	fot them to put question 	he  anticipated them by 	asking them whether they 	knew Hindustani. As only 	about half the 	number raised their hands 	in reply, 	he inquired 	as to how 	long they would require 	to learn Hindustani. Some replied: “One Year.” Gandhiji commented : No 	good, Contai people did not require more than six  monthslibtech_251_footnotelibtech_252_footnote.  	“All 	right then, six months,” shouted a few voices. But Gandhiji 	twitted them for doing no better than the countryfolk of Contai in 	the matter of learning the national language. Calcutta should do 	better. Someone from the gathering objected that they were not all 	Calcutta folk. But the objector’s voice was drowned in a chorus 	from the rest who shouted “three months”. [Gandhiji said :] That 	is good, but say “six months” all in chorus and endorse the 	same by raising your right hand in affirmation.       
 A forest of hands rose in reply. But Gandhiji’s keen eye detected a lacuna.
 I notice that the women workers are hesitating. Is Azad libtech_253_footnote Hindustan then going to be for men only and are women for ever to be in Zenanistan? If not, you should all shout out, “sub” (“all”) in one voice.
 There was a deafening chorus of “sub, sub” in reply. Gandhiji was pleased . . .  he told them it was up to them to see that they kept it. There were ample facilities in Calcutta for learning Hindustani and they should avail themselves of it.
 Another friend asked whether by learning Hindustani was meant ability to understand Hindustani or whether it included the ability to read and write Hindustani  as well.  This gave Gandhiji the opportunity to  emphssize the importance of learning  to read and write both the Nagari and the Urdu scripts, if they wanted to maintain direct touch with all the sections of the people in the country.  Even Hindus in north, let along Muslims, did not know the Nagari script. In support of his argument he mentioned the instances of the late Lala Lajpat Rai, the Lion of the Punjab, Pandit Ajodhyanath, who was one of the founders of the Congress and Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru, none of whom knew the Nagari script. The Urdu script was not difficult to learn. Anyway he was not prepared to hear objections on the score of difficulty from intellectual Bengal.
 Gandhiji’s attention was next drawn to a Press cutting purporting to give a restatement of his views on the utility of the parliamentary programme in relation to constructive work. The reference was to a recent writing of his in Hindustani in Khadi Jagat. “What attitude should a wholetime constructive worker maintain towards the parliamentary programme? Can the will of the people be really represented by a legislature under present conditions in India? If the conditions are adverse, i. e., if  the Government is hostile, should Congressmen continue to function in  the legislatures and what help can they advance under the circumstances to the cause of constructive work ?”
 Gandhiji, replying, said that he had advocated the boycott of the legislatures as a part of the fourfold non-co-operation programme. He still held the view that if that programme had been given effect to in full, India would have got swaraj. But the country as a whole was not prepared fot it. There was a considerable section in the country that wanted to use parliamentary talent in the service of the country. No one should prevent them from serving the country in their own way.   As a practial idealist   he had therefore reconciled himself to Congressmen capturing the legislatures and other elective bodies, if only to prevent self-seekers and enemies of India’s freedom from getting there.
 
 He repeated what he had said at Contai, that  nothing  would  please  him  better than that ideal scavengers  should  be  returned  to  legislatures  to   represent the Congress there.  He himself claimed   to   be   scavenger   No.   1 of  India.	His ideal scavenger would not be an ignorant puppet but a man with sturdy common sense and capacity to think and decide upon the problems of the day.   He would   be an educated person though he might not know English. He could not see why such a one should not be President of the  Congress.	The positive function of those who went to the legislatures would be to promote constructive work. He, however, warned  them  that  mere  parliamentary  work  would  not  bring  them swaraj.  That would come only as a result of their work outside among the masses.   A wholetime constructive worker would not  be  able  to  take  up  parliamentary activity  without  detriment   to   his  own  work.	But those who  were  not  giving all their time to constructive work might enter  the  legislature  if   people   wanted it, provided however that it did not lead to rivalries among workers and they had  not to enter into any expenditure in order to be elected.
 Q. In many portions of Bengal, the cultivators are Muslims and the proprie- tors Hindus. Recently in some places the Muslim tillers have refused to till the land under Hindu owners. What should the Hindu owners do under the circumstances ?
 Gandhiji, replying, said that the views he was going to express were strictly his own. As they all knew, he was not even a four-anna Congress member and therefore he could not speak as a Congressman. He spoke only in his personal capacity as a satyagrahi.
 Although the question had been posed in a communal setting the real cleavage as he saw it was not communal but economic. In Bengal the cultivators might be Muslim and the properietors Hindu. But in Andhra both  the  cultivators and proprietors were Hindus and yet the same conflict was in evidence in some parts.
 His views, continued Gandhiji, on the ownership of land were well known. The only rightful owner of the land was he who tilled it. The present properietors were morally entitled to hold land only if they became trustees for it. If the cultivators of the fields of a proprietor, who had become a trustee, refused to till the land for him, he would not sue them or seek otherwise to coerce them. He would leave them alone and try to earn his livelihood independently by his honest industry. If he has been discharging his function as a trustee honestly, they would come to him before long in contrition and seek his guidance and help. For, he would use his privilege not to fill his pockets by the exploitation of the labourers but teach the letter co-operation and organization so as to increase their produce and generally ameliorate their conditons. This would mean that the proprietor must himself become  a cultivator par excellence. A propeietor who regarded his property merely as a means  of satisfying his lusts was not its owner but its slave. The proprietors of land in
 Bengal had therefore only to adopt his ideal of trusteeship and their troubles would end.
 Q. Would the trustee’s  property  be  passed  on  to  his  children  by  in- heritance ?
G.	A proprietor who holds his property as a trust will not pass it
 on to his children in inheritance unless the letter in their turn become trustees and make good their claim as such. If they are not prepared for it, he should create a trust of his property. It is demoralizing for an able-bodies young man to live like a parasite on unearned income. A father should inculcate in his children the appreciation of the dignity of labour and teach them to earn their bread by their honest industry. As regards the monied people all I can say from my close personal association with a large number of them, is that if a general atmosphere in favour of trusteeship, devoid of ill-will and class hatred, is created in the country they will fall in line with it.
 Q. Many Congress workers who have recently come out of jail have to earn a living for themselves or their families. Under present economic conditions they have been forced to crowd into towns for this purpose with the result that the villages have begun to lose their services. Could not a paid service be established for them by the provincial or the district Congress organizations? If so, how would you advise them to find the money for this prupose ?
 G. The question reflects the present  deplorable  condition  of  the country. The cities are not only draining the villages of their wealth but talent also. The only way to check the process is for Con- gress workers to refuse to make their lives their God but to dedicate themselves to the service of their ideal only. God will then take care of them. A labourer is always worthy of his hire but I know that I have no magic wand to revolutionize people’s outlook up to the ideal of voluntary poverty. There-fore I consider it desirable that a fund should  be  created  either  by  the   Provincial   Congress   Committee or by local agencies to provide  maintenance  for  such  workers  as may want to dedicate themselves to the service of the villages. Do not expect me however to provide you with funds. My begging days are over. It is my firm belief that no worthy cause has ever suffered for want of finances if there are sincere workers to work fot it.  Calcutta has got enough ‘money bags’, and if a practical scheme of work in the villages is produced and there are sincere and earnest workers forthcoming to take it up, I am sure the money will come forth.
 Q. You have advised spinning for swaraj. If, in trying to execute that programme in its full implications, spinning for wages has to be restricted, should we do so? That will mean hardship for the very poor who find some relief through their spinning wages. Then, again, if we keep up spinning for wages, the new rules of purchasing khadi against yarn will make it more difficult for us to dispose of the khadi produced for offering relief to the poor.
 Gandhiji said that what he had recommended was that all people should spin not for self but for swaraj. Such conscious and altruistic spinning on the part of forty millions would constitute a veritable yajna or sacrifice out of which swaraj would emerge. It would knit the classes and masses, the brain workers and the manual labourers, in a living bond of unity. What had however happened was that although their efforts had resulted in providing thousands of men and women with a supplementary source of income, the spinners themselves did not wear khaddar. They did not realize the implications of khadi in terms of swaraj. He had therefore come to the concluclon tha if khadi was truly to become the “livery of freedom”libtech_254_footnote, to use Pandit Jawaharlal’s expression, all those who spin should consciously adopt khadi and all those who wanted to wear khadi should spin. There was thus no conflict between spinning for wages and spinning for sacrifice. The two were supplementary, one of the other.libtech_255_footnote
 Q.	Violence is bad	The only substitute for it is constructive activity as
 symbolized by the charkha. But the dynamic quality seems to have gone out of it. What should be done to bring out its revolutionary significance ?
 G. Dr. Radha Kumud Mukherji in one of his books has quoted Colebrooke as saying that in India, the home of chronic poverty, the spining-wheel is the provider of butter and bread for the poor. The late R. C. Dutt has shown how the prosperity of the East India Company was founded on their trade in Indian textiles. No part of the world, neither China nor Japan could produce fabrics to equal them. In the early phase the East India Company battened on the exploitation of its monopoly in Indian textiles. Not only did it bring them immense trade profits, it also gave an impetus to  British  shipping. Later, Lancashire developed its own textile industry follow- ing upon a series of mechanical inventions. This brought it into com- petition with the Indian textile manutactures. The policy of exploi- tation of the Indian artisans then gave way to that of destruction of their craft.
 
 An English writer has observed that the history of cotton is the history of civilization. Politics is the handmaid of commerce. Indian history provides an apt illustration of it. In the heyday of our cotton manufactures we used to grow all the cotton for our needs. The cotton seed was fed to the cattle which provided health-giving milk to the people. Agriculture flourished. The lint was turned into beautiful fabrics of which the jamdanis of Dacca were a specimen. As an offshoot we had the worldfamed dyeing and printing art of Masulipatam. Connoisseurs say that our old indigenous dyes could not be matched by any in the world for their permanence as well as brightness and beauty. All that is gone now. India is today naked. We have to cover her nakedness. If anybody could suggest a better substitute than the spinning-wheel for the prupose I would discard the spinningwheel today. But none has been found so far and I dare say none is likely to be found.
 The question may however be asked: ‘How can the charkha bring India freedom when it could not prevent its loss ?’ The reply is that in the past charkha was not linked with the idea of freedom. Nor did it then symbolize the power of non-violence. In olden days it symbolized our slavery. We had not realized that our progress, prosperity and even freedom depended on the charkha or else we should have put up a fight and resorted to satyagraha to save it from destruction. What was lost through our ignorance and apathy has now to be won back through intelligence and knowledge. We have today ceased to think for ourselves. The Government says that Bengal is a pauper province and we mechanically accept the statement. To call a
 province 	which boasts libtech_256_footnote crores 	of population as pauper is only to 
  	proclaim our own intellectual bankruptcy. Did not the Governor of 	Bengal observe    in a broadcast talklibtech_257_footnotethe other day that the cultivator in Bengal remains 	unemployed for six months in the year? Can any population in the 	world subsist while remaining idle for half the year? Even if all 	the water that the rains bring were captured and harnessed to 	irrigaion it would not keep the masses alive if their enforced 	unemployment for the better part of the year were not removed. Our 	real malady is not destitution but laziness, apathy and inertia. You 	may achieve marvels of irrigational engineering. But wellfilled 	grana- ries alone cannot and will not end our slavery. To end 	slavery you must over-come the mental and physical inertia of the 	masses and    
 quicken their intelligence and creative faculty. It is my claim that the universa- lization of hand-spinning with a full knowledge of all that it stands for alone can bring that about in a sub-continent so vast and varied as India. I have compared spinning to the central sun and the other village crafts to the various planets in the solar system. The former gives light and warmth to the latter and sustains them. With- out it they would not be able to exist.
 Q.	If swaraj hangs on the thread of hand-spun yarn, as you say, why have we failed to attain it up till now after a quarter of a century of khadi work ?
G.	Because our labour was not quickened by knowledge. The
 peace of the grave makes the latter the house of death. But the peace in the soul makes it the seat of divine intelligence. Similarly, soulless labour symbolizes serfdom Labour illumined with knowledge smy- bolizes the will to freedom. There is a world of difference between the two. Khadi workers should understand that khadi work without the mastery of the science of khadi will be love’s labour lost in terms of swaraj.
 Q.	What do you mean by the science of spinning? What things are included
  in 	it ?   G.	I 	have often said that I can do without food but not without 
  	sacrificial spinning. I have also claimed that no one in India has 	perhaps done his spinning with such unfailing regularity and 	conscientious diligence as I. And yet I will say that all that by 	itself cannot take the place of scientific knowledge. Scientific 	knowledge requires constant probing into the why and wherefore of 	every little process that you perform. Mere affirmation that in 	charkha there is swaraj and peace is not enough. A scientific mind 	will not be satisfied with having things scientific just on faith. 	He will insist on finding a basis in reason. Faith becomes lame when 	it ventures into matters pertaining to reason Its field begins where 	reason’s ends. Conclusions based on faith are unshakable whereas 	those based on reason are liable to be unstable and vulnerable to 	superior logic. To state the limitation of science is not to 	belittle it. We cannot do without either—each in its own place.  	When I first discovered the spinning-wheel it was purely through 	intuition. It was not backed by knowledge so much so that I confused 	charkha with kargha, i. e., handloom. Later on, however, I 	tried to work out its possibilities with the help of the late 	Maganlal Gandhi. For instance, the question arose: Why should the 	spindle be made of 
 iron, not brass? Should it be thin or thick? What would be the proper thickness? We began with the mill spindles. Then, spindle-holders used to be bamboo and wood. Later we came to leather and gut bearings. It was found that spindles got easily bent and were difficult to straighten. So we tried to make them out of knitting needles and ultimately of umbrellawires. All this called for the exer-cise of the inventive faculty and scientific research.
 A khadi worker with a scientific mind  will  not  stop  there. ‘Why the charkha, why not the spinning mill?’ he will ask himself. The reply will be that everybody cannot own a spinning mill. If people depend on spinning mills for their clothing, whoever controls the spinning mills will control them and thus there will be an  end  to individual liberty. Today anyone can reduce the whole of London and New York to submission within 24 hours by cutting off their electric and water supply. Individual liberty and interdependence are both essential for life in society. Only a Robinson Crusoe can afford to be all self-sufficient. When a man has done all he can for the satisfaction of his essential requirements he will seek the co-operation of neighbours for the rest. That will be true co-operation. Thus a scientific study of the spinning-wheel will lead on to sociology. The spinning-wheel will not become a power for the liberation of India in our hands unless we have made a deep study of the various sciences related to it. It will then not only make India free but point the way to the whole world.
 Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru has very aptly remaked that at one time India was not lacking in the inventive spirit but today it has become dormant. Once one gets the scientific outlook it will be reflected in every act of his, in his eating, drinking, rest, sleep. Everything will be scientifically regulated and with a full appreciation of its why and wherefore. Finally, a scientific mind must have detachment or else it willl and itself into the lunatic asylum. The Upanishad says that whatever there is in this universe is from Him. It belongs to Him and must be surrendered to Him and then enjoyed. Enjoyment  and  sorrow, success and failure will then be the same to you.
 One thing more. Supposing the tyrant wants to destroy the spinning-wheel itself. What then? My reply is that in that event we should ourselves perish with the spinning-wheel and not live to witness its destruction. For every khadi worker who thus sacrifices himself thousands will arise to take his place. The act of his will set the final seal of victory on the cause he represents.

266,"January 6, 1946",SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING,"
    
 January 6, 1946
 Gandhiji emphasized what he had saidlibtech_258_footnoteat Mahishadal about the observance of the general rule for attending a meeting. He said that it was the common rule that nobody should enter the meeting place after it had begun and nobody should leave the meeting place during the continuance of the meeting. Those who would violate this rule, Gandhiji emphasized, would disturb others. Even if anybody did not find any interest in the meeting he should think of others who are in the meeting and not leave the meeting before it was concluded.  This was the common rule for every meeting and  in the case of prayer meeting they should be more careful, because at the prayer they had to train their minds and concentrate on God.
 Referring to the song that was sung at the prayer Gandhiji said that they should take the significance of the song to their hearts. In the song Poet Rabin- dranath said that he would not be frightened to see God coming to him in the form of misery. In this connection Gandhiji would remind them of an English poem entitled “The Hound of Heaven”libtech_259_footnotein which God had been described as a huntsman pursuing the disciple continually. God, Gandhiji explained, could not leave His devotee alone because He, who had created the world, was concerned about the world going in order. So real misery came when they forgot God and happiness came when they kept God in them.
 This libtech_260_footnoteis also a kind of misery, but you should not feel like that. At the Sabarmati Ashram which was at a short distance from the Station there was a person who took the vow of silence. One day he told Gandhiji that he was greatly disturbed by the whistling train at the time of worship. Gandhiji suggested to him to shut his ears with cotton or rubber to prevent the whistle disturbing him. After a short time the man again came to Gandhiji and told him that he was no more in need of cotton or rubber because he had been trained to such a concentration of mind that no sound or whistle could enter his ears. What Gandhiji would tell them was that they should not be perturbed when misery—in whatever shape or form—came to them.

  January 7, 1946 Gandhiji stressed the need for observance of the rules of cleanliness by every  citizen. He asked them to remember that cleanliness was next to Godliness and that if  they 	could observe the rules of cleaniness they would be pure in their 	hearts also.  Gandhiji 	said that although 	he did 	not travel much 	during these 	days he had 	heard from his friends 	how the city 	streets were made dirty 	with  the  kernel  of 	 fruits, paper pieces and 	other useless things 	strewn over them.

  January 	8, 1946   BHAI 	VALLABHBHAI Yesterday 	I sent you a telegram as follows :  	“God willing reach Bardoli 3rd March.” I very much wanted to 	come on the 1st but I see that that is not possible, for February 	has only 28 days and I must look in at Poona, for a few days at 	least, before going to Bardoli. I have, therefore counted two days 	more so that I may arrange the programme as if the month had 30 	days. Having started the thing I must see it through. I cannot in 	any circumstances tolerate misuse of money. And if I take no 	interest Dinshaw cannot manage the new venture. I will, therefore, 	quickly finish the work at Wardha, pay a brief visit to Poona, and 	then come to Bardoli and after that go back to Poona again. This is 	what I have in mind at the moment.  	I have already written something about the Parliamentary 	Delegation.libtech_271_footnotelibtech_272_footnoteWe should not spurn it; on the other hand   we  should 	welcome it whole-heartedly. It is not necessary  to  get  excited 	over it as people used to when such people arrived in the past. We 	should not insult our guests in any manner whatesoever. There is no 	need for Congressmen to decline the invitation if they are invited 	to    
 parties that may be held to honour the members of the delegation. I myself will certainly meet them somewhere. As it, I was to see the Governor on returning from Midnapore. I saw him only last evening and he himself asked me when I could meet them. I gave him my dates. They will most probably meet me in Madras, no other dates scemed suitable. Dr. Mahmud has come over to see me. He met me the day before yesterday, and since I am soon leaving for Assam he intends to go to Patna after seeing me off. So he will go today. In the meanwhile, the Governor heard about his arrival and suggested a meeting. They were together for about an hour. Nothing important seems to have been discussed, but they were glad to have met. I have not as yet been able to sit and talk with Dr. Mahmud for even a quarter of an hour. Just as he came my silence began. It lasted throughout yesterday. Dr. Mahmud came in the evening, but I went to see the Governor. When I returned it was already a quater to ten; and so naturally we could not sit and talk.
 I am all right. Kanchan has been taken very ill but I hope she will recover. She has severe anaemia. She has had it for some time but she did not pay attention to it. I leave for Assam today. I do not like to leave her but you know how often I have had to go like this. Most probably Sushila will stay on for her sake. I am dictaing this early in the morning after the prayers. How she fares today we shall know only in the course of the day. Just now she is sleeping. So is Sushila, She was with Kanchan for most of the night.
 If I fill this letter with an account of my experience here, it would become much longer. I have not the time for it. Besides, why should you want to read all that?
 Rajkumari is of course here. She had to go to Hyderabad  (Sindh) for some time. She will accompany me to Assam. After that she will have to go to Mysore.

 I enclose herewith the original letter from the Friends’ Service Unit showing how urgent this work is. (Enclosure 2)
   Abhoy 			Ashram, Comilla.   
 I attach hereto a paper marked ‘Enclosure 3’. It discloses a curious state of affairs, as I understand if. I know personally that the Ashram activities were wholly beneficial and constructive. Schools based on social reform were run, catering for mostly Muslim children of spinning families who span yarn for wages; a depot was established for the storing of yarn, cotton and khadi; a hospital was conducted under the able supervision of Shri Suresh Bannerji.libtech_279_footnote(Enclosure 3)
   Other 			Khadi Centres.   
 Other khadi centres affected are shortly referred to in enclosure No. 4.libtech_280_footnote
   Sales 			Tax Act.   
 As to Sales Tax Act, I observe that the Act was passed on Ist July 1941. Handloom cloth was excluded from the operation of the Act, but it was amended on March 30th 1944, and the tax was raised from one to two pice per rupee. On 25th June 1945, it was raised to three pice per rupee by the Governor’s Ordinance. Handloom cloth was made taxable though originally omitted, but it is not clear when. Dhoti
 
 sari and lungi worth Rs. 10, Rs. 15, and Rs. 18 respectively are excluded from the operation of the Act.
 My point is that khadi, i.e., hand-spun and hand-woven, or hand-spun yarn should be excluded from all taxes. Logically, hand- woven cloth also, though woven from mill yarn, should be excluded for the tax hits the handloom weaver. Therefore, the exclusion of dhoti, sari and lungi is of no help. The revenue derived from khadi is altogether negligible. The revenue derived from hand-woven cloth is fair because hand-woven cloth is large enough in quantity to yield some income to the treasury, but at the poor weaver’s expenese. In taxing khadi, however, thousands of poor hand-spinners are so hard hit that the tax becomes so deterrent as to be punitive. I am quite certain that such was never the intention of the farmers of the Act. The oversight has only to be brought to the notice of the Government to  be remedied. I may also mention that all the khadi depots of the All- India Spinners’ Association are benevolent concerns. The conductors are servants of the A. I. S. A. which according to the recent judgment of the Privy Council, has been held to be a benevolent institution, not liable to income tax.libtech_281_footnote
 Incidentally, I may mention that whilst fresh milk is excluded from the operation of the Act, all other forms of milk such as boiled milk, pasteurized milk, dahi, etc., are taxable under the  Act.  The clause baffles me. The original Act is called Bengal Act of 1941.
   Feni.   
 Feni is within the Japanese bombed area. Therefore, 98 villages were evacuated by the Government. Assurance is said to have been given that six months after the cessation of hostilities the  villages would be returned to the villagers. Nevertheless, 28 villages appear to be still in Government possession. At the time of evacuation, removal of merchandise was strictly prohibited. This is a case demanding close inquiry.
 I enlose herewith an account furnished to me, marked ‘Enclosure 5’.libtech_282_footnote
 
 I have hurriedly drawn up this letter. The chief aim is to involve as little reading as possible for you. If, however, any further papers are required I shall be prepared to furnish them on my return from Assam, I hope on the 14th. As I told you last evening I cannot myself vouch for the accuracy of the facts given. They have been to me by co-workers as being accurate. But if that is not so I stand open to correction. If, however, they are found to be accurate I suggest that they call for immediate inquiry. I have taken care to refer only to those things which can be remedied without much difficulty or  expense and yet they are the things which will give relief to the neediest.

 SODEPUR,
 January 8, 1946
 CHI. MUNNALAL,
I have sent the following wire :libtech_284_footnote
 As it is Kanchan was ill. She was suffering from anaemia. Dr. Bidhan sent his own pathologist, who took her blood sample and examined it. She has been found to be suffering  from  severe  anaemia. It is because of this that her cough does not leave her. I have not known even a millionaire receive better treatment than she is receiving. Dr. Bidhan calls regularly and guides Sushilabehn. The latter had treated her once through a serious illness and hence  Kanchan had complete faith in her. I do not therefore believe that you will be able to do anything more by coming here. But if you feel you must, I will not dissuade you. It might not be proper also in view of the seriousness of the illness. I have, therefore, sent the above wire. If you have already left this letter will be superfluous. But I am dictating this assuming that you have not left. If you do come the question will arise as to who will take charge there. I have therefore sent a wire to Manibhai at Sevagram saying that, if he can, he should leave immediately for Poona. If you have not already left, he will help you. Take whatever help he can give. If you have already left, Manibhai will do as he thinks best.
I had got your postcard yesterday. All the questions in it had
been answered in my previous letter.

286,"January 9, 1946",STATEMENT TO THE PRESS,"
        
 January 9, 1946 Last night (Tuesday) was a terrible night for me. The crowds at  every station were unmanageable.  The shouts,  although well meant,
 could not please me in my old age, if they ever pleased me before.
 
 For I know that swaraj is made of truer and sterner stuff. They serve no uselful purpose. In the beginning stages, when people out of fear were afraid to hear their own voice, shouts and slogans had a place, not today when we seem likely to achieve independence, maybe within a few months. I was allowed last night no sleep except for what I could snatch in between stations. I cannot repeat this performance for many days and hope to live to the age of one hundred and twenty-five years. Friends will now appreciate why I have hardened my heart against even a brief tour through East Bengal. I would love to travel throughout Bengal but I know that for the sake of the common cause I must restrain myself and invite friends and co-workers to  do  likewise. Let them and people at large satisfy themselves with what service I can render without traveling as I used to before. Let the leaders in the various places try to conciliate the populace surroun- ding them and advise them to restrain from shouts and slogans and from jostling one another.
 One vulgar and uncivilized practice must be given up. There is the chain on every train to be used strictly in times of danger or accidents. Any other use of it and the consequent stoppage of the train is not merely a punishable offence but it is a vulgar, thoughtless and even dangerous misues of an instrument devised for great emergancies. Any such misuse is a social abuse which, if it becomes a custom, must result in a great public nuisance. It is up to every lover of his country to issue a stern warning against such wanton abuse of a humanitarian device intended for public safety.

287,"January 9, 1946",SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING libtech_285_footnote,"
        
 SAULKUCHI,
 January 9, 1946
 Gandhiji said that he had noticed during the bhajan that some of the people had failed to keep time with the song, but that was pardonable. He  would  like  that this form of  congregational prayer be  adopted all  over  Hindustan.	He was told that women  in  Assam  sang  sweetly  during  their  work,  for  example  when they were spinning or weaving.  Gandhiji had noticed that women had not joined  in today’s bhajan . It might be that they were ashamed to sing in chorus, but Gandhiji told them that swaraj would not come until they gave up this feeling of shyness.
 He was thankful to them for maintaining peace in the prayer meeting. In a few months they might have swaraj and they wanted to have swaraj within a few months in a peaceful way. But could they achieve swaraj if they went on shouting  in season and out of season? This would go to show that they did not possess the necessary discipline.
 Mahatma Gandhi referred to the experience of his journey and the indisciplined behaviour of the people at some places. He said this showed that the people had not yet fully imbibed the principle of non-violence. Indiscipline, he added, was only a variety of violence. If 40 crores of people or even a major part of them had assimilated the message of truth and non-violence which the Congress had been preaching for the last 25 years, India would have been free. But that was no reason for despair or despondency. To inculcate perfect discipline and non-violence among forty crores of people was no joke. It needed time.  Twenty-five  years  were  insufficient for such a tremendous task. That was why he desired to live 125 years so that he might, with his own eyes, see the consummation of his own ideas. But he could not hope to live up to that span of life unless the conditions attaching to it were fulfilled. If these conditions were fulfilled not only he, but anybody even in a country like India where the average expectation of life was the lowest in the world could live up to that period. It was clear, however, that if he exposed himself to experiences like that of last night his candle would be burnt out within a month.
 Britishers, continued Gandhiji, might realize, as they were bound  to  one day,  that they could  not  hold  down  an  awakened  people  for  all   time   with   force of bayonets and therefore, decide  to  transfer  power  to  them.  They  (the  people) would find themselves in a quandary in that event, if they had no discipline and organization. He hoped that they would not allow themselves to be caught
 
 napping like that.
 There was no greater spell-binder of peace than the name of God,  said  Gandhiji. He had, therefore, commenced the practice of holding mass prayers and inviting people to join in singing Ramdhun to the beating of time with the hands, to inculcate in the masses the spirit of non-violence and discipline. He would love to see that the whole of India was covered with prayer gatherings like that.

 I have seen a reportlibtech_286_footnotelibtech_287_footnotein the Press wholly baseless, to the effect that I propose to give two days to Orissa before reaching Madras. I would love, if I at all could, to give some days to Orissa and some days to Andhra. But I know the limitations of My body. It gives the work that it does from day to day to the utmost limit. Therefore, I cannot break my journey either for Orissa or Andhra and I invite all friends and co-workers in these two provinces to give their fullest  co- operation by telling people not to expect from me what seems to me to be impossible. I do not know who is responsible for the report in question.

 Thank you for your letter received some days ago. I have been busy with the annual session of the Women’s Conference and hence unable to acknowledge it earlier. I am grateful to you for enquiring about the matters mentioned to you by me when we last met. I do so wish all political prisoners could be released. It would have a good effect. What is more, it would be an act of justice though tardy.
 I enclose a list of several prisoners who have done ten to fifteen years in jail. This refers to Bengal only and then too the list  is  probably not exhaustive. Some are in bad health. Do you not agree that these should be released without delay ?

Particularly he 	was pleased that women 	had whole- 	heartedly joined in 	it without any 	feeling of 	false shame.

The 	man who had the 	realization of God Who 	dwelt in the hearts of all beings should know no fear.  	“Jai 	Hind” should not 	replace “Vandemataram”.libtech_295_footnoteThe words 	which Subhas Bose 	uttered were very pleasant 	to hear. 	But by 	this poeple should 	not forget 	Vandemataram which 	was being 	uttered since 	the inception 	of the 	Congress. First, 	they should say 	“Vandemataram” and 	then “Jai Hind”. He 	would whole-heartedly 	return that greeting but 	it should 	not be 	to the exclusion 	of “Vandemataram”. 	If they 	could discard 	“Vandemataram” 	which had such a 	tradition of sacrifice behind it, he was 	afraid they would one day 	discard “Jai Hind” also.      
 Gandhiji reiterated his belief that Subhas Babu was not dead, but was hiding somewherelibtech_296_footnoteand said that if he could communicate with Subhas Babu, he was sure the latter would endorse him in his view about “Vandemataram”.

I had 	explained to you what your dharma was at the time of your father’s 	 death. You have adhered to that. May you be blessed. I daily get 	news about Kanchan’s progress I am dictating this in the early 	hours of the morning. I had a wire from Sushila yesterday, saying 	that Kanchan was improving. She gives the credit to penicillin. I 	believe that Sushila has nursed her very well indeed. She has stayed 	behind entirely for the sake of Kanchan. Let us see now what 	happens. Perhaps this serious illness may bring about a complete 	transfor- mation in Kanchan. She is simple-hearted but is very much 	of a child also. As she grows in age, she does not correspondingly 	grow in understanding. Can it be that you are the cause of that? The 	people  around us believe so, and hold me also jointly responsible 	with you.  I do not admit the charge. But that is another matter. I 	have men- tioned the thing in case you would like to think over it.  	Manibhai must have arrived there by now. We had in any case decided 	to summon him there, and becuase of the development regarding 	Kanchan I felt it my dharma to send him there and asked him to 	proceed immediately if he was free. I have had very little 	experience of him. But Shantilal,who has lived at Sevagram for some 	time, and Ishvarlal Desai, husband of Nirmala, Mahadev’s sister, 	have given me the impression that he is a man of uncommon ability. 	Narahari has had experience of him and seen his worth. You will, 	therefore, find Manibhai of the greatest help. He is a capable man 	at any rate.  	I have been insisting on the account books being kept in English 	entirely for the sake of Jehangirjilibtech_297_footnote.   If he is not keen on that,     
 you may by all means have them kept in Hindi or Marathi. Can it be so arranged that the months and the dates are entered according to the Gregorian calendar, so that Jehangirji can check them ?

  	I have your clear letter. It is good that you have written frankly.  	I am dictating this also at a Mahila Ashram. It is in Gauhati.  A 	camp  of the Kasturba Fund is being held here. On one side there is 	a village and on the other Gauhati city. It is utterly peaceful.  	It gave me satisfaction to know that the cereals which were used for 	the camp would be cooked as kedgeree.

Even so I had some 	talk with Shriman Narayan. But its purport was quite different. I do 	not remember whether I was able to convey it or not. But if I could 	not speak out then I am telling you now. The Mahila Ashram is an 	institution of the poor. It is born of a noble sentiment. It is 	filled with Jamnalalji’s feelings and Vinobaji’s tapascharya. 	It is regarded as a good means of rendering service to poor women. 	And its manage- ment is in the hands of Shantabehn. And yet what a 	difference between what does on in such an institution and the 	almost naked    
 condition of the millions of poor women of India and Bengal. And I being a witness to all this. It wrung my heart then. Even as I recall the scene, my heart weeps. Even if I could not convey my meaning, Shriman understood it and conveyed it. I dictate this early in the morning. If it calls for further explanation, or if you want to know more, ask me when I come there. You may share this letter with all.

  CHI. 	DINSHAW,  	Chi. Munnalal’s wife Kanchanbehn  has  been very  ill,  so  I sent 	a wire saying that he should be relieved if he wanted to come away. 	I assumed that someone would have to replace him there and so 	telegraphed to Sevagram also asking them to send M[anibhai], whom I 	regard as very competent.  He has promptly left for Poona. I am glad 	I have been told that Manibhai is a very good worker. I believe it. 	I have hardly any personal experience of him. You will have some. 
 I hope you received the Rs. 10,000 I sent you, so the  new account will not suffer from paucity of funds.
 The patients who were already there should  adapt them-  selves to the new pattern. They should mix with the poor. Every- one should be punctual to the minute. Over and above this, you
 should accommodate them only if they pay or else let them leave. This alone will be true comradeship. We cannot any more allot separate rooms to the patients according to their wishes. In fact for the present we cannot accommodate patients who  need separate rooms. I have already written to you to allow as much privacy as the patients may need. I hope you remember it. If you haven’t had such instructions from me so far, please make a note now.
 Munnalal suggests that the English method of book-keeping is more expensive. I believe it is true. How would it matter if we maintained accounts in the Indian style? The Indian method can also ensure accurate account-keeping. Indian firms maintain accounts in the Indian way and carry on business in millions involving dealings with English banks. And since our little affair is going to be and should be worthy of an Indian we ought to infuse into it the swadeshi atmosphere as far as possible right from the beginning. Please show this letter to Jehangirji. It was at his instance that we had agreed to maintain accounts in the English way. But I believe, if opting for the English method is likely to cause an expenditure of Rs. 40 to 50 per month, Jehangirji would be in favour of saving the  amount.  The money that I shall contribute must be regarded as belonging to the poor. I may be getting it from the rich, but once it comes into my hands it becomes the poor man’s pie, to be spent solely for the poor. All my dealings are carried on in the same old way and it pains me that now because of my old age I cannot fully follow that way, and I also put up with the situation because I cannot get on otherwise. But I must not burden others with my foibles.
I hope you got my earlier letters, and have replied to them.
 For the present save all avoidable expenditure. I shall try my best to reach there on the 20th or the 21st of February. It is in God’s hands whether I shall succeed.

 CHI. SUSHILA (GANDHI),
 I saw what you wrote at the bottom of Arun’slibtech_300_footnoteletter.  You will know from my letter to him how my mind is working. You should not be soft. There is a famous line in Kalidasa and, I think also in the Bhagavata. It says that love is more tender than a flower and harder than steel.libtech_301_footnoteThat alone is love which can soften or harden with the occasion, all else is infatuation. Those who are worldly-wise should also note that such famous sayings are often misconstrued.
 There are many occasions when I remember all of you. There are also occasions when there is a feeling of relief that you did not come. The experience which you are gaining there and what Arun and Ila are witnessing is of course worth while. Maybe, comparatively speaking that is better than anything else. Ila for one was not likely to have imbibed anything in this place. Hence, for her at least I regard this at- mosphere as positively bad. You needed peace. You cannot expect to find peace in my company, especially while I am touring. Arun’s can be considered a different case, yet on the whole he is likely to be safest while he is before your eyes. He is a fine boy. I am of the view that he will have achieved all if he grows finer and finer. As for the other development everything happens in its own course. And in the absence of nobility of character even the Kingdom of Heaven is meaningless.

  	I have your letter. I shall say you have grown very wise if you get 	good testimonials from everyone there. And then I shall have nothing 	more to say to you. I shall be glad and the expectations that 	Prabhudas himself has entertained and has encouraged me to entertain 	of you will bear fruit. Besides, you already have my blessing that 	you may grow to be a very fine girl. There is much scope there to 	learn for anyone who wants.  	I have your brother’s letter to which I am enclosing a reply. Pass 	it on to him after you have read it. Don’t encourage him to come 	till you are yourself perfectly settled and don’t let him come 	until he grows into a very hard-working, firm and obedient boy. The 	question of his earning anything does not arise. See that in your 	zeal you do not encourage him only to repent later and cause 	embarrassment to others. You must watch out. You must draw your 	letters still bigger and you must form them well. You have learnt 	Urdu, haven’t you ?

I would always advise you and it is my wish that wherever you be you 	will always fully observe your vow.  	I can very well understand that there are difficulties while one is 	travelling.

Thorough observance of one vow straightens out all other matters. 	This is invariably found to be the case.  	Why is Ila growing insolent. As her elder brother, you are, I think, 	to blame for it.

 I  was  glad  to   have your  letter.	I had seen your letter to Sushilabehn and I think she had sent a reply also.
It is right for you to remain there as long as they do not relieve
you.
I shall pay your expenses, including your return fare. Draw the
 amount from Devdas and that, too, from my account. As long as Devdas is there, there should be no need to send it from the Ashram. The Government have of course offered to pay for your journeys. All this is only for your information.
 The Delhi weather is considered to be the best during  this season. Normally, [good] climate and pure food are adequate for maintaining good health.
 I understand about the Jamia. It would indeed be good if they let you stay there. Maybe they cannot for want of accommodation but if the reason is paucity of funds you can tell them that your expenses will be borne by the Ashram.
I am writing to Bhai Shriram. It is good that you informed me.
 From here, I shall reach Sodepur on the 14th and on the 19th. I may leave there for Madras. That means that a letter written to reach me by the 19th, should be sent to the Sodepur address.

 BHAI  SHRIRAMJI SHARMA,
 Prabhu Dayal writes that you lost a son while you were in jail and another after your release. What can I write to you? How can I console you? But where is any call for consolation on a death? Why fear death? Is death painful? And is birth joyful? Why is it that great epics such as the Ramayana teach the same thing? Because, on reflection, we find that birth and death are but two sides of the same thing. What is there good or bad about it? A world without death would be a frightful thing. Maybe the world would then have peri- shed. All this is not philosophizing but an utterance of the thoughts that come to my mind.
 Prabhu Dayal also writes that after meditation in the jail, your faith in truth and non-violence has grown much stronger and that you and your whole family spin beautiful yarn. All this makes me very happy.
 My Assam tour will end tomorrow. I intend to leave Calcutta for Madras on the 19th and February 8 is the date when I reach Sevagram.
 My address in Madras: Dakshina Bharat Hindi Prachar Sabha, Thyagarayanagar. At Calcutta, it will of course be Khadi Pratishthan, Sodepur. I shall expect your reply at either Place.

 GAUHATI,
 January 11, 1946 Addressing the gathering, Gandhiji explained the aims and objects of Kasturba Memorial Trust which had been startedlibtech_312_footnotelibtech_313_footnoteduring the period when he was in jail.  Later
 on he lent a hand in framing the Trust of the Fund.libtech_314_footnoteThe idea behind the whole scheme
 of Kasturba Trust had been to make women self-reliant and self-sufficient. This did not mean that men would go down, but if womenfolk improved and raised themselves up, men would automatically be raised higher. It is good that in India there were no quarrels between the menfolk and the womenfolk as existed in other countries. But that did not mean that the condition of Indian women was better than those of European countries. If the resources of Assam could be utilized, then the face of Assam could be changed. So much time was wasted in useless and idle talk. If they kept a diary of their work for the 24 hours, then they would know it. If they could utilize only a portion of the time they wasted for constructive work, there would be a wonderful improvement in their condition. In Assam muga industry was one through which people could change their conditions considerably and thus could do immense service to the cause of their country.
 He knew that quite a number of ladies had come merely to see him. But he could tell them that if they could devote all their strength to the execution of his constructive programme they would be immensely benefited.libtech_315_footnote
 Gandhiji emphasized that beauty lay not in ornaments or fine clothes but in doing something good and in applying oneself to doing some service to others.
 Replying to certain questions, Gandhiji said that the relation between the Congress and the Kasturba Memorial Trust was nothing but at the same time everything. If Congressmen took interest, the relation was there. If not, there was  no relation.

  January 	11, 1946  Gandhiji 	said that prayer 	was his life. 	He felt 	that the man who did not pray 	was a 	dry person, 	devoid of 	everything.

I was then in South Africa.

How I wish that the admirable canon be repeated this time.

 Your kind letter and copy of the Sapru Committeelibtech_321_footnotelibtech_322_footnoteReport was received during my Assam tour.

 Whilst I send this letter in English for fear of your resentment, I must inform you that nowadays to most Indian friends I have been studiedly writing in Hindustani or, when I find it is cruel to write to a countryman in the South in Hindustani, I take speical care to get someone near me who knows one of the Southern languages to write in it. So I hope you will not mind receiving my letter one  fine morning written in rashtrabhasha.

 You will pardon me when I tell you that I had forgotten—which I should not have done—that you were in Shillong. I am going to Dhubri today and from there tomorrow I say goodbye to Assam. Therefore, for the folly of my forgetfulness—and shall I also say your folly in not descending to Gauhati to meet me—I shall have to go away without seeing you even though you are within such a short distance of me. However, it is good that you have reminded me of your presence in Shillong and told me how well you are doing there.
 I am sure you have gained by following my instructions about not taking part in the political turmoil.
 Yes.  I have been hearing fairly regularly from Marylibtech_328_footnotelibtech_329_footnote.   I agree with you that she will return to India when your father does not need her services. So far as I gather from her letters, however, she does not expect to come back to India in the near future. It does appear as if there ever will be a time when your father will not need her services. According to my calculation if the old Mr. Barr’s life is being spent in accordance with the teaching of Ishopanishad, he must complete the full span of life i.e., 125 years. Have you read that little Upanishad? If not you should get a copy from some library there or at least in Dr. B. C. Roy’s collection. I suppose you know he has a bungalow there.

 Referring to the condition of the Harijans he said that he knew how they lived and what they ate. Their condition was almost similar to what it was in other parts of India.

 GAUHATI,
 January 12, 1946
 Explaining the scope of the constructive programme to them Gandhiji by way of an illustration described how a capital expenditure of about twenty five lakhs of rupees had been able to put into the pockets of the poor a sum amounting to not less
 
 than five crores of rupees. Indian cloth consumption, he said, amounted to about one hundred crores of rupees according to the present price level. All that money can be prevented from going out of the pockets of the people by fulfilling one item of the constructive programme, namely, khadi.
 With regard to parliamentary programme Gandhiji reiterated what he had previously  saidlibtech_343_footnoteat  Sodepur.		He was fully convinced that if all the people boycotted the legislatures, the country or the nation would not be losers by that. On the contrary, Gandhiji stressed that it would mean a great addition to their strength. But he realized that was not practical politics at present and as a realist he realized the necessity of preventing self-seekers and enemies of the freedom of India from entering the legislatures.	The main function of the legislatures should be the advancement of constructive work. Any programme that hindered constructive work was  not   worth  taking  up.		As an illustration of constructive work Gandhiji mentioned the services to Adivasis. Today, he said, they had been divided into water- tight  compartments by  the   ruling   power   and   that   was   why   Adivasis   had been classified as tribal races. It was a  shame that they should be isolated from the   nation  of   which   they   were  an inalienable  part.	Here was a vast field of constructive   work   which   Gandhiji   exhorted    all    to  take   up.	Nobody could prevent   them   from   undertaking   this   kind   of   constructive  work.	And if for undertaking constructive work they were put in jail, they should not be afraid of jail- going. In this connection Gandhiji referred to his own stand in the Champaran Satyagraha.
 In the course of his long and convincing speech Gandhiji made references to the names of Abbas Tyabji, Badshah Khan and Pandit Jawaharlal in order to illustrate his points by concrete examples.

       CHI. 	VICHITRA,  ON 	THE STEAMER,  January 	13, 1946 
  	I have your letter of 26-12-1945. Come and see me by all means. 	Consult Dada if you want. I see that you and Jajuji do not get on 	well. I am unable to make up my mind whether I should try to 	persuade you to keep together or let you work independently in your 	different ways. Either course can be justified. What harm could 	there be if you were to work independently of the Charkha Sangh? You 	are both devoted to khadi. It is possible that under Jajuji’s 	control, the Meerut Gandhi Ashram’s progress is arrested and they 	cannot work to their full capacity. If it is so and if Jawaharlalji 	and Pantji are also of the same opinion, why not have a separate 	organization for khadi in the U. P.? Assuming that it is done for 	the love of khadi and if, as a result, khadi is more successful in 	the U. P., such a step would only do good instead of harm. There 	have been many instances in my life when I gave such encouragement 	and it always resulted in good. The latest instance is that of the 	Hindi Sahitya sammelan. I quit it. How could I oppose Tandonji? He 	had the main part in building  up the organization. I do not approve 	of his present policies and feel that I would be able to serve Hindi 	well, perhaps even better, by keeping out of it. In case it does not 	turn out so, I shall admit my mistake and follow Tandonji. But if I 	have not made a mistake, I shall only further the cause of the Hindi 	Sahitya Sammelan from outside. The important point is that our 	actions should not be inspired by selfish motives and our ultimate 	aim should be one and the same. Maybe I should be able to make a 	definite statement if I could meet all the people.  	Think well over this letter, consult the others and write to me what 	you think is the proper course of action. I shall reach Madras 	probably on the 21st and shall stay there for 15 days. You may come 	there if you like. Jajuji will of course be there. You need not go 	there immediately I arrive. We can manage even if you come in the 	beginning of February. My sole intention is that all khadi devotees 	should make all-round progress and khadi should get its rightful 	place. Of course, if you do not sincerely believe in non-violence, 	do 
 not consider khadi its symbol and have no faith in my present policy with regard to khadi, then it is a different matter. When our views differ to such an extent, the question assumes a wholly different form. And if, while maintaining different views with regard to the above three points you still want to serve khadi, you must dissociate yourself from the Sangh. Then the question is not one of differences with Jajuji but of differences over principle, and if that be the case they ought to be cleared up.

PRESS OF INDIAlibtech_346_footnote","
             [January 	13, 1946] Asked whether the cry of 	Jai Hind could 	be appropriately adopted in a non-  violent action since 	originally it was devised by Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose as a war  cry, 	Mahatma Gandhi said :  	It does not follow that because  Jai  Hind  was  	devised  by Subhas Babu as a war cry in armed warfare, it must be 	eschewed in a non-violent action. On that basis even Vandemataram 	 may have to be given up because there are instances of people 	committing violence with this cry on their lips. If a thing is 	essentially an evil it becomes a positive duty to abjure it In my 	opinion Jai Hind and Vandemataram have almost the same 	meaning. In one we make obeisance to Mother India and thereby wish 	her victory; the other merely wishes  her victory. There is no 	question of singing the two together. As I have saidlibtech_347_footnotelibtech_348_footnotebefore 	Jai Hind  cannot replace 	Vandemataram.  Asked 	whether Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose enjoyed the 	same place in 	his esteem 	and affection 	and whether 	he heard 	what Netaji 	and written 	about him in 	his reported 	book Father of 	All Nations, 	as was 	believed in 	some sections 	of the 	people of 	Assam, Gandhiji replied : I 	have not read what Subhas Babu is reported to have said about  	me. But I am not surprised at what you tell me. My relations with 	him were always of the purest and best.  I always knew his capacity 	for     
 sacrifice. But a full knowledge of his resourcefulness, soldiership and organizing ability came to me only after his escape from India. The difference of outlook between him and me as to the means is too well known for comment.

334,,SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING,"
              GOALPARA, "
335,"January 13, 1946",SPEECH AT DHUBRI,"
  January 13, 1946 Gandhiji reiterated that there could be no non-violent swaraj which was but another name for 	Ramarajya except 	through the charkha. 	His definition 	of Ramarajya  was 	that under it even the weakest must enjoy the same freedom and same 	rights as the strongest. For that it was necessary that even the 	physically weakest person shold be able to take due share in the 	struggle for independence. In other words, women and children should 	be able to play an equal part with men. It was clear that this was 	not possible in armed warfare.  Gandhiji’s 	reading of India’s 	history was that 	every time the people 	made use of 	armed forces for 	their protection it 	only resulted 	in tightening 	their bondage. The 	so-called protectors in 	their turn, Gandhiji 	added, became oppressors. But 	under non- 	violence as 	symbolizesd by 	the spinning-wheel, 	men and women 	enjoyed absolute 	parity in 	the fight 	for freedom. 	The condition 	was that 	every thread of yarn 	that they spun 	should be a conscientious 	sacrifice or yajna 	for swaraj and it 	should be backed by the 	determination to 	resist with 	their lives any 	assault that 	might be 	directed against 	charkha. By 	charkha, he 	meant not 	hand-spinning alone 	but all those 	things which 	hand-spinning symbolized. 	These included the 	revival of 	all other 	village industries, of 	course, but 	it included 	all the various 	other items of his 	18-point constructive 	programme as 	well. By 	way of 	illustration Gandhiji 	mentioned communal harmony 	and total 	abolition of 	untouchability, both 	of which 	were natural corollaries 	of ahimsa.  Amrita 	Bazar Patrika, 	15-1-1946             January 	13, 1946  Addressing 	 the  gathering,  	Gandhiji  said  that he  was  sorry for  keeping them 	waiting for 	such a long 	time. The 	steamer could not 	move due to fog. 	He had 	heard and seen the 	miseries of Bengal. He came to Assam because the miseries of the 	people of Assam were no less than that of the people of Bengal. He could not stay 
 longer in Assam due to urgent work at Calcutta.  He emphasized  that  swaraj  would not come from the heavens  and  would  not  be given to them by anyone. Eveything depended on their self-help and swaraj would be achieved through charkha.

 I got your letter. I do not feel happy about Dr. Dinshaw’s indifference. It is good that Jehangirji helps you. You should go on doing patiently and calmly whatever you can. Let those who wish to leave do so. I hope Manibhai is giving you all possible help. Do not admit new patients. Even the old ones who pay their own expenses must abide by the new rules. We do not want to run the show with their money. We wish to do that with the blessings of the poor. The Doctor may recommend to new patients such treatment as they can take at home. If any patients come for baths, etc., these may be given. But nobody should be allowed to stay in the clinic. I hope that we shall be able to systematize everything after I return. If necessary, you may show this to Jehangirji. The doctor of course will read it.
 We shall arrange about khadi after I return there. I will get the required quantity.
I believe Kanchan is all right.

I have your letter.
 The removal of Gajraj’s tonsils must have done good. I understand about Mavjibhai.
 The right place for Chakrayya seems to be with Raju. By staying with him, he too may get trained.
 I think there are several copies of the Hindi Koran lying with us. Any one of them may be given to them. It is likely that all those books have been given to the Talimi Sangh. From there also it can be got for them. Do what is necessary.
 People do joke about boys and girls. It can be innocent as well as harmful. There cannot be one rule for this. Life is full of risks and will continue to be so. Ours can only be the middle path. Among our prayer songs there is one by Raichandbhai: “Innocent joy may be derived from anywhere.” This song is probably there in the [Ashram] Bhajanavali. One who wants to do evil may do no evil at all by action but will do so by his thought. The golden rule is that always and in all circumstances we should remain pure. That purity does by itself influence the atmosphere. If you want to ask anything about this, ask me when I come there.
 Let us be quite impersonal towards that sadhu and tell him bluntly that there cannot be any place for him in the Ashram.

  January 	15, 1946  Gandhiji 	said that the victims of the Diamond Harbour accident were no more 	but what would happen to their relatives? Many lives had not been 	lost in Chitta- gong, however.  These 	two incidents had overwhelmed him but it should not be so. Men 	should  be calm and steady even if thousands, lakhs or even crores die. If we can bear it 
 peacefully, we can hear the inner voice then.libtech_369_footnote
 Government must be alive to their duties regarding these two incidents but at the same time the people should not forget theirs. The bhajan sung at the prayer on Monday (Antar mama vikasita karo) indicated the way. It was a prayer to open our hearts. The world would become a vast fraternity if that was done.
 Gandhiji said that if he were there at Diamond Harbour,  he  would  have advised the men and women not to go there.  He had witnessed a  similar instance  at Kumbha Mela at Hardwar in 1915, when in the jostle for a  dip in the Ganges, 17 men were drowned. At Diamond Harbour the pilgrims had to get on the jetty and the Government should have made proper shipping arrangements. However, even if the Government did not do their duty an accusation on that score  would  not help us. The people on their side should follow the right course. The Govern- ment could not be blamed for the incident at  Hardwar.  Here  of   course   it   could be  found  on  enquiry  that proper  arrangement  for  shipping  facilities   had   not been made.
 At Chittagong, it was worse. People had read the Government account and it was an admission of the story as sent out by Jaminibabu. But the people, Gandhiji said, did not play their part as preached in the bhajan . The bhajan wanted to make us firm, active and fearless. Gandhiji felt sure that if the people could rely on these qualities, the Chittagong incident could not have taken place. If people could sing the bhajan as they did in the prayer, why could they not act according to its message, he asked. Gurudev’s words were not meant for Bengal only. Everywhere saints had preached the same message.
 An Englishman had sardonically asked Gandhiji if the Indians could get independence by harping on the theme of their slavery. Gandhiji thought that the remark was true. No good could come out of repeating the fact of dependence. Slave people lived in eternal misery and only by working for eradicating this misery could they get swaraj. Only criticism could not make foreigners quit. If people realized the message of satyagraha, if they practised it in life, they could get rid of this misery. What was satyagraha? It was only the craving for truth inherent in man and there lay its strength.
 Two women were attacked at Chittagong and for that two men were counter- attacked. As a result a hundred came, attacked the villagers and burnt the hamlet.  If the people could rest firm on truth such an incident could never happen. He had subsequently learnt, Gandhiji said, that the rowdy elements were his countrymen and therefore brothers. If that was so he also had some responsibility for their action  and it was his duty as well to strive for the eradication of their vile instincts. On the
 
 other side many pilgrims died at Diamond Harbour. This latter accident occurred because the Indian people had not been successful in explaining the true significance of pilgrimage. Pilgrimage entails pain. It was not pilgrimage to travel by rail or steamer. Travelling from Cape Comorin to Hardwar by a train was no pilgrimage.
 He had been preaching this idea for a long time, and he would be doing so in the future whatever the result. He would continue with his message even if five men only responded to the call.

353,"January 	16, 1946",LETTER TO JIVANJI D. DESAI,"
              SODEPUR, 
    CHI. 	JIVANJI,  January 	16, 1946 
  	I have with me three letters of yours dated December 13, 1945, 	January 7, 1946, and January 11, 1946.  	I will not argue at length about another Tamil translation of An 	Autobiography. Nor have I the time for that. I am 	dictating this reply in the early hours of the morning, and that 	also while racing against time. I have seen in English more 	translations than one of a good book. I don’t find anything wrong 	in it. Our only aim in retaining the copyright can be to guard 	against possible misuse of the privilege. But if we have authorized 	one person, and then another public-spirited person who can do a 	better translation comes forward, why should we not give him the 	permission? This is my line of reasoning. More when we meet and can 	talk at leisure. But meanwhile I will accept your decision as final 	and correct. For I may decide something in haste and you may have to 	bear the burden, which would not be proper.  	I have decided for the present to refuse permission for a Finnish 	translation, for the person’s intention seems to be to make 	profit.  	About Harijan we shall decide after I hear more  from  you. 	For,  as  long  as  the  Government  does  not  share  our   desire  	 that its  publication  should  be  resumed,  I  think  it  will  be 	 a  great risk to embark on the venture. I think I have discussed 	this matter with you earlier.libtech_370_footnotelibtech_371_footnoteThe 	lifting of the ban will not be enough for resuming publi- cation. 	Discuss the matter with Mavalankar and Sardar, if he is there, and 	then write to me. We wish to do nothing in haste.    
 I have received the new edition of The Constructive Programme. You are right when you say that you can afford to send, and should send, a large number of copies only if a proper account of the copies is kept and the money is regularly remitted to you. Do not send more copies just now. Two of the newspapers here published the whole test. You may publish the booklet in the other languages you intend to.
 You have given a full explanation about the preface, as also about the price.
 Chi. Kanu will write to you separately regarding the Bhajana- vali. Do not publish the new edition till you get all the material from him.
 I should like you to publish the translation sent by Rajendra Babu. Discuss the matter with Kishorelal and Narahari also.
 The Rashtrabhasha dictionary follows me wherever I go. I have not forgotten, either, about the foreword to the book on Gita According to Gandhi written by Mahadevbhai. I will be happy if I can finish it before leaving for Madras. But all that is in God’s hands.  I rest content with the work I can do from day to day. I cannot, of course, attend to all the things. I see in this my inefficiency. If I cannot overcome it, I cannot hope to live up to 125 years. But be it as  it may. If you think it fit, you may reprint Nation’s Voice.
 Your suggestion for adding something more to the paragraphs on cow-protection in The Constructive Programme seems a good one.  I would describe it as “improvement of livestock”. I agree that it should not have been left out. We will remember the point at the time of the next edition. If the current edition is exhausted soon and any suggestions for improvements occur to you, let me have them,  too.
 I am leaving here on the 19th and reaching Madras on the 21st. The address will be c/o Dakshina [Bharat] Hindi Prachar Sabha, Thyagarayanagar, Madras. I will be in Madras for 15 days at the most. If I can finish earlier, I will  try.  Then  on the 8th to Seva- gram. After spending a day in Bombay, to Poona on the 21st.

  	I have your letter. I like it. I am also glad that you have deci- 	ded to give Manorama in marriage to a Harijan. But your inference in 	favour of atheism is not correct; or as I believe, your  nastiktalibtech_380_footnoteis only a form of astiktalibtech_381_footnote.  	I am prepared to get the marriage performed in the Sevagram Ashram 	and have the same rites followed as in the case of Tendulkar.      
 The priest, who will perform the ceremony under my supervision, will be a Harijan. You are welcome to make any suggestion in this regard. One thing more. Manorama is 17 years old; I think I remember her. My advice is that she should wait at least for two years. If your idea is that the ceremony may be performed now and the girl might go to stay with her husband on attaining the age of 19, I would suggest postponing the marriage till she can live with her husband. In the meantime they may learn whatever more they want to learn. Let them learn at least Hindustani in both the scripts and all the processes of the charkha right from beginning to end.

364,"January 	17, 1946",SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING,"
              SODEPUR, 
  January 	17, 1946  Gandhiji 	said that Fridaylibtech_383_footnotewould be 	his last day at 	Sodepur on 	this occasion. 	He had always 	cherished a desire 	to stay 	in this 	place and join 	them in prayer. 	Indeed he 	had not been 	able to stay 	there continuously owing 	to his 	tours. His 	tours had 	produced good 	results. He 	hoped that 	they would stick to 	the system 	of congre- 	gational prayer.  Exhorting 	them to 	sing the name of 	God in 	chorus and 	to keep 	tune with all heart, 	Gandhiji said 	that he had 	told them before and 	wanted to 	tell them now 	that soldiers 	were compelled to move 	together and to keep 	step in marching. 	At first 	there was 	an element 	of compulsion 	in making 	them do 	so but gradually 	as they 	became habituated 	the element 	of compulsion 	passed and their 	movements became easier and 	smoother. In 	their case 	the soldiers were 	made disciplined on 	pain of 	dismissal, but 	 in prayer 	although they were the 	devotees of 	God yet there 	was no question of compelling 	them to keep 	or sing 	in chorus. 	But it 	was for the sake 	of their 	own good 	that they joined in prayer and if they uttered the name of God in one tune their hearts     
 would be purified and they would get new strength in their hearts. This would be their remuneration for becoming the devotees of God.
 Referring to the day’s bhajan , Gandhiji said that in this song the devotee was making the submission that he would offer his salutation to God in all his worldly duties. God was their real friend, He was their father and mother and in  fact  everything. Their earthly friends and relations suffered death but God was immortal. He never left them at any time. The bhajan therefore very aptly taught them to remember God who was their eternal friend in every sphere of their life’s activities. The song also told them to keep their inward eye open because it was through this inward eye that they were able to perceive God.
 Concluding, Gandhiji said that in the prayer song of the day they had found such things which would be of great value in their everyday life. They should take the teachings of the song to heart. After they had attended the prayer if they returned home with their hearts unchanged they would be deprived of a great thing.

367,"January 	18, 1946",SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING,"
              SODEPUR, 
  January 	18, 1946  Gandhiji 	 regretted  that  he 	 was  addressing  the  congregation 	 for  the  last time 	on the 	present occasion and 	God only knew when he 	would be 	in position to 	repeat his 	visit to 	Bengal. He 	had a 	mind to 	go to Chittagong and 	also to 	visit Munshigunj but he could not realize his wish. Mahatma Gandhi observed : Although 	during my stay I could not visit the different parts of  	Bengal as I wished, still I will say that I am satisfied with what 	little I could do in Bengal. My code teaches me to be satisfied even 	if I succeed in one front out of ten I try.  Referring 	to the 	Chittagong incident, 	Gandhiji said that there 	was no point 	  in finding 	fault with others 	over this issue. 	They had to 	analyse themselves. They 	should remember that 	in always 	finding fault 	with others they 	themselves were 	 likely to 	 be at fault.	If 	the habit of 	fault-finding  became 	 a  permanent  feature 	with them they would 	never be able 	to serve 	anybody. Tulsidas in 	his inimitable 	way made 	it quite 	clear that there were no  	animate  or 	 inanimate  objects 	 which  were 	either totally evil 	or totally 	good.  Those two 	qualities more or  less  were to 	be noticed in 	everything and 	just like the 	proverbial swan 	they had to 	discard the 	evil of a 	thing and 	adopt the 	good of it for 	their own 	welfare. He 	asked the 	people to 	remember this 	moral sermon of the 	poet and 	conduct themselves accor- 	dingly. If 	they concentrated 	only on 	black spots they would 	themselves be 	spotted. Therefore, 	for one’s own welfare 	it was 	desirable that 	the habit of 	fault-finding be 	given up. 	In China 	there was a 	pillar on 	which three monkeys were 	carved in stone: 	one of them was 	blindfolded, the second ear-logged and the third close-mouthed. The 	moral of 	this illustration 	was ‘see no 	evil, hear 	no evil 	and speak no 	evil’. He 	urged upon the congregation to take to heart what this Chinese symbol taught them.  Dwelling 	upon the necessity 	of congregational 	prayer, Gandhiji hoped 	that people 	on return 	to their 	homes would conduct such 	prayer in the 	company of 	the members 	of the family 	and children. 	Theatres or cinemas 	they often visited, but 	those agencies 	could scarcely 	benefit the people 	to the 	extent the 	congregational prayer 	could do. 	He himself had 	been to 	a  famous  theatre  in 	 London  and 	 could  speak 	 from his personal 	experience that it hardly 	benefited him. Comparing the benefit 
 of congregational prayer with what little historical knowledge a dramatic perfor- mance could offer, Gandhiji said that the former was many thousand times more beneficial. What could the stage teach, he asked. Was it of any consequence when compared with the realistic drama that the world presented? He had seen the role of a hero being played on the stage. Could Rama of his conception be played on the stage? Could the tragedy on any stage be so realistic and effective as the tragedies they witnessed on the world stage? Mothers were ministering angels of homes and they nursed children to life and to them he especially appealed to introduce God and divinity to their children and to introduce bhajan song which was full of eternal bliss.

  	Your letter written from Allahabad is before me. I am dictating this 	after the morning prayer. At 2·30 p.m. today, I leave for Madras.  	Your report is good. I have written to Bapa regarding the Delhi case 	as well as the question of representation. I am inclined to think 	that if we just wait till we find a suitable Agent for a place, 	meanwhile getting the work done through the centre, no problem 	should arise in the appointment of women Agents. Therefore, I am of 	the opinion that we may take any kind of work from Brijkrishna. We 	should not formally appoint him an Agent. If the idea does not 	appeal to either or both of you I shall be ready to do as you 	suggest. This has been my policy regarding any activity that I am 	not conducting myself and  I am convinced that it is right. 	Therefore, send me your own opinion.  	About the U.P., I am carrying on correspondence with Purnima. No 	decision has yet been reached. Concerning the appointments another 	question had now arisen, viz., whether anyone contesting election to 	the Assembly can continue to be an Agent. We have three or four such 	cases—those of Durgabai, the sister  from  Calicut  (I forget her 	name), Rameshwaridevi and probably Purnima too. I feel that it would 	indeed be difficult, if not impossible, for those going into the 	Assembly, to do full justice to their work as Agents. Besides, the 	mere knowledge that their Agents are members of the Assembly is 	likely to perturb the village women. Do send me your views in the 	matter. Are you coming to Madras? Bapa is coming. You may also come. 	If you come I shall arrange for your accommodation.  Blessings 	from  BAPU  SHRIMATI 	SUCHETA 	KRIPALANI 	SWARAJ 	BHAVAN  ALLAHABAD  From 	a copy of the Hindi: Pyarelal Papers.

  	These days I am kept extremely busy. I, therefore, have not been 	able to reply to one or two letters of yours. They contained nothing 	special. I am glad that things have improved somewhat. How- ever, I 	have realized your difficulty. We shall be able to solve it only 	through patience. I cannot do more from here. It will be enough if 	you do not incur any new expenditure. I will see about the khadi 	after I return.  	I read your long telegram to Kanchan. I would say that you should 	not have sent it. I do not understand how Balkrishna encou- raged 	you to send it.   It can be described as a wire from a  vevalolibtech_387_footnotelibtech_388_footnote. You will understand what I mean if you know the 	meaning of the word vevalo. I do not know the English 	equivalent for vevalo. Every language has some words which 	are untranslatable. Vevala is such a word. I am not 	reprimanding you at all. This is only a joke. I actually gave you an 	opportunity to come, if you wished to. Kanchan is better now. And if 	she gives up her obstinacy, this illness will do her much good. I am 	leaving today for Madras. It is not certain whether or not I shall 	take Kanchan with me. Dr. Bidhan has had an X-ray taken. If the 	report is good, Sushilabehn says I can take her. She has not yet 	been permitted to walk.

 He said that he had already spoken enough in Bengal and Assam and they must have read the speeches in the papers. He asked them to follow those instructions. Gandhiji laid stress on the need for Harijan uplift. He wanted caste Hindus and Harijans to live as brothers. He also complimented them on the discipline they had shown and said that the people at Balrampur had also behaved in similar manner.

However strange my claim may appear to the reader, I have called Gokhale my political guru. Therefore Sastriar is a fellow-disciple. And what a disciple and yet an amiable usurper!

 I confess that however great may be my attempt at impar-tiality,I must fail to satisfy the critical reader. Fellow-admirers need no pass- port from me. And of whom was I to write? As I began to read Jaga- disan’s selection, I did not know whether Gok-hale absorbed my attention or Sastriar.
 Therefore I would close these hasty and rambling remarks by warning the critical reader against his or her trying the ques-tionable task of discovering in these pages an echo of his or her own views. It should be enough to find in them the transparent sincerity and patrio- tism of the writer or, shall I say, the biographer and the master.

 The following pages by Mahadev Desai are an ambitious pro- ject. It represents his unremitting labours during his prison life in 1933-’34. Every page is evidence of his scholarship and exhaustive study of all he could lay hands upon regarding the Bhagavad Gita, poetically called The Song Celestial by the late Sir Edwin Arnold. The immediate cause of this labour of love was my translationlibtech_397_footnotein Gujarati of the divine book as I understood it. In trying to give a translation of my meaning of the Gita, he found himself writing an original com- mentary on the Gita.
 The book might have been published during his lifetime,libtech_398_footnotelibtech_399_footnoteif  I could have made time to go through the manuscripit. I read some portions with him, but exigencies of my work had to interrupt the reading. Then followed the imprisonment of August 1942, and his sudden death within six days of our imprisonment. All of his imme- diate friends decided to give his reverent study of the Gita to the public. He had copies typed for his English friends who were im- patient to see the commentary in print. And Pyarelal, who was colla- borator with Mahadev Desai for many years, went through the whole manscript and undertook to perform the difficult task of proof- reading. Hence this publication.
 Frankly I do not pretend to any scholarship. I have, therefore, contented myself with showing the genesis of Mahadev Desai’s effort. In so far as the translation part of the volume is concerened, I can vouch for its accuracy. He has carried out the meaning of the original translation. I may add, too, that Pyarelal has interfered with the origi- nal only and in rare cases where it was considered to be essential, an interference which Mahadev Desai would, in my opinion, have gladly accepted, had he been alive.

377,,WHAT EXHIBITION SHOULD BE,"
        
 The Congress session is likely to be held within two or three months. The question, therefore, arises as to what sort of an exhibition should be put up from the villagers’ point of view. It is only the rural view-point which can be valid for India, if we desire and believe that the villagers have not only to survive but also to become strong and rich. If this is true, there can be no place for city articles and pomp and show. There should be no need for the entertainments that are prevalent in cities. Under no circumstances, should the exhibition degenerate into cheap entertainment or a means for earning and never into an instrument of advertisment for business men. Nothing should be sold there, not even khadi and the products of village industries. The exhibition should be educative, and it should be intersting too. It should be so organized that a villager after returning home, would begin to feel the necessity of learning some sort of industry or craft. There should be somebody who can point out the shortcomings in all the villages of India and someone who can explain the ways and means for getting rid of them. There should be someone who can show how far we have progressed since the beginning of the move- ment for village uplift. There should be somebody who can explain how this exhibition helps in making village life aesthetically satis- fying.
 Now let us consider what should be the form of the exhibition which can fulfil these conditions:
  There 	should be two models 	of the village—one 	showing the village as it is today and the other, the improved one. 
 The improved village will be clean.  The cleanliness will be  seen in the houses, the roads, the surroundings and the fields. The con- dition of the cattle will also be better. Maps, pictures and books should show how particular occupations can help in increasing the villagers’ income.
  Complete 	details should be 	displayed about how 	the various village 	industries should work, where the 	tools for 	them are available and 	how they are 	manufactured. All 	the crafts should be 	demons- trated. 	At the same 	time the following 	items should be shown: 
 Ideal 	diet for the villagers; the 	competition between 	machine industry and handicrafts; a 	practical demonstration 	of animal husbandry;  a 	model for latrines; art section; organic 	manure v. 	chemical fertilizers; use 	of hides 	and bones 	of animals; village 	music, musical instruments and village dramas;  village 	games, gymnasium and exercises; Nayee Talim; village medicines; 
 Bearing in mind the policy stated at the outset, whatever addi- tional items can be exhibited should be there.
 What I have stated is only illustrative. I have deliberately omitted all those village industries which are connected with the spinning- wheel. Without these industries the exhibition should be considered worthless."

  Gandhiji 	said that independence was not an easy thing to win or was it a 	drama. Discipline was essential in the national life of the country 	and, if they got swaraj, 	he asked, how could they maintain it without discipline. He was very 	much impressed at the discipline of people in place like Balasorelibtech_400_footnoteand Bhadrak and was 	expecting discipline of higher order in Cuttack, this being the 	capital of the Province. libtech_401_footnoteThankkar Bapa had 	asked him to break journey in Orrisa. He regretted very much that he 	could not break journey. But he had Orissa always in his heart.libtech_402_footnote  It 	has cut him to the quick, he said, that Orissa, which he had loved 	so fondly and through which he had made his Harijan pilgrimage on 	foot,libtech_403_footnoteshould 	belie his expectations. Was this their non-violence or did they 	imagine that freedom would be       
 won or kept through indiscipline and hooliganism? They were living in a fool’s paradise, if they did. Was it not ridiculous to pit indiscipline and hooliganism against the atom bomb which was the ultimate of brute force? It was time that they made up their mind as to their choice between the two paths. They were at liberty to scrap non- violence, if they felt that it was a played-out force. But, if they were thinking of violence while they professed non-violence, they would be guilty of deception and fraud upon themselves and the world. He remarked:
I do not want your cheers of welcome, nor money during these
 stoppages. But I want you to purge yourselves of the lie in the soul. That will please me more than your gifts; the noises never will, and never have.

 Junuary 20, 1946 In these early hours I meet you, and I am glad. I am sorry, I  could not stay with you even for a day in Orrisa. You will excuse me.
My health is not like before. After fifty years of age one’s health
 weakens. That is God’s will. At Bhadrak and Balasore the crowds were very disciplined. So I thought it was better that I stop at Cuttack. In the original programme, no stoppage at Cuttack of the special train was arranged. In Cuttacklibtech_405_footnotethe mob was unruly.  It was about 1.30 a. m. At such a time one should not be disturbed in his sleep and that too an old man like myself. They afterwards became orderly.
 You are sitting calmly. My prayer is, not only at your place but at all places, that it should be so. Through unruliness we cannot win swaraj. You all know me and I know you. I am not new to you. You should carry on constructive work. You should take to khadi work and removal of untouchability earnestly. You have not yet completely solved the Harijan problem The problems are the same in all parts of India. I agreed to come to you so early in the morning because I hope that Orissa will show the lead in these matters. I know the British will
 
 leave India tomorrow. If they go, not out of your strength, of what use is it to us? If you think you can make the British leave the country by empty shows, you are not correct. I have no doubt that through non- violence and truth alone we can achieve swaraj.
 Mahatma Gandhi thanked the people for the purse presented for the Harijan fund and said :
If I have time enough, I would have collected from each one of
you money for the fund.
 Concluding, Gandhiji said, what had happened at Cuttack (the people behaving in an unruly manner) distressed him, but the orderly manner in which people behaved in Berhampur amply consoled him.libtech_406_footnote

MEETING, VISAKHAPATNAMlibtech_407_footnote","
    
 January 20, 1946 Gandhiji asked whether (1) they had removed untouchability, (2) they had achieved communal unity, and (3) they had realized that Adivasis (hill tribes) should
 also share swaraj.
 Mahatma Gandhi said, they were all of Hindustan, drinking the same water and breathing the same air. So swaraj must be of the Hindus, the Muslims, the Christians and others of India.
 Referring to the necessity of keeping themselves disciplined and peaceful at meetings, Mahatma Gandhi said that even if one crore people congregated at one place, there should be no disturbance. Then only could they claim to be organized and disciplined; If even the few people that gathered at a public meeting, compared to the forty crores of India, could not keep themselves in order, he asked, how they could get swaraj. Even supposing they got swaraj, they would lose it, if they were not diciplined and orderly in their behaviour. Gandhiji said that without doubt swaraj would come but their preparedness must be shown my proper discipline. He had not come to collect funds but to test at first hand how far people were ready for swaraj by self-discipline.
 
 Gandhiji next touched upon the lingua franca of India and said, everyone knew that he was at present on his way to Madras to preside over the Dakshina Bharat Hindi Prachar Sabha celebrations. Two or three Andhra ladies were travelling with him, and when he spoke in Hindustani, they could not understand. They should all know Hindustani. Gandhiji asked:
Do you want to know the language that is common to all
Provinces of India or English?
 Gandhiji said that he was devoting his services to all in India. When that was so, he asked, which would be preferable—whether his (Gaandhiji’s) learning all the languages of India or a small proportion still not knowing Hindustani learning the language for following his advice. Hindustani was a sweet language, easy to learn, which had been adopted as the mother tongue of 33 crores of people. So he belived that they should all take up the subject and learn Hindustani.
 Continuing, Mahatma Gandhi said, swaraj cannot be retained if it came as if by magic. They all proclaimed, they would get their swaraj through non-violence and truth. That being so, they should not behave otherwise and cheat the world. Since 25 years they had been proclaiming that they would win indepedence by truth and non- violence. On that account, the whole world had placed India on a high place. Supposing in 1920 they had announced that they would win swaraj by violent means and later had won it, they would have lost it by now. Gandhiji wanted them to take a pledge to win swaraj by means of truth and non-violence.
 Concluding, Gandhijj said that he was glad to have noticed that the crowd had remained peaceful.

 But again the crowd shouted “Mahatma Gandhi ki Jai”. Gandhiji. . . said :
 I do not expect that you, citizens of Madras, would be so undis- ciplined. How can I come in your midst again, if you do not conduct yourself in a disciplined manner?
 Then Gandhiji called for the singing of Ramdhun	the whole gathering
 took up the refrain. . . . He followed the singing of the crowd with eyes closed . . .
 keeping tune with the song.  Ramdhun  terminated after five minutes.	Gandhiji
 said:
 Now you have seen me. I want every one of you to go home quietly and leave me to my work.
 The crowd, however, was not satisfied . . . They kept shouting, “Lights, lights; we want to see him.” The electrical staff . . . projected a lamp . . . on the dais and . . . Gandhiji stood in the full blaze of the light . . . for a full minute and then pleaded with the crowd . . .
I have come travelling a long distance. I have not even washed
 or taken food. There is any amount of work waiting for me. Do you want me to stay here all night to be with you?
 The crowd in a chorus shouted, “No, no; we won’t detain you.” Gandhiji said :
 Then let me go. But you must first of all go home quietly. That is my request to you. Are you prepared to do so?
 “Yes”, came the unanimous answer followed by a shout in Tamil “pogirom”libtech_412_footnote.
 
 Gandhiji said :
Good, go, all of you. Do you now give me leave to go?
 The crowd shouted “Yes”, and Gandhiji then slowly descended . . . and walked back to his residence. . . .

 MADRAS,
 [After January 21, 1946]libtech_418_footnoteQUESTION: There are several religions in the world. They were all orginated in foreign countries. Which one of these should Africa follow? Or should she discover
 her own religion? If so, how ?
 GANDHIJI: It is wrong to say that all religions were originated in foreign countries. I had fairly extensive contact with Zulus and Bantus and I found that the Africans have a religion of their own, though they may not have reasoned it out for themselves. I am not referring
 
 “Lord Wavell’s Version of His Talk with Gandhiji”
 
 to the rites, ceremonies and fetishes that are prevalent among African tribes but the religion of one Supreme God. You pray to that God. There are many religions, but religion is only one. You should follow that one religion. Foreigners might bring you Christianity. Chris- tianity as exemplified in Europe and America today is a travesty of the teaching of Jesus. Then there are Hinduism, Islam, Zoroastrianism and so on. You should absorb the best that is in each without fettering your choice and form your own religion.
 Q.	How can a continent like Africa fight down the fetters of slavery when it is so hopelessly divided?libtech_419_footnote
G.	I know your difficulty. If you think of the vast size of
 Africa, the distance and natural obstacles separating its various parts, the scattered condition of its people and the terrible divisions among them, the task might well appear to be hopeless. But there is a charm which can overcome all these handicaps. The moment the slave resolves that he will no longer be a slave, his fetters fall. He frees himself and shows the way to others. Freedom and slavery are mental states. Therefore the first thing is to say to yourself: ‘I shall no longer accept the role of a slave. I shall not obey orders as such but shall dis- obey them when they are in conflict with my conscience.’ The so- called master may lash you and try to force you to serve him. You will say: ‘No, I will not serve you for your money or under a threat.’ This may mean suffering. Your readiness to suffer will light the torch of freedom which can never be put out.
 Q.	Africa and India both drink of the cup of slavery. What necessary steps can be taken to unite the two nations so as to present a common front?
G.	You are right. India is not yet free and yet Indians have
 begun to realize that their freedom is coming, not because the white man says so but because they have developed the power within. In as much as India’s struggle is non-violent, it is a struggle for the eman- cipation of all oppressed races against superior might. I do not pro- pose mechanical joint action between them. ‘Each one has to find his own salvation’ is true of this as well as of the other world. It is enough that there is a real moral bond between Asiatics and Africans. It will grow as time passes.
 Q.	Everything immoral and deadly is attributed to Africa. What steps should
 
 be taken to eradicate the epidemic of foreign prejudice against us?
 G.  In so far as there is a modicum of truth in this criticism, it is  no special prerogative of Africa. Immorality and wrong are common in all countries. But you must not allow yourselves to take refuge in self-complacency either, by saying to yourself: ‘Well, others are no better than we.’ Many, perhaps most of the evils that are at the back of the prejudice against Negroes are the result of nominal Christianity imported from America. They have learnt to drink, dance immoral dances and so on. Then there are evil African customs. You must eradicate these and thus disarm foreign prejudice. It is a laborious task but a joyous one. The epidemic of foreign prejudice will then die a natural death.
 They wanted to know as to how they could set up depots of useful Indian books, and what India could give them and how they could achieve “co-operative industrialization” in order to be saved from the terrible exploitation under which they were suffering. Gandhiji replied :
 India can give you good ideas. It can give you books of  universal worth. The commerce between India and Africa will be of ideas and services, not of manufactured goods against raw materials after the fashion of Western exploiters. Then India can offer you the spinning-wheel. If I had discovered it when I was in South Africa, I would have introduced it among the Africans who were my neigh- bours in Phoenix. You can grow cotton, you have ample leisure and plenty of manual skill. You should study and adopt the lesson of the village crafts we are trying to revive. Therein lies the key to your salvation.

 [Before January 22, 1946]libtech_421_footnoteQUESTION: In the Bhagavad Gita comes a slokalibtech_422_footnote: . . . If everything goes according to fixed law, then if you pray to God, can He intervene and set aside the law
 for your sake?
 ANSWER: But the meaning at the bottom is: “Thy will be done, not mine.” God’s law is never interrupted, but that very law says that every act has its result. In the prayer for the child, father surrenders his will to God. The law works as if it were a person, and since every action tells, this prayer has an unforseeable result. You should work out what I have written. The sum total of every act is a resultant. Draw a parallelogram of forces.
 Jnana, karama and bhakti—should not they all go together? Unless you know God, how can you have bhakti? You cannot even offer him your karma.
You must not reason like this. If you have no work and so-
 called bhakti, the result will be lop-sided. Do you know God to whom you pray? I don’t. He is unknown to you and me.
 To whom shall we then pray?
 To God, whom you do not know. We always do not know the person to whom we are praying.
 But the Shastras say that He is knowable.
 Since He is knowable we search. It may take a billion years. Even if you do not believe, you must continue to pray.“Help thou minelibtech_423_footnoteunbelief”libtech_424_footnoteis a verse from the Bible. But it is improper for you to ask such questions. For you, there must be infinite patience and inward longing. Inward longing obviates all such questions. “Have faith and you will be whole”libtech_425_footnoteis another chip from the Bible.  Gita has many such parallel passages.
 
  When 	I look 	at nature 	around me, I 	say to 	myself there must 	be one 	Creator, one God and to 	Him I should pray. 
 A.	That is reasoning. God is beyond reason. But I have nothing
to say, if your reason is enough to sustain you.

  From 	a copy a copy of the Hindi: Pyarelal Papers. Courtesy: Pyarelal         January 	22, 1946  Gandhiji 	explained how Ramdhun 	was sung and how 	those willing to join might clap their hands in time. He explained :  	This custom was started in Bengal, and, I believe, with very good 	results. I wish as many of you as are willing should join this dhun.  Gandhiji 	first enquired how many of them could understand Hindustani. About a 	tenth of 	the crowd 	raised their hands. To 	the question 	how many were unable 	to understand 	Hindustani, there was no answer until it was translated into Tamil 	and then the overwhelming 	majority raised their hands. Gandhiji said, they need not 	be shy 	or ashamed, 	but he would want them all to learn Hindustani.  At 	the outset, Gandhiji said that it gave him great pleasure to be in 	their midst once again after so many years. He then recalled how 	years ago it was in the city of Madras that satyagraha 	againt the Rolatt 	Actlibtech_436_footnotewas 	first launched. He had come to Madras on that occasionlibtech_437_footnoteat the invitation 	of Mr. Kasturiranga Iyengar who had put       
 him up with Mr. C. Rajagopalachari. Rajaji had then recently come over to Madras from Salem. There he was a leading practising lawyer and was doing useful work as Chairman of the Salem Municipality. Gandhiji confessed that he had at first felt a bit put out at Mr. Kasturiranga Iyengar putting him up with one who was a preactising laywer and a stranger to him at that time. But the late Mr. Mahadev Desai who was then with him told him the next day that Rajaji was a precious friend of Mr. Kasturiranga Iyengar and far from playing him a trick; therefore the latter had selected  an ideal host for him. Although Rajaji had never met Gandhiji before, Mr. Desai had told Gandhiji before, Mr. Desai had told Gandhiji, he had been following his work in South Africa with close attention and admiration. Mr. Mahadev Desai had further told him that Rajaji would be prepared to throw away his practice in a trice at a word from Gandhiji.
I could hardly believe at that time that a leading lawyer could
 give up his practice like that. I, however, accepted Mr. Desai’s testi- mony of faith. The subsequent events have, however, amply borne out Mr. Mahadev Desai’s estimate. Rajaji as I see him today is just what he was on the day when we first met.
 It was on that occasion, too, said Gandhiji, that he had made his first acquain- tance with the late Mr. C. Vijayaraghavachariar.
 Continuing, Gandhiji described how it was at Mr. Rajagopalachari’s place that the observance of the 6th of Aprillibtech_438_footnotewhich had become a sacred day to all of them was commenced. It was a great day for him and for them. It marked the birth of satyagraha  in this country. The way in which it galvanized the whole nation into a new cons- ciousness was nothing less than a miracle. It gave him particular pleasure, therefore, to recall those glorious associations and to re-visit the place that had given them birth.
 Referring to his present visit, Gandhiji stated that he was disinclined to come to Madras on the present occasion. He was reluctant to come out of Sevagram in the first instance and later he would have liked to return straight to the Ashram from Bengal. He believed that it was providence that had brought him to Madras. Surely it would not be for nothing. He hoped that the present visit would prove as fruitful as the previous one. He added :
Yesterday I was rather disappointed with you. I tried in my bro-
 ken Hindustani, to make myself understood but could not. When I spoke in Hindustani, Rajaji himself did not fully understand it. He is the defaulter No. 1  in  this respect. He  addresses you in  Tamil but

 when he goes outside the Province, he talks in English. Well, if the sea water should lose its salt, wherewith shall it be flavoured? All over the country he is reputed to be one of the finest speakers in the English language, but he has not learnt to speak in Hindustani. I want a pledge from you here and now—and you should not only give the pledge but pledge yourself to implement it too—that you will all learn Hindustani. Should you not do even that little for the country’s independence? Do you expect all the two crores of people of Tamil Nadu to learn English? Or do you expect India to learn one of the four South Indian languages to be able to communicate with you? I say it is your dharma to learn Hindustani, which will link the South with the North.
 I want you further to contribute to the Harijan fund. You must do so as a token of your determination to eradicate the blot of untouchability from the fair name of Hinduism. Another thing I want to tell you is that whatever your religion, prayer should form part of your daily life. It should mean more to you than food and drink. I thank you for maintaining perfect discipline during prayer. I will hold prayer here, every evening. The text of the prayer with the translation of the same in the four South Indian languages is obtainable from Satyanarayanajilibtech_439_footnote. You should learn it and its meanings.  Further  all those who come to the prayer should fully take part in it and join in the singing of the Ramdhun to the accompainment of tala.libtech_440_footnote.

 If he had time, he continued, he would have gone to their latrines, their kitchen, their dining hall, ect., so that he might see for himself how they ate, sat and so on. Maintenance or proper living conditions in the camp was another illustration of fresh items that could be added to the 18-fold constructive programme.
 Parliamentary programme and constructive programme were both before the country, he observed. It was not a question of one being inferior to the other, but he wanted to make it clear to them that for India to win her independence through truth and non-violence, constructive work was absolutely essential. Those who went to the legislatures should go there primarily to promote constructive work. But in any case he was of opinion that lovers of freedom should go to the legislatures, if only to prevent those who did not want freedom from getting in and posing as the country’s representatives.

		WORKERS’ CONFERENCE, MADRAS","
    
 January 24, 1946
 The first question related to the place of khadi in the national economy and how far it would help to solve the poverty problem.
 Gandhiji said that khadi was the very foundation of Indian swaraj  and  economic uplift of the poor. He had always linked khadi with swaraj from the beginning. The more khadi we produced, the nearer we would be to swaraj. Manual labour was an essential factor in his programme, and it was as necessary for the rich also to do manual work. Spinning was manual labour par excellence. It enabled even poor people to lead independent lives. Explaining the symbolism of the charkha, Gandhiji said that it stood for ahimsa . Let them not get lost in minor controversies but concentrate on the work of spinning and production of khadi, the most important part of the constructive programme.
 Another question asked was how khadi production could be of help to the poor man when one considered that in the budget more than 80 per cent was spent on food and only 12 per cent on cloth.
 Gandhiji answered that if through khaddar they could add to the income of the people even a few annas, it would be worth while. He was looking forward to the day when khadi would become a universal gospel, though today it was confined to India. The first step he envisaged was that khadi should touch all the 40 crores of Indian people.
 A question written in English and in pencil on an odd slip of paper was next put aside by Gandhiji with the remark that it was illegible and the questioner was doing violence to an old man to send the question in that way.libtech_462_footnote
 QUESTION: What exactly do you mean by economic equality? What is statutory trusteeship as conceived by you?
 Gandhiji’s reply was that economic equality of his conception did not mean that everyone would literally have the same amount. It simply meant that everybody should have enough for his or her needs. For instance, he required two shawls in winter whereas his grand-nephew Kanu Gandhi who stayed with him and was like his own son did not require any warm clothing whatsoever. Gandhiji required goat’s milk, oranges and other fruit. Kanu could do with ordinary food. He envied Kanu but there was no point in it. Kanu was a young man whereas he was an old man of 76. The monthly expense of his food was far more than that of Kanu but that did not mean that there was economic inequality between them. The elephant needs a thousand times
 
 Harijan.
 more food than the ant, but that is not an indication of inequality. So the real meaning of economic equality was: “To each according to his need.” That was the definition of Marx. If a single man demanded as much as a man with wife and four children that would be a violation of economic equality. Gandhiji continued :
Let no one try to justify the glaring difference between the
 classes and the masses, the prince and the pauper, by saying that the former need more. That will be idle sophistry and a travesty of my argument. The contrast between the rich and the poor today is a painful sight. The poor villagers are exploited by the foreign Govern- ment and also by their own countrymen—the city-dwellers. they pro- duce the food and go hungry. They produce milk and their children have to go without it. It is disgraceful. Everyone must have a balanced diet, a decent house to live in, facilities for the education of one’s children and adequate medical relief.
 That constituted his picture of economic equality. He did not want to taboo everything above and beyond the bare necessaries but they must come after the essential needs of the poor are satisfied. First things must come first.
 As for the present owners of wealth, they would have to make their choice between class-war and voluntarily converting themselves into trustees of  their  wealth. They would be allowed to retain the stewardship of their possessions and to use their talent to increase the wealth, not for their own sakes, but for the sake of the nation and therefore without exploitation. The State would regulate the rate of commission which they would get commensurate with the service rendered and its value to society. Their children would inherit the stewardship only if they proved their fitness for it. He concluded :
Supposing India becomes a free country tomorrow, all the capi-
 talists will have an opportunity of becoming statutory trustees. But such a statute will not be imposed from above. It will have to come from below. When the people understand the implications of trustee- ship and the atmosphere is ripe for it, the people themselves, begin- ning with gram panchayats, will begin to introduce such statutes. Such  a thing coming from below is easy to swallow. Coming from above, it is liable to prove a dead weight.
 Q.   What is the difference between your technique and that of the communists  or socialists for realizing the goal of economic equality?
A.    The socialists and communists say, they can do nothing to
 bring about economic equality today. They will just carry on propa- ganda in its favour and to that end they believe in generating and accentuating  hatred.  They   say, when   they   get   control   over  and
 accentuating hatred. They say, when they get control over the State, they will enforce equality. Under my plan, the State will be there to carry out the will of the people, not to dictate to them or force them to do its will. I shall bring about economic equality through non- violence, by converting the people to my point of view by harnessing the forces of love as against hatred. I will not wait till I have converted the whole society to my view but will straightaway make a beginning with myself. It goes without saying that I cannot hope to bring about economic equality of my conception, if I am the owner of fifty motor-cars or even of ten bighas of land. For that I have to reduce myself to the level of the poorest of the poor. That is what I have been trying to do for the last fifty years or more, and so I claim to be a foremost communist although I make use of cars and other facilities offered to me by the rich. They have no hold on me and I can shed them at a moment’s notice, if the interests of the masses demand it.
 Q. What is the place of satyagraha in making the rich realize their duty towards the poor?
The same as against the foreign power. Satyagraha is a law of
 universal application. Beginning with the family, its use can be extended to every other circle. Supposing a land-owner exploits his tenants and mulcts them of the fruit of their toil by appropriating it to his own use. When they expostulate with him, he does not listen and raises objections that he requires so much for his wife, so much for his children and so on. The tenants or those who have espoused their cause and have influence, will make an appeal to his wife to expostulate with her husband. She would probably say that for herself she does not need his exploited money. The children will say likewise that they would earn for themselves what they need.
 Supposing further that he listens to nobody or that his wife and children combine against the tenants, they will not submit. They will quit, if asked to do so, but they will make it clear that the land belongs to him who tills it. The owner cannot till all the land himself, and he will have to give in to their just demands. It may, however, be that the tenants are replaced by others. Agitation short of violence will then continue till the replaced tenants see their error and make common cause with the evicted tenants. Thus satyagraha is a process of educating public opinion such that it covers all the elements of society and in the end makes itself irresistible. Violence interrupts the process and prolongs the real revolution of the whole social structure.

  January 24, 1946 If the 	report about the damage to communist persons and pro- perties is 	true, I  consider it disgraceful. Whatever may be the  diffe- rence 	between  communists  and  others,   they  must   be   respected, as  	others will wish theirs to be respected. Every act of popular 	violence is detrimental to the people’s progress.  The 	Hindu, 26-1-946         January 	24, 1946  Speaking 	of the Tyagaraja 	keertana that 	had been 	sung during prayer, Gandhiji 	said, he knew 	what a high 	place Sri Tyagaraja 	occupied in South 	India. Wherever he had 	been, whether in 	Tamil Nadu, Andhra Desha, 	Karnataka or Kerala, 	he had 	heard Tyagaraja’s 	songs sung with a 	sweet melody 	which seemed 	to spring 	from the very 	heart of 	the singer. 	Tyagaraja’s songs and 	Tyagaraja’s name 	comported ill 	with the spirit 	of provincialism 	and secularism 	that he had 	witnessed among them. 	There was rivalry 	of languages 	today which might grow into something worse tomorrow. Some 	wanted Tamil, some Telugu 	and so on. Then 	there was the feeling 	of separateness 	and rivalry betwen South 	Indians and North 	Indians. He was 	utterly unable to 	understand how 	this parochialism could 	be compatible 	with the growing 	desire for freedom 	for the 	whole of 	India. Supposing 	a Bengali 	achieved distinction in a 	particular field, 	would the 	glory belong to 	Bengal alone? No, 	it belonged to 	every Province and 	every one 	of the 	forty crores of 	India. That should be 	their first lesson, if 	they wanted to 	be  a 	free nation. Tyagaraja 	had sung 	that if all the 	attributes of 	Rama are 	put on one side and 	the glory of Ramanama 	on the 	other, the 	latter would 	far outweigh the 	former. Thinking 	of the historical 	Rama of Valmiki 	or Tulsiddas, 	one was liable 	to have 	many doubts as, 	for instance, why 	Rama banished Sita, and 	so on. 	But when one 	thought of 	Ramanama in the abstract, forgetting who Rama was and what he did, Rama at once    
 become the omnipresent and omnipotent God, above doubt and criticism. Similarly he asked them to forget and put behind them the confusing label of Tamil Nadu v. Andhra, Gujarat v . Maharashtra or Punjab, and so on, and just remember Hindustan and its glory. There was a potency in the two letters composing the syllable Ram which nothing could match or rival. Similarly there was a magic in the syllable Hind all its own. After all, the world knew India, not its Provinces—India which had resolved to win her independence through truth and non-violence. He exhorted them  to throw their parochialism and petty quarrels and rivalries into the Indian Ocean and, in Tyagraja’s name, take a pledge that they would be Indians first and Indians last, live for India and die for India.
 When Tamil translation of Gandhiji’s exhortation was given, some people shouted for Telugu translation also. Gandhiji said :
All right, say it in Telugu also.
 Accordingly a Telugu translation was given. Gandhiji then remarked with a
  laugh 	:   Is there no 	Malayalee and no Canarese here?  The 	Hindu, 26-1-1946 "

         MADRAS,  January 24, 1946 Gandhiji gave 	a very 	clear picture of 	what his views 	were on the present political situation and the future. Gandhiji’s view outlined broadly was, it is under-  stood, 	that India wanted her freedom. She wanted the freedom to be given to 	her not as though by a superior to an inferior, but given and taken 	as among equals. He hoped that the British Government would soon 	make a declaration to that effect, for any delay would complicate 	the situation and harden the feelings betwen the different sections 	of opinion in India, and between India and Britain.  Once 	that declaration was made and Constituent Assembly was set up, an 	act which would prove that Britain was acting in good faith, India 	would begin to believe that Britain was in earnest. Of course, he 	realized that it would take time before the full Indian Constitution 	would function properly. But they would be prepared to work out 	these details in patience or, he is stated to have pointed out, they 	would have been    
 satisfied about Britain’s good faith.
 Gandhiji, it is reported, also touched on the position of political prisoners and urged the need for their release.

  January 	25, 1946  Gandhiji’s 	advice was 	that the 	students must 	observe perfect 	discipline and 	non-violence. Not 	only there should be 	no coercion of 	any kind, 	but there 	should be no 	show of 	force either. To 	take a 	large mass 	of students 	to another 	College in order 	to bring out 	the students of 	that College, in 	Gandhiji’s opinion, 	would not be 	strictly non-violent. 	More than that he could 	not say. 	Gandhiji would like the 	students to 	act under the guidance and advice of someone in the city in whom they have faith.  The 	Hindu, 26-1-1946           January 	25, 1946  Congratulating 	the Sabha 	on its 	work during the 	last 25 years, 	Gandhiji said that 	what had been achieved so 	far was certainly 	praiseworthy. One of 	the previous 	speakers, Mr. 	T. Krishnaswami, 	had used a type 	of English-mixed 	Hindus-tani, though 	he could 	talk good Hindustani, 	in order 	to emphasize how 	far they had 	succumbed to 	the influence 	of a 	foreign language. 	He did 	not want to 	make any 	invidious comparisons, 	but it 	seemed that 	the influence of 	English was 	so great, 	particularly in 	South India, that even 	Indian names assumed an 	English form in 	many places. This was 	a kind 	of slavery. 	Why should 	they continue to 	hug the chains, 	albeit golden, which 	enslaved them? Should they 	not break these asunder 	and try to 	regain their freedom? It 	was not difficult at 	all. Let 	them at 	least replace English 	with Hindustani. 	He wanted 	Hindustani to spread 	so as to unite 	the different 	parts of India 	and not so 	as to displace the 	local Indian languages. 	He was 	sorry to 	note that so 	many in 	that gathering could not 	understand him. He 	desired to 	serve them, enslaved 	as they were. It was here in Madras that he first started on his service of slaves. Many     
 prominent citizens of Madras, highly educated persons, welcomed him and extended to him their hospitality at that time. They all fell in with the idea of promoting Hindustani as the lingua franca of India. It was soon after that the movement was set on foot here. He was glad to read the reports presented to him of the progress of work  so far, and he congratulated them on it; but taking into consideration what yet remained to achieve, one should admit that it was but a drop in the ocean. So it was that he appealed to everyone in the gathering and outside to learn Hindustani as early as he or she could. If only they devoted to the study of Hindustani a sixteenth of the time they devoted to English, they would attain a higher degree of proficiency in that language. They should learn to read and write both the scripts related to that langu- age—Nagari and Urdu—for the sake of India’s independence.
 Suggesting that the nomenclature for the work done by the Sabha should be changed from “Hindi Prachar” to “Hindustani Prachar”, Gandhiji said that he was not quite such a fanatic about the nomenclature as some were. What was meant by rashtrabhasha was that common medium which was easily understood by some 23 crores of the people of India, irrespective or religion or class. That was Hindustani. It was their dharma to learn this language and in both the scripts, too. He also would like Hindi workers to learn the language of the area in which they carried on their work so that they would be able to serve the country and the rashtrabhasha all the more.
 Referring to the difficulties over translation, Gandhiji said that he had decided that there should be no translation of his speech that day. It would save time, for one thing. Furhter, they could read what he said in the newspapers later on or gather the substance from friends.
 It was good that they had all contributed to the Silver Jubilee Fund and come there in such large numbers. But he had seen how they had also committed a serious breach of discipline in rushing pell-mell and sitting here, there and everywhere, instead of occupying the seats allotted to them If they did not learn to observe discipline in their everyday life, how would they be able to manage the affairs of a free India, he asked. It should be their sankalpalibtech_467_footnotethat  swaraj  should  be  run  on the  basis of discipline. Everyone should learn to obey laws and regulations in order to promote constructive national work. Disobedience to be non-violent had to be civil; it did not mean breaking of any and every law. That would lead to chaos and mob rule. He did not wish to live to see mob rule in India. His desire to live for 125 years was in order to serve the cause of truth and non-violence. That presupposed the observance of strict discipline on their part.
 
 
 
 Gandhiji said that he did not want to take more time. He thanked them for the silence they had maintained and bade them good-bye.

 Gandhiji said that he did not put through a comprehensive prayer programme as the meeting was not observing perfect silence. He was, however, glad that the position improved during Ramdhun.
 Gandhiji declared that henceforth there would be no translation of his speech in Tamil or Telugu.libtech_468_footnoteThose who did not care to know Hindustani should afterwards gather from newspaper reports or from friends what he had said. If they did not wish to hear him in Hindustani, he was prepared to go away without saying anything. The incident had pained him greatly, he said. His appeallibtech_469_footnoteof the previous seemed to have fallen on deaf ears.
 They should at least observe elementary rules of courtesy. The rule was that even if a child was entrusted with authority, everyone should implicitly obey his or her instructions. He had heard that on the previous evening one child was crushed in the crowd. It had given him much pain. Their joining in the prayer was a meaningless thing, if it did not teach them to show consideration to women and children and give them precedence. They should let women and children go first. Why should there be such unseemly hurry to depart after the meeting?
 Finally Gandhiji exhorted them to observe perfect discipline in the indepen- dence Daylibtech_470_footnotemeeting. He was the author of the independence Pledgelibtech_471_footnote. He wanted to live and die for India’s independence. Any indiscipline on their part would hurt him deeply. It would delay the coming of swaraj. The Independence Pledge laid it down that independence had to be won through truth and non-violence. This required on their part adherence to strict discipline. Violence did not merely mean causing physi- cal injury. It means also giving provocation or causing inconvenience to others. To
 
 indulge in abuse or to goad others into acts of violence was worse than direct physical violence.libtech_472_footnote

		WORKERS’ CONFERENCE, MADRASlibtech_473_footnote","
    
 January 26, 1946 Gandhiji singled out for his first answer his favourite topic, Harijan uplift. He categorically called on the constructive workers   to   make   Harijan   uplift   a major
 programme. While he agreed that a large majority of the people had advanced views on this question, the action taken in this regard, he regretted, was like a speck in an ocean. Their question was what step should be taken for the complete amelioration of the condition of the Harijans. He had again and again answered such questions. He would repeat that steps such as inter-dining of caste Hindus with Harijans, voluntary admission of Harijans into temples—he considered this as a vital programme—and accessibility of Harijans to roads and water sources would alone give the Harijans
 
 equal status with the caste Hindus. To depend on the Government for throwing open the temples to Harijans was to expect too much of them. People alone could volun- tarily take the Harijans into temples and give them real temple-entry based on a change of heart.
 Through another answer, Gandhiji announced that non-violence was also a principal item in the constructive programme. He averred that violent acts such as arson and causing injury to others would not bring them Ramarajya, their birthright. Non-violence alone would lead them to freedom. But what happened? They had freedom almost in their hands and, through violent acts, they were, as it were, throwing it away into the sea.
 Concluding, Gandhiji stressed the importance of co-operating with the Hari- jans and helping them to keep their places and persons clean.
 As a few minutes of the allotted time still remained, Gandhiji invited more questions and answered them. The answers only reinforced what he had already said.

OF HARIJANS, MADRASlibtech_474_footnote","
    
 January 26, 1946
 At the outset, Mahatma Gandhi expressed his great pleasure in seeing before him such a large gathering of Harijans. He was also glad to notice the great awaken- ing among them.
 Englishmen often put the question, what the caste Hindus were going to do for the solution of the problem of untouchability, if the country achieved freedom? They further asked what had the people done for Harijans? Mahatmaji admitted that the question was pertinent; but at the same time he wished to make it clear that untouchability did not exist in such a horrible form, as their European friends wanted to make out.
 In this connection, Mahatma Gandhi referred to his South African experience and said that there all Indians were regarded by the European people as untouchables. An Indian might be a merchant or a barrister. Still he was a ‘coolie’, so far as the Europeans there were concerned. Separate places were allotted for the residence of Indians. There were also other disabilities. Therefore it could not be said that Euro- peans did not observe untouchability. There might not be untouchability amongst themselves; but they treated Indians in South Africa as untouchables. He did all he could to remove that kind of untouchability while he was in South Africa. After
 
 returning to India he had devoted himself to the removal of untouchability in this country.
 “Would the conditions of Harijans be the same, or would it imprive when India attained freedom?” was another question asked. He visualized that there would not be any question of untouchability in free India. Their Hindu brethren would see to it that untouchability was put to an end and that all Harijans were acknowledged equals. Crores of Congressmen would devote themselves towards that end. They would work for the removal of untouchability and die for it. In his addresslibtech_475_footnoteto the constructive workers, he had stated clearly the nature of work [and asked] the workers to strive sincerely for the removal of untouchability. It was not enough, if a few Harijans rose to high positions in life such as barristers or High Court judges. For the uplift of the community as a whole, all of them must strive. They must educate themselves. They must fight and win their own freedom, not by violent means, but through truth and non-violence. Untouchability should disappear by winning the hearts of the caste Hindus through peaceful means.
 Mahatma Gandhi then went on to explain what was meant by real freedom. It did not mean freedom to do as they pleased. It meant freedom to do their duty, freedom to abstain from drink, and freedom to work for their own uplift. In this connection Gandhiji explained the significance of the term ‘Harijan’ by which he preferred to call them. The term signified people of God. He who nurtured hatred or ill-feeling towards another could not be a man of God. The Harijans had borne their sufferings patiently for ages without retaliating. Therefore they deserved to be called Harijans. True to that expression, they must believe in God and repeat His name. They must be true devotees  of God, and history furnished them with classic examples of true devotees like Nandanar. On this occasion he did not wish to refer to the rights of Harijans, but only to say a few words on their duties or dharma. The so-called higher castes had their duties; so had Harijans. If they considered that inter-dining or inter-marriage was the purpose of their freedom, they would be mistaken. All these things would not bring about real happiness. By acquiring clean and healthy habits, by adhering to truth and non-violence, and by doing their work in life honestly and sincerely and with love of God, they would be promoting not only individual happiness but also the happiness of the community as a whole. Only through truth and non-violence could they establish swaraj or Ramarajya in this land.

 January 26, 1946
 Gandhiji said that festivals varied in character with the times. The Indepen- dence Day was a sacred day to them all, as on that day crores of people would be repeating their pledge for the attainment of the independence of India. He hoped that everybody had taken the pledge. If not, everybody should take it. The special feature of that pledge, he reminded them, was that the means to be adopted for the attainment of independence were unadulterated truth and non-violence.libtech_477_footnoteCrores of people had been repeating that pledge for the last 25 years and offering prayers for the fulfilment of that pledge to the Most High, who, though far, was yet nearer to us than our hands and feet. It was the self-same Power, though known by various designations, Allah, Rama, Rahman, Rahim, God, and so on. There was no limit to His names. They were as countless as His attributes. It was to this Unseen Power which permeated and sustained the universe that their prayers where made. It would be heard only if their means where as pure and spotless as their end.
 Could they expect God to crown their resolve with success, if their means included falsehood, deceit, violence and deception? Such a prayer would not ascend to heaven. It would only bring ridicule on those who offered it. True prayer must transform their conduct. How could they indulge in unseemly behaviour like yesterday’s, while they professed to be votaries of truth and ahimsa ? Prayer meant nothing, if it did not result in self-purification and humility. Prayer ought to purge the soul of all impurity, pride and egotism. Whilst the incident had caused him deep pain, it was not without a redeeming feature. The redeeming feature was that although one person had run amok, those around him had refused to be thrown off their legs and had not joined him in the clamour. That was as it should be in a well-behaved gathering.
 In conformity with yesterday’s announcement, he had discontinued giving any translations either in Telugu or Tamil of his remarks at the end of the prayer. Even the song was in Hindustani because he did not want to make the language of the song a bone of ocntention. He strongly deprecated the rivarly and recrimination between the Tamilians and the the Andhras which he had noticed during his visit to the South. The Tamilians and the Andhras, the Kanarese and the Malayalees were distinct, but not antagonistic to one another. They were like branches of the same tree. They should realize the fundamental unity underlying their diversity. Then alone they would be
 
 worthy of independence.
 Referring to the disturbances that continued through the prayer from the dis- tant fringe of the gathering, he said, he realized that it was due to insufficiency of accommodation. The clamour came from those who could not find accommodation. The right thing for those who failed to get accommodation would have been to quietly sit back or wait in silence outside. Similarly, if they had assimilated the spirit of non- violence, he would not have been forced to confine himself to the precincts of his residence as he was doing at present. It was because he was afraid of the unthinking adoration of the crowds that he did not go out in the open even for his evening walk. Genuine love should be more discerning.
 Concluding, Gandhiji asked them all to pray to God to either give them freedom or the strength to die for it. He said :
Let us hope we shall not have to repeat this pledge next year but
 shall have attained our freedom before that. It is given to man but to try. The result is in the hands of God. But, if our weapons are un- adulterated truth and non-violence, our prayer will not go unheard.

		WORKERS’ CONFERENCE, MADRAS","
    
 January 27, 1946
 Mahatma Gandhi said that many women enquired of him about the nature of work they might do. He had been telling repeatedly, and he would say again that women should go to villages and work there. They must attend to the health and sanitation of the villages and to the education and culture of the womenfolk. All these should be done in a spirit of love and service and not as a mere formality.
 Replying to a question relating to parliamentary programme, Mahatma Gandhi said that the question of entering legislatures was a small matter. Only a limited number of women could engage themselves in this work, whereas the constructive programme provided scope for all of them. Mahatma Gandhi added that he had no objection to women standing for election to legislatures; but they must enter the legislatures with the idea of serving the people, always keeping in mind the principle of truth and non-violence. But how many of them would be able to enter the legislatures in a spirit of service? They must also have a clear idea beforehand as to what they would do inside the legislatures. The parliamentary programme was like building from the top. Their aim must be to build from below so that the foundation would be strong and the structure good. If any mistake occurred while building from the bottom, it could be rectified immediately, and the harm done would not be much.
 On the other hand, if a mistake was committed in the other programme, the entire structure might collapse and the whole country stood to lose thereby.
 The next question related to receiving assistance from Christian Missionaries in a free India. Gandhiji declared that they could certainly accept help not only from Christian Misssionaries but from others also, if such help was offered sincerely and in a spirit of service to the country. There was before them the example of the late Deenabandhu Andrews. He was a Christian. He served India and gave his life for India. India required the help of all men of goodwill who were prepared to offer that help in a spirit of love and service.
 In reply to another question, Mahatmaa Gandhi said that the wife or dependent of a Government servant could do national work, provided she was ready to do so without fear of her property being consfiscated or the education of her children suffering. If any woman thought that by doing constructive national work  her children stood to lose privilege they might otherwise get from the Government, she should not undertake the work.
 He said that this sphere of work was large and all were welcome. It was the constructive programme that was responsible for creating an awakening in the country. It was only through constructive programme that they would be able to retain their freedom when it was won. The important part of the constructive pro- gramme was to develop purity of body and mind and to educate their children accor- ding to the Nayee Talim or New Education. Thereby their girls and boys would grow into self-supporting and independent citizens. They wanted many workers to go out into the villages and work among the people. Educated women should make it a point to get into villages and teach the children to read and write and to lead clean lives. If these things were done, the constructive programme would have achieved its purpose.
 If they had a capital of one crore of rupees, they should be able to multiply it and not allow themselves to squander away what they had.

 The business they had all met to transact was a solemn one, and he was glad to be able to take part in that function. If the aspirations of the people of India for freedom were to be fulfilled, they should learn the lessons of true discipline and right conduct, particularly in such large congregations. No doubt there was a president on such occasions to regulate proceedings and maintain order. But the order he wanted was that which was born of a due sense of discipline in each individual. The discipline should be so strong that even where it was a child of five that sought to enforce regulations and law, people should willingly abide by it. That he thought was real vinayalibtech_479_footnote. They should also concentrate on the main purpose for which they were assembled there and do nothing to mar the solemnity of that purpose and its fulfilment.
 He had again and again said that he preferred the nomenclature ‘Hindustani’ to ‘Hindi’ in this connection. The language the Sabha sought to spread was really the language of the common folk of North India, understood by an overwhelming  majority. He had also stated again and again that students of Hindustani should learn both Urdu and Nagari scripts. Some people deliberately mixed more Sanskrit words and some others Arabic and Persian words, with the result that today two distinctive streams were noticeable in the language which was one. His own view was that Hindustani was the one common language containing Sanskrit words as well as Arabic and Persian words and understood by the common people. He wanted them to do their bit for spreading that languaage.

 January 27, 1946
 Addressing the gathering in Hindustani, Gandhiji said that in that songlibtech_480_footnotethere was a prayer by the devotee that God might save his honour. He then alluded to the episode in the Mahabharata describing how, when Draupadi was sought to be shamed in the court of Duryodhana in th presence of thousands of persons, Lord Krishna came to the rescue and saved her from being dishonoured. The secret of the miracle was her undying faith in God which nothing could shake. The legend says that the Lord himself reached out his arm to protect her. The poet, of course, is here referring to the
 
 omnipotence of God, who, however, becomes a living force to those who have faith. Gandhiji said that as Draupadi was depicted as being sought to be made naked,
 India was already naked and was praying for protection from shame—the shame of
 slavery and serfdom under alien exploitation—and restoration of her independence.
 Yesterday they had pledged themselves that they would either win independence through truth and ahimsa or perish in the attempt, and yet today, in spite of the spacious grounds, they were behaving like an undisciplined mob in one quarter of the prayer ground.libtech_481_footnoteIf they could not behave well even during bhajan , how would they behave when India got freedom? Theirs was by no means  an  extraordinarily big gathering, but for a people who aspired to be free and remain free through no other means than ahimsa , it should be possible to act and obey orders as one man even if they were 400 million. If 400 million could but shout with one voice, the effect would be overwhelming. But there was a proper time for shouting as for silence. Each must come in its proper place.
 Gandhiji concluded by expressing the hope that if God again brought him in their midst, they would all be able to understand Hindustani, and there would be no clamour for Tamil and Telugu translations of his speech. He prayed to God to guide them all aright so that they might deport themselves in a manner worthy of the people who aspired to be free.

425,"January 29, 1946","ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS AT CONSTRUCTIVE
		WORKERS’ CONFERENCE, MADRAS libtech_495_footnote","
    
 January 29, 1946
 Q.	Can a worker who has taken up one item of constructive work dabble in others? Is it right for him to do so? If so, how?
A.	Constructive programme as it stands today is comprised of
 18 items. The spinning-wheel as the symbol of non-violence occupies the central place. So every worker must spin and know all about spinning. Supposing a worker takes paper-making as his main occu- pation and has to find his livelihood also throught it, he won’t  have
 
 1  
 much time left for other things. But he will be able to render some other service to the villagers besides that which he renders through the spinning-wheel and paper-making. For instance, he can work for improving the sanitation of the place and render advice about the care of the sick when he cannot take up full responsibility for nursing them.
 Supposing another worker decides to concentrate on the spinn- ing wheel only and to find his livelihood also through that, he can do so. I have no doubt in my mind that the wheel can serve as the instrument of earning one’s livelihood and at the same time enable the worker to render useful service to his neighbours. The thing is that every worker should decide for himself what will be his main activity besides the spinning-wheel, and what will be his subsidiary activities. Whatever he does, he should do intelligently and with knowledge. Thus, in order to ply the wheel intelligently, he should know all the processes that precede and succeed spinning. He should have full knowledge of the activities that he wishes to concentrate upon and have a general working knowledge about other items of the construc- tive programme. A student of astronomy cannot know astronomy without some knowledge of science in general. Similarly a worker cannot afford to be utterly ignorant about other items of constructive work.
 Q.	Please explain the meaning of samagra gramseva of your conception. How can we fit ourselves for that?
 A.    The   18-fold  constructive   programme  includes  samagra
 gram- seva. A samagra gramsevak must know everybody living in the village and render them such service as he can. That does not mean that the worker will be able to do everything single-handed. He will show them the way of helping themselves and procure for them such help and mate-rials as they require. He will train up his own helpers. He will so win over the villagers that they will seek and follow his advice. Supposing I go and settle down in a village with a ghani (village oil-press), I won’t be an ordinary ghanchi (oil-presser) earn- ing 15-20 rupees a month. I will be a Mahatma ghanchi. I have used the word Mahatma in fun but what I mean to say is that as ghanchi I will become a model for the villagers to follow. I will be a ghan-  chi who knows the Gita and the Koran. I will be learned enough to teach their children. I may not be able to do so for lack of time. The villagers will come to me and ask me: ‘Please make arran-gements for our children’s education.’ I will tell them: ‘I can find you a teacher but you will have to bear the expenses.’ And they will be prepared to
 do so most willingly. I will teach them spinning and when they come and ask me for the services of a weaver, I will find them a weaver on the same terms as I found them a teacher. And the weaver will teach them how to weave their own cloth. I will inculcate in them the impor- tance of hygiene and sanitation, and when they come and ask me for a sweeper, I will tell them: ‘I will be your sweeperlibtech_496_footnotelibtech_497_footnoteand I will train you all in the job.’ This is my conception of samagra gramseva. You may tell me that I will never find a ghanchi of this description in this age. Then I will say that we cannot help to improve our villages in this age. Take the exam-ple of a ghanchi in Russia. After all the man who runs an oil-mill is a ghanchi. He has money but his strength does not lie in his money. Real strength lies in knowledge. True knowledge gives a moral standing and moral standing and moral strength. Everyone seeks the advice of such a man. Take the instance of Vinoba. He is a good ghanchi. You all know what he does, and you can all follow his example according to your capacity.libtech_498_footnote
 Q. Khadi work has been carried on for the last 20 years for the purpose of solving the problem of unemployment. Now if priority is to be given for an all-round uplift of the villages, then (1) arrangements should be there for the tiller of the soil so that he gets full remuneration for his labour; (2) efforts should be made to improve agriculture; (3) if there is some spare time, spinning and such other industries should be introduced in the villages. According to my scheme, khadi and gramodyog get a third place. How far am I right in this?
A.	When khadi was first introduced, we used to say that it was
 meant for helping the poor. But at the same time I had told the country that swaraj rested upon cotton yarn. Both the things went on simultaneously. But you paid attention only to one of them. This was our ill-luck. I had brought the idea of khadi from South Africa. From there I could visualize that till we chose an occupation in which millions of men and women of India could take part, swaraj could not be achieved even through truth and non-violence. Those who have to work for their livelihood may do so. But they can spin voluntarily for their country or they can work at some occupation for their survival. I hope you understand the difference between the two.
When I came to India, then also women were carding. I placed
 
 before them the idea of swaraj as I understood it. Whether the poor earned their livelihood through khadi or adopted it as a means of swaraj, both the things could go hand in hand. I realized that real freedom could be attained only in this way. Therefore I placed before the Congress the idea of khadi. The Congress accepted khadi in 1920. You should know that till that day the Congress had no flag. When people realized the importance of khadi, the tricolour flag came into being.
 In the Aga Khan Palace I used to think constantly about the place of khadi. It is a matter of shame that I was releasedlibtech_499_footnoteon grounds of ill-health. The Government did not want that, like Ba and Mahadev, I too should die there.libtech_500_footnoteTherefore they released me.  After my release I placed before you the same idea. Was khadi only a means of econo- mically helping the poor or was it a means of attaining swaraj also? If we wish to make khadi a means of achieving freedom, then we shall have to change our method of work. Many people were disappointed with spinning only for economic reasons. To spin for the whole day and get just an anna was not enough. We raised the status of women by raising the wages of the women spinners. But at the time we emphasized the point that the spinners should also wear khadi. This was the second step.
 Now the third step is that all those who wear khadi should spin. How splendid it would be, if all the people of Madras should spin and also weave the yarn spun by them. Otherwise they can get their yarn woven at a nearby place. This is the way of the village to get all things done at minimum cost and labour. The urban way is just the opposite. When I visited Lancashire, I observed that the workers never wore the cloth that they themselves produced. For them the cloth was imported from Ireland. Some embroidered cloth from Madras was also used. Now, if the villagers or the cultivators are able to spin and produce yarn for their own use, we can save them a lot of trouble. And, if they do so with knowledge, they would be bringing swaraj nearer. This is the new policy of khadi.
 If you have understood my point, then the place of khadi is not third, but it remains first. I have made khadi or the spinning-wheel the symbol of ahimsa. Ahimsa is a unique thing. You can make anything
 
 its symbol. I made the charkha its symbol and not the rosary after due thought. If we spin just one length all the time taking the name of God, then the spinning-wheel itself becomes our rosary. Spinning itself becomes sacrificial work.
 One who having eyes does not see the light of the sun and having a skin does not feel its warmth is dead, though living. The spinning-wheel is the life of constructive work. If you take away that, all the other seventeen items will become a lifeless corpse. If we wish to achieve swaraj for the poorest of the poor and the weakest of the weak, for the crores of women, whose only guardian is God, and not only for some educated women, it can be done only through the spinning-wheel. And, without the spinning-wheel, the constructive programme becomes a mere cipher. It becomes ten if the zero is placed after one. Zero alone has no value.
 Q. Ninety-five per cent of agriculture in India depends on rains. For the improvement of farming more than 50 per cent of it should be done  through  irrigation. It is the experience of the experts that in this way alone farming can be improved. Under all circumstances this sort of improvement will have a prominent place in the economic planning of India. In case such an improvement in farming is introduced, it becomes a complete industry which goes on throughout the year. In that case the spinning-wheel do not occupy the place of a supplementary industry. If we want to ply it in the villages, we will have to think of a place for it as for the hand- loom. Please throw light on this matter.
A.	Khadi and all the activities connected with it have a direct
 relation with satyagraha. Whatever credit I have earned, I have earned it through satyagraha. I am not a learned man. I consider myself and feel somewhat stupid before scholars in Tamil, English, Hindustani and even Gujarati. But I have placed before you satyagraha know- ingly and after careful thinking. I have not acquired it from books, but from experience. I could see that khadi industry could serve as a means of achieving [swaraj]. Farming cannot take that place. Millions of men, women and children cannot take part in it [as they can in spinning]. I live for the freedom of the country and work continu- ously for it. After I am worn out, I do not wish to live; not even for enjoyment. For that matter I am always happy and never sad. If I were born in free India, perhaps I would not have insisted on khadi. But, even when I was in South Africa, I knew that India was a slave country and to remove that slavery I thought of the spinning-wheel as the means.
First of all do not possess full knowledge about agriculture. But
 the simple thing is that we cannot progress much without the help of the Government. Canals will have to be constructed, some trees will have to be cut down. We will have to use the new engineering devices. At every step, the Government’s help will be required.
 Q. An Indian villager spends about 80 per cent on foodgrains and 12 per cent on cloth. Does it not follow that agriculture holds the most important place in our village uplift scheme? Would it not be proper to give to agriculture instead of to khadi the place of the sun in the solar system [of the constructive programme]?
A.	Even if all that is correct, farming cannot take the place of
 the spinning-wheel. It is a great thing to become industrious through the spinning-wheel and give up lethargy. The key to our swaraj lies in it. When we keep the spinning-wheel in the centre and try to remove  its defects, we learn many things by the way. You must know that I talk about the charkha [only] as regards India. I would not ply charkha in the North Pole. If India understands the value of the sspinning-wheel, swaraj can be certainly attained through it. To some extent there is propaganda of the spinning-wheel in the cities. It is welcome. But the villagers have to adopt the spinning-wheel. In order to link it with agriculture, the villgers had better adopt it.libtech_501_footnote
 Q.	Is it possible to achieve nationalization of land in a non-violent manner? “Yes” came the answer from Gandhiji. He made it perfectly clear that kisans,
 the tillers of the land, should educate  kisans on  their rights and  duties, and  tell them
 how they should develop self-confidence and courage to assert their just rights. Satyagraha might have to be resorted to in the process of claiming ownership of the land, and the zamindars were not rakshasas to oppress them, for it would not be to their benefit to do so.
 Q. What should be  done  when  an  unsympathetic Indian  State  placed obstacles in the way of the constructive programme?
 Gandhiji said that the result depended entirely on the workers themselves and the extent to which they were prepared to suffer for the cause. Gandhiji, replying to another question, approved of Kaka Kalelkar’s suggestion to bring  in  words belonging to other languages to make themselves intelligible in their addresses to gatherings. If any pandit objected to this procedure, he would be only ignoring realities. He, however, pointed out the absurdity of using bombastic words like chathushpada peetham for chair and lakhini nilaya for an ink-stand.
 Gandhiji was asked as to what extent students could engage themselves in political work. Mahatmaji said that there was quite enough work for students to do
 
 alongside of their studies. They could, for instance, do a great deal in connection with removal of illiteracy. But he was not in favour of students associating themselves with party politics or controversies as they could not do justice to such work, remaining as students. If some of them felt like leaving schools and colleges with a view to engaging themselves in national work, they were free to do so.libtech_502_footnote

As there was 	no appreciable reduction in the noise coming from the fringes of the 	vast gathering, Mahatmaji called for bhajan 	.libtech_505_footnote  He 	said that he had received a purse containing about Rs. 10,000 from 	the Maharani of Vizianagaram, on behalf of the ladies of Madras, for 	which he was thankful. The Rani Saheba had told him that on account 	of the the shortage of time, more could not be collected, but had 	promised to raise the amount to Rs. one lakh within three months. 	The vast gathering before him was witness to that promise. If the 	Maharani was not able to collect the entire balance within that 	period, Mahatmaji       m.

 was certain she would make good the deticit form her own pocket. But that would not please him. It was his desire that his sisters residing in all the four linguistic parts of this Province should contribute and see to it that the fund reached the figure of Rs. one lakh.
 Explaining what he proposed to do with the money, Gandhiji said that he was not going to devote the entire sum for work among women.He proposed to give a portion of it to the Hindi Prachar Sabha for the spread    of Hindustani among women,  a portion to Harijan work and balance for important work for the uplift of women.  He had seen many girls taking their degrees at the Hindustani Convocation. He was not satisfied with their number. He would like to see crores of women studying Hindustani in South India. All of them were aware what a “greedy” person he was in the matter of collecting funds for specific purposes. He was never satisfied with small purses. He wanted crores so that he could spend the money on deserving causes. The sum of Rs. one lakh was not a big thing for the women of Madras Presidency to contribute. Women liked to decorate themselves with so many unnecessary things. They could avoid so much waste and contribute to good causes.
 Gandhiji remarked that the Maharani had taken pity on him as sun-light was falling severely on him.libtech_506_footnoteResuming his speech, Mahatma Gandhi said that he saw women wearing a number of ornaments. He would prefer to see them dressed in khaddar rather than bedecked with ornaments. After all, character was the most important thing for women. It was ignorance that led them to wear ornaments. The simplicity of Sita was an example before them. In spite of carrying her away to Lanka, Ravana dared not lay his hands on her. Why was it? It was because of the character of Sita. India was a glorious country, full of such great examples. The glory of Hindustan was in the hands of Indian womanhood. Dusshasana was unable to put Draupadi to shame, though the Pandavas were unable to come to her rescue. It was her character that made the Lord come to her rescue. Swaraj or Ramarajya was after all a small thing. It was the tejaslibtech_507_footnoteof Hindustan that mattered. If the womanhood of India attained her complete tejas, the foreigner would not be here. Therefore he would impress upon them that their real asset and ornament was character and not dresses and jewels.
 Finally Gandhiji spoke about untouchability and said that some of them could not drink even water given by a Harijan. Not only that, they would not give water to a Harijan in a pot. They would pour water only into his hand. This attitude should go. Other differences like Hindu, Muslim, Christian and Parsi should also go. They should strive for unity and that unity could be achieved early by all of them speaking a common language, Hindustani.
 Glancing at his watch, Mahtamaji said that it was time for him to leave. He would, therefore, request them to excuse him, if he could not speak more.

 Gandhiji addressed an exhortation to the teachers to carry on their work in their respective areas in a spirit of loyalty and earnestness to the cause. He wanted them all to remember the several items of work mentioned in their certificateslibtech_509_footnoteand to strive their utmost to carry out their duties in that connection. It was true that there were certain very wide subjects like agriculture included there, but he was sure they would do their best to instil in those coming under their care the proper attitude in this matter. The one important matter which he wanted them to bear in mind was that they should all learn Hindustani. He added that they should in no circumstance neglect their mother tongue. In each linguistic area, the mother tongue should have the first claim. But Hindustani would not only serve as a common medium for the different language areas of their own Province but also as a means of communication between the South and the rest of India.
 Another important thing he would urge them to bear in mind was that they should learn all about their immediate surroundings and gradually extend their knowledge in a widening circle to things outside. Mere memorizing would not carry them far. He remembered how as a young boy he was made to memorize “London is on the Thames’ as part of his geography lesson. That kind of knowledge was not much good.
 Knowledge directly derived from anything was much better than knowledge derived through a written lesson or through symbols. A child would have a much better idea of a charkha when it saw one and how it worked than by reading or hearing about it. That was an essential basis of Nayee Talim.
 These were some of the ideas which he thought he might place before them, and he wanted that they should adopt whatever seemed good to them therein.

 January 29, 1946 I hear many of you did not understand the  bhajanlibtech_510_footnotelibtech_511_footnoteof  Guru Nanak which was just sung.  He had written the  bhajan for men  and
women who are ignorant.  He says, some people go to the forest to
 realize God. God is for the many crores of people on earth and not for those who go to the forest alone. In the forest live tigers, lions and bears. Therefore ordinary people cannot be expected to go to the forest. ‘Why do you go to the forest?’ he asked. When God is inside you, be in this world and do the work of this world. Gambling and operating on the sharemarkets are not among the works of the world. God is everywhere. He is in the scorpion. He is in the dog. The dog may bite us, God is good. God is not far away in the forest, but He is within us.libtech_512_footnote

431,,"ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS OF HINDI
		PRACHAR SABHA STAFF AND WORKERSlibtech_515_footnote","
    
 Jaunary 30, 1946 Gandhiji, who made many kind enquiries about them, cracked many jokes and,  saying that he considered them as members of his own family, urged that not only
 Hindi workers but the members of their families should also learn Hindustani. He compared the Hindi pracharak to the Gantotri, the place from where the Ganges flows. He said, the pracharak should be the fountain-head of learning, and through him the knowledge of Hindustani should spread throughout the country.
 Gandhiji then invited questions. Pandit Sivarama Sharma of Guntur asked whether pracharaks could take up work in public educational institutions, such as schools and colleges in connection with the teaching of Hindustani to the students there.
 Gandhiji replied that there was no antagonism regarding any place of work for Hindi pracharaks. It was their aim to spread Hindustani all over the country and they should deem it part of their duty to teach Hindustani to everyone who desired to learn it.
If Lord Wavell wants to learn the language, I will send him my
 best Hindustani pracharak or myself take up the duties of teaching that language to him.
 Answering another question, Gandhiji said that the Hindustani workers should try also to contribute their bit to the assimilation in Hindustani of whatever was best  in the local languages and even in other languages. Works like those of Valmiki,
 
 Kamban and Shakespeare would enrich any language. Further they should continue their studies side by side with their work as pracharak and, if possible, organize extension lectures and postgraduate courses in this connection. Another thing pracharaks should do was to try to bring about a synthesis, and exchange with other Indian languages so that the benefit would be mutual as between Hindustani and those languages.

432,"January 30, 1946","ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS AT MEETING OF
		TEACHERS AND STUDENTS","
    
 January 30, 1946 Gandhiji first expressed pleasure at the very large gathering that  had assembled. He said that though of late he had not participated in students’ meeting,
 yet his affection for them remained the same as before. He believed that one could do more service by silent work, and this was borne out by his experience not only in South Africa, where he had moved with Madrasis, but also in this city during his short stay. People here, to whom he had not spoken, had clearly understood what he stood for and what shape their service to the country should take.
 The rest of the address was in the nature of replies to questions that were placed  in his hands earlier. Gandhiji had walked into the meeting bringing the questions with him. First he remarked in a humorous vein that while he would answer the questions, he would not like to leave the palce before receiving their promised purse. Before he commenced his answers, he put his usual question as to how many of them could understand him in Hindustani. The response was not good. On this he remarked  that it was a matter for regret that, in spite of the fact that the Sabha had been working amongst them for twenty-seven years, they had not learnt Hindustani in large  numbers. He expected that students, at least all of them, would learn Hindustani and said that learning Hindustani was not as costly as college education. It was much easier also to learn the language.
 Next the subject of utilization of collections made for the presentation of a purse to Gandhiji was touched upon by him. Gandhiji said that since they had made the collections with a view to giving him the amount towards  the  Hindi Prachar Sabha Fund, law and propriety required that they should  not  lay  any condition on the utilization of the amount. He did not wish to say anything more on this point.
 Gandhiji’s opinion was sought on the practice prevalent amongst students of conversing in English. Gandhiji condemned such a practice and said that this ought not to be. Though the English language could be compared to a gold chain, yet it
 bound their hands and feet in slavery. The mother tongue could be compared to their mother, and to drop it in favour of English was like letting down their mother. Every student should know two languages, his mother tongue and Hindustani.
 Q.	Could girl students use cosmetics and boy students ape it?
 Gandhiji’s reply was that only inanimate things like stone-images required frequent polishing, and that human beings’ natural beauty required no cosmetics. He added that in this country, where poverty and starvation was rampant, it was foolish to waste money on such luxuries.
 Q. Do you approve of smoking which was at present very common amongst students?
 Gandhiji said that he did smoke once or twice when he was young and, reflecting on it, he was really ashamed. But, while he did it stealthily, students were doing it at present openly (laughter). Smoking was as had as drinking, whether it was indigenous stuff or foreign, and should be avoided.
 Replying to another question solicited Gandhiji’s view on the poor percentage of students using khadi, Mahatmaji observed that khadi had its birth for freedom. He reiterated that if they wanted freedom quickly, students must not only wear khadi, but also make it out of their own spun yarn.
 Gandhiji referred the students to his latest booklibtech_516_footnoteon constructive work, when he was told that many students did not believe in the constructive programme. He added :
How could work amongst Harijans and aboriginal prove un-
 interesting? To say that constructive programme was uninteresting was a vote in favour of slavery.
 When asked for his advice to students who were intolerant, Gandhiji said that tolerance was the first virtue that a student should develop. He added :
If anyone says that India can gain independence through the
 sword, I would patiently hear him, even though I have been preaching truth and non-violence for the last twenty years for winning swaraj.
 Gandhiji, full of emotion, referred to violence such as causing destruction with the atom bomb and the victory won thereby, and said that he had applied his mind to this point. He felt that truth and non-violence were really more powerful than the atom bomb.
 “I am not afraid of the atom bomb,” he remarked. While they could cause physical injury, they could not kill their soul. Once they had the determination that they could not be conquerred by violence, victory was theirs; for a moral protest
 
 against evil was itself a victory.
 Finally Gandhiji exhorted the students to think on the various problems; for students who could not think for themselves could not learn anything.

433,"January 30, 1946","SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING, MADRAS","
    
 January 30, 1946 Taking for his theme the text of the bhajan song—“With the grace of the Lord, everything can be achieved”—Gandhiji said, the persistence of the noise from one
 section of the crowd was such that it seemed that only God’s grace could bring about perfect silence in that gathering. For his part, he thought, it would be impossible for him also to speak when so many were “making speeches” at the other end of the gathering. Were a similar meeting held under the auspices of the Government, there would surely be silence enforced with a lathi. But here there was only the appeal of the volunteers, which they in their sense of freedom did not care to obey. He knew they did so because of their love for him, and in their desire to see him closer. They would not be denied. But they should learn to discipline themselves in such matters and even to deny themselves what they wanted, if it was harmful to discipline and general good. How could they do it unless they became filled with Rama for, as the bhajan song went, when they became saturated with Rama all else would be  eliminated.
 In Madras, he knew, thousands were addicted to liquor. The consequent evil was enough to break one’s heart. When the Congress was running the Ministry, drink was abolished in different areas. Liquor revenue fell, but the people were happy and their wives and children had a square meal and a happy home. Had the reform come from within and not as a result of something from without, then it would have been far more good. When could such a phenomenon happen? Only when people were saturated with Rama and Gurukripa—God’s grace—as the song went.
 Should a rich man offer them gold or silver from his safe room, people would crowd to his gates. But of what use would gold and silver be to a man, really? Gurukripa was the greatest and most valuable help one could have. God is known by different names but God is One. When His grace filled one’s being, nothing was impossible for one to achieve.

434,"January 30, 1946","SPEECH TO CONGRESS
WORKERS, MADRASlibtech_517_footnote","
    
 January 30, 1946 Gandhiji asked, how many of them could follow his speech. About fifty people raised their hands. Noticing that Mr. Kamarajlibtech_518_footnotewas not among the number,
 Gandhiji laughingly remarked: “You too?” Gandhiji said that he had hoped that Congress workers at least would all have learnt Hindustani by now, but he was dis- appointed. The Congress resolution about lingua franca and conducting all business  in Hindustani should, he took it, be binding on them all. It was a misfortune, indeed, that after so many years of emphasis on the importance of Hindustani, Congressmen were yet unacquainted with the language. He knew the hold of English on the people of this country. He had seen sign-boards before business premises showing Indian names in Roman characters. That indicated the extent of the slavery of the people of this country to the foreign language.
 Gandhiji paid a tribute to the late Mr. S. Satyamurti, and said :
 He was a fine man, but I used to quarrel with him, asking him whether he would speak in English in Northern India.
 Pointing to the writing on the mike before him (giving the name of the radio company concerned in Roman script) Gandhiji said that provided another illustration of his statement. But how did English or other Western people and firms go about the work? They tried to reach the people by boosting their own ware in the language of the people.
 It was the duty of the people to throw off this slavery to a foreign language. A common language spoken by the bulk of the people of the country could alone be the medium linking all parts of India, and such a language was Hindustani. Local provin-  cial affairs should be transacted in the local provincial language; for all-India
 
 purposes and inter-provincial communication Hindustani should be the medium.
 Gandhiji then invited those present to ask him questions. If they had no ques- tions to ask, he would like to talk to them about the charkha for some time.
 The first questioner, speaking in English, requested Gandhiji to tell them something about the future.
GANDHIJI (humoursly): What is ‘future’? Is it a horse? Say it in
 Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam or Kannada. Only God can say what is in the future. I am an ordinary man. I  have not read as much as some  of you. If I wrote ‘B.A.’ behind my name, people will laugh at me. Much less can I write ‘M.A.’ I cannot call myself Barrister-at-Law either. I have been removed from the rolls by the Inns of Court because I went to jail.
 The gentleman repeated his question in Tamil. Gandhiji, replying in Hindus- tani, told him that he could not foresee the future; the future rested with the Almighty.
 QUESTION: What is the easy method of learning Hindustani?
 GANDHIJI: Devote to it one-sixteenth of the time you have spent in learning Engish. That is, if you have spent sixteen years learning English, spend one year for Hindustani. libtech_519_footnote
 Tell me beforehand when you want to take my picture. Then I will close my eyes so that they may not become blind (laughter).
 Continuing, Gandhiji said that he could not tell them anything about the future. They might ask him about the present, if they chose, since talking about the past was not much good.libtech_520_footnote
 Gandhiji said that he would answer such questionslibtech_521_footnote, as he could, within the few minutes still available to him. Referring to the complaint of the Harijan sweeper, Gandhiji said that it was a matter over which they should ponder deeply. If it was true, it was a matter very much to be regretted. He wanted that all Congressmen should place God in their hearts and act as their conscience dictated. Then everything would go all right. If they should observe distinctions such as Hindu, Muslim, Parsi, untouchable and so on, the nation would go to ruin.
 Answering another question, Gandhiji said that it was part of the law of his life
 
 that he should pray to God, be it Krishna, Rama, Allah or Christ. They were all one to him. All religions to him appeared to be like branches of one and the same three. In  his view, there was no conflict between different religions. He did not pray in the manner he did with any ulterior motive of preaching Hinduism or any particular reli- gion. He merely prayed to God. If people misunderstood that, he was not to blame. People were welcome to join in the prayer, if it pleased them; otherwise they might keep away and leave him alone.
 Another member asked a question in regard to the elections to the legislatures, Congress committees and Congress executive bodies. Gandhiji said :
How can I answer this question? I am not even a four-anna
 Congressman. Much less can I give you advice in such matters. The advice I may give you, you may not find of much use. These are questions which you should ask to the President libtech_522_footnoteof the Congress, who is a great and good man. You should ask these questions of a man like Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Patel or other members of the Working Committee. And, whatever Congress decides, it is open to you to abide by it.
 It is true, Gandhiji added, that he had been connected with the Congress for many years and had also fought the Government on behalf of the Congress. To some extent he had also been responsible for shaping its Constitution. But his advice was given to the Congress Working committee, if and when it sought his advice. So far  as they were concerned, such questions should be put to the Working Committee or the Congress President. His own particular department was constructive work. They were welcome to ask him questions on that subject.
 Gandhiji stated that he met them because, having come all the way to Madras, he did not want to omit meeting Congress workers. But he did not want to enter into complicated political matters which were not within his province.
 One member observed that constructive work was also related to politics. Gandhiji agreed that it was in a way related to politics, but to him it was pure constructive work.
 One gentleman asked whether the the spread of Hindustani would not prejudicially affect the local languages.libtech_523_footnote
 QUESTION: What place should the Congress assign to people who had carried on black-marketing activities during the last War and what punishment should be given to them?
 
 
 Gandhiji said that if he was a Congressman, he would say, they should be horse-whipped non-violently. But as a man of out-and-out non-violence, he preferred  to keep mum. Gandhiji added that he had exceeded the time which had been allotted for the function, and he asked leave of them to go.
 One member asked him a question as to whether the rulers should not learn the language of the people rather than the people learn the language of the rulers. Gan- dhiji said that this was the proper thing to do. The rulers should learn the language of the people. But as it was, the people had allowed themselves to be suppressed and their language to be dominated by the language of the ruler.

The theme 	was that after 	Ravana’s death, Hanuman 	goes to 	Sita in 	Ashoka Vatika and 	asks her :  Mother, 	give me your permission and I shall severely punish all the 	rakshasis  who 	have been torturing you.

 S.  As soon as I go home I shall dictate it to Jagadisan, if he can come to me   and send it to you. Will you let Pyarelal read it out to you?
G.	You dictate it to Jagadisan tomorrow and send it to me. I
shall read it before I go to Madura.
 S. No, it will take me at least two or three days. I have to do it in bits. Marvellous as my doctor is, he has not made me well enough to do it tomorrow.
 Sastriar was full of the Ramayana. He regretted that the great epic was not read more generally and that its ideal did not animate the people as of old. [He added]
 S. The Ramayana has no parallel. When  Sita  had  repulsed  the  evil- intentioned Ravana with the tejas of the purity the rakshasis came to her and said:
 You do not know the world. Else you would not have refused what is being offered to you.
 The Divine Lady’s reply was :
 Your city is beautiful, the buildings are grand, and there is every mark of civilization, but are there not two or three people who feel the wrong and can say the truth to Ravana?
 That is the duty we owe to friends and that we fail to discharge. I have done that for you once or twice and, as for you, do it, and sometimes publicly, much to the consternation of everybody.libtech_528_footnotelibtech_529_footnoteBut it is the noblest office of friendship.
 Tell me, Rajagopalachari, out of hundred people that go wrong, is not there one whom a timely warning could have saved? Please do not thin that I am preaching at the Mahatma. I am making a confession. I have also failed in that duty sometimes.
 S.    (turning to Bapu): You are a seeker after truth.  You and I are poles asunder  in many things. I have differed from you, and you have said so without reserve.  But I  am also a follower of truth, though at a great distance from you. The eternal truths propounded by Valmiki in the Ramayana have been the greatest source of inspiration to me. I feel, I have failed to do my duty by not giving to the people what I have found for myself in that great epic.
 Gandhiji reminded him of the lectures on the Ramayana that he had delivered, and suggested that they should be printed. But that was not enough for him.
 

 
 S. If I live for some time more and good Jagadisan can spare time, I might  still be able to make some atonement.
 G. Jagadisan is your admirer and a devoted follower.  He will  be always at your disposal, unless, of course, the doctor thinks that you should not be disturbed. Then he will just not be at home.
 S. (with a hearty laugh): So,  like  Rama,  you  teach  falsehood. When Sumantra was driving Rama, Lakshmana and Sita to the jungle, Rama asked him to drive fast: “Man, why prolong the agony? Go fast and, if my father is angry, tell him you did not hear him.”
 S. (to the doctorlibtech_530_footnote): Yes, you are right. A good conversationalist hears more  than he talks. But they say ‘once a schoolmaster, always a school-master.’ So I have gone on.
G.	And we shall bear witness to that.
 S. Well, this might be my last meeting with you. I am not in a  position to  say, ‘I will come to see you when you return from Madura.’ So I wanted to talk, and have talked. Now it is your turn.

RALLY, MADRASlibtech_533_footnote","
    
 January 31, 1946
 Gandhiji said that he was under the impression that the entire programme was over with the previous evening. But he was told in the night that there was this rally and that he must be present. He was glad, he was able to attend the function and he was really pleased to meet them all.
 Referring to the service rendered by the several departments in making the celebration a success, Gandhiji profoundly thanked them for their help and co- operation. Without the aid of volunteers, he could not believe that they could have got through such an important celebration. He considered volunteers as those sworn to non-violence, as against the police and the military who were pledged to violence and who dominated over the people. It was only with this impression that he had appealed as early as 1920 that they should organize volunteer corps all over the country so that service rendered sincerely and non-violently could get them freedom quickly.
 They must learn thoroughly how to control large gatherings with tact, poli- teness and calmness, without distinction of rich and poor, civilized and uncivilized. He knew that people would keep order, if a policeman appeared on the scene because he posed himself as their master and paraded his lathi. But this was not what he want- ed. They must make people understand by persuasion what they should do through tru-  th and non-violence and show that these forces of law and order were only for serving the people. He had attended many parades and rallies in foreign countries where the police took an oath that they would serve the public. In London, which was considered to be very advanced in policing, policemen took an oath that they would render service to the people through their work. Why not the Commissioner of Police here take a similar oath? If the servants of Hindustan understood this particular view-point, then freedom could easily be obtained.
 Referring to the frequent noisy behaviour of the large concourse at prayer meetings in spite of the efforts of volunteers to keep silence, Maahatmaji said that the volunteers should bear in mind what he had said about their duties and make a practical demonstraton that they were following them by keeping perfect order and silence in that evening’s prayer meeting.

 January 31, 1946
 Addressing the gathering, Gandhiji said that the Mess Committee had fed about 50,000 people, and he heartily thanked them for it. Proper feeding had kept people in good spirits to get through the important business at the conferences and meetings. They had done this job well and taken away a heavy burden off the shoulders of the Reception Committee. What he was particularly pleased with here was that the entire show was conducted in clean surroundings. He had toured all over the country, and he felt that they had really set an example to others in cleanliness. What should be observed on these occasions by cooks was cleanliness in body and mind. By cleanliness he did not mean that their clothes should be nicely ironed. It was enough if their simple clothes were free from dirt.
 Gandhiji said that he had no time to auction the articles individually  nor  had he the required energy for it. He suggested  that  the  entire  lot  might  be purchased by a group of persons for a lakh of rupees, out of which Rs. 10,000 would go to the Harjan Fund and the balance to the Hindi Prachar Sabha. After all, they should realize that a bulk of it would be given to the Sabha as they had not reached their target.
 Closely following this appeal, Gandhiji, like a true Bania, began to canvass support for his suggestion. He singled out of the several articles a silver vigrahalibtech_535_footnoteof Gajalakshmi and said that that had been presented by a lady who stated that it was done as Gandhiji was a worshipper of God. But the pity was a worshipper of Avinashi and Avyakta (Eternal and Unseen) God. Therefore, he said, he was not keeping it with him and wanted to part with it.
 Taking out a silver idol of Muralidhara from the collection, Mahatmaji said that this was presented because he was a Krishna bhakta. But his Krishna was He ‘Who sees me but Whom I do not see’.libtech_536_footnote

 have become old and these sticks are to aid me during walks. But I would rather like to give them away in auction.’ A printed list of the articles presented was then handed to Gandhiji. It was in English. Gandhiji remarked humorously: ‘I think this is in English to avoid the Tamil-Telugu controversy (laughter). But I do not approve of this. You must print it in Hindustani’”.

 All of them were aware of the part played by women in the cause of India’s freedom. The work connected with the Kasturba Fund was a different one. Here they received training for working in and among the villagers. He was looking forward to the day when it would be possible to say that women were working in the villages in large numbers. They must remove illiteracy and also improve the condition of village women. Then only would they have real swaraj and the ability and strength to retain political freedom when it was won.

441,"January 31, 1946","SPEECH AT WORKERS’ RALLY, MADRAS libtech_539_footnote","
    
 January 31, 1946
 Gandhiji said that he had been delayed by another engagementlibtech_540_footnoteand he was sorry for having come later than the scheduled time to the meeting.
 The truest capital was, in his opinion, one’s capacity for work. Money alone could never produce goods; only through labour could goods be created. Labourers then were possessed of real wealth, but they were not rich in worthy goods and had no property. He wanted that they should all become maliks (men of property), but not through any process of coercion. Property got through coercion would not remain with them; a stronger man might snatch it from them. If they were to become maliks, therefore, they should first learn to be non-violent, truthful and peaceful. He was a worker like them and he felt like a worker. He wanted to tell them of the joy of non- violence, truth and peacefulness. He was a servant of the poorest Harijan. He wanted them to bear in mind the exapmple of the Ahmedabad Labour Union and take a leaf from its work. There was nothing extraordinary in a labourer becoming the President of the Congress. It was not necessary that one should know English to be the Pres- ident. He said :
Maulana Azad, the present Congress President, does not speak in
 English with anybody, although he knows the language. When Maulana Azad goes to the Viceroy, he does not speak in English, but takes a translator with him, and he speaks through him. It is not as if he does not know English. He is a very learned man. He is so wise that there is hardly anybody who equals him. But he wants that he should speak in the language of the country.
 The whole country, said Gandhiji, was one. The workers were all one entity. One of them could certainly become President of the Congress. The  difference  between the mazdoor and the kisan was that the kisan stayed to work on the land, while the mazdoor went wherever there was work. The workers were taken there by the proprietors. Mahatma Gandhi recalled that he had always said that the real pro- prietor was not the person who owned the mill, but the person who worked. He him- self was speaking as a worker. He said :
I have given up my ownership of property some time back. The
 lakhs I have with me are not my money. It is intended for carrying out the work for which contributions have been given. If anybody gives money for the Harijans, it will be spent for the Harijans.
 Ever since his return to India from South Africa he had been serving the
 
 workers. The Ahmedabad Workers’ Union, which was started by himself, was a model for others. He did not suggest that even there the workers had become the owners. He  felt that the workers would come to own the mills and factories in which they worked, if they became more disciplined and wiser.
 Appealing to them to learn Hindustani, Gandhiji said that all India was one and they should learn the Hindustani language which would enable them to be one with the rest of India. Industrial workers and kisans were both badly off; they were suffering alike. If all of them pulled together and worked for their common good, he was sure they could achieve a great deal through non-violence and truth. He knew he was not understood by a good number of them, but he was thankful to them for the consideration they showed him and the perfect silence they were maintaining, though he spoke in a language which all of them did not understand. He wished he knew enough Tamil to address the gathering in that language.
 In conclusion, he prayed for God’s blessings for them and all their kith and
  kin.   The 	Hindu, 1-2-1946 "

         January 	31, 1946  Gandhiji 	asked to be pardoned for coming late to the meeting. He said that it 	was due entirely to the heavy programme that had been arranged.  Gandhiji 	then referred 	to the 	Workers’ Conventionlibtech_541_footnoteheld that evening 	and complimented 	the workers 	on the shanti 	(silence) that 	prevailed at that 	meeing. That was 	not to be found here. That labourers who had not acquired education, 	and who did not understand Hindustani, had behaved so well was marvellous, he said.  	“Were 	these workers 	responsible for 	not knowing Hindustani?”  asked 	Gandhiji. “No,” was his answer. While the Hindi Prachar Sabha 	should share to some extent 	the responsibility 	for this, 	he felt 	that practically the 	entire responsibility for 	such state of affairs 	should be 	owned by 	the educated 	people of 	this country. 	The educated people 	had neglected 	the education 	of these 	poor labourers. If 	educated people 	took a decision 	to teach 	them Hindustani, he 	was sure 	that before he next 	visited Madras—he hoped 	that this would 	happen by God’s 	will—all of them 	would have 	learnt the language.  Speaking 	on the import of the day’s special song, Gandhiji said that right 	from his youth, he was impressed by it. Dr. Bharatan Kumarappa had 	told him a few days ago that his sister was conducting an 	institution here and that the girls of that    
 school would like to learn and sing the song, vaishnava Jana Tolibtech_542_footnote. The girls today had sung the song in the best possible manner. So impressed was he that its tune and sentiments were still ringing in his ears. While the girls who sang it did their best,  he had to confess that it was not rendered in the way it ought to have been done. It should be sung with a full under-standing of its meaning and import. The song was by Narasinha Mehta a bhakta kavi, and was intended entirely for the use of the villagers. It was in a tune which could be sung by the ordinary villagers and, being sweet, was full of meaning. The bhakta, a worshipper of Lord Vishnu, through this song was trying to take upon himself the miseries of others and felt a supreme pleasure in doing so. This was its secret.libtech_543_footnote

 February 1, 1946
 Gandhiji said that many of them might not perhaps be aware that the function he was taking part in that morning had been pending ever since he came out of the jail. After he was released, Mr. B. Jagannath Das and Mr. V. Bhashyam Iyengar approached him on the subject. Besides his (Gandhiji’s) being able to be present and perform the function, there were certain other obstacles in the way which had to be got over. Certain negotiations had to be carried on with the Madras Corporation and certain difficulties to be overcome in that connection. After putting forth some efforts, everything was settled satisfactorily, and they were able to secure this land for the Harijan Industial School. It was not as if they were able to secure the land free;  but they were able to secure it at the minimum price. All of them were thankful to the corporation of Madras for that.
 Proceeding, Gandhiji said that at this juncture, it was up to them to think deeply over the work ahead. Dr. Alagappa Chettiar, the great philanthropist he was, had given them very great help. Gandhiji felt confident that Dr. Alagappa Chettiar considered his wealth as but a means of rendering service. But all the wealth Dr. Alagappa Chettiar possessed would not suffice for the cause of Harijan service. The Hindu community had committed a great sin by the Harijans by observing untou- chability. It was the duty of every Hindu to rid himself of this sin. How else could he
 
 do the purificatory ceremony than by serving the Harijan?
 There was another aspect to this harsh treatment of Harijans. All men were equals and by treating a fellowman as untouchable, a person degraded himself. The real un-touchable was the person who treated a fellowman as untouchable. Such a treatment was not only a great wrong but also a great sin. Men fortunately placed in this world, who gave for the cause, were but discharging their duty by the less fortunate, because wealth after all was a thing held in trust by the rich on behalf of the poor. Gandhiji, from this point of view, regarded that there was no need for offering special thanks to Dr. Alagappa Chettiar. All the same, he was thankful to Dr. Alagappa Chettiar for the munificent offer of help and for showing the way as to how men ought to discharge their obligation towards their less fortunate brethren. On this occasion, Gandhiji emphasized, he desired to draw the attention of everyone  to the urgent need for serving the cause of Harijans through a change of heart, for, he added, a change of heart was far more important than gifts of money or other similar help.
 Referring to the desire expressed by Mr. Thakkar with regard to the future development of the institution, Gandhiji said that it was very good that they were making provision for training as many as 300 persons in the institution. Gandhiji desired that the course of training should be devised on proper lines so that the institution might become a model one, serving not only this Province but also enabling people from other parts of India to come here and receive training. He also hoped that the pupils trained in this institution would be among the best workers in the cause of Harijans.
 Good work carried on sincerely and truthfully would never suffer for want of financial help. God in his mercy would somehow take care of all good causes. Had he not, on this occasion, sent them help through Dr. Alagappa Chettiar? Nothing would please him more than to see that his coming to Madras had been of some help to this institution.
 Gandhiji next stressed the importance of imparting instruction and training in the school in the mother tongue. Hindustani should also be taught. He was glad to note that the entire proceedings of the meeting were conducted in Tamil, though it was unfortunate that the programme of the meeting should have been printed in English. How much better would it have been, if even the programme had been printed in Tamil or Hindustani? In this connection, Gandhiji referred to an incident of the previous day when he met some merchants for the purpose of raising funds for the Silver Jubille Fund of the Hindi Prachar Sabha. Invitation to the merchants had been sent in English. He mentioned this in order to emphasize the need for getting rid of this slavery to English. Those in charge of teaching work in the Harijan Industrial School should not forget the mother tongue just as they ought not to forget their
 
 mother. He would, at the same time, appeal to them not to forget the motherland either. They should try to learn as many languages as possible; but they must all learn Hindustani which would help unify the whole of India.
 Gandhiji next suggested that the new school should be named after Mr. A. V. Thakkar. He said that Thakkar Bapa had dedicated himself to the cause of Harijans and Adivasis to the exclusion of everything else.  All the 24 hours of his day, he devoted  to this work. It was, therefore, but fitting that the Harijan Industrial School should be named after such a good servant of the cause. They might call it the “Thakkar Bapa Vidyalaya” or for brevity’s sake, only “Bapa Vidyalaya”, for who was a greater Bapa (father) of the Harijans than Thakkar Bapa?
 In conclusion, Gandhiji wished the institution a great  future  and  useful  service to Harijans. He also hoped that the institution would help to bring about a real change of heart among the people towards Harijans and enable them to live as equals with the rest of the society. Gandhiji further hoped that this Vidyalaya would maintain steady progress and that the pupils trained at this centre would, by their life and example, be real Harijans, sons of God, pledged to serve the country truthfully.

 one simple question to which they should answer without any fear by raising their hands. Gandhiji asked :
How many of you here are addicted to drink?
 Finding that a good number in the crowd had lifted their hands, Gandhiji remarked that he did not understand what benefit they derived by drinking, which was a sinful act. They all earned their livelihood by labour, and they should not spend their hard-earned money in evil habits like drink and gambling. He would advise them to spend it wisely for their own good. Gandhiji then asked them to disperse peacefully and go home.

 February 1, 1946 Gandhiji recalled his visit to the School a few years agolibtech_548_footnote, and expressed his pleasure to be present there again and see their work. He hoped that though there were
 practical difficulties, the trained boys would do their best to settle in villages and see that the work they had learnt was also taught to the villagers. Urging the removal of untouchability completely, he said that the workers connected with Harijan uplift should banish from their minds any notion that the people for whom they worked were un-touchables, and establish closer contact with them.
 Referring to the School, Gandhiji said that at present there were 50 boys under-going training. This was not enough. They should see that hundreds of boys were benefited by the school. The public on their part should extend financial help to such institutions freely and fully. Gandhiji also made a fervent appeal to Harijans and others to learn Hindustani along with the study of their mother tongue. He reminded them of the visit of Swami Vivekananda to Madras a few years back and the advice he had given them to study Sanskrit. Gandhiji hoped that some of the Harijans would aspire to become Sanskrit pundits.
 The work which the Harijans were taught in the school, Gandhiji said, was not merely intended to eke out their livelihood; it should also enable them by their conduct to make the higher castes feel that they were equal to them in all respects, and not un-touchables. If they went out doing good work, speaking good things and leading a good life, nobody would call them Harijans. Gandhiji hoped that God would guide them and the institution along the right path.

446,"February 1, 1946","SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING, MADRAS","
    
 February 1, 1946
 Gandhiji began his speech with a reference to the orderliness of the gathering, by pointing out that the noise that usually came from his left was absent that day, and that he had hoped to thank them for the calm and peaceful manner in which they had conducted themselves. But, he added, at the end of the prayer there was a slight
 
 
 distrubance in front of him. Gandhiji, however, appreciated the patience of the gathering and remarked that the prayer meetings appeared to have had some effect on them as they had learnt how to maintain silence and order.
 This big maidan was really the best temple of God. They had the fine blue sky for their roof, under which there was no difference between the rich and the poor, the master and the servant, the millionaire and the worker, or the Hindu, the Muslim, the Christian and the Parsi. With sky as canopy and with mother earth, which could accommodate thousands of them, as floor, they had before them a temple of art, kala mandir, the like of which he had not seen in any part of the world. This was a special feature of India. He had travelled in Europe and had seen many places of worship. He  had been to many mosques. He had also visited a number of temples. Before he took up the question of Harijans, he used to be taken to the temples. People believed that they would be rid of their sins by making offerings and worshipping at the temples. Though such a belief would have its own effect, Gandhiji felt that  the acts  of worshipping and making offerings by themselves would not make one pure. Purity was a matter of the heart, and it was this indestructible quality that they should aim at.
 Gandhiji then went on to say that a person who worshipped in a Siva temple would not go to a Vishnu temple because he felt that his salvation could be secured only by worshipping Siva. This sort of bigotry was wrong. It was a mere illusion. It used to be said that once Tulsidas went to a Krishna temple and fervently wished to see there his Rama with his bow and arrows. It was also said Tulsidas was able to see his Rama in the image of Krishna. This showed that faith and belief were matter of the heart and that one realized what one ardently desired and prayed for.
 In this open-air temple, Gandhiji said, they had been assembling for the past few days. they had understood the need for orderliness, he was glad to note. But he aso wanted that this orderliness and devotion should not be a mere outward show. There was no use if they appeared pious, but indulged in drink, gambling and deceit. The lessons of discipline and orderliness which they learnt at these gatherings should not be forgotten. The peace  and calmness that prevailed at the meeting was very dear to him. He was perfectly satisfied. This was probably the last meeting he would be addressing in Madras this time. But on his return from Madura, if he found time, he might address them once again in the same maidan.
 Gandhiji said that he had a special attachment to South India, and whenever he came to the South, the people demonstrated their affection for him.  Whatever work  he had been able to do, and that too without rest, would not have been possible but for their affection and sincerity. He was old and weak and he also got easily tired. His mind was overworked, but with God’s grace, which manifested through their affection for him, he had been able to do his work properly. Gandhiji said :
After all what is my work? I have nothing to give you except
 my services. If you continue to show the same love to me, I am confident, God will give me strength to serve you further in the future. It is your devotion that enables you to sit calmly for such a long time. It is your calmness that gives me more and more strength.
 Referring next to his visitlibtech_549_footnoteto the Harijan Industrial School at Kodambakkam, Gandhiji said that it was a small place where students were taught many useful handi- crafts. One should not go away with the feeling that the institution after all helped only a few students. It was such kind of work that would go for the unification of India. In South India they spoke four languages. It could not be said that there was unity among them. That was a sad thing. It must be possible for him to hear that no feeling of difference existed between the four linguistic areas of South India or between South India and North India. Untouchability had not completely disappeared from their midst. All human beings are the children of God, and how could there be any difference amongst them? If educated people created a feeling of brotherhood among all communities and ceased to think that brain-worker was superior to a barber or an oil-monger or a Harijan and thereby helped their Harijan neighbour to feel that he was equal to them, the unity of India would be promoted and realized.
 Referring to the theme of the song sung earlier, Gandhiji said that in order to realize Rama, the poet felt that he should become a saint. The poet said that one should give up outward show and keep one’s heart pure so that Rama might come and reside within. That showed that God would make his abode in the hearts of only who got rid of thier sins and passions and became pure.
 Concluding, Gandhiji wished the gathering happiness and the grace of God.

 Why is Harijan revived? This question may have occurred to many as it has to me. I may tell the reader that no special effort was made for its revivallibtech_551_footnote. An application for the removal of the ban was made on December 3, 1945, and the ban was removed on January 10, 1946. Many readers, including English and American, had all along felt a void, and they began to feel it more after the defeat of the Fascist Powers. The reason for the feeling was obvious. They wanted my reaction, in terms of truth and non-violence, to the various events happening in India, if not in the world. I wished to satisfy this desire.
 
 There have been cataclysmic changes in the world. Do I still adhere to my faith in truth and non-violence? Has not the atom bomb exploded that faith? Not only has it not done so but it has clearly demonstrated to me that the twins constitute the mightiest force in the world. Before it the bomb is of no effect. The two opposing forces are wholly different in kind, the one moral and spiritual, the other physical and material. The one is infinitely superior to the other which by its very nature has an end. The force of the spirit is ever progre- ssive and endless. Its full expression makes it unconquerable in the world. In saying this, I know that I have said nothing new. I merely bear witness to the fact. What is more, that force resides in everybody, man, woman and child, irrespective of the colour of the skin. Only in many it lies dormant, but it is capable of being awakened by judicious training.
 It is further to be observed that without the recognition of this truth and due effort to realize it, there is no escape from self-destruc- tion. The remedy lies in every individual training himself for self- expression in every walk of life, irrespective of response by the neigh- bours. Harijan will attempt from week to week to stand up for this truth and illustrate it.libtech_552_footnote

No sense of inferiority or superiority should subsist between one section and another of the community or between Hindu, Muslim, Parsi or Christian.
 Speaking of temple worship, Gandhiji said that worship of God‘s image would serve no good unless people cleaned their hearts of hardness against fellow-beings. God should be enshrined not in images, but in human hearts. He had just worshipped Sri Meenakshi at the Madura Temple because that Temple was now open to Harijans.

 Personal likes and dislikes, ambitions and jealousies should have no place in our organization. What, therefore, distresses me greatly is that dis- like, hatred and vindictiveness in private life and even in public speeches are becoming common among Congressmen; and consequenty indiscipline and hooliganism are increasing.

Though I do not read newspapers diligently, I feel that there is truth in her experience. Now that it seems that we are coming into our own, the evils complained of ought to go and calmness, rigid discipline, co-operation and goodwill must take the place of passion, indiscipline and jealousies, public and private.

458,"February 4, 1946",ITS IMPLICATIONS,"
    
 The vast meeting at Palnilibtech_569_footnotelibtech_570_footnoteunder the shadow of the Temple was perfectly silent; there were no noises. I seized the occasion to give the audience the implications of removal of untouchability. It began with touch but it would be a wooden thing, if it merely ended there. A Brahmin may be a depraved man in spite of his learning. It would be preposterous to call him one. A Brahmin is he who knows Brahma.  It is character, not occupation, that determines the man. The Bhangi is, or should be, on a par with the Brahmin in all social relations. There is no reason why he shoud not, other things being equal, occupy the chair which Maulana Abul Kalam Azad occupies with distinction. I would be happy to see the day when a Bhangi, working as such, is in the Presidential chair.
 The ulcer of untouchability has gone so deep down that it seems to pervade our life. Hence the unreal differences; Brahmin and non- Brahmin, provinces and provinces, religion and religion. Why shoud there be all this poison smelling of untouchabiity? Why should we not all be children of one Indian family and, further, of one human family? Are we not like branches of the same tree?
 When untouchability is rooted out, these distinctions will vanish and no one will consider himself superior to any other Naturally ex- ploitation too will cease and co-operation will be the order of the day.
 Having dealt with untouchability, I turned to the pilgrimage. There was fear of my being unable to negotiate the flight of over six hundred steps on a chair, if crowds of people insisted on accom- panying me up the hill which was too small to accommodate them. I would be satisfied with doing darshan at the foot of the hill. Let not the people, however, think that I was guided by any belief in the potency of images of clay or precious metal. Idols became what the devotees made of or imputed to them. For me they had no potency whist Harijans were prohibited from entering temples. I had passed
 
 by the famous Meenakshi Temple in Madura more than once before and never cared to go inside it whilst the prohibition against the Harijans lasted. How could I, who claim to be a Bhangi, care to enter such temples? Then I was sure that the God of India was God living in the plains where the millions lived. How many could reach the Himalayas? Many more have gone and more many could reach the Himalayas? Many more have gone and more could certainly go to Palni, but the crores could not. I would be, as I am, one of them.
 I was sure, too, that my prayer at the foot of the hill would be heard more than that of some devotees in the Temple itself. God knew and cared for the hearts of men. Outward appearance was  nothing to Him, if it was not an experssion of the inner. It  was  enough for me that the Harijans of the inner. It was enough for me that the Harijans were as free as any other Hindu to enter the Palni Temple for the purpose of worship.
 Nevertheless the millions who were assured that I would have darshan of the image itself would not understand this message and might feel that some calamity would descend upon the country, if I could not go up the hill. Their silence at the meeting encouraged the hope that I might be able to go through the advertised programme.
 The speech was delivered at nearly 6 p. m. But at 8 p. m. I found that I was able to negotiate the hill and, though there was a large crowd at the entrance, none insisted on joining while Rajaji and I were being taken up the hill in chairs. Thus happily did the pilgri- mage came to a successful end.
 One swallow does not make summer. No legitimate inference can be drawn from this incident. However I cannot help cherishing the fond hope that it augurs well for India under swaraj, home rule or indepen-dence, by whatever name one may choose to call the thing.
 Perhaps this article is the proper place for recording my thanks to the South Indian Railway and the staff for their considering no trouble too great for making the journey as little tiresome as it was possible for it to be under the circumstances.

 Gandhiji thanked the giverlibtech_572_footnotebut added that he was no longer able to digest groundnut and had, therefore, given it up. He said :
Day by day, I am growing older but I am at the same time desir-
 ous of living 125 years. Not that I want to live in pleasure, but I want  to do more service. I want to serve you and your freedom’s cause. True freedom is in developing freedom-consciousness. That cannot be deveoped in one year or two. Twnty-five years’ work among 400 millions is but a drop in the ocean. My prayer to God is that He should spare me 125 years to render more service. Harijan seva is an important item in that service. If you do not wash your-selves of the sin of observing untouchability, we cannot become free, nor can our religions survive long. From the time the Madura Temple was thrown open to the Harijans when Rajaji was Premier, I have thought  of visiting it. Rajaji is a servant of you all. But even ten Rajajis could not have achieved such great work unless there was public support and public opinion behind it. I want you, therefore, to elimi-nate untouchability from your hearts.

 February 5, 1946
 Addressing the audience in Hindustani, Mahatma Gandhi first referred to a letterlibtech_582_footnote, handed over to him by Mr. A. Subrahmanyam, a local Congressman, saying that there was a feeling among the Andhras that he (Gandhiji) had come to Madras to set up Mr. C. Rajagopalachari as the Premier. He said that he was very sorry that there was such a misunderstanding even among Congressmen about the purpose of his trip to Madras. Even the Telugu papers, he added, were writing that he had come to set up C. R. as Premier, and that he had made his journey specially for Mr. Rajagopa- lachari’s sake. In fact he had not even dreamt of this.  Ever since his release from jail he had been thinking of visiting Madras for Hindustani propaganda. He made it clear that he had gone there as the President of the Dakshina Bharat Hindi Sabha Rajat Jayant (Siver Jubilee) celebrations and not in any other capacity or for any other purpose. He was asked to speak about Mr. C. Rajagopalachari but he refused to do so.  He did not answer any letter received by him in this connection. This was beause he was not even a four-anna member of the Congress.
 Mr. Rajagopalachari was his old friend, and he had great respect for his con- duct and convictions. Mr. C. Rajagopalachri was quite competent to wield the reins of Premier-ship, he would do it, but to make him the Premier or to become Premier himself was not in his hands. It was the business of the pvovincial Congress Committee and the All-India Congress Cmmittee, which were the only bodies compe- tent to do the job.
 He was not interested in the elections and the Parliamentary programme. Until today he had not done anything secretly nor did he intend to do so in the future. He came to know of their misunderstanding only after his arrival in Bezwada. He had no occasion to think of it before. If it was his intention to interest himself in setting up Mr. C. Rajagopalachari for the post of Premiership, he need not have come all the way to Madras but could have done it from where he was. Therefore he wanted to keep silent over this matter and did not want to interfere.libtech_583_footnote
 He wanted them not to forget what he had said about Hindustani propaganda.
 
 Although the Hindustani Pracharak Sangh had been functioning in Andhra Desha for the last many years, he was really sorry to find that a vast number of them did not know Hindustani. Today he had blessed libtech_584_footnotethe foundation-stone of the Hindustani Bhavan to be constructed in Bezwada. He hoped that very soon all of them would take advantage of it and learn Hindustani. He would only be satisfied when he heard that there was no one who did not understand Hindustani. By this he did not mean they should neglect their mother tongue, Telugu. But Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam, etc., could never become the all-India language and, therefore, people of all languages should learn Hindustani.
 Gandhiji also referred to the controversy whether Hindi or English should be
 the common language in India. All Indian languages were being eclipsed by the popular use of English. It was just for this reason that he was strongly emphasizing the need for Hindustani propaganda.
 In conclusion, he appealed to them not to waste their time with Tamil-Talugu or Canarese-Malayalam differences and said, “God bless you all.”

 The foregoinglibtech_585_footnotewas written before Bezwada was reached at 5.30 in the morning. At Bezwada a note in Hindustani from Shri A. Subrahmanyam was delivered, the gist of which is given below :
 There is a belief spread in Andhra Desha that you have come to Madras with a view to make Rajaji Premier. Several Congressmen have been carrying on such propaganda. Taking up the theme, some Telugu newspapers have been writing even against Hindustani. Pease give your opinion on this.
 I felt bound, therfore, to give my reply. I saidlibtech_586_footnotethat my journey was purely for the purpose of celebrating the Silver Jubilee of the Dakshina Bharat Hindi Prachar Sabha, now Hindustani Prachar Sabha, and incidentally for Madura and Palni Temples. The visit was conceived soon after my premature discharge and before the Con- gress resumption of parliamentary work was even conceived. My visit has nothing to do with Rajaji being the Premier. My life had no secrecy about it. If I wanted to give an opinion, I was in the habit of giving it openly. But I had rejected the advances of friends to guide
 
 them, for I was not interested in elections and offices. But since I was challenged, I had no hesitation in saying that Rajaji was by far the best man for the purpose in the Southern Presidency and, if I had the disposal in my hands, I would call Rajaji to office; if I did not give it to myself. But the disposal was with the Provincial Congress Com- mittee and finally with the Working Committee. My opinion was only that of an individual, to be taken for what it was worth.

 How can any Indian really be averse to Hindustani? Lovers of Sanskritized Hindi are, however, afraid that Hindustani will hurt Hindi and likewise lovers of Persianized Urdu fear hurt to Urdu. These fears are futile. No language can spread through mere propaganda. If it had been so, Esperanto would have found a place amongst the popu- lace in the West. They failed because in such a matter the enthu-siasm of only a few cannot succeed. The language of a people who produce hard workers, literary experts, business men and enter-prising persons spreads and is enriched. It is ours to make the effort in that direction.
 Only that language which the people of a country will them- selves adopt can become national. However virile the English langu- age may be, it can never become the language of the masses of India. If the British regime were to be permanent, it would continue to be the official language of their Indian officials and,  because  education woud be in their hands, provincial languages would suffer. The late Lokamanyalibtech_587_footnotelibtech_588_footnoteonce  said  that  the  British  had  done  a  service  to  the provincial languages. This is true to some extent. But it was not their business to encourage them nor could they in reality do so. That work belongs to the people and their leaders. If the Engish-educated neg- lect, as they have done and even now continue, as some do, to be igno- rant of their mother tongue, linguistic starvation will abide.
 We are today certain that the British Raj cannot remain for ever. They say, and we believe, that it will go even this year. Then there can be no national language for us other than Hindustani. Today there are two forms of this language, Hindi and Urdu, the former written in Nagari and the latter in Urdu script. One is fed by Sanskrit, the other
 
 by Persian and Arabic. Today, therefore, both must remain. But Hindustani will be a mixture of these. What shape it will take in the future none can say nor need we know. Twenty-three crores out of thirty speak Hindustani. This number must have increased pari passu with the population. Obviously in this lies the national language.
 There ought to be no quarrel between the two sisters Hindi and Urdu. The rivalry is with English. This struggle itself means much labour. The rise of Hindustani will also give an impetus to the provincial languages because it is the language of the masses, not of a handful of officials.
 It was for the propaganda of the national language that I went recently to the South. The name Hindi used there up till now has been changed to Hindustani. During the last few months several persons have been learning both the scripts and have obtained certificates. In the South, too, the difficulty is not about the two scripts but in regard to English. We may not blame the official world for this. The fault lies in us. It is we who are infatuated with English. I found this disease even in Hindustani Nagar. But I hope that the illusion will now disappear. A good deal has been done in the South but much still remains, if we have to reach the desired goal.

466,"February 5, 1946",THE LESSON OF MADURAI,"
    
 The crowd in Maduralibtech_589_footnotelibtech_590_footnotecould not have been less than five lacs and may have been even six. Human faces were to be seen as far as the  horizon.  It  was  a  veritabe  sea  of human  faces.  The   long route to the race course was lined by people who were all to swell the crowd in the prayer ground. They must push on as much as they could. I doubt if the people on the fringe could even see me, much less hear me or anyone else, though loudspeaker arrangements were good and the rostrum high enough. The volunteers were not used to manage such vast crowds. People had come from distant  villages where the Congressmen had not worked habitually, if at all. Such being the case, the din and noise and jostle were unavoidable. And then the crowd had to deal with a satyagrahi in me. But my satyagraha for the first time failed. The people’s was bound to fail. They showed
 
 the greatest forbearance whilst I was passive. The vast multitude in front of me and on either side sat noiseless and motionless, in spite of the pressure from behind. But the jostling and noise from behind the rostrum continued unabated. I, therefore, cleared the dais and asked the women members of my party to go. Only Rajaji, Kanu Gandhi and Ramakrishna Bajaj remained. The latter said, the way was clear; but, as I appeared, the people became restive. I addressed the people in front and at the sides and pleaded with them to go away as I did not propose to speak. They remained silent but would not leave. So I thought I would rest where I was for the night till the crowd had either dispersed or made a way for me. Kanu Gandhi, the tempter, came again and said, the poeple would make a passage and let me go. The car would wait for me at a distance from the crowd. In a weak moment I yielded. I went down the few steps of the improvised strong ladder only to meet the same pressing and noisy crowd as before, though considerably thinned. It was not a safe passage through a noiseless, disciplined crowd for which I was pleading and waiting. It was neither  a mischievous crowd. Making noise and pressing forward towards the idol was the only way of expressing their love towards it. Here was a living idol made of the same clay as they. And this idol could not and would not appreciate their demonstration. But I proved an impatient and inefficient teacher. Had I waited, I believe, this particular crowd would have learnt the value of silence and, knowing love, probably of discipline requisite for swaraj. I shall know much better next time, if such ever comes. Anyway it is legitimate to ask whether the exemplary behaviour at Palni was a result of the imperfect lesson of the previous night at Madura. In any case, no blame attaches to anybody in the drama and nobody has any cause for shame.

 Readers are awarelibtech_592_footnotethat  I   have  become  co-trustee  with  Shree Jehangir Patel and with Dr. Dinshaw Mehta in his clinic at Poona. A condition of the trust is that from January 1 this year the clinic should
 
 
 become a clinic for the poor instead of for the rich. The conception was mine but owing to my absence on tour the condition has not been wholly fulfilled. I am hoping to go to Poona this month, however, and trust I shall be able to do some work in this connection. My fervent hope is that rich patients will, if they came, pay to their fullest capa- city and yet live in the same wards as the poor. I believe that by doing so they will derive more benefit from henceforth. Those unwilling to abide by this condition need not trouble to go to the clinic. This rule is necessary.
 In addition to treatment for their ailments, poor patients will also be taught how to live healthy lives. It is a common belief today that nature cure is expensive, more so than Ayurvedic or allopathic. If this is proved to be true, I shall have to admit failure. But I believe that the opposite is ture, and my experience also bears out the belief. It is the duty of a nature cure doctor not only to look after the body but also pay attention to and prescribe for the soul of a patient. The best prescription for the soul is, of course, Ramanama (God’s name). I cannot today go into the meaning of and method of applying Ramanama. I will only say that the poor do not stand in need of much medicine. They die uncared for as it is. Their ignorance makes them blind to what nature teaches us. If the Poona experiment succeeds, Dr. Dinshaw Mehta’s dream of a nature cure university will come true.
 Help of India’s true nature cure doctors is needed in this great work for the country. There can be no question of  making money in it. The need is for those who are filled with the spirit of service to the poor and only with a sufficient number of such doctors can the work progress. The mere title of a doctor is no criterion; a real doctor is he who is a true servant. Those who have experience and knowledge and are anxious to serve may write with a list of their qualifications. No replies will be given to those whose qualifications are not up to the standard.
 Readers will please note that work has increased with the revival of Harijan. There will, therefore, be very little scope for replying to individual letters.

468,"February 5, 1946","THE LURE OF
LEGISLATURESlibtech_593_footnote","
    
 I believe that some Congressmen ought to seek election in the legislatures or other elected bodies. In the past I did not hold this view.libtech_594_footnoteI had hoped that the boycott of legislatures would be complete. That was not to be. Moreover times have changed. Swaraj seems to be near. Under the circumstances it is necessary that Congress should contest every seat in the legislatures. The attraction should never be the honour that a seat in a legislature is said to give. The desire and opportunity for service can be the only incentive for a Congressman. Congress should have, and has, such prestige that a Congress candi- date is irresistible even where a particular seat is contested. Moreover those that are not selected by the Board should not feel hurt. On the contrary, they shoud feel happy that they are left there to render more useful service. But the painful fact is that those who are not selected by the Board do feel hurt.
 The Congress should not have to spend money on the elections. Nominees of a popular organization should be elected without any effort in the latter’s part. Conveyance arrangements for the poor  voters should be made by their well-to-do neighbours. For instance, if the voters from X have to go to Y, the railway fare from X to Y for the poor voters should be paid by the well-to-do people of X. That is the distinguishing feature of a well-organized, non-violent, popular organization. An organization which looks to money for everything can never serve the masses. If money could bring success in a popular contest, the British Government which can, and does, spend most lavishly should be the most popular body in India. The facts are that even Government servants drawing fat salaries do not, in their heart of hearts, want the British Government.
 Let us examine the utility value of legislatures. The legislatures can expose the Government, but that is the least service. He who can tell the people why they become victims of the Government in spite of knowing its faults, and can teach them how to stand up against Government wrongs renders a real service. The members cannot do this essential service, for their business is to make people look to them
 
 
 for the redress of wrongs.libtech_595_footnote
 The other use of legislatures is to prevent undesirable legislation and bring in laws which are useful for the public, so that as much help as possible can be given to the constructive programme.
 Legislatures are supposed to carry out the popular will. For the moment eloquence may be of some use in these bodies. Ultimately that will not be the need. Experts with practical knowledge and those who can give to these few their support will be required. In an organization which exists for the sake of service and which has boycotted titles and other such paltry things, the sentiment, that to be selected as candidates for the legislatures is a mark of honour, is harmful. If such a sentiment takes root, it will bring down the name of the Congress and finally prove its ruin.
 If Congressmen are to be reduced to such degradation, who will put flesh and blood into India’s millions of skeletones? On whom will India and the world rely?

Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	a microfilm of the Hindi. Courtesy: National Archives of India, and 	Anand T. Hingorani         	During the pilgrimage to Madras and Palni the following docu- ment 	signed by 259 persons was handed to me at tremendously large 	meetinglibtech_612_footnoteof 	labourers at Golden Rock :  We 	the workers of the South Indian Railway beg to place before you some 	 of our major problems 	with a view 	to get your support.  Nearly 	2,64,000 workers are 	going to 	be retrenched all 	over the 	railways. In 	South Indian Railway 	alone, 10,000 will be 	retrenched and 	till now 	more than 2,000 have been 	discharged. The Government         
 contemplate absorption of ex-service men in place of railwaymen, thus putting us against the ex-soldiers.
 We have been demanding a minimum living wage of Rs. 30 per mensem. At present the lowest wage is Rs. 8 to Rs. 15, and a majority of us receive less than Rs. 18 per mensem.
 Out of 42,000 railway employees, only 8,000 are provided with quarters, of which the majority are infested with insanitary conditions, and are without proper ventilation.
 You may be aware of the decision of the All-India Railwaymen’s Federation demanding adjudication or a court of enquiry, if they refuse to redress our grievances and accept the suggestions. The suggestions were intended for improvements in the railway system and the condition of the employees. For your reference we are giving below the sixteen suggestions forwarded to the Railways Board and the Government by the Federation:
  Reduction 	of work 	to 40 hours 	per week as 	a first 	step and further 	to 40 	hours per week for all the staff including running staff without fall in wages. Introduction of weekly calendar days off for all the railwaymen. Leave 	reserve to be increased to 25%. Reduction 	of rail 	length for engineering gangmen.  Extension 	of leave 	facilities to dailyrated 	and inferior 	service staff on par 	with subordinates.  All 	the work now done through 	contract labour should be 	taken over 	departmentally. Reduction of mileage for overhaul of locomotives, wagons and carriages.  Expansion 	of workshop 	production, namely, 	construction of 	boilers, engine 	parts, etc.  Manufacture 	of locomotives, carriages 	and wagons  in 	 the  Indian Railways workshop.  Rebuilding 	of third-class 	carriages so as to 	provide better facilities 	for passengers 	such as 	bath-rooms, fans 	and sleeping 	accommodation for long 	distance travel, etc.  Reopening 	all the lines that were 	closed and 	the restoration of 	all the 	trains stopped during the 	period of 	war and further 	expansion of services 	to meet 	the needs 	of the public.  A 	programme of house building with a view to provide  decent houses 	for  all railwaymen. Construction of new lines to suit the needs of the country. 
 
  Laying 	down of double tracks wherever necessary.  Introduction 	of rail-motor 	transport to the 	distant towns and 	villages where 	railways cannot reach.  R. 	A. F. workshops now 	controlled by 	railways to 	be maintained and 	extended to 	serve the 	need of aviation. 
 In the demand of ours for full work, living wages, proper housing facilities, etc., we request you to support us and give a lead in the matter to the country and force the Railway Board to accept the same and save thousands of railwaymen and others from unemployment, misery and poverty.
If the workers are to be retrenched in order to make room, as
 alleged in the letter, for ex-soldiers, it is, in my opinion, doubly wrong. Wrong for the ex-soldier in that they will be favoured, and a solider who accepts favoured treatment is no solider. The second wrong will be to the men to be retrenched who, for no fault of their own, will be thrown out of employment. It will not do to say they were temporary hands The State has to find work for all unemployed persons. Coming to the railwaymen’s demands, items Nos. 1-9 and No. 12 fall, in my opinion, within the sphere of labour, but whether they are reasonnable or not cannot be said without hearing the railway authorities’ side. They should be referred to  arbitration. They cannot be made a subject of strike, before the process of arbitration has been gone through. Any lightning strike is a form of dictation which is dangerous.
 Items Nos. 10, 11 and 13-16, cannot legitimately be demanded by labourers. They are passengers’ grievances and passengers, i.e., the public, can take them up.
 Item No. 10 I would consider quite extravagant. By far the largest number of passengers belong to the third class, and I have no doubt they deserve progressively better treatment, not the first and second class. Raiway-cars of the not distant future will have no classes. Classes society is the idea , not merely to be aimed at but to be worked for and, in such society there is no room for classes or communties. Until that time is arrived at, first and second-class comforts be standardized and lowered where necessary and all attention bestowed upon third-class passengers. But I cannot visualize a time when third- class carriages, no matter how distant of the journey may be, can carry bathing accommodation for tens of thousands of travellers. What is required is proper bathing arrangement for third-class passengers at railway stations. Third-class passengers are the most neglected in
 India. Railway-cars and railway stations should be utilized for proper education of the public in sanitation and cleanliness. This is not the case today. And the quicker Hindu and Mohammedan tea or water distinctions  disappear the betterlibtech_613_footnote. Why should the State recognize these unnatural and irreligious distinctions? Those who consider themselves defiled by service rendered by person not belonging to their own persuasion may well be left to their own resources.
 The association for railway passengers’ relief should certainly ventilate grievances before the authorities. Their main work should be to conduct sustained education among the passengers as to their own duty toward one another and about observing laws of cleanliness and hygiene.

 You may not know  X  but  he  is  staunch  Congressmen.  He  has suffered, too. I send you the letter which he has left with me. You will see from  it  that  Y  has  broken  faith  with  the  Congress.  The Doctor left the letter with me in order to guard against his candida-ture being approved through mistake. Now do what seems right to you.
 I hope you keep good health. The tour was quite strenuous, but God granted me the necessary strength, and it was finished without a hitch. As arranged, I hope to reach Bardoli on the 3rd. I leave here  on the 17th and reach Poona on the 19th.
 From the newspaper reports, you seem to have done fairly well in the Sind elections.

  	I got your letter. I reached the Ashram on the 6th morning. The 	issue of“Jivansakha”has not yet been found. Why are your 	envelopes marked ‘Cofidential’? Such letters are handed over to 	me unopened,  	and I can see them only when I find time.  For instance, though your  	letter had reached us in Madras, I opened it only yesterday. There 	was no scope for it to be opened during the journey. You do not 	write to Sushilabehn at all.  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	a copy of the Hindi: Pyarelal Papers. Courtesy: Pyarelal         	The Goseva Sangh which has its headquarters in Wardha was the late 	Shri Jamnalalji’s last creation. He served the public cause in a 	variety of ways. For years money-making had ceased to be his main 	occupation. If he cared for money, it was only with the object of 	financing public activities. Eleventh day of February was the fifth 	anniversary of his death,and his followers and comrades decided to 	celebrate this anniversary by holding a meeting of  friends and 	workers of the Goseva Sangh.  	An hour before he died, he was working for this cause. Gopuri, where 	the meeting took place, is his creation. His ashes rest there, and 	the first meeting of the Sangh was also held there. The name Goseva 	was chosen after careful thought. The sense of patronage contained 	in goraksha was eliminated by the substitution of the word 	seva. The Hindu believes in the cow as mother and indeed she is so. 	An American has described her as the “Mother of Prosperity” and 	the description is correct. It is another matter that they eat beef 	in the West. They believe, at the same time, that the cow occupies 	highest place amongst those animals which contribute to man’s 	comfort and    
 happiness. It is difficult, if not impossible, for an Indian to think of man as being able to live without cow’s milk.
 Preservation of cattle is a vital part of goseva. It is a  vital question for India. And it is a tragedy that the country which wor- ships the cow pays scant attention to her and her progeny. While we may not kill the cow, we definitely torture her. Matters have reached such a sorry pass that today cattle seem to have become a burden and people talk of killing them off in order to lighten this load. What could one Jamnalalji do to battle against such odds? And now even he is not among us.
 Speeches are not going to solve the problem. There is urgent need for deep study and the spirit of sacrifice. To amass money and dole out charity does not co109nnote real business capacity. To know how to preserve cattle, to impart this knowledge to the millions, to live up to the ideal oneself, and to spend money on this endeavour is real business. Today the opposite obtains. The rich amass wealth somehow and salve their consciences by giving a paltry sum out of it towards the upkeep of goshalas by untrained persons and fancy that they have acquired merit. Jamnalalji was well aware of these short-comings and was working out a scheme to overcome them. In the meanwhile. death claimed him. Perhaps even greater capacity is needed to solve this immensely difficult problem than to obtain swaraj.

484,"February 9, 1946",QUESTION BOXlibtech_624_footnote,"
    
 Q. While in conversation or doing brain work or when one is suddenly worried, can one recite Ramanama (the name of God) in one’s heart? Do people do so at such times and, if so, how?
 A. Experience shows that man can do so at any time, even in sleep, provided Ramanama is enshrined in his heart. If the taking of the name has become a habit, its racitation through the ear becomes as natural as the heartbeat. Otherwise Ramanama is a mere mechanical performance or at best has touched the heart only on the surface. When Ramanama has established its dominion over the heart, the question of vocal recitation does not arise. Because then it transcends
 
 speech. But it may well be held that person who have attained this state are few and far between.
 There is no doubt whatsoever that Ramanama contains all the power that it attributed to it. No one can, by mere wishing, enshrine Ramanama in his heart. Untiring effort is required as also patience. What an amount of labour and patience have been lavished by men to acquire the non-existent philosopher’s stone? Surely God’s name is of infinitely richer value and always existent.
 Q. Is it necessary for the mind to go through different stage of progress (including collapse) before it attains absolute calm? Why is it that even when one is awake and quite calm, one’s mind is often disturbed as in a dream? Why do such things as one has neither felt or seen in real life intrude into one’s conscious or sub-conscious mind?
 A. Before attaining perfect calm, it is essential for almost every- one to go through stages of progress. I use the word ‘almost’ ad- visedly. It exclude those who have made consistent effort in a pre- vious existence, but without complete success, and who will not, there- fore, have to pass through purgatory in this life. When the apparently calm mind is disturbed as if by dreams, it means that the calm is outward and not inward. What does not appear to have any relation to one’s life’s experience and yet disturbs shows, in my opinion, that there are many things which have associations but of which one has no recollection.
 Q. Is it harmful if, owing to stress or exigencies of work, one is unable to carry out daily devotions in the prescribed manner? Which of the two should be given preference, service or the rosary?
 A. Whatever the exigencies of service or adverse circumstances may be, Ramanama must not cease. The outward form will vary according to the occasion. The absence of the rosary  does not interrupt Ramanama which has found an abiding place in the heart.

A letter from Karnataka contains the following information:
 On February 1, 1946, at about 10 a.m. when the Karnataka Provincial Congress Parliamentary Board was conducting its business in its office in Hubli, 20 to 25 persons effected an entrance into the meeting hall without first obtaining permission of the President.
 The Board had met to discuss some improtant matters. Some of the persons  above mentioned  asked  for  time  to  make   certain   representa- tions. The President told them that sufficient time  for  the  purpose  had  been given to them on the previous day. The Board was now engaged in serious deliberations but would see them again during the afternoon. In
 reply, they said, they had further important matter to represent and insisted on doing so then and there. The president opined that their attitude was quite inconsistent with due decorum and discipline, but they continued to insist, whereupon the President said that he would be obliged to leave the hall. As he stood up in order to go away,one member of the party tried forcibly to hold him down. Another snatched the office files from his hands and was going to take them away. Yet another hit Shri Diwaker on the head with his umbrella. Persons in the hall finally came to the rescue and restored order.
If such be the case, the Congress organization will go to pieces.
 Indeed no organization can successfully work under a  system  of terror. I do not go into the merits. That work will be done by the Congress Working Committee. What is reported to have taken place is not against decency and all the rules of the game, but is manifestly against non-violence. Moreover there seems to be an indecent longing for getting into the legislatures.This indecency shows that the deciding reason for contesting elections is being lost sight of.

   Those 		who feel 		themselves poor 		without the 		knowledge of 		English may be 		taught the 		language. The 		general policy should 		be understood 		that nobody 		should be taught 		English, and that, 		when it 		is found necessary 		to teach 		anybody, my 		permission should 		be ob- 		tained.  The 		reason for 		stressing the 		importance of 		carding is 		that, if 		we learn 		it, we 		shall be 		spared the 		necessity of 		all other 		processes. If,  in 		addition to 		carding by 		hand, they 		also think it 		necessary, they 		may use 		the carding-bow, but 		I don’ 		regard that 		as essential. I see no difficulty 		at all 		in stopping 		the practice 		of procuring 		the gutstring 		of the carding-bow 		from outside. 		Good cotton 		can be carded 		with a string 		made of mooj 		libtech_626_footnoteor 		yarn. But 		I don’t 		insist on this.  General 		supervision work leaves no 		time for 		teaching things 		to others. 		It is another 		matter if, in 		order to 		improve one’s 		efficiency in 		supervision work or 		relax one’s mind, one 		finds it 		necessary to 		take up 		some other work. It 		is difficult to 		lay down 		any rule 		in this 		matter. The 		supervisor himself 		must decide. It is a 		sign of 		ignorant attach- 		ment to 		go on working till the 		breaking point.  I 		regard a 		weekly tour 		by Vinoba 		as essential. 		There would be 		no harm in 		his taking 		someone who can be 		spared from his 		work and 		who is eager 		to learn. 		The rule 		that one person 		should always accompany 		him seems laudable.   Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	a photostat of the Gujarati: G. N. 4545         	During my wanderings in Bengal, Assam and Madras, I heard tales of 	distress due to shortage of food and cloth. Reports come to    
 me from other parts of India. They support the same tale. Dr. Raj- endra Prasad tells me that the Government report expressing fear of shortage of food immediately doubled the market price. This is a bad sign. Such speculation should be a thing of the past. The mer-cantile community should be competent to curb such greed. Let them not add to the distress caused by the Government mistakes or incom- petence. There are mercantile association and chambers. If they act patriotically, they can help most to prevent panic and speculation.
 It is the fashion to blame nature for famine. Scarcity of rain is by no means a monopoly of India.In other countries, though people welcome rains, they have made themselves fairly independent of rainfall during a season or two. Here Government have used them- selves and the public to the idea that famines come when there is shortage of rainfalllibtech_627_footnotelibtech_628_footnote. Had the mind been framed otherwise, they would have made adequate provision for shortfalls. They only tinkered with the porblem and naturally so. For the official world was taught to think no better. Originality there could be none in a close monopoly organization like the Government of India. It is the largest autocracy the world has known. Democracy has been reserved only for Great Britain. And when it rules and exploits millions belonging to other races, it becomes an unmitigated evil. It corrupts the whole island with the idea that such exploitation is the best thing for an enlightened democracy to do. It would be well to remember this fundmental fact,  if I have correctly estimated it. If we recognize this while dealing with the immediate problem, we shall be patient with the present actors. There is no call here for patience with the evil. The distinction will enable us the better to deal with the evil.
 We must then first put our own house in order as far as may be, and at the same time demand from the foreign Government that since they mean what they say, let them at once replace the irresponsible executive with elected and responsible members from the Central Legislature, however arcahic and based only on a limited franchise it may be. There is nothing to prevent the Viceory from doing this today. I do not propose to answer the difficulties in anticipation. “Where there’s will, there’s a way”. This one act will restore confi- dence and allay panic.
 “Grow more food” was not a bad cry during the war. It is a greater necessity now. This can be best done only by a national
 
 executive. Even its mistakes will not loom so large as those of a nominated executive, however able the latter may be. As it is, even their ability and integrity are in question—rightly so or wrongly is beside the point in this connection. Everything possible should be done to draw water from the bowels of the earth.There is talent enough in this country for the purpose. Provincial selfshness should give place to the national want. In addition to, not in the place of , these measures, grain should be imported from wherever it can be had.
 Cloth famine can and ought to be  averted  by  telling  the millions to spin and weave in their own villages, the State supplying them with cotton where it is not grown or available, and with the simple instruments of production on hire or long-term purchase. The
 A. I. S. A. with its seasoned workers should be summoned to render assistance and guidance. This will take a few months, if the work is taken up in earnest. Indigenous mills will be called upon to assist this national process by a wise distribution of their cloth in citites and villages while the transition process is going on. Argumentation on  the capacity of mills to supply all the cloth required should cease in face of the calamity which is existent and daily growing in intensity. Mills cannot find employment for the millions of unemployed villa- gers. The educative value of the charkha is not be surpassed. But for the spell of hypnotism which rules our minds today, we shall all  realize this obvious truth, set ourselves working out the concrete pro- position and thereby restore confidence to the millions and, maybe, even to the world which has neither enough food nor clothlibtech_629_footnote.

 editions—the Hindustani, the Gujarati and the  English—are  my weekly letter to readers. But I would not be wrong, if I described the Gujarati edition as specially so. Gujarati being my mother tongue, a large number of correspondents write letters to me in that language than in the others, and I reply to them more easily and freely. If, therefore, I wrote only in Gujarati and the material for the other editions was supplied as translations, I would have to take less pains, and I would be able to enrich the Gujarati Harijanlibtech_630_footnote
 But one cannot easily give up a practice already adopted. And ignorant attachment also, consciously or unconsciously, would do its work. I know English. I have realized that my English writing has an appeal, though I do not know what exactly is the attraction. The same is true of Hindustani but to a lesser extent.  Shri Brajkishore Babulibtech_631_footnotemade me realize this years ago. I was then made President of the Provincial Hindu Sammelan. At that time my Hindi was much weaker than it is today. I gave him my Presidental address and asked him to revise it. But he refused to do so and it was delivered as it was. The reader puts up with my imperfect and ungramatical Hindi.  Thus  unlike the proverbial recluse who, hankering after both this and the other world, ruined his prospect in both, I stand to lose three! For the present, however, I wish to let things continue as they are. I cannot say at the moment where the ship will anchor in view of this, I hope, the Gujarati reader will excuse me, if he finds in the Gujarati Harijan more translations of my English articles than original Guja- rati articles. I can, however, give him the assurance that whatever translation appear in it will have been by me also, so that there will generally be no misinterpretation. I have to say “generally ” because sometimes I may have no time to see the translations and, morever, if a translation is done at Ahmedabad. I will not be able to see it at all. Be that as it may, I trust the reader will put up with this as he had been doing so far.

         	I have two typical letters about flags in schools and colleges. Some 	boys hoist the Congress flag, therefore others hoist the League 	flag. Both are wrong. My correspondents report that the mischief 	commenced by the hoisting of the Congress flag. Probably nothing 	would have tolerated. The right thing was, and is, that boys must 	not take the initative in such cases. The buildings belong to the 	authorities and they must decide whether or not to fly, which, if 	any, flag over their buildings. If boys take the law into their own 	hands, the result must be chaos and confusion plus breaking of 	heads. This would be sheer vulgarity and doing no good to anybody. 	Schools and colleges should be institution for healing communal 	breaches, not for promo- ting differences. If boys and girls do not 	learn discipline in their school-days, money and time spent on their 	education is so much national loss. The one bright thing that 	emerges from the Lahore episode is that Maulana Saheb Abul Kalam 	Azad promptly intervened and ruled that the boys who had hoisted the 	Congress flag were in the wrong.

497,"February 11, 1946","LIVING UP TO
125libtech_637_footnote","
    
 I have not talked about wishing to live up to the age of 125 years without thought. It has a deep significance. The basis for my wish is the third mantra from Ishopanishad which, literally rendered, means that a man should desire to live for 100 years while serving with detachment. One commentary says that 100 really means 125. Even today in Madras the word ‘hundred’ is used to mean described as Rs. 100, but was, on scrutiny, found to be Rs. 116. 100=99+1 is not an invariable formula in our country.
 Be that as it may, the meaning of ‘hundred’ is not necessary for my argument. My sole purpose is to indicate the condition necessary for the realization of the desire. It  is  service  in  a  spirit  of detachment, which means complete independenc of the fruit of action. Without it one should not desire to live for 125 years. That is how I interpret the text. I have not the slightest doubt that without attaining that state of detachment, it is impossible to live to be 125 years old. Living to that age must never mean a mere life unto death, like that of an animated corpse, a burden on one’s relations and society. In such circumstance one’s supreme duty would be to pray to God for early release, not for prolongation of life anyhow.
 The human body is meant solely for service, never for indulgence. The secret of happy life lies in renunciation. Renunciat- ion is life. Indulgence spells death. Therefore everyone has a right and should desire to live 125 year while performing service without on eye on result. Such life must be wholly and solely dedicated to service. Renunciation made for the same of such service is an ineffa- blye joy of which none can deprive one, because that nectar springs from within and sustains life. In this there can be no room for worry  or impatience. Without this joy long life is impossible and would not be worth while even if possible.
 Examination of the possibility of prolonging life to 125 years by outward means is outside the scope of this argument.

501,"February  11, 1946",STATEMENT TO THE PRESS,"
    
 [On  or  after  February  11, 1946]libtech_639_footnoteThe food situation brought the Private Secretary to H. E. the Viceroy to me.  I had many meetings and appointments up to a fairly
long time.  These I  could not disregard, and I  do not know  how to
 fly, and hope I may never have to do so. Therefore in reply to an imperative invitation from His Excellency,  I  askedlibtech_640_footnotelibtech_641_footnotethat  he  should send me someone who could speak for him, and so the P. S. V. came yesterdaylibtech_642_footnotelibtech_643_footnote.  The food situation alone brought him to me.  Could I say something in order to lift the question out of the political arena and out of the general distrust of Government intentions and policy? As the matter brooks no delay, I give here the purport of what I said. So far as the Congress policy is concerned, His Excellency should invite Maulana Saheb and, if he cannot come, ask him to name his deputy. I personally feel that the present irresponsible Executive should be immediately replaced by a responsible one chosen from the elected members of the Central Legislature. I also personally feel that this responsibility should be shouldered by the elected members of the Central Legislature irrespective of parties, for famine of cloth and food is common to the millions of India. Whether the Government can accept the suggestion and whether the different political parties that compose the Central Legislature consider it practicable or not, is more than I can say. But this much I can say without fear of contradiction: I have little doubt that if the mercantile community and
 
 the official would become honest, if only in face of the impending calamity, we are such a vast country that we can just tide over the difficulty even if no help comes from the outside world, which is itself groaning. Grain and cloth dealers must not hoard, must not speculate. Food should be grown on all cultivable areas wherever water is, or is made available. Flower gardens should be used for growing food crops. This has been done during the period of war.  The present is,  in some respects, worse than the war period. Before we have eaten up the grain we have in stock, we must economize like misers. All ceremonial functions should be stopped. Women can play the highest part in the alleviation of the present distress by economizing in their households. In nine-tenths of our activity we can manage our daily affairs without the aid of the Government, whatever its colour may be, if only it will refrain from interfering with the people. Panic must be avoided at all costs. We must refuse to die before death actually takes toll, and think of the skeletons of India and the least little things we may do to help, and all will be well with India. Let us not hypnotize into the belief that because we can indulge ourselves, our next-door neighbour can do likewise. Cloth famine, I know, is a mockery, for if only the Government and mill-owners will act honestly and intelli- gently, no one need go naked for want of cloth. We have cotton enough and idle hands enough and skill enough to make in our villages all the cloth we need.

 Mahatma Gandhi then referred to the impending famine and the visit of the Viceroy’s Private Secretary to Sevagram last evening.
 I have visited Bengal and Assam and met workers from Orissa.  I have seen people who have expressed their views about the famine which is staring them in the face unless proper steps are taken. If things or food can be imported from outside, it is well and good. But this year there is little prospert for that for transferring food from one province to another. So my advice to you would be to minimize food requirements, avoid wastage and serve both men and cattle to your utmost capacity. We must produce better milk and increase our wealth and improve our health. If you devote to cow-keeping, it will be a fiting tribute to Jamnalal’s revered memory.libtech_655_footnotelibtech_656_footnoteIf you don’t know how to serve your own people, how can you serve animals and especially cows?

 MY DEAR VERRIER,
 Your letter of 1st November was given to me by our mutual friend Jehangir Patel after the 14th January through Thakkar Bapa.
 Your language cannot hurt me. I love you so well and so much that language has no effect on me, even as my son Harilal’s has not. What has hurt me is that distrust of you has crept into me. Bapa, who loves you, if it were possible to do so more than I do, deepens that distrust. I do not know whether I have succeeded in conveying to you my full meaning. Your learning which I know is very great, is worth nothing to me if you do not or cannot represent truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Of course you know this fine oath that is administered to every witness before a law court. That it has become a mere mechanical thing and debasing as that does not matter. We utter God’s name in vain. He does not suffer. We do. Is it possible that untruth has crept into you ? Bapa swears, I feel.
 Bapa will see this letter before I send it and so will Jehangir Patel through whom it will go, if it does.
 I have dictated this letter because Harijan takes almost every ounce of my energy.
Love.

515,"February 14, 1946",WHAT OUGHT TO BE DONE,"
  Jayakar 	Papers: File No. 826, p. 38. Courtesy: National Archives of India         	Food crisis should be regarded as a certainty. In the circum- 	stances, the following things should be attended to at once:   Every 		person should confine his 		daily wants regarding 		food to 		the minimum, 		consistent with his 		or her 		health requirements; 		and where, 		as in cities, 		milk, vegetables, oil 		and fruit are 		available, grains 		and pulses 		should be reduced 		as they 		easily can 		be. Starch can 		be derived 		from starchy 		roots such as 		carrots, parsnips, 		potatoes, yam, banana; 		the idea 		being to exclude 		from present 		diet and 		conserve those 		grains and pulses 		which can be 		kept and stored. 		Vegetables too should 		not be 		eaten as 		an indulgence or 		for pleasure 		when millions 		are denied 		the use of 		these things altogether 		and are now threatned 		with starvation due 		to shortage of 		cereals and pulses.  Everyone 		who has access 		to any 		water should try 		himself or 		herself to grow 		some edibles for 		personal or 		general use. 		The easiest way 		to do so is to collect 		clean earth, mix it 		with organic 		manure where 		possible—even a 		little bit 		of dried 		cowdung is good 		organic manure—and 		put it 		in any earthen 		or tin 		pot and throw some 		seeds of 		vegetable such as mustard and cress, etc., and daily water the pots.     
 They will be surprised how quickly the seeds sprout and give edible leaves which need not even be cooked but can be eaten in the form of salad.
  All 	flower gardens should be 	utiized for 	growing edibles. 	And in 	this connection I 	would suggest to 	the Viceroy, 	Governors and high 	officials to 	take the 	lead. I 	would ask 	the heads of 	agricultural departments 	at the 	Centre and 	Provinces to 	flood the 	country with 	leaflets in 	the provincial 	language tellling laymen 	how and what to 	grow easily.  Reduction 	should be taken 	up not 	merely by 	the civilian population 	but equally, 	if not 	predominantly, by 	the military. 	I say 	“predominantly“ for 	the military ranks, 	being under rigid military 	discipline, can 	easily carry out 	measures of economy.  All 	exports of 	seeds, such 	as oil-seeds, 	oils, oil-cakes, nuts, 	etc., should be 	stopped, if 	they have not 	been already. 	Oil-cakes, if the 	seeds are sifted of 	earth and foreign 	matter, are good human 	food with 	rich protein content.  Deep 	wells should be sunk 	by the 	Government wherever 	possible and required, whether for irrigation or for drinking purposes.  Given 	hearty co-operation by 	Government servants and 	the general 	public, I have 	not the slightest doubt 	that the country 	can tide 	over the difficulty. 	Just as 	panic is 	the surest 	way to 	defeat, so 	also will 	be the 	case when there is 	widespread distress impending 	and prompt 	action is not 	taken. Let 	us not 	think of 	the cause of 	the distress. 	Whatever the cause, 	the fact 	is that 	if the Government 	and the 	public do 	not approach 	the crisis 	patiently and 	courageously, disaster 	is a 	certainty. We 	must fight 	this foreign 	Government on 	all other 	fronts except this 	one, and even on this 	we shall 	fight them, if they 	betray callousness 	or contempt 	for reasoned 	public opinion. 	In this 	connection I 	invite the 	public to 	share my 	opinion that 	we should 	accept Government 	professions at their 	face value, and believe 	that swaraj is within 	sight inside of a few months.  Above 	all, black marketing and 	dishonesty should 	disappear altogether, 	and willing 	co-operation between all 	parties should be 	the order of the day in so far as this crisis is concerned.libtech_665_footnote

 I shall reach there on the 19th. I shall write later by what train. We shall be about 11 or 12 people. This time I am not coming as your guest, but for the sake of the work that we want to do there. This time my party as well as I will meet our food expenses only from the funds reserved for the poor. You need not, therefore, incur any expenditur on that account. I will reimburse then and there whatever you spend [on our account]. That too would not be from my own account but from the money that is earmarked for the poor out of the hospital fund. The other that lies with me has not been earmarked for any particular purpose. And this amount belongs to my rich friends Whatever amont now remians with you is what you  have earned yourself and for your personal expenses. And I have no right
 to take a single piece out of it, for after having become a trustee I should not regard it as my right to draw anything from that amount.
 As regards accommodating me, I shall put up wherever you ask me to, i. e., in the room you have reserved for me or in any part of the hospital or in a tent. I don’t at all regard it as inconvenient for me  to put up in a tent in this season. And I shall not find it inconvenient  to stay throughout the year in a place with a tiled floor. You had such  a place made for the Working Committee.
 You are not to incur any expenditure on my account. If I don’t proceed with a hardened heart as I do, I will not be worthy of the trust, nor will I be able to serve the poor through the trust.

 I have read Shri Kamaraja Nadar’s Press messagelibtech_673_footnote.   I am sorry. I can easily be silent, but the cause may suffer. He says he is my follower. In that case he should have referred to me before rushing to the Press and certainly before resigninglibtech_674_footnote. I have  intentionally descri- bed myself as a Bhangi. In the man-made social ladder I want to be at the bottom. I would like Shri Kamraj to cease to be a Nadar and to become a Bhangi with me and then in all humility withdraw his resig- nation. Whatever it is legally or not, the Provincial and Working Com- mittees alone can decide. Morally it is perfectly possible, if he him- self feels he has hurt himself and the cause by resigning. Then he will rejoin the difficult post (if it is legally possible) as a strong man. He was weak in resigning. He says he prevented four others from follow- ing him. It was well that they did not resign.
 Why worry about the use of the word ‘clique’?libtech_675_footnotelibtech_676_footnoteIn spite of all my love for the English lenguage, it is a foreign tongue for me and I am as likely as not to make mistakes in using it. Of course, I have used the word ‘clique’ deliberately. I must not withdraw it. This is its dictionary meaning:“small exclusive party”. I know that there is such a clique in Tamil Nadu against Rajaji. I am unable definitely to name one single person in it.libtech_677_footnotelibtech_678_footnoteNo one need wear the cap unless it fits him. There are many cliques in the Congress organization as even in the best managed organizations in the world. The fewer their number the better the organization.
 Were I not challenged at the time that I was touring in the South, I would have been silent.
 I must admit that I did not talk to those who were with me in that special train. I was buried in my work which was divided between meetings at frequetnt stoppages and writing whilst the train was in motion. And let the public know that those who are physically nearest to me have to be so forbearing that they would not come near me and interfere with my work. Such has been the usage during my stormy life. My own children thus get the least of me. Aruna Asaf Ali came
 
 for two days to see me fresh from her hiding place and was so forbearing that she had of me only as much as she could during my walks.

524,"February 15, 1946",HOW TO CANALIZE HATRED,"
    
 Hatred is in the air, and impatient lovers of the country will gladly take advantage of it, if they can, through violence,  to  fur-  ther the cause of independence. I suggest that it is wrong at any time and everywhere.  But it   is  more  wrong  and  unbecoming  in  a country where fighters for  freedom  have  declared  to  the  world that their policy  is  truth  and  non-violence.Hatred,  they  argue, cannot be turned into love. Those who believe in  violence  will naturally use it by saying, ‘Kill your enemy, injure him and his pro-
 perty wherever you can, whether openly or secretly as necessity requires.’ The result will be deeper hatred and counterhatred, and vengeance let lose on both sides. The recent war, whose embers have yet hardly died, loudly proclaims the bankruptcy of this use of hatred. And it remains to be seen whether they so-called victors have really won or whether they have not depressed themselves in seeking and trying to depress their enemies. It is a bad game at its best. Some philosophers of action in this country improve upon the mode and say, ‘We shall never kill our enemy but we shall destroy his property’, for the remarkable thing is that the so-called enemy has brought no property of his own and what little he has brought he makes us pay for. Therefore what we destroy is really our own. The bulk of it, whether in men or things, he produces here. So what he really has is the custody of it. For the destruction too we have to pay through the nose and it is the innocent who are made to pay. That  is  the implication of punitive tax and all it carries with it. Non-violence in  the sense of mere non-killing does not appear to me, therefore, to be any improvement on the technique of violence. It means slow torture and when slowness becomes ineffective we shall immediately revert to killing and to atom bomb, which is the last word in violence today. Therefore I suggested in 1920 the use of non-violence and its inevitable twin companion truth for canalizing hatred into the proper channel. The hater hates not for the sake of hatred but because he
 wants to drive away from his country the hated being or beings. He will, therefore, as readily achieve his end by non-violent means. For the past twenty-five years, willingly or unwil-lingly, the Congress has spoken to the masses in favour of non-violence as against violence for regaining our lost liberty. We have also dis- covered through our progress that in the application of non-violence we have been able to reach the mass mind far more quickly and far more extensively than ever before. And yet, if truth is told as it must be, our non- violent action has been half-hearted. Many have preached non- violence through the lips while harbouring violence in the breast. But the unsophisticated mass mind has read the secret meaning hidden in our breasts, and the unconscious reaction has not been altogether as it might have been. Hypocrisy has acted as an ode to virtue, but it could never take its place. And so I plead for non-violence. and yet more non-violence. I do so not without knowledge but with sixty years experience behind me. This is the critical moment, for the dumb masses are today starving. There are many ways that will suggest themselves to the wise reader as to how to apply the canons of non- violence to the present needs of the country. The hypnotism of the Indian National Army has cast its spell upon us. Netaji’s name is one to conjure with us. His patriotism is second to none. (I use the present tense intentionally). His bravery shines through all his actions. He aimed high but failed. Who has not failed? Ours is to aim high and to aim well. It is given to everyone to command success. My praise and admiration can go no further. For I knew that his action was doomed to failure, and that I would have said so even if he had brought his I. N. A. victorious to India, because the masses would not have come into their own in this manner. The lesson that Netaji and his army brings to us is one of self-sacrifice, unity irres-pective of class and community, and discipline. If our adoration will be wise and discriminating, we will rigidly copy this trinity of virtues, but we will as rigidly abjure violence. I would not have the I. N. A. man think, or say, that he and his can ever deliver the masses of India from bondage by force of arm. But, if he is true to Netaji and still more so to the country, he will spend himself in teaching the masses, men, women and children to be brave, self-sacrificing and united. Then we will be able to stand erect before the world. If he will merely act the armed soldier, he will only lord it over the masses and the fact that he will be a volunteer will not count for much. I, therefore, welcome the declaration made by Capt. Shah Nawaz that, to be worthy
 of Netaji, on having come to Indian soil, he will act as a humble soldier of non-violence in Congress ranks.

532,"February 16, 1946",QUESTION BOXlibtech_689_footnote,"
    
 Q. It is necessary to import as many foodstuffs as possible.  As  it is, people do not get enough to eat. Any further reduction in rations is fraught with risk. It will mean further undernourishment, making the people an easy prey to disease. It may even lead to food riots. As for increasing production, it is most difficult, if not utterly impossible, at the present juncture.
 A. I am aware that many people hold the views given above. But the argument does not impress me. People will find it unbearable to have their rations further reduced when they are already not getting enough to eat. But, if we accept, as I do, that the Government figures are correct, foresight demands, and it is our duty, to swallow the bitter pill and ask the people to do like wise; that is, we should all eat less so that we can hold out till the next harvest. Today, because of  the corrupt administration, the masses do not get even their just dues under the rationing system. It will be a great thing if this can be rectified so that everyone can get his or her share easily and truly. If, however, we believe the Government figure to be wrong and continue the agitation for increased rations, and if the Government concedes that demand, a time will come before the next harvest is in when we shall be let without any food whatsover and the poor will have to die an untimely death.We should take every care to avoid such a calamity. It will, therefore, be wisdom on our part to put up with a reduction in the present rations.
 Then I do not think it is impossible to grow more foodstuffs, though I agree that it is difficult. The difficulty is due to our lack of knowledge and the requisite skill If we are all optimistic and  courageous and employ ourselves forthwith to produce whatever food we can by our individual effort, we shall probably be able before long to give the people a balanced diet and shorten the period of reduced rations.
 
 My optimism is irrepressible, but I admit that nothing will be possible without whole-hearted co-operation on the part of both the Government and the public. Without it, even the imported foodstuffs may be squandered and maldistributed. Besides we are not yet inde- pendent. Relying on outside help will make us still more dependent. If, however, without relying on them, we do get imports of foodstuffs, we shall gratefully accept and make the best use of them. While it is the duty of the Government to try to get food from outside, I do not think it is good for us to look either to them or to other countries. What is more, disappointment from that direction will be positively harmful for the morale of our people in these hard times. But, if the peo-ple become united and determined to look to none save God for help and do not oppose such Governmental measures as they find useful, there will be no cause for disappointment. Such action will enable the people to emerge stronger from the ordeal, and foreign countries will think of their duty to send us food of their own accord wherever they can spare it ‘God helps those who help themslves.’ How can others withhold help from the self-reliant? The British Government, during their hour of need, took away all that India had, and today we have to put up with the consequ-ences of their action. Need we then tell them and those whom they helped by depleting India’s resources that their duty today is towards India?
 Q. India does not produce enough cotton. This has to be imported from Africa and America. Peasants are not allowed to grow cotton, the reason given being that they should grow more food.
 A. This cannot apply to those who grow cotton for their own use.  It can only be applicable in the case of those who grow cotton as  a money crop. The Government has committed the crime of making cotton a commercial commodity. This sin cannot be wiped out by importing cotton. That can only aggravate the wrong. The export of the cotton was made solely for the benefit of Lancashire. It thus became a commerical commodity in an artificial manner. I can understand the prohibition against growing large quantities of cotton during war in certain areas in the interests of food production. To prohibit the growing of cotton altogether and depend on imports for our needs is no remedy for food scarcity. Wherever possible people should grow cotton for their own use. I might understand, and even tolerate, the policy of importing cotton for the use of Indian cloth mills. But, if this policy prohibits the growing of cotton for the individual’s own use, it becomes wholly untenable and must, there-
 fore, be strongly resisted. This is a matter for the consideration of both the Government and the public.

A correspondent writes :
 I am reading your Gita Bodh these days and, trying to understand it, I am puzzled by what Lord Krishna says in the tenth discourselibtech_691_footnote.
 “In dicer’s play I am the conquering double eight. Nothing, either good or evil, can take place in this world without my will.” Does God then permit evil? If so, how can He punish the evil-doer? Has God created the world for this purpose? Is it impossible then for mankind to live in peace?
To say that God permits evil in this world may not be pleasing
 to the ear. But if He is held responsible for the good, it follows that He has to be responsible for the evil too. Did not God permit Ravana to exhibit unparalleled strength? Perhaps the root cause of the perplexity arises from a lack of the real understanding of what God is. God is not a person. He transcends description. He is the Law-maker, the Law and the Executor. No human being can well arrogate these powers to himself. If he did, he would be looked upon as an un- adulterated dictator.libtech_692_footnotelibtech_693_footnoteThis does not befit a man.   They become only Him whom we worship as God. This is the reality, a clear under- standing of which will answer the question raised by the corres- pondent.
 The question whether it is impossible for mankind ever to be at peace with one another does not arise from the verse quoted. The world will live in peace only when the individuals composing it make up their minds to do so. No one can deny the possibility nor say when that will come to pass. Such questions are idle waste of time. To a good man the whole world is good. By following this golden rule the correspondent can live in peace under all circumstances,
 
 
 believing that what is possible for him to be is also possible for others. To believe the contrary connotes pride and arrogance.

If the students under Nayee Talim can produce even a part of their food requirement, they will to that extent release food for others, besides teaching them self-help by their personal example.
 You do not know the kind of land we had to begin with in South Africa. Who would give good land to ‘coolies’, as we were called there? But by dint of application we were able to convert it into a fruit orchard.libtech_700_footnote
 If I were in your place, I would not use the plough to begin with. I would arm our children with the hoe, and teach them to use it effectively. it is an art. Bullock power can come later. Similarly I would not like you to be deterred by the power quality of the soil. A thin top layer of loam or compost can enable us to grow many a useful vegetable and pot herb. A beginning can be made at once by converting night-soil into manure by the shallow trenching system. The coversion does not need more than a fortnight. Every pint of water whether from bathing and ablutions  or  from  the  kitchen should be turned into the backyard vegetable beds. Not a drop of water should be allowed to be wasted. Greens can be grown in earthen pots and even discarded old tins. No opportunity should be neglected, however trifling. The cumulative result, then, if the practise is on a nation-wide scale, will be colossal.

 Shri Jhaverbhai Patel of A. I. V. I. A.libtech_704_footnotelibtech_705_footnote, who knows his subject, writes:libtech_706_footnote
 Since the cutting off the supply of rice from Burma, there has been an acute shortage of rice in India. To meet this quantitative deficiency, Government prohibited the polishing of rice beyond a certain degree. If polishing has been banned altogether, the deficiency. . . would have been more than  met. .  .  Government could not introduce that measure.  .  .  but. .
 .even the halting step taken by the Government has been put to naught without the intelligent co-operation of the people. Since the Government has begun supplying undermilled rice, consumers have begun getting the rationed rice polished.      The most effective way to get whole rice find its permanent
 way into our dietary is to teach our womenfolk the science of dietetics.
 It is very true that this peremptory reform can be brought about quickly by educating our women in the art of conservative cookery. How this education can be imparted is a serious question. Schools and colleges are perhaps the most ready-made media, let alone the Press and platform. If the people are to save themselves and the star- ving millions during this critical period, the Press and the platform have to respond to the urgent need.

  	I have your letter. I should certainly like it, if Anna lives in the 	Ashram but the question is whether he will be able to adjust himself 	to the Ashram atmosphere. Hence write to him all that you should 	about this point. Pass on this letter to him. He had a talk with me 	and his response had the same tone. That is why he had said that had 	he      
 would be able to pull on for two or three months. It was proposed that he would work with Jagannath Dass and at the same time help in the working of Bharati. I cannot make out what has happened about all that. His letter is not clear whether he will come alone or with his family. A lot of work can be found in the Ashram itself, and later he can be accommodated under you as it suits all. This is all I can think of at the moment. It will be all right even if you pass on this letter itself adding to it whatever you think fit.

We should  admit that it is our fault if some 	do not come to us. They should all want 	to come to us.  	We should treat those children who come to us as our own children. 	If their body and mind become sound and they acquire normal 	discipline, we should be satisfied that our purpose has been served.  	I have taught many boys. I never allowed them to indulge in 	mischief. If they were under my care, I would educate them in such a 	way that they would learn from their very childhood that the desire 	to destroy was a very bad thing. Whatever they do, they should 	create something, produce something. There is an art in making 	anything and whatever they make should be artistic.  	I do not believe that children are either good or bad from their 	very birth. Some tendency is there, but we have to mould them. This 	means that an infant starts learning right from the time of 	conception. At that time I would teach the mother. That would be a 	part of adult education. The training of the infant begins from that 	stage. We have    
 to train the future generation on these lines. Till the child is separated from the mother, I would teach the mother. The infant is ever moving its hands and feet and is able to do something. If we are able to take under our care children of two or two and a half years of age and if they learn to move their hands and feet according to our method, I cannot set any limits to their progress.
If the child is put under our care, he will not destroy anything.
He will feel hurt in doing so.
 Whatever education we give to the children, it should be constructive and creative but never destructive.
 When the child starts speaking, he starts learning a language. First you should teach him to distinguish different colours. Begin teaching him the letters of the alphabet only with the help of the pictures. Don’t you have charts showing 1-2, A-B and so on? Read- ing, writing and arithmetic will come in due course of time and the child will not be overstrained. His education should be a form of play.
 Whatever thing he makes should be useful. In this way his mind and hands and feet develop in co-ordination.
 There are no distinctions between work and play in basic education. For a child everything is play. I would go so far as to say that thus his whole life becomes a kind of game. I have been doing this for many years now. I never feel that it is time for play and I should go and play. For me even writing is a game. Under basic education of my conception children will learn while playing.

540,"February 18, 1946",NEW POLICY AND BOMBAY KHADI BHANDAR,"
    
 The following figureslibtech_708_footnotehave been received from the All-India Spin-ners’ Association Bhandar. They deserve to be studied. The progress of khadi under the new policy will in some matters, have to be measured in the inverse ratio. No doubt the more spinning-wheels the city-dwellers buy, the better; it means that more of them learn spinning. But the soon-er slivers stop selling the better. The only conditions is that the number of persons desirous of learning carding
 
 and spinning should increase. If the people are really enthusiatic, Vinobaji’s experiments should bear some fruit. Whatever it may be, this much is clear that one who spins should himself card his cotton and make slivers out of it. For this the pro-cess of carding should be made easy. The answer to this is hand-carding.
 Khadi may be kept in a bhandar, but the bhandar should present the appearance of a school. The persons woking in a bhan- dar, if I may call them employees, should necessarily be volunteers. They do not cease to be volunteer, if they accept less than their market value and do the work because of love of khadi. All  of  them  should be proficient in ginning, carding, spinning and in teaching all the these. The greater the number of those who can weave, the better. We have done very few experiments regarding weaving. The real bhandar of my conception is an extensive plot near a suburb of Bombay where all those processes go on and are taught.
 Difficulties should not overwhelm us; we should overcome them, that is, get rid of them. If it is true that swaraj lies in khadi, there are bound to be difficulties. Here, in the path of non-violence, they will be the least.

 How nice it  would  be,  if  we  had  newspapers  only  in  our own languages. We should not then be blind persons, one mistak-  ing the tail for the elephant, another the tusks, a third the trunk, for the noble animal—all wise in their own conceit, yet all wrong in essence. Thus I in my conceit saidlibtech_709_footnotelibtech_710_footnote, and still say, that the opposition to Rajaji was, and is, confined to a clique. An esteemed friend and others main- tain that I have made a serious blunderlibtech_711_footnotelibtech_712_footnotelibtech_713_footnotein calling the opposition by this name. My appellation can-not be, and was not meant to be applied to the Congress organization, whether provincial, central or any other, which, like the king, can do no wrong. A clique generally does the wrong thing. But surely both my critics and I are right, each other in our own way, and both are wrong. All this bother over the use of a foreign word! If I had written in the national [language] or my mother tongue, we would not have quarrelled over a word. Only let me close the Rajaji episode by saying that if I am wrong in the use of the word or in my estimate of Rajaji, no one need follow me. I have no official authority. The loss will be purely mine in that, for a wrong estimate, I shall have lost much or some of the moral weight I possess.
 My purpose, however, just now is to quarrel with the reporter who, in trying to translate my Hindustani speechlibtech_714_footnoteat the Goseva Sangh meeting into English, has made me say the opposite of what I had said and meant. A handsome and delicate compliment has been turned into an indelicate reflection. There was no ‘if’ about my saying that Janakibai, the widow or the late Jamnalalji, was the rightful first successor of her late husband, even as the late Ramabai was of her later husband Justice Ranade. Next to her were his children. They might fail, but those of us who had gathered together to honour the memory of the deceased were also heirs, only if we were true.We were heirs by choice unlike the heirs through relationship. I am sure that the delicate compliment I paid in my indifferent Hindustani was not lost upon the widow, the children who are all working for the cause, or the numbers of freinds who filled the pandal which was specially constructed for the purpose. All were heirs in a common and noble
 
 service which constituted a limitless inheritance. I prided myself on the message which was altogether lost in transmission through a foreign medium. Could it have been reported and transmitted in Hindustani, it would have gone home to the readers.
 I have not been able to read the whole report. Let me, there- fore, complete it by briefly stating the other two thoughts I placed before the meeting. Cattle preservation was one of the major problems of India. It was not to be solved by speeches or money. It could only  be solved by the Goseva Sangh possessing many cattle experts who understood and gave themselves to the problem, and by the mer- cantile community doing its	work in the spirit of service rather than in the spirit of self-aggrandizement and exploitation. If they applied their undoubted talent to cattle-preservation, they could render great service to India. They need not be overwhelmed by the vastness of the problem. Each one was to think what he could do and do it thoroughly, irrespective of  his  neighbor  or  others.	Therefore the central body was to concentrate on producing milk and bringing milk cheaply to every inhabitant of Wardha. In the end they would discover that they had solved the cattle problem for India.
 Lastly I asked them to bear in mind Aruna Asaf Ali’s wellmeant taunt that in thinking of their benefactor, the four-footed animal, they might not forget their elder freind, the biped of India, who made up the forty crore and without whom cattle could not exist for one day. Therefore every honest man owed it to himself, and the country, only to eat what he must for living healthily and not a morsel for indulgence. Every man, woman and child of understanding should try to grow for the use of India two blades of grass where today only one was growing. If they worked intelligently, honestly and co-ope- ratively in hope, they would find that they could tide over the impen- ding calamity without fuss, without anxiety and with dignified bear- ing.

MEETING, BOMBAYlibtech_715_footnote","
    
 February 18, 1946
 There is a time for laughing and shouting and a time for observing silence and being serious. I have often said that a people who want to be free should learn to mount to the gallows with a smile upon the face. But laughter becomes an offence against decorum, if it is out of season. Similarly shouting out of season is an exhibition of bad manners. It becomes a man to remember his Maker all the twenty-four hours. If that cannot be done, we should at least con- gregate at prayer time to renew our covenant with God. Whether we are Hindus or Mussalmans, Parsis, Christians or Sikhs, we all worship the same God. Congregational prayer is a means for establishing the essential human unity through common worship. Mass singing of Ramdhun and the beating of tala are its outward expression. If they are not mechanical performance but are an echo of the inner unison, as they should be, they generate a power and an atmosphere of sweetness and fragrance which has only to be seen to be realized.
 In the police and the army, physical drill and training in the use of arms regarded as an essential part of discipline. Military training includes marching in step and executing of movements to order in the mass noiselessly and harmoniously too.The mass singing of Ramdhun and the accompaniment of tala are as much a part of discipline in non-violence as physical drill and training in the use of arms are that of military discipline.
 Gandhiji, however warned them that his advice must appeal to their hearts, not merely to their heads, if it was to bear fruit. Dry intellect would  not  take  them far.
 Turning next to the food crisis, he said, it presented a grim prospect. They could criticize the Government as much as they liked for its share in it. He himself had not been sparing in his criticism of the Government in the past and he would do so again when the occasion demanded it even though he stood alone. He stood by what he had said in 1942. If the British had stayed in India as the servants of the people, not their masters, and purely to defeat the Axis powers, he would have had nothing to say. Instead they had in their arrogance cast to the winds the warnings and
 
 
 protests of the people’s respresentatives and denuded India of her vital resource, though perhaps not deliberately, with the result that they all knew. Nevertheless he could understand the food shortage. But cloth shortage he could not understand at all. India could grow any amount of cotton. He said:
In this land of ours, fabulously rich in natural resources, there is
 the lofty Himalayas with its  everlasting  snows  where,  they say, dwells the Lord of the Universe. It has mighty rivers like the Ganges. but owing to our neglect and folly, the year’s rains are allowed to run down into the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea. If all this water was trapped and harnessed to irrigational purposes by the construction of dams and tanks, there should be no famine or food shortage in India Similarly cloth shortage can immediately be remedied by planting a miniature mill in every home in the form of a spinning-wheel or a takli. That would give us all the cloth that we need almost for nothing. I have cried myself hoarse in pressing this solution on the Government. It is immediately feasible, and it is my claim that not a single person need go naked, if necessary steps are taken to put it into operation. The only obstacles in the way are the inertia and prejudice in high places.
 In regard to the food shortage, I admit that Government alone has adequate resources to cope with it. But even so we need not apathetically resign ourselves to fate, fixing our gaze at the skies for the rains to come. There is an inexhastible reservoir of water in the bowels of the earth. It should be tapped, even though we may have to dig two thousand feet deep for it, and used for growing food. We may not blame fate before we have exhausted all available means for combating a threatening calamity.
 Today there is a lot of wastage in food going on in big cities like Bombay in the form of feasts and ceremonies. It is the sacred duty of every man, woman and child to conserve every grain of food and every drop of oil and ghee in this crisis. One should eat no more than necessary to keep the body in health and fitness when millions are faced with the prospect of death through starvation The foodstuffs thus saved can be distributed among the needy poor—not as alms but as remuneration for honest labour.
 The Harijan which resumed publication recently, had a part to play in the present crisis. He advised them to read it as it would be for their good.libtech_716_footnote
 
 
 Proceeding, Gandhiji diagnosed the present helplessness of the country to the double slavery—slavery under the foreign yoke and slavery to our own inertia and sloth. As an instance of the latter he mentioned the fitful and inadequate response to the officer under the new khadi plan of the Bombay Kalbadevi Khadi Bhandar to provide instruments of, and instruction in, spinning and carding and the allied processes to all those who care. If we were not under the hypnotic spell of inertia and laziness, the people of Bombay should flock to the Khadi Bhandar in an unending stream day and night and make in no time the shortage of cloth a thing of the past.
 The political slavery, they all hoped and he shared that hope, would soon end. But the removal of the foreign yoke won’t necessarily bring freedom to the people in the real sense of the  term.  The Congress President had only the other day denouncedlibtech_717_footnotethe recent happenings in Calcutta as being unworthly of a people who aspired to be free. He hoped that they would never disgrace themselves again like that. They were greatly deceiving themselves, if they thought that by indulging in hooliganism they would be able to make the British quit India. They would belie their creed and demean themselves in the eyes of the world if, after pledging themselves to truth and non- violence as the only means for the attainment of swaraj, they exhibited their impotent wrath by indulging in looting, stone-throwing, arson and abuse. He repeated what he had previously said that if 40 crores of Indians resolved unanimously and whole-heartedly that they would have swaraj through and non-violence alone, it would be theirs for the asking. But, if they lacked that faith, it was open to them to repudiate non-violence openly and after due deliberation. People like him might question their wisdom but nobody would charge them with falsehood and cowardice. He was afraid, they could not escape that charges today. He reminded them of Capt. Shah Nawaz’s declarationlibtech_718_footnotethat Netaji Bose had told them that on their return to India they would be expected to serve their country not by means of the sword but through non-violence.
 Granted that India produced sufficient arms and ammunition and men who knew the art of war, what part or lot will those who cannot bear arms have in the attainment of swaraj? I want swaraj in the winning of which even women and children would contrubute an eqal share with physically the strongest. That can be under ahimsa only. I would, therefore, stand for ahimsa as the only means for obtaining India’s freedom even if I were alone.

 An interesting case of the use of purses presented to a public person has recently come under my obeservation. I received many purses from the public. Thus, during my recent tour, donations covering over two lakhs were given to me between Calcutta and Madura. Some of them were anonymous, some earmaked, and some donors said, when asked, that I was to use the money in any manner I liked. I have kept no property which I can call my own. Am I entitled to use those donations or a part of them for personal needs? During the whole of my career I have never made any such use and have always advised friends to do likewise. I hold that there is no other course open to persons who enjoy public confidence and to whom the public give donations, fully believing that the money will be used more judiciously and carefully than by themselves for some public purpose. It would be a terrible thing, if the trust reposed in one were abused for personal purposes. Ruinous consequences of such use can be better imagined than described. Public service must be, like Ceasar’s wife, above suspicion.

 Your letter had been forwarded to me by Bhai Sadiq Ali. I am sorry I could not send a reply sooner. I do not consider what you write a justification for Pakistan. The two-nation theory does not impress me. Economic inequality must go. It is not a Hindu-Muslim question; it is a question of hunger, affecting millions. It is the same both for the Hindus and the Muslims. It is the question of the workers and employers. I am convinced that when this question is solved, the problem of high and low will also be solved. Both parties will have to co-operate in solving this problem. Let us see what God wills.

N. 9270         February 	20, 1946 Here 	is my idea :  	At present do not admit any patient unless I send him or for whom I 	cannot arrange the expenses from the fund that is earmarked for the 	poor. This way the poor, but not the destitute, will be accom- 	modated.   Examine 		any poor 		patient, whether male or 		female.Give him 		a bath, 		if necessary; 		also the syringe, 		if necessary. 		Prescribe the diet 		in writing. 		He should 		himself procure it. If he asks 		for it, we may 		give it but 		he should 		pay for it. They 		need not be 		made to 		lie down 		in a 		large tub; 		should be 		seated to 		have a hip-bath 		and bathed with a 		shower. There should be 		provinsion to 		clean all 		parts of 		the body. 		[The patient] 		should be 		given nude sun-bath. 		He may 		put on 		a langotilibtech_725_footnotelibtech_726_footnote. There should be separate arrangement for women 		 but  no 		separate arrangement 		for individual patients.  Let 		him take as much 		clean drinking-water as 		he can. Those 		who cannot 		afford oranges, etc., should be 		given honey, 		lime and 		water.  Only 		those for 		 whom  such 		 treatment  is 		 enough  should be attended to This includes indigestion, fever, smallpox, constipa-     
 tion, headache, eczema, eruption, measles, chicken-pox, itch, dysentery and such other ailments common among the villagers.
 For carrying on this work we should take on workers, in proportion to the number of patients, and train them. We should take only those who are prepared to work at least for two years. Generally such workers should stay at their own place. Some of them should give a few hours’ free service while some should be paid a regular salary. But all these things will settle down gradually. As our needs grow, a way will suggest itself and we shall know how to implement it.
  We 	shall never use 	foreign medicines nor 	any organic drugs. 	Medicines made from 	plant stalks and as 	simple as 	can be 	procured in 	the village 	may be 	used to 	some extent. 	Castor oil may be 	used, if 	found necessary.  We 	would need a 	large number 	of volunteers 	for this work. 	None of 	them, however, should be 	highly paid.  If 	this work is 	broad-based, it 	can certainly 	develop into a 	seat of learning, say, a university.  It 	is my firm belief that 	if the 	project works, we 	shall cer- 	tainly get 	as much 	land and funds 	as we 	need.  If 	you cannot 	appreciate this project 	but if 	you can have 	faith in 	it, you may go 	ahead with your work at 	Bombay until this is 	put on 	the rails. 	Examine other places. I 	am not inclined 	to invest 	in land 	or a 	building right 	now. I wish 	to carry 	on with 	the existing means. If you have the faith, you will of course, peep in now and then.  You 	must keep your promise 	to those 	patients who pay. 	It is for 	you to see 	how it can 	be done. 	Whatever amount you get 	should belong to 	you. These 	people may not stay on 	this site but I 	think they 	can stay 	anywhere in Poona. 
 If anything is left unanswered, please ask me. I shall reply in writing.
Show this to Jehangirji. After that all three of us can discuss.
 You are not to accept defeat and certainly there is no question of despairing. It is the duty of all three of us to fulfil what we have undertaken.

ABELL,  	Here are a few more suggestions to meet the food situation  which 	have been sent to me by friends.  	The Indian Army should be given this unique opportunity of doing 	constructive work. They can be moved about easily.  They  could, 	therefore, be sent to all such places where wells need to be dug 	most urgently.  	Regarding additional foods, fish has been mentioned. Fish abounds in 	the seas around the coasts of India. The war is over; there are 	innumerable small and medium-sized vessels which were used for doing 	patrol and guard duties along our shores for the last five years. 	The Royal Indian Navy could arrange about staffing these with the 	Department of Fisheries giving all assistance. If everything and 	any- thing can be done during a war, why not a peace-time war 	effort? Dry fish does even now form part of the normal diet of a 	great num- ber of people who are very poor—that is when it is 	available and they can afford to buy it.  	All public gardens should immediately by law made to start growing 	vegetables. Squads of army personnel should be put to work here too 	People requiring extra labour to transform their ground or garden 	should also be able to obtain free help through this channel.    
 The distribution of food should be through co-operative socie- ties or similar organizations.
 All food parcels to friends or relatives in Britain or elsewhere abroad should be stopped as also the export of groundnuts, oils, oil- cakes, etc.
 All stocks of foodstuffs in the hands of the military should be released forthwith and no distinction should be made between military and civil ranks. In this connection I draw His Excellency’s attantion to the following A. P. I. message published in  the  Amrita  Bazar Patrika of February 11, 1946.
 It is learnt that huge quantities of composed atta are being destroyed for the last few days by throwing them into the river Shitalaksha at Narayanganj.
The campaign against despondency and for growing more food
 will avail nothing, unless bribery which is going on as never before is stopped and honesty and straight dealing begin to pervade the Gover- nment ranks and the public.libtech_737_footnote

 MY DEAR PRAKASAM,
 I am enclosing herewith copy of a letter which I have received from Bezwada dated 15th inst. Ordinarily I would have ignored such a letter but there is a specific allegation in this letter which I believe requires immediate contradiction. It is about your having collected Rs. 50,000/-.libtech_738_footnoteI do not know whether there is any truth in this matter but if you have collected such an amount, it must have been credited to the Congress account in your province. This kind of scandal should not be allowed to be spread and therefore I would suggest that you may take such steps either by public contradiction or by such other
 
 
 method as you may deem appropriate to prevent the spread of such scandals.

Some of them say 	that all the praise bestowed on Rajaji is well-deserved. They admit 	his integrity, self-sacrifice, great ability and administrative 	capacity. But they hold his so-called apos- tasy in 1942 to be 	unforgivable and add that his scheming to be Premier of Madras is 	insufferable. For me there is no offence or apos- tasy in resigning 	from the Congress and maintaining one’s views. If he is scheming 	to get the Premiership, it is undoubtedly worthy of condemnation and 	would be a sad discovery for me.  	But my purpose in reverting to the subject is not for the sake of 	defending him. My opinion carries no authority save moral which can 	be rejected at will. What I want to reprehend the threat of fasting, 	or the fast itself, if I do not withdraw the epithet ‘clique’ in 	respect of those who are opposing him. I have given my meaning of 	the word. And I adhered to its use according to that meaning. Nobody 	should be coerced into changing his belief. There would be an end to 	all decency and reason, if such fasting became effective. As the 	author of fasting as a weapon in satyagraha, I must state that I 	cannot give up an opinion honestly held even if the whole world 	fasts against me. I    
 might as well give up my belief in God because a body of atheists fasted against such belief. The rule of conduct stated by me is of universal applicability.

 POONA,
 February 23, 1946
 I have followed the events now happening in India with pain- ful interest.  This mutinylibtech_755_footnotelibtech_756_footnotein the navy and what is following is not, in any sense of the term, non-violent action. Inasmuch as a single person is compelled to shout “Jai Hind” or any popular slogan, a nail is driven into the coffin of swaraj in terms of the dumb millions of India. Destruction of churches and the like is not the way to swaraj as defined by the Congress. Burning of tram-cars and other property, insulting and injuring Europeans is not non-violence of the Congress type, much less mine, if and in so far as it may be different from the Congress. Let the known and unknown leaders of this thoughtless orgy of violence know what they are doing and then follow their bend. Let it not be said that India of the Congress spoke to the world of winning swaraj through non-violent action and belied her word in action and that too at the critical period in her life. I have deliberately used the adjective“thoughtless”. For, there is such a thing as thought- ful violent action. What I see happening now is not thoughtful. If the Indian members of the Navy know and appreciate non-violence, the way of non-violent resistance can be dignified, manly and wholly effective, if it is corporate. For the individual it always is. Why should they continue to serve, if service is humiliating for them or India? Action like this I have called non-violent non-co-operation. As it is, they are setting a bad and unbecoming example for India.
 A combination between Hindus and Muslims and others for the purpose of violent action is unholy and will lead to and probably is a preparation for mutual violence—bad for India and the world.
 The rulers have declared their intention to “quit” in favour of Indian rule. Let the action be not delayed by a moment because of the exhibition of distressul unrest which has been lying hidden in the
 
 breast theirs might is unquestioned. Its use beyond the bare require- ment will be unworthy and even wicked, if it is made to suppress the people or a portion of them. The people have been far too long under the foreign heel.

This 	remark was prompted by my telling him that I distrusted the word of 	the official world. He did not and  had  thought that I might share 	his trust. Behold his disappointment when he found me wanting. It 	may be that was not what he meant by his cryptic letter. Anyway that 	was my interpretation and I repliedlibtech_763_footnotelibtech_764_footnotethat 	as a man of God, he must never feel lonely.  For God was ever with 	him.     British 	officials.   I 	 was seized 	with an 	 unusual sense of loneliness.	On 16th  February 	I wrote a letter to Gandhiji to unburden myself.” For an extract 	from Sudhir Ghosh’s letter, vide 	“Letter from Sudhir 	Ghosh”  
 Why should he care even if the whole world deserted him? Let him trust in spite of me, as long as the trust came from his heart and not his head.
 I feel differently. Mutual trust and mutual love are no trust and no love. The real love is to love them that hate you, to love your neighbour even though you distrust him. I have sound reasons for distrusting the English official world. If my love is sincere, I must love the Englishman in spite of my distrust. Of what avail is my love, if it be only so long as I trust my friend? Even thieves do that. They become enemies immediately the trust is gone.
 See what is happening in Bombaylibtech_765_footnote—the Bombay where I have passed so much time, which has given the public causes so much money, and which I had thought had fairly imbibed something of ahimsa. Will it prove the burial ground of ahimsa?
 I am unable to think that the incendiarism, the looting and the insults heaped upon Englishmen are, or were, acts of hooligans. Who are hooligans? Will there be none when English rule is no more? The fashion of blaming the hooligan ought to be given up. We are the makers of the brand. They respond to the air about them.
 Imagine the senselessness of looting grain shops. The looters did not help themselves. Even if they did, they were not starving. The grain was meant for the starving. If it was being misused, looting could not prevent that misuse. Usurpers will always replace the looted grain while there is any to usurp. Between the two sets of looters the starving will be more starved than before.
 They who incited the mutineers did not know what they were doing. The latter were bound to submit ultimately.  Or was it meant as a lesson in violence? That is not the way to understand history.
 I ask myself, and perhaps others are asking, why I am not repea- ting what I did after Chauri Chaura.libtech_766_footnoteI have no call in that direc-tion. When or if it comes, nothing in the world will prevent me, ill or well. Let me reaffirm the truth that I love the Englishman as well as the Indian. Both are humans. Yet I want the rule of and for the masses of India. Loka-manya has taught us that Home Rule or swaraj is our birthright. That swaraj is not to be obtained by what is going on now
 
 in Bombay, Calcutta and Karachi.

580,"February 24, 1946",NATURE CURE TREATMENTlibtech_767_footnote,"
    
 Nature cure treatment means that treatment which befits man. By ‘man’ is meant not merely man as animal but as a creature possessing, in addition to his body, both mind and soul. For such a being, Ramanama is the truest nature cure treatment. It is an unfailing remedy. The expression ramban, or infallible cure, is derived from it. Nature too indicates that for man it is the worthy remedy. No matter what the ailment from which a man may be suffering, recitation of Ramanama from the heart is the sure cure. God has many names. Each person can choose the name that appeals most to him. Iswar, Allah, Khuda, God mean the same. But the recitation must not be parrot-like, it must be born of faith of which endeavour will be some evidence. What should the endeavour consist of? Man should seek out and be content to confine the means of cure to the five elements of which the body is composed, i. e., earth, water, akash, sun and air. Of course Ramanama must be the invariable accompaniment. If, in spite of this, death supervenes, we may not mind. On the contrary, it should be welcomed. Science has not so far discovered any recipe for making the body immortal. Immorality is an attribute of the soul. That is certainly imperishable but it is man’s duty to try to express its purity.
 If we accept the above reasoning, it will automatically limit the means permissible under nature cure. And man is thereby saved from all the paraphernalia of big hospitals and eminent doctors, etc. The large majority of persons in the world can never afford these. Why then should the few desire what the many cannot have?

 APPENDIX I
 THE SAPRU COMMITTEE PROPOSALSlibtech_779_footnote
 BOMBAY,
 December 27, 1945 “The Committee stands for a single Union of India, including the whole of  British India and all the Indian States, the claim for secession or non-accession, by
 which individual Provinces or States can keep out of the Union is not accepted,” says
 the Sapru Committee in its final report on constitutional proposals. This report, which was compiled by the Rt. Hon. Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru, the Rt. Hon. Mr. M. R. Jayakar, the Hon. Sir N. Gopalaswami Iyengar and Kunwar Sir Jagadish Prasad, was released to the Press on December 27, 1945.
 Embodying this principle in its proposals, the Committee recommends that the constitution-making body to be appointed after the elections should proceed on the basis of framing a constitution for a single State, and urges that the right of secession or non-accession given to individual States or Provinces in the Cripps proposals should be withdrawn.
 The Committee maintains that throughout it has endeavoured to make a cons- tructive approach to the many knotty problems that confront the country, to investigate them from every angle, to appraise as dispassionately as they could every fact, circumstance or conceivable argument and to reach conclusions which in their estimation were calculated to promote the lasting interests of India and were likely to elicit the approbation of thinking Indians.
 The report says : “It is the Committee’s firm conviction that the future of India lies in adopting a democratic constitution. The ultimate sovereign in a demo- cracy is the electorate, which chooses those who are to represent it in the Legislature and Executive. Adult franchise is therefore recommended.   Under   existing conditions,  it is excusable to give religious communities the right to a fair and adequate share of opportunities for service in the Legislature and Executive, but the aspirants for these opportunities should realize that they hold them in trust for the nation as a whole and should for that reason seek the support of all communities.”
 JOINT GENERAL ELECTORATES
 The  Committee  has  recommended  that  separate  communal  electorates  should disappear and should be replaced by joint general elctorates with reservations
 
 
 of seats. In the opinion of the Committee, Parliamentary Government is not unsuited  to India and can be worked even with communally composed Legislature and Exe- cutive. One of the cardinal features of the constitutional proposals made by the Committee is the provision of ample and effective safeguards for the minorities.
 Emphasizing the importance of joint electorates, the Committee says : “No Government, which is not merely in power but accepts active responsibility for its decisions, can legitimately flinch from the task of righting a manifestly wrong decision (taken forty years ago, accepting separate electorate for Muslims), which has been so mischievous in its effects. We hope the present Labour Government in Britain, with its high democratic ideals and the enormous voting strength behind it, will not lack the courage to get this decision reversed with the support of Parliament. We have no doubt that such reversal would be to the lasting benefit of the Muslims themselves.”
 PARITY  AT  THE  CENTRE
 It is because the Committee attaches great importance to the abolition of separate electorates that it considers parity of representation  in  the  Central Legislative Assembly between Muslims and Hindus, other than Scheduled Castes, not too great a price to pay. Hindu objections to this proposal are strong, because it means on a population basis one Muslim will be regarded as equal to two Hindus, other than Scheduled Castes, also the fear that the British Government may accept the parity concession without implementing the important provision that joint electorates must be introduced, is not unfounded in the light of past history. Each special concession has, in the past, been made the starting-point for fresh demands. But in the interests of communal harmony, which abolition of separate electorates will bring about, the Committee has ventured on this proposal, but it insists that in its recommendation on parity, the conditions and limitations it has laid down are equally important. Parity, however, is confined to the Lower House of the Union Legislature and Union Executive, which are the final organs for determining all-India policy; and it is important that such policy should have the substantial backing of the bulk of Hindus and Muslims. The same considerations do not apply to the Provincial Legislatures or Executives, or to the Services, or to other fields of administration.
 Joint electorates, with reservation of seats, are admittedly a far cry from democracy, but they are a necessary halfway house between separate electorates and general electorates without any limitation even as to candidature.
 CONCESSION SHOULD NOT EXTEND TO THE SERVICES
 The Committee considers that it will be unjust and improper to extend the concession of parity to the Services, civil or military. Government Services, like any other service, must be based upon individual merit and fitness. Neither does the
 Committee think that the Muslims are educationally backward, as they were thirty or forty years back. As regards other communities, the present proportions are consi- dered fair, but they may be revised by future Governments, so as to provide adequate representation for backward communities. The Committee also expresses the view that it will be dangerous to extend the principle of parity to the Defence Services.
 Maintaining that the Muslims are not a separate nation, the Committee in the chapter on Pakistan or partition of India says that the separate nationhood of Mus- lims cannot be established on grounds of race, language or culture. If religion alone will have to be the basis of division, then many other communities can also claim separate nationhood.
 Declaring that self-determination is not an absolute right and can only be applied with due regard to circumstances, the Committee examines the practicabilities of Pakistan in the context of Indian conditions and in the light of Indian opinion. It says : “The position is that the scheme of Pakistan put forward by Mr. Jinnah is not acceptable either to the Hinuds of the Punjab and Bengal or to the Sikhs or to the Congress or to the Hindu Mahasabha. The C. R. Formula has been totally rejected by Mr. Jinnah and has been opposed by the Hindus and Sikhs of the Punjab and Hindus of Bengal.
 PAKISTAN NOT A PRACTICABLE PROPOSITION
 “It is thus clear that Pakistan, whether whole, according to Mr. Jinnah’s ideals, or truncated, according to the C. R. Formula, cannot be established without the consent of parties and will meet with the strongest opposition. Arbitration has been ruled out and is out of place when the fate of the entire country is to be decided. The only alternatives for enforcing Pakistan are either British enforcement of it or civil war.”
 After considering the problems of Defence of the sub-Continent and the position of minorities after division, the report states the Committee’s conclusion that Pakistan “solves no communal problems and only raises fresh ones : that on grounds of Defence, leaving apart other major considerations, the division of the country into two independent States will endanger the safety of both, and that there is no justification for the British Government to support such a revolutionary scheme if they have genuine faith in the unity of India which they themselves have built up and fostered.”
 The report characterizes Prof. Coupland’s regional scheme as “fantastic, unreal and academic.”
 Rejecting all schemes of partition and division, the Committee concludes : “We are convinced that the partition of India would be an outrage justified neither by history nor by political expediency. It is incompatible with the greatness, safety and economic development of the country and will lead either to constant internecine war
 
 or perpetual foreign domination. It multiplies and complicates the problem of minorities without solving it and threatens to plunge India back into the dark and dismal days of the 18th centruy.”
 The Committee feels certain that political unity can  be  maintained  and  Hindus and Muslims can live together amicably as they have done for a thousand years.”
 The report proceeds to consider the arrangements to be made by which India will remain united and at the same time, afford the communities sufficient scope for self-development. One of the Committee’s fundamental recommendations in this regard is the provision by which in the Union Assembly, excluding the seats given to special interests, Muslim representation from British India will be on a par with the representation given to Hindus excluding the Scheduled Castes. The offer of parity is subject to the condition that joint electorates with reservation of seats are introduced throughout, i. e., for all elective bodies in the country and the Committee adds that, should the Muslims not agree to this condition and insist on separate electorates, not only should the offer stand withdrawn, but the Hindus should be free to ask for a revision of the Communal Award.
 PROVISION FOR ADULT FRANCHISE
 
 Another important recommendation is the provision for adult franchise. If political power is to be transferred to an Indian Democracy, so as to prevent its concentration in the hands of a few, the risk of enfranchising the entire adult population should be taken. Political consciousness among the masses has awakened to a great extent and the last elections in 1937 were in themselves a great educative force. The average man thinks more and more in terms of politics and, if his judgment is faulty, he is no better or no worse than the average voter in Europe, where franchise has been in existence for some time.
 Before Pakistan came to occupy the field, Muslim opinion generally seemed to demand that the residuary powers should be lodged with the Provinces, in order that the latter might have the fullest freedom to legislate in matters which were not covered expressly by the provisions enumerating the distribution of powers. Though the case for a strong Centre is strong, the Committee, as a matter of compromise and for the sake of peace and amity, recommended the vesting of the residuary powers in the Provinces, in accordance with the Muslim view. Mr. P. R. Das and some other members disagree with this recommendation.
 While the subjects allotted to the Centre are reduced to a minimum, it is provided that the Centre shall have powers to co-ordinate legislation and adminis- tration of different units when necessary as well as to ensure the maintenance of the political integrity and economic unity of India as a whole.
 REPRESENTATION  FOR  COMMUNITIES
 The Committee recommends that the constitution should provide for represen- tation of different communities in the Central Executive on the basis of their strength in the Legislature. The Cabinet will be a composite one only in the sense that communities will be represented on it, but in the interests of harmonious working “the Prime Minister’s choice of his colleagues is not to be fettered”. The Committee looks forward to the choice of members to whatever community they may belong on the basis of their political affiliations. The substitution of joint for  separate  electorate should, by compelling candidates to seek support from all communities, help the emergence of political parties each of which will contain members of different communities. It is on these considerations that “composite” instead of “coalition” Governments have been envisaged. It is also provided that there should be collective responsibility to the Legislature. The Committee prefers the British model, namely that the Prime Minister should choose his colleagues though a suggestion had been made that the Swiss model, under which the Central Legislature in joint session by single transferable vote elects the Cabinet and the Ministers hold office for the duration of the life of the Legislature, was made.
 INDIAN STATES AND FEDERATION
 Dealing with the Indian States, the Committee says that provision should be made in the constitution for the accession from time to time of Indian States as units of a Federation on such terms as may be agreed upon but the establishment of the Indian Union should not be contingent on the accession to the Federation of any Indian State or of any minimum unmber of Indian States. The Committee, therefore, contemplates that the Union need not be identical with Federation and it may include States which have not formally federated.
 The Committee say: “Our recommendation is that the new constitution should continue at least the unity that now binds the States and British India, though the bond may not be federal. Federation, we recognize, is a closer and a more intimate and efficient bond and we earnestly hope that in due course and after the fullest consultation and investigation, all th States—a few individually  but  the  great majority organized in groups and sub-federations—will have acceded as federated units of the Union. The inherent difficulties of bringing about such a happy con- summation  and  the  experience  of  negotiations   which   Lord   Linlithgow inaugu- rated and conducted between 1936 and 1939 do not encourage the hope that these consultations and investigations can be successfully concluded, except with the exercise of infinite patience and after lapse of several years. To hang up the Federal Union of such units as are willing to federate until some States, or a minimum number of States, or the last hesitant State has agreed to accede, would be a policy which is calculated to postpone indefinitely the elimination of foreign rule and the achieve- ment of full self-government. The Committee, therefore, insists that the Union of
 India should be established without any such waiting and that, while individual States might take their own time to make up their minds as to whether they would accede as federated units, all of them should, from the outset, be treated as in the Union, united with each other and with the rest of India through paramountcy at the Union Centre.”
 As regards paramountcy, the report says, “British suzerainty, which is the mainspring of paramountcy jurisdiction today, will have to cease to exist and the new Union Centre, that is, the Federal Cabinet will come to exercise that jurisdiction over the unfederated States.” The Committee hopes that the Rulers of States will not object to this inevitable development.
 The Committee is also of the view that the Crown Representative  as  a  separate office should disappear and the paramountcy jurisdiction now exercised by him should be transferred to the Union Cabinet. It is suggested that the Minister    of the Union Cabinet should be in charge of the States  affairs,  assisted  by  a  reformed Political Department. The Minister should also have a body of Indian Advisers to help him in administering paramountcy jurisdiction over the unfederated States.
 “HEAD OF STATE”
 On the question of “Head of the State”, the Committee says : “All parties  are agreed that the constitution should be based on Indian  independence  and, therefore, in law and in fact the indefeasible sovereignty of the people of India from whom alone all powers of legislation and administration should be derive, should be recognized. No foreign power should be allowed to exercise any juris- diction over  the  Indian   Union   and   therefore   the   existing   practice   by   which all residuary powers are exercised by the United Kingdom Parliament on the theory of “the indestructible sovereignty of the King in Parliament over the land through-out the  King’s  dominions”  will  not  be  acceptable   to   any   school   of   Indian political opinion. The Head of the State under the new constitution should replace the present chief Executive with his dual role as Viceroy and Crown’s Represen- tative. He will have such powers as are given to him under the constitution  as also such other powers as are now  vested  in  his  Majesty  the  King,  including powers connected with the exercise of the functions of the Crown in relation to Indian States. The Head of the State cannot act arbitrarily but only on the advice of the Ministry. His term of office may be for five years and ordinarily one person may not hold if for more than one term.
 MINORITY RIGHTS
 Dealing with the rights of the Scheduled Castes and other minorities, the Committee has provided that these communities will in future be accorded by statute a place on the Executive and will share in the responsibilities of administration. They will have adequate voice in framing the constitution with safeguards against hasty
 changes. They will have likewise the benefit of the fundamental rights with power to have more important ones enforced by the highest tribunal in the country. The Minorities Commission will keep a jealous watch over their welfare and will obtain relief when they are injured. The Committee hopes that with their rights ensured and protected, the minorities will not lose sight of their obligations to the sub-sections which exist in their midst.
 As regards the Scheduled Castes, the Committee recommends the continuation of the method of election prescribed in the Poona Pact.
 INDIANIZATION OF ARMED FORCES
 Dealing with the question of Indianization of armed forces the Committee says : “Under any system of real self-government, these must be in the charge of a member of a responsible ministry. The disciplinary head of the armed forces, the Commander-in-Chief, has to work under the orders of the Ministry and, on the Dominion analogy, the supreme command of the armed forces has to be vested in the Head of the State; Indian statute law will make provision for the government of the armed forces, the application of the British Army Act and any other enactment of a similar nature to the Indian Army being done away with.”
 The Committee lays great stress on the creation and rapid development of a National Army.
 SECESSION
 Dealing with the question of secession, the Committee takes strong exception to the provision contained in the Cripps offer in regard to secession. In the opinion  of the Committee such a provision amounts to the recognition of revolt from and repudiates the constitution. It is, in essence, an extraconstitutional act and common sense is against the constitution recognizing it as a legal right to be unilaterally exercised at the option of the unit.
 In the opinion of the Committee, the constitution-making  body  should proceed on the basis of framing the constitution for a single State as a safe- guard for minorities, it is provided that no decision of the constitution- making body will be valid unless it is supported by three-fourths of the members present and voting. Valid decisions of the Constituent Assembly must be binding on the British Government. The Committee says that a stage has been reached when the British Government can no longer evade responsibility. Therefore they should not allow things to drift and the situation to deteriorate.
 INTERIM GOVERNMENT
 In conclusion the Committee makes an earnest appeal to all communities and parties in the country to accept the principles underlying its recommendation. In the event of there being no agreement, the Committee calls upon His Majesty’s
 Government to set up an interim Government at the Centre and proceed to establish a suitable machinery for framing a new constitution, substantially on the principles enuciated by it and to have it put into operation at the earliest possible date by handing over all the power now vested in them to the authorities establised there- under.

 APPENDIX II
 CONGRESS WORKING COMMITTEE RESOLUTION ON INDONESIAlibtech_780_footnote
 The Working Committee have watched with admiration and sympathy the valiant struggle in defence of their newly won republic and independence which the people of Indonesia have been carrying on with steadfast courage and determination against British and Dutch forces. This Commitee emphatically condemn the wanton invasion of Java and other parts of Indonesia in order to impose Dutch imperialist domination on their inhabitants against their unanimous demand for a free State. Any support from any quarter to imperialist designs in Indonesia, Indo-China and elsewhere is resented throughout Asia as culpable violation of the professed aims of the United Nations and the undeniable right of Asian nationals. This will destroy the chance of international understanding and the very basis of any future world organization. The Committee regret that the United States of America have by their passive attitude encouraged these imperialist aggressions. While expressing their heartfelt sympathy with the Indonesia and Indo-Chinese nationalists for  the enormous loss and suffering inflicted upon them by the imperialist powers, this Committee are particularly distressed to find the units of the Indian army arrayed against the Indonesians and Indo-Chinese and view with deep indignation this mischievous misuse of the Indian forces by the British Government. This Committee note with resentment that the Government of India has  not  granted  necessary facilities to enable Jawaharlal Nehru to proceed to Java in response to Dr. Soekarno’s invitation to which the present intolerable state of humiliating helplessness is due.

 G. E. B. ABELL’S NOTE ON INTERVIEW WITH GANDHIJIlibtech_781_footnote
 SEVAGRAM,
 February 11, 1946 At 1 p. m. exactly I was taken along to Mr. Gandhi and was given a chair  beside him.  He sat on a mattress on the floor.  Mr. Pyarelal, Mr. Ghosh, Rajkumari
 Amrit Kaur and an anonymous young girl also sat on the floor.
 It was Mr. Gandhi’s day of silence. When I asked if I might speak first and deliver His Excellency’s message, he nodded assent.
 I said, His Excellency hoped he had recovered from the fatigue of his Madras tour. He wanted me to explain the grave food situation and ask for Mr. Gandhi’s help and co-operation. I had come without any high hopes as Mr. Ghosh had told me over the telephone that Mr. Gandhi’s attitude was thoroughly hostile—I said this in a joking way and Mr. Gandhi laughed heartily. His Excellency had toured in the scarcity areas of Bombay, Mysore and Madras. In these areas there were practically no crops. Food had to be found for the people of these areas for 8 to 10 months; otherwise there would be a disaster. There was a very heavy all-India dificiency and the world food situation was such that in spite of our best efforts we might get very little in the way of extra imports. Two different policies had been suggested. The first was to maintain the present basic ration of 1 lb. and rely on getting imports. The other was to cut down the rations every-where, impose equal sacrifices on all, and thus ensure that even if no extra imports were obtainable, the people in the villages  of South India would not starve. The Government of India were quite clear that the second was the right alternative. Mr. Gandhi signified that he agreed.
 I said that we had very slender reserves, and that hoarding was a grave danger. If political parties used the opportunity of the ration-cut to agitate against the Government and undermine confidence in the food administration, the result might be to make a large-scale disaster inevitable. We had no desire to shirk responsibility, but there was a clear humanitarian issue to which everyone must face up.
 On the political side, the scarcity involved a grave risk to the success of the efforts that would be made shortly to form a National Government and to get ahead with deliberations on a new Constitution. It would also be a very serious obstacle in the way of the new Ministries in the Provinces. The present Government was pre- pared to incur the odium of cutting the ration now in order that every available ounce of foodgrains should be saved for the scarcity areas, and a fair field given to the new Executive Council and the new Provincial Ministries.
 
 Though the Government of India would have welcomed the nomination of a Congress representative on the delegation now going to London, His Excellency realized that Mr. Gandhi might find it difficult to help in this particular matter. Mr. Gandhi nodded emphatically, and I did not pursue the point.
 It had also been suggested that Mr. Gandhi’s support to an appeal for imports would be valuable. I did not think His Excellency would press this either. Again an emphatic nod from Mr. Gandhi.
 His Excellency did, however, urge very strongly indeed that Mr. Gandhi should assist by not embarrassing the administration on the food issue—Party capital should not be made of it as the result of agitation would be panic, hoarding and the loss of many lives. Mr. Gandhi’s influence would be invaluable and His Excellency hoped he would use it.
 Mr. Gandhi was in a more friendly mood than I had expected. He wrote down that he had written at 5  a. m. that morning an article for the  Harijan which met  His Excellency’s requirements. This he produced. I read the article and said that though it contained some very useful advice to the public, the emphasis,  which was on the futility of the administration, was wrong, I thought he could do better than that.
 Mr. Gandhi wrote that the emphasis was a matter of opinion. His article showed a way out, which was to put in a National Government at once. I said His Excellency wanted such a Government as soon as possible but the President of the Congress himself had deprecated the formation of a new Executive Council until after the elections were over in the Provinces. Mr. Gandhi said that he personally dis- agreed with this. An Executive Council could be formed in two days. I said, I did not agree. A serious attempt would have to be made to get the Muslim League into such a Government. This would be very difficult and at the best take time. If it were urged that the League should be by-passed, at once I would say that this could not possibly be done during the elections. Nor, at such a critical time, could we have two changes of Government in the space of two or three months. (Mr. Gandhi made it clear he thought only of a short-term Interim Government to give way to another Government in April or May.) Finally there was the obvious difficulty about the budget. Mr. Gandhi seemed to be impressed with the practical difficulties and did not pursue the idea further.
 Mr. Gandhi then said, it would be helpful, if I would give him in
 writing suggestions as to what he should do. I said, if he wanted anything authorita- tive, I would ask His Excellency to send him a letter on my return, but I emphasized that we were short of time and wanted a lead from him in the next few days. He said it would help, if I wrote down my ideas “as a man”. I wrote down a few suggestions in the following words and got Rajkumari Amrit Kaur to give me a copy before I left :
  Put 	about the 	idea that sacrifices are 	necessary by 	all, rich and 	poor, in 	order that the 	poor may live. Encourage 	thrift, especially by housewives. Discourage 	hoarding as a criminally wicked act.  So 	far as 	possible give 	the lead to 	electioneering speakers 	either to speak 	helpfully on 	food or 	at least not 	to say 	anything that 	will tend to destroy confidence. 
 Other moves in the same direction will occur to you. May not the shor- tage be a blessing in disguise, if all parties and people work together both now and under a new government to mitigate the suffering of the poor?
 Mr. Gandhi read this and indicated that he was fully prepared to help on these lines. I asked him whether he would give a lead at once to Congress and electio- neering politicians all over India. He refused to commit himself firmly on this point, but sent a message after I had left him that he would consider making a Press statement. . . .
 Mr. Gandhi advised that His Excellency should send for Maulana Azad and say  to him what I had said to Mr. Gandhi. . . .
 Before leaving I asked what I should say to the Press. I told him that I had suggested that the Press should only be told today that I had gone to see Mr. Gandhi on His Excellency’s behalf to apprise him of the food situation in India as a whole. He said, he would like us to say no more than that, unless we added that His Ex- cellency had asked Mr. Gandhi to see him in Delhi but I had gone to Sevagram instead, because Mr. Gandhi, owing to his engagements, could not make the journey at once. He wanted no mention made of fatigue of ill-health and indeed he seemed very fit and spry.

 LETTER FROM M. R. JAYAKARlibtech_782_footnote
 
       DEAR 	MAHATMAJI,  BOMBAY,  February 	 8, 1946 
  You 	will kindly excuse this letter, which is consequent on the eventful 	news in today’s Press that H.H. the Aga Khan is meeting you on the 	20th at Poona. This is an astute move, which he foreshadowed during 	his interview on reaching India a few days ago. Why should he be 	bothering you with his attention instead of meeting Mr. Jinnah’s, 	it is not difficult to understand. You have done your best to meet 	Mr.    
 Jinnah’s point of view by offering a division of India, though on the basis of a friendly transaction between two brothers. Mr. Jinnah contemptuously spurned it wanting the division as between two separate nations. With this background, the Aga Khan should be busy in meeting Mr. Jinnah and not you. But he won’t do this because he knows that Mr. Jinnah will show him the door, if he tried to interfere. So he turns in your direction.
 As for the Aga Khan’s credentials to be an intermediary in such a vital cause, you will no doubt remember that he was the sponsor of the deputation to Lord Minto in 1906, asking for separate electorates—a deputation which the late Maulana Mohammed Ali described as a command performance. Further if you were aware of the proceedings of that deputation and knew, as I do, the activities of the Aga Khan during the four years of the Round Table Conferences in London, you would have no difficulty in realizing that, under the cloak of an international diplomat, he is as vicious a communalist as any in India. You will also recall what is now well-known, though at one time a part of the secret history of that time, that, on the occurrence of   a European crisis, the Aga Khan went to Turkey to carry on negotiations, but the Ata Turk Kamal Pasha, on becoming aware of his visit, summarily ordered him out of the country.
 These are some of the Aga Khan’s antecedents which I have been able to recall. So I am writing this letter, as I did during your talks with Mr. Jinnah, with  the view of conveying a caution—perhaps unnecessary—about the subtle nature of this attempt.
 As  reported  in  this  morning’s  papers,  the  Aga  Khan  talks  of   a   Pakis- tan State as part of an ‘Indian and South Asiatic Confederation’. The South Asiatic Confederation is not in his power to establish. It may or may not come. But, if you accede to his delusive scheme, the Pakistan in India will be established and the other ingredients of the scheme may evaporate into thin air. His clever device is to sink Pakistan in an attractive scheme of an Asiatic Confederation, but a little search into the matter will reveal that it is an astute method for obtaining for the Muslim League its cherished object of a divided India. I need not say anything more. I am aware, as you said in one of your replies to me that you will not be wanting in caution, remembering that, anything which you think of conceding, it will be difficult for the country later to avoid. Such is your great influence in the country.
 Begging you to excuse once more, I am,
      MAHATMA 	GANDHI SEVAGRAM 	WARDHA  Yours 	sincerely,  M. R. J.

 STATEMENT OF K. KAMARAJA AND  T. PRAKASAMlibtech_783_footnote
 KAMARAJA’S   STATEMENT
 After Gandhiji’s recent article, I feel that I can do nothing else than resign from the Parliamentary Board because all this conflict has come about only on account of the parliamentary programme. Yesterday the Parliamentary Board met, as already arranged. But meanwhile Gandhiji’s article appeared. That needed serious attention. So I adjourned the Board meeting, so that I may consider Gandhiji’s statement. It came as a shock to me.
 I am the official head of the Tamil Nadu Congress. According to the Cons- titution, I nominated the Working Committee. Therefore Gandhiji’s reference can only be applicable to me. I have paid my respects to Gandhiji in person, and have been in his calling distance in Madras and during his Tamil Nadu tour. So have been many of the other members of our Working Committee. It pains me much that Gandhiji did not talk to us anything about the Tamil Nadu Congress affairs while here. His use of the word “clique” affects me deeply.
 Neither I nor my colleagues believe in the parliamentary programme except as a means to further the country’s struggle for freedom. I had made my position clear on dozens of platforms since my release. At any rate I am no aspirer to any kind of office under the parliamentary activities.
 As for the public agitation against Rajaji, it is only the reaction among Congressmen and the public to Rajaji’s action and his speeches since his Pakistan resolution and resignation from the Congress. But, after Gandhiji’s recent article, I feel that I can do nothing else than resign from the Parliamentary Board, because all this conflict has come about only on account of the parliamentary programme.
 My four colleagues, Messrs T. S. Avinashilingam, C.  N.  Muthuranga Mudaliar, O. P. Ramaswamy Reddiar and Mrs. Rukmani Lakshmipathy felt compelled   to quit also. I have persuaded them to remain for the very simple reason that the short time available for the election work ahead could not admit of such wholesale resignations. I thank them for the spirit in which they have agreed to continue on the Board. They would certainly have been within their rights, if they had followed my example. But they and I do not want to disturb the election work.
 For my part, I cannot but quit.   For 20 years Gandhiji has been the leader whom   I have unswervingly followed and my faith in him continues unabated. That I should occasion him pain drives me to take the action I have decided to take. I assure
 
 
 
 everybody concerned that every decision taken by the Board here or at the centre will command my whole-hearted acceptances.
 PRAKASAM’S  STATEMENT
 February 13, 1946
 Mahatma Gandhi, who had declared more than once that he had nothing to do with Parliamentary politics and that he was not interested in anyone particularly, was led into a serious error when he characterized the official Tamil Nadu Congress as a “clique”.
 I feel strongly that Gandhiji should make amends in this matter, and I have every hope he will.
 Shri Kamaraja Nadar did well in resigning the presidentship of the Tamil Nadu Provincial Parliamentary Board.  He fought well over a big constitutional issue until  it became impossible for him to continue any further.

                 DEAR 	MR. GANDHI,  APPENDIX VI  LETTER FROM G. 	E. B. ABELLlibtech_784_footnote  THE 	 VICEROY’S 	 HOUSE, 	 NEW  DELHI,  February 	 26, 1946 
  Thank 	you for your 	letter of the 21st 	February making suggestions to 	meet the 	food situation. His 	Excellency, to 	whom I 	have shown your letter, 	is grateful 	to you 	for writing, and 	will have the 	various proposals 	examined where this has 	not been done already.   Only 		a day 		or two 		ago His Excellency 		suggested to the 		Commander-in- Chief 		that it might 		be possible 		for the R. 		I. N. to assist with 		fishing. Recent events 		may make this difficult, 		but meanwhile 		His Excellency 		has initiated 		enquiries about the 		possibility of 		importing dried fish 		from Canada and 		Newfoundland, and 		also about 		the securing 		of suitable 		vessels and equipment 		so as to make 		a start 		with developing 		on modern 		lines the fisheries 		industry. Already the 		Army is 		doing a 		good deal in 		the Grow More Food 		campaign and 		is releasing 		machinery for digging 		wells, levelling ground, etc.  In 		Delhi, a 		considerable part of 		the Central Vista is 		to be ploughed up 		and the 		gardens of 		bungalows are 		to be used for 		growing vegetables on 		a larger scale. The 		sending of 		food parcels 		to friends 		or relatives 		outside India has been 		ordered to 		be stopped 		and an 		urgent examination is 		being undertaken of 		the question 		of exporting 		groundnuts, oil-cakes, etc.     
  Bribery 	and corruption 	is admitted 	to be one 	of the 	worst enemies of 	efficient food 	administration. This 	is also 	one of the 	most difficult to 	defeat. The 	detailed implementing 	of the controls 	is mainly 	in the hands of 	Provincial Governments, 	and perhaps 	the new Ministries 	may be 	able to 	achieve results in 	this direction. 
      M. K. GANDHI, 	ESQ.  Yours sincerely,  G. E.  B. ABELL 
  Gandhiji’s 	Correspondence with the Government, 1944-47, p. 	143      APPENDIX VII  LETTER FROM 	SUDHIR GHOSHlibtech_785_footnote  During 	the conversation 	I had with 	you at Sevagram 	you talked 	about ‘distrus- ting’ 	one’s friend. I 	pondered over 	it after 	I left 	Sevagram. It 	made me 	feel that I 	ought to 	say something 	about what I 	am trying 	to do and 	why. It is difficult 	to talk about it. 	But I enclose 	a letter 	which a young 	Englishwoman wrote to me 	when I 	left Cambridge. I 	hope you will have a 	look at 	it in a spare 	moment. She was a 	Quaker and a 	deeply religious 	person. We 	worshipped together in 	the Friends’ 	Meet-ing House 	during our three 	years at the 	University. You 	know how 	young people get 	drawn towards each other 	and become 	fond of each 	other. We were 	very fond of each 	other; but 	we succeeded 	in keeping 	this friendship 	free from any sentimental 	bonds. She says 	in this 	letter : “You 	have not chosen 	to do anything 	easy and 	I fear 	that, humanly, 	you will 	often be lonely. 	But you have 	a source 	of strength 	which will not fail 	you in 	the worst 	trials and desolation. 	If my friendship 	can help, 	I shall 	be more 	than glad and 	shall send you 	my love 	as I do now.” 	She helped 	me to understand 	the good 	that is England, 	and Cambridge 	gave me 	the inspiration 	to work 	for peace betwen 	the British 	and the Indian 	peoples. When I 	left Cambridge 	in the 	summer of 	1940, she 	sent me 	a copy 	of the 	Oxford Book of 	Mystical Verses 	along with this 	letter. I 	experienced when 	I left 	Sevagram this 	time something of 	the ‘loneliness’ 	which she talks about in 	the letter. 	I know 	you will understand what 	I am 	trying to 	say.
