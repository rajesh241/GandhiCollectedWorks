Recognition of the right of every individual to exercise his civil rights unhampered and uninterfered with, provided he does not do anything in a manner which may offend his neighbour. (This will include right of every community to take out processions on roads, to kill any animal for sacrificial or other purposes and right of every community to offer prayers in any manner that community likes). (2.) Now that the total number of Muslim population has increased to almost one- third in the whole of India, a representation of one-third in all Central Legislatures and allotment of similar proportion of seats under the Government of India. These are some of the suggestions which I am making, and I am requesting you to kindly take up this question now in all seriousness for immediate solution. I have been writing to you for nearly two years and I hope you will not think it impatient on my part if I earnestly beseech you to kindly expedite matters specially in the present situation.” Vide also the following item."
