That he-goat was thus taken possession of by the Hindus, made Amar and made over to the Police for protection because Mohammedans got excited over their religious conduct. The Police kept the he-goat in the City Police Station but the Mohammedans numbering about 3,000 besieged that place and demanded the animal back by show of criminal force. The assailants scaled the walls of the Police Station with lathis and swords in their hands and were about to attack the Police when Military was called who dispersed them. No casualty happened” (S.N. 12397-A)."

Kalelkar had pointed out that all people in the world used skins of animals in olden times, that in the Vedic period sages used to sit upon deer-skins while performing yajnas, that Kshatriyas and dutiful kings went ahunting and killed deer and tigers for protecting crops and cattle. Since skins of dead animals and of animals killed for food could not be thrown away, they were freely used. As animals were currently being killed merely for their skins these latter ought to be discarded from the point of view of ahimsa. Kalelkar had made the further point that our ancestors were not unaware of silk though he held that originally there was no silk in India. As the people did not know that it came from China and was produced from the body of insects, they must have welcomed it. Once the people liked a thing, it was difficult to discard it. However, the moment this fact became known, they gave it up."
