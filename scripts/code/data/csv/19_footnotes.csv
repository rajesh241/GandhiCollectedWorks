In summing up, the Chief Justice in his judgment said: ‘I wish to make it perfectly clear that, apart from any other considerations, those who are enrolled as advocates or pleaders of this High Court or of the District Courts cannot serve two masters. It may be that after due consideration of this expression of our opinion, the respondents may see the force of it. We have no desire to deal harshly with them and for the present we shall content ourselves with giving them the warning. We do so because we are told that the Satyagraha Sabha since the riots of April has been quiescent. Whether we shall take any further action depends entirely on the development, if any, of the satyagraha movement, so that these notices will be adjourned with leave to the Advocate-General and the respondents to move for their restoration to the Board should occasion arise.’ ”"

The Registrar wrote in reply: “With reference to your telegram of the 20th instant, I am directed by the Hon’ble the Chief Justice to say that His Lordship does not want to interfere with your preparations for going to the Punjab.

The chief 	reason is stated 	to be that 	through the 	Indian contact depravity 	is the result, 	but advance under 	Christian Western 	civilization. The 	Government Economic 	Commission report recently published takes the 	same attitude 	mentioning specifically 	the Indian 	moral depravity and 	approving the 	South African 	exclusion policy. 	Intense indignation 	was expressed here by the 	local Indian Congress gathering which 	was remarkable 	for its weight 	and numbers. 	I have 	decided, on 	urgent request, to 	stay till January 	here. The Congress 	Committee decided on my 	suggestion to 	abandon the 	claim for 	preferential treatment in 	German East Africa 	while demanding 	complete continuance of 	all existing 	rights. Circulate and 	explain the situation.” 	The statement 	appears to have 	been released generally 	to the 	Press as 	an Associated 	Press message and was 	published in 	several newspapers.

Yesterday I was informed by the Government of India that the Savarkar Brothers were not included in those that are to be released. The telegram runs as follows: ‘Your telegram 8th inst. Savarkar Brothers have not been included in those receiving clemency under the amnesty.’ It is now clear that the Indian Govt. have decided not to release them. Please let me hear from you as to how to proceed in such circumstances. They (my brothers) have already undergone a rigorous sentence for more than ten years in the Andamans and their health is utterly shattered. Their weight has come down from 118 to 95-100. Though they are given a hospital diet at present, their health does not show any sign of improvement. At least a change to some Indian jail of better climate is the most essential for them. I have received a letter from one of them very recently (a month back) in which all this is mentioned. I hope that you will let me know what you mean to do in this matter.” The Savarkar Brothers had been sentenced to life. They were ultimately released in 1937."

Keen disappointment non 	attending.”
libtech_349_footnote,"2A Gujarati version of the letter in Navajivan, 25-1-1920, has the following additional paragraph: “The third point raised in the cable is about the proposed increase in the powers of municipalities. Ordinarily, everyone would welcome such an increase but, looking to what has happened in the present case, in South Africa and the other Colonies, this increase will mean investing the municipalities with power to persecute the dependent and disenfranchisedclasses. In the event, the latter will find the increased powers of municipalities not to their benefit but to their detriment. In the Transvaal and the Free State, Indians have no political or municipal franchise. They have a measure of franchise in Natal and the Cape, but not sufficient to enable them to influence the working of municipalities or to have their wishes respected.”"

I would strongly urge that the mill-hands should be left untouched. The further proviso is that there should be no violence accompanying the hartal. I have been often told that the C.I.D. sometimes promote violence. I do not believe in it as a general charge. But even if it be true, our discipline should make it impossible. Our success depends solely on our ability to control, guide and discipline the masses."
