		DEPARTMENT, GOVERNMENT OF INDIA","
       DETENTION CAMP,  January 	27, 1944  ADDITIONAL 	SECRETARY 	TO THE GOVERNMENT 	OF INDIA 	(HOME 	DEPARTMENT)  NEW 	DELHI 	SIR, Some 	days ago Shri Kasturba Gandhi told the Inspector-General  	of prisons and Col. Shah that Dr. Dinshaw Mehta of Poona be invited 	to assist in her treatment. Nothing seems to have come out of her 	request. She has become insistent now and asked me if I had written 	to the Government in the matter. I, therefore, ask for immediate 	permission to bring in Dr. Mehta. She has also told me and my son 	that she would like to have some Ayurvedic physician to see her.libtech_1_footnoteI suggest that the I.G.P. be authorized to permit 	such assistance when requested.   I have no reply as yet to my requestlibtech_2_footnotelibtech_3_footnotethat Shri Kanu Gandhi, who 		is being 		permitted to 		visit the patient 		every alternate day, be 		allowed to 		remain in 		the camp 		as a 		whole-time nurse. 		The patient shows no 		signs of 		recovery and 		night-nursing is 		becoming more 		and more exacting. 		Kanu Gandhi 		is an 		ideal nurse, having 		nursed the 		patient before. And 		what is 		more, he 		can soothe 		her by 		giving her 		instrumental music 		and by singing 		bhajans. I 		request early relief to 		relieve the existing 		pressure. The matter 		may be 		treated as 		 very  urgent.  The 		Superintendent of the 		camp informs 		me that when visitors 		come, one nurse only 		can be present. 		Hitherto more than one 		nurse has 		attended when 		necessary. The 		Superintendent used his 		discretion as 		to the necessity. 		But when difficulty 		arose I 		made a 		reference to 		the I.G.P. 		The result 		was that 		an order 		was issued 		that a doctor 		in addition 		may be 		present. I 		submit that 		the order has 		been issued 		in ignorance 		or disregard 		of the 		condition of 		the patient.She 		often requires to be helped by more persons than one. Therefore I ask        
 that there should be no restriction as to the number of the attendants.
  It 	would be 	wrong on 	my part, if 	I suppressed 	the fact that in 	the facilities 	being allowed to the 	patient grace has 	been sadly lacking. 	The order about the 	attendants is 	the most glaring 	instance of pin-pricks, 	besides being 	in defeat 	of the 	purpose  for 	 which attendance 	during visits of 	relatives is 	allowed. Again, my 	three sons 	are in 	Poona. The 	eldest, Harilal, who 	is almost 	lost to 	us, was not 	allowed yesterday, the 	reason being that the 	I.G.P. had 	no instructions 	to allow 	him to 	come again. And 	yet the patient was 	naturally anxious 	to meet 	him. To cite 	one more pin-prick, 	every time visitors 	who are on the 	permitted list 	come, they 	have to apply 	to Government 	Office, Bombay, 	for permission. 	The consequence 	is that 	there is unnecessary 	delay and 	heart-burning. The 	difficulty, I imagine, 	arises because neither 	the Superintendent 	nor the I.G.P. 	has any function 	except that of 	passing on 	my requests to Bombay.  I 	am aware 	that Shri Kasturba is 	a Government 	patient, and that 	even as her 	husband I 	should have no 	say about 	her. But, as the 	Government have been 	pleased to say 	that instead of 	being discharged 	she is 	being kept 	with me in her 	own interest, perhaps, 	in interpreting 	her wishes 	and feelings, 	I am doing 	what the Government 	would desire and 	appreciate. Her 	recovery or 	at least mental peace 	when she is lingering 	is common 	cause between the 	Government and 	me. Any jar tells 	on her.

 Mr. Ramdas said that Government was taking unnecessary risk in detaining Mrs. Gandhi. The old man (Gandhiji) replied that there was a greater risk in releasing her. In case she was released and if she died, Government would be compelled to release him, which they did not like to risk.
 Mr. Ramdas said that it was his impression that Harilal, being an irresponsible man, might give in papers anything about the Palace, and hence Government were reluctant to give Harilal frequent interviews. Mr. Gandhi laughed and said:
 Perhaps I may take advantage of Harilal’s weakness and ask him to do something for me.

She has no particular Ayurvedic physician in mind, but my son
 
 Devdas suggested the name of Vaidyaraj Sharma of Lahore. Any physician who is admitted will be in addition to Dr. Dinshaw, and that too, if and when the latter has failed to give satisfaction. She has often expressed a desire to be seen by an Ayurvedic physician. If the permission is granted, it should be of a general character. She is losing will-power and I have to judge between a multiplicity of advice so long as I am permitted to have responsibility for her peace of mind, which is about all that is possible at this stage.

 THROUGH THE BOMBAY GOVERNMENT DEAR DAUGHTER,
 Your letterlibtech_12_footnotelibtech_13_footnotereached me yesterday about 2 p.m. What can I write to you? The news which I read in the papers was read out by me to Ba. Thereupon with tears in her eyes Ba said: “Oh God (Rama) I am at death’s door and I am not taken away while Ranjit is taken away! What will happen to Sarup?” I did not feel like that. You cannot become helpless. You are a brave daughter of a brave father,and brave sister of a similarly brave brother. The disease of Ranjit was such that he had to go before his time. His body was not meant to suffer jail life. But all these are my imaginations. The fact is that God gives you birth and whenever He likes He takes you up. And this is all for the body. Soul, however, neither takes birth nor dies. You had married a soul named Ranjit. You can never become a widow. You have rightly stated that you will represent all the qualities of Ranjit. May God satisfy this wish of yours. You should look after your body and be engrossed in your duty.

  	Shri Kasturba asked me yesterday when Dr. Dinshaw was coming, and 	whether a vaidya (Ayurvedic physician) could see her and give her 	some drugs. I told her, I was trying for both but that we were 	prisoners and could not have things as we liked. She has since been 	repeatedly asking me whether I could not do  something  to hasten 	matters. She had a restless night again. This is, of course, nothing 	new for her at present. I request immediate orders about Dr. Dinshaw 	and Vaidyaraj Sharma of Lahore.

 Immediate DETENTION CAMP,
 February 14, 1944
 THE INSPECTOR-GENERAL OF PRISONS POONA
 SIR,
 I told you yesterday that Shri Kasturba was so bad during the night that Dr. Nayyar got frightened and awakened Dr. Gilder. I felt that she was going. The doctors were naturally helpless. Dr. Nayyar had, therefore, to wake up the Superintendent who kindly phoned the Vaidyaraj. It was then about 1 a.m. Had he been on the premises he would certainly have given relief. I, therefore, asked you to let him stay at the camp during the night. But you informed me, theGovernment orders did not cover night stay. The Vaidyaraj, however, you said, could be called in during the night. I pointed out the obvious danger of delay but you were sorry, the orders would not allow you to go further. In vain I argued that the Government having given the authority to call in Vaidyaraj on condition that I absolved them from responsibility for any untoward result of the vaidic treatment, they could not contemplate any restriction on the duration of the physician’s stay at the camp so long as it was thought necessary in the interest of the patient. In view of your rejection of my request, I had to trouble the Vaidyaraj to rest in his car in front of the gate so that in case of need he might be called in.  He  very  humanly consented. He had to be called in and he was able to bring the desired relief. The crisis has not passed as yet. I, therefore, repeat my request and ask for immediate relief. I would like, if I can, to avoid the last night’s experience. I do wish that the vexations caused by the delay in granting my requests about the patient’s treatment came to an end. Both Dr. Mehta and the Vaidyaraj were permitted to come in after protracted delay. Precious time was lost making recovery more uncertain than it was. I hope you will be able to secure the necessary authority for the vaid’s stay in the camp during night, if the patient’s condition requires it. The patient needs constant and continuous attention.
 I am,
 Yours, etc.,

 Immediate DETENTION CAMP,
 February 16, 1944
 THE INSPECTOR-GENERAL OF PRISONS POONA
 SIR,
 This is in continuation of my letterlibtech_31_footnotelibtech_32_footnoteof the 14th instant. When I askedlibtech_33_footnotelibtech_34_footnotefor  Vaidyaraj  and  took  upon  myself  the  responsibilitylibtech_35_footnotelibtech_36_footnoteof changing Shri Kasturba’s treatment, and absolved the Government physician of all responsibility, I naturally took for granted that the Vaidyaraj would be allowed such facilities as would in his opinion be necessary for carrying out his treatment. The patient’s nights are  much worse than her days and it is essentially at night that constant attendance is necessary. The Vaidyaraj considers himself handicapped in his treatment of the case under the present arrangement.
 In order to be within immediate call, he has been good enough to sleep in his car outside the gate of this camp for the last three nights, and every night he has had to be called up at least once. This is an unnatural state of things and, though he seems to have infinite capacity for suffering inconvenience for the sake of the patient, I may not take undue advantage of his generous nature. Besides, it means disturbing the Superintendent and his staff (in fact the whole camp) once or more often during the night. For instance, last night she suddenly developed fever with rigor. The Vaidyaraj, who had left the premises at 10.30 p.m., had to be called in at 12 midnight. I had to request him to leave her soon afterwards, although he would have liked to have stayed with her longer, because so long as he stayed in, it would have meant keeping the Superintendent and his staff awake which might have been even for the whole night. I would not do this even for saving my life-long partner especially when I know that a
 
 humane way is open.
 As I have said already, the Vaidyaraj considers it necessary to be in constant attendance on the patient. He varies the drugs from  moment to moment as the patient’s condition requires. Drs. Gilder’s and Nayyar’s assistance is at my disposal all the time—they are more than friends and would do everything in their power for the patient. But, as I have said in my last letter, they cannot help while treatment of  a wholly different nature from theirs is going on. Besides, being in its very nature impracticable, such a course would be unjust  to  the patient, to the Vaidyaraj and to themselves.
 I, therefore, submit below the following three alternative proposals:
  Vaidyaraj 	should be permitted 	to remain 	in the 	camp day and night 	so long 	as he considers 	it necessary 	in the  interests  of 	 the patient.  If 	the Government 	cannot agree to this, 	they may release 	the patient 	on parole to 	enable her 	to receive the full 	benefit of the 	physician’s treatment.  If 	neither of these 	two proposals are 	acceptable to 	the Government, I request 	that I be relieved of 	the responsibility  of 	looking after the 	patient. If 	I as 	her husband 	cannot procure for her 	the help 	she wants 	or that 	I think 	necessary, I 	ask for my 	removal to 	any other 	place of detention 	that the Government 	may choose. 	I must 	not be made 	a helpless 	witness of 	the agonies 	the patient 	is passing 	through. 
 The Government have kindly permitted Dr. Mehta to visit the patient at her repeated requests. His help is valuable, but he does not prescribe drugs. She needs the physical therapy given by him which soothes her greatly but she cannot do without drug treatment either. Drugs can only be prescribed by the doctors or the Vaidyaraj. The doctors’ treatment has already been suspended. In the absence of a satisfactory reply to this letter by this evening, I shall be constrained to suspend Vaidyaraj’s treatment also. If she cannot have the drug treatment which she should in full, I would rather that she did without it altogether.
I am writing this by the patient’s bedside at 2 a.m. She is
 oscillating between life and death. Needless to say she knows nothing of this letter. She is now hardly able to judge for herself.
 I am, etc.,

The latter must carry with it the deliverance of India from the foreign yoke. The spirit; of India demands complete freedom from all foreign dominance and would, therefore, resist Japanese yoke equally with British or any other. The Congress represents that spirit in full measure. It has grown to be an institution whose roots have gone deep down into the Indian soil. I was, therefore, staggered to read that Government were satisfied with things as they were going. Had they not got from among the Indian people the men and money they wanted? Was not the Government machinery running smooth? This self satisfaction bodes ill for Britain, India and the world, if it does not quickly give place to a searching of hearts in British high places.

        THE 	INSPECTOR-GENERAL 	OF PRISONS 	POONA  SIR,  DETENTION CAMP,  February 	18, 1944 
  	Vaidyaraj Shri Shiv Sharma regretfully informs me that having put 	forth all the resources at his disposal, he has been unable to 	produce a condition in Shri Kasturba so as to give him hope of final 	recovery. As his was simply a trial to see whether Ayurvedic 	treatment could yield better result, I have now asked Drs. Gilder 	and Nayyar to resume the suspended treatment. Dr. Mehta’s 	assistance was never suspended and will be continued till recovery 	or the end.  	I want to say that the Vaidyaraj has been most assiduous and 	attentive in the handling of this most difficult case, and I would 	have willingly allowed him to continue his treatment, if he had 	wished to do so. But he would not continue it, when his last 	prescription failed to bring about the result he had expected. Drs. 	Gilder and Nayyar tell me that they would like to receive the 	benefit of the Vaidyaraj’s assistance in the matter of sedatives, 	purgatives and the like. These have proved effective both from the 	doctors’ and the patient’s point of view. I hope that the 	Government will have no objection to the Vaidyaraj continuing to 	come in for the purpose. Needless to say, under the altered 	circumstances, he will not be required for night    
 duty. I cannot refrain from regretfully saying that had there not been the wholly avoidable delay in granting my request for allowing the services of the Vaidyaraj and Dr. Mehta, the patient’s condition might not have been so near the danger point as it is today. I am well aware that nothing happens outside the Divine Will, but man has noother means of interpreting that Will apart from the results he can see.

 SIR,
 I have read the speech of the Hon’ble the Home Member in the Assembly on the debatelibtech_56_footnotearising out of the ban on Shrimati Sarojini Devi. The speech has reference, among other things, to the correspondence between Shrimati Mirabai and myself and the Government’s refusal to publish that correspondence. The following is the relevant portion of the speech:
 She (Shrimati Sarojini Devi) refers, and the point has been raised in this debate, to a letter said to have been writtenlibtech_57_footnoteby Miss Slade to Mr. Gandhi and Mr. Gandhi’s reply libtech_58_footnoteand I have been asked why no publicity was given to that letter. That letter was written and answered long before the Congress leaders were placed in detention. If Mr. Gandhi had wished to give publicity to that letter, he was perfectly free to do it himself. But it was a confidential communication addressed to him, and I do not see any reason why Government should disclose a communication of that nature. I might say that it would not help the Congress case, if it were disclosed.
 Then it has been said that Mrs. Naidu wishes to defend the Congress from the implication of being pro-Japanese. Government have never at any time, either here or at home, charged the Congress with being pro-Japanese. Well, the allusion to that in the booklet called Congress Responsibility refers to a statement quoted from Pandit Nehru himself. I have not the time to quote it  at length but if Hon’ble Members will refer to the quotation given in the Congress Responsibility pamphlet, they will easily find the passage in question.
 Assuming that the report is correct, it makes strange reading. Firstly, as to the non-publication by me of this correspondence
 
 between Shrimati Mirabai and myself, surely the publication wasunnecessary until the charge of my being pro-Japanese was spread abroad. Secondly, why do the Government feel squeamish about publishing “confidential” correspondence when both the correspondents have specially invited publication?
 Thirdly, I do not understand the reluctance of the Government to publish the correspondence when, according to the Hon’ble the Home Member, the correspondence will not serve the Congress case. Fourthly, the Government seem intentionally or unintentionally to have suppressed the very relevant fact that Shrimati Mirabai wrote to Lord Linlithgow drawing attention to the libellous propaganda in the London Press at the time, containing allegations that I was pro-Japanese, which allegations she invited him to repudiate. Her letterlibtech_59_footnotelibtech_60_footnoteto  Lord  Linlithgow  enclosed  copies  of   the   correspondence referred to and asked for its publication. It was written on December 24, long before the Government publication entitled Congress Responsibility which bears the date February 13, 1943, appeared. Fifthly, as to Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru’s alleged statement before the Working Committee, I have already made it clear in my replylibtech_61_footnoteto the Government pamphlet that it was wholly wrong on their part to make use of the unauthorized notes of the discussions at the Allahabad meeting of the Working Committee, after Pandit Nehru’s emphatic repudiationlibtech_62_footnotelibtech_63_footnotepublished in the daily Press.
 It is difficult for me to understand the Hon’ble the Home Member’s speech and the Government’s persistence in making  charges and innuendoes against Congress people whom they have put in custody and thus effectively prevented from answering those charges. I hope, therefore, that the Government will at the very least see their way to publish the correspondence referred to, namely,

 CHI. MANUDI,
 Did you sleep well? Yesterday I drafted a long letter about keeping you and Prabhavati here, but I kept thinking over the matter the whole of last night and could get no sleep. In the end, I saw light. We cannot make such a request. Aren’t we prisoners after all? We must endure our separation. You are a sensible girl. Forget your sorrow. You want to do great service. Stop crying and live cheerfully. Learn what you can after leaving the jail. After all this service that you have given, you are bound to prosper no matter what happens.
 More after my silence ends. I am your mother. Am I not? It  is  enough, if you understand this much.

 I feel much worried about you. You are a class by yourself. You are good, simple-hearted and ever ready to help others. Service has become dharma with you. But you are still uneducated and silly also. If you remain illiterate, you will regret it, and if I live long, I too will regret it. I will certainly miss you, but I do not like to keep you near me as that would be weakness and ignorant attachment. I am quite sure that at present you should go to Rajkot. You will get there the benefit of the company of Narandas; such good company you will get nowhere else. You will learn there besides music, the art of working methodically. You will learn Gujarati, too. There may be  other benefits also. If you spend at least one year there, your slovenliness will disappear. If you go to Karachi or anywhere else you like after you have become more mature, you will get all that you want. Gurudayaljilibtech_66_footnotelibtech_67_footnotewill not be in Karachi for long now. Hence you will get only education there. That also will be useful, of course. Living in the company of so many girls will also do you good. But what you will get in Rajkot you will get nowhere else.

 THE ADDITIONAL SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA (HOME DEPARTMENT), NEW DELHI
  SIR,   In reply to a 	question in the Assembly, the Hon’ble the Home 
 Member 	is reported to have said:libtech_68_footnote     
 The provision for the expenses of Mr. Gandhi and those detained with him in the Aga Khan’s Palace amounted to about Rs. 550 a month.
In my letterlibtech_69_footnotelibtech_70_footnoteto you dated 26th October last I remarked as follows:
 The huge place in which I am being detained with a biglibtech_71_footnoteguard around me, I hold to be waste of public funds. I should be quite content to pass my days in any prison.
 The Hon’ble the Home Member’s reply quoted  above  is  a sharp reminder to me that I should have followed up the remark just referred to by me. But it is never too late to mend. I, therefore, take up the question now.
 The expenses on behalf of my companions and me are not merely Rs. 550 per month. The rent of this huge place (of which only a portion is open to us) and the expense of maintaining the big outer guard and an inner staff consisting of Superintendent, jamadar and sepoys have got to be added. And to this a large squad of convicts from Yeravda to serve the inmates and to look after the garden. Virtually the whole of this expense is, from my point of view, wholly unnecessary; and when people are dying of starvation, it is almost a crime against Indian humanity. I ask that my companions and I be removed to any regular prison Government may choose. In conclusion, I cannot conceal from myself the sad thought that the whole expense of thiscomes from taxes collected from the dumb millions of India.
 I am, etc.,

 THE ADDITIONAL SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA (HOME DEPARTMENT) , NEW DELHI
  SIR,   It is not without 	regret and hesitation that I write about my dead 
 wife. 	But truth demands this letter.     
 According to the newspapers, Mr. Butlerlibtech_72_footnoteis reported  to  have said in the House of Commons on 2nd March, 1944:
 “...She was receiving all possible medical care and attention, not only from her regular attendants but from those desired by her family.	”
Whilst I gratefully acknowledge that the regular attendants did
 all they could, the help that was asked for by the deceased or by me on her behalf, when at all given, was given after a long wait, and the Ayurvedic physician, was permitted to attend only after I had to telllibtech_73_footnotethe prison authorities that, if I could not procure for the patient the help that she wanted or I thought necessary, I should be separated from her, I ought not to be made a helpless witness of the agonies she was passing through. And even then I could make full use of the Vaidyaraja’s  services  only  after  I  wrote  a  letterlibtech_74_footnotelibtech_75_footnoteto   the   Inspector General of Prisons of which a copy is hereto attached. My applicationlibtech_76_footnotefor Dr. Dinshaw was made in writing on 27th January, 1944. The deceased herself had repeatedly asked the Inspector-General of Prisons for Dr. Dinshaw Mehta’s help during practically a month previous to that. He was allowed to come only from February 5, 1944. Again, the regular physicians Drs. Nayyar and Gilder made a written applicationlibtech_77_footnotefor consultation with Dr. B. C. Roy of Calcutta on31st January, 1944. The Government simply ignored their written request and subsequent oral reminders.
Mr. Butler is further reported to have said:
 No request for her release was received and the Government of India believe it would be no act of kindness to her or her family to remove her from the Aga Khan’s Palace.
Whilst it is true that no request was made by her or by me (as
 satyagrahi prisoners it would have been unbecoming), would it not have been in the fitness of things, if the Government had at least offered to her, me and her sons to release her? The mere offer of release would have produced a favourable psychological effect on her
 
 mind. But unfortunately no  such offer was  ever made. As to the funeral rites, Mr. Butler is reported to have said:
 I have information that the funeral rites took place at the request of Mr. Gandhi in the grounds of the Aga Khan’s Palace at Poona, and friends and relatives were present.
The   followinglibtech_78_footnotelibtech_79_footnote,  however,  was  my   actual   request   which   the
Inspector-General of Prisons took down in writing from dictation at
8.07 p.m. On February 22, 1944. . . .
 Government will perhaps admit that I have scrupulously avoided making any political capital out of my wife’s protracted illness and the difficulties I experienced from the Government. Nor do I want to make any now. But in justice to her memory, to me and for the sake of truth, I ask the Government to make such amends as they can. If the newspaper report is inaccurate in essential particulars or the Government have a different interpretation of the whole episode, I should be supplied with the correct version and the Government interpretation of the whole episode. If my complaint is held to be just,  I trust that the amazing statement said to have been made in America by the Agentlibtech_80_footnotelibtech_81_footnoteof the Government of India in   U.S.A.  will  be  duly corrected.libtech_82_footnote

23,"March 	9, 1944",LETTER. TO LORD WAVELL,"
         DEAR 	FRIEND,       March 	9, 1944 
  	I must thank you for your prompt replylibtech_84_footnotelibtech_85_footnoteto 	my letter of 17th February. At the outset, I send you and Lady 	Wavell my thanks for your kind condolences on the death of my wife. 	Though for her sake I have welcomed her death as bringing freedom 	from living agony, I feel the loss more than I had thought I should. 	We were a couple outside the ordinary. It was in 1906 that after 	mutual consent and after unconscious trials we definitely adopted 	self-restraint as a rule of life. To my great joy this knit us 	together as never before. We ceased to be two different entities. 	Without my wishing it, she chose to lose herself in me. The result 	was she became truly my better half. She was  a woman always 	of very strong will which, in our early days, I used to mistake for 	obstinacy. But that strong will enabled her to become quite 	unwittingly my teacher in the art and practice of non-violent 	non-co-operation. The practice began with my own family. When I 	introduced it in 1906, in the political field, it came to be known 	by the more comprehensive and specially coined name of satyagraha. 	Whenthe course of Indian imprisonment commenced in South Africa, 	Shri Kasturba was among the civil resisters. She went through 	greater physical trials than I. Although she had gone through 	several     
 imprisonments, she did not take kindly to the present incarceration during which all creature comforts were at her disposal. My arrest simultaneously with that of many others, and her own immediately following, gave her a great shock and embittered her. She was wholly unprepared for my arrest. I had assured her that the Government trusted my non-violence, and would not arrest me unless I courted arrest myself. Indeed the nervous shock was so great that after her arrest she developed violent diarrhoea and, but for the attention that Dr. Sushila Nayyar, who was arrested at the same time as the deceased, was able to give her, she might have died before joining me in this detention camp. My presence soothed her, and the diarrhoea stopped without any further medicament. Not so the bitterness. It led to fretfulness ending in painfully slow dissolution of the body.
   In 		the light 		of the 		foregoing, you 		will perhaps understand 		the pain 		I felt 		when I read 		in the 		papers the 		statement made 		on behalf 		of the Government, 		which I 		hold was 		an unfortunate 		departure from truth 		regarding her 		who was precious to 		me beyond measure. I 		ask you please to send for and read the complaintlibtech_86_footnotelibtech_87_footnotein the matter which I have 		forwarded to 		the Additional 		Secretary to 		the Government of 		India (Home 		Department). Truth is 		said to 		be the first 		and the heaviest 		casualty in war. How I 		wish in this war it could be otherwise in the case of the Allied powers!  I 		now come 		to your 		address which you 		delivered before 		the Legislature 		and of 		which you 		kindly sent me copy. 		When the newspapers 		containing the address 		were received, I was by 		the bedside of the 		deceased. Shri 		Mirabai read 		to me the 		Associated Press 		report. But 		my mind 		was elsewhere. 		Therefore the receipt 		of your 		speech in a handy 		form was most welcome. 		I have now read it 		with all the 		attention it 		deserves. Having 		gone through it, 		I feel 		drawn to offer 		a few 		remarks, all 		the more so, 		as you 		have observed 		that the views 		expressed by 		you “need 		not be 		regarded as 		final”. May 		this letter 		lead to 		a re-shaping of 		some of them!  In 		the middle 		of page two, you 		speak of the 		welfare of the“Indian 		peoples”. I have 		seen in some 		Viceregal 		pronouncements the 		inhabitants of 		India being referred 		to as the 		people of 		India. Are 		the two expressions synonymous?  
 
 
   At 		page thirteen, 		referring to 		the attainment of 		self-government by 		India, you say:  
 I am absolutely convinced not only that the above represents the genuine desire of the British people, but that they wish to see an early realization of it. It is qualified only at present by an absolute determination to let nothing stand in the way of the earliest possible defeat of Germany and Japan; and by a resolve to see that in the solution of the constitutional problem full account is taken of the interests of those who have loyally supported us in this war and at all other times—the soldiers who have served the common cause; the people who have worked with us; the Rulers and populations of the States to whom we are pledged; the minorities who have trusted us to see that they get a fair deal. . . but until the two main Indian parties at least can come to terms, I do not see any immediate hope of progress.
Without reasoning out I venture to give my paraphrase of your
 pronouncement. ‘We, the British, shall stand by the Indian soldier whom we have brought into being and trained for consolidating our rule and position in India, and who, by experience, we have found can effectively help us in our wars against other nations. We shall also stand by the Rulers of the Indian States, many of whom are our creation, and all of whom owe their present position to us, even when these Rulers curb or actually crush the spirit of the people whom they rule. Similarly shall we stand by the minorities whom too we have encouraged and used against the vast majority when the latter have at all attempted to resist our rule. It makes no difference that they (the majority) seek to replace it by a rule of the will of people of India taken as a whole. And in no case will we transfer power unless Hindus and Muslims come to us with an agreement among themselves.’ The position taken up in the paragraph quoted and interpreted by me is no new thing. I regard the situation thus envisaged as hopeless, and I claim in this to represent the thought of the man in the street. Out of the contemplation of this hopelessness was born the anguished cry of “Quit India”. What I see happening in this country day after day provides a complete vindication of the “Quit India” formula  as defined by me in my considered writings.
   I 		note, as 		I read 		your speech, that 		you do 		not regard 		the sponsors 		of the 		formula of 		“Quit India” as 		outcastes to 		be shunned by 		society. You believe 		them to 		be high-minded persons. 		Then treatthem as such and trust their interpretation of their own formula  
 and you cannot go wrong.
   After 		developing the 		Cripps offer you 		have said at page 		sixteen in 		the middle 		of the paragraph:  
 . . . the demand for release of those leaders who are in detention is an utterly barren one until there is some sign on their part of willingness to co-operate. It needs no consultation with anyone or anything but his own conscience for anyone of those under detention to decide whether he will withdraw from the Quit India resolution and the policy which had such tragic consequences, and will co-operate in the great tasks ahead.
Then again, reverting to the same subject you say on pages
nineteen and twenty:
 There is an important element which stands aloof, I recognize how much ability and high-mindedness it contains; but I deplore its present policy and methods as barren and unpractical. I should like to have the co-operation of this element in solving the present and the future problems of India. If its leaders feel that they cannot consent to take part in the present Government of India, they may still be able to assist in considering future problems. But I see no reason to release those responsible for the declaration of August 8, 1942, until I am convinced that the policy of non-co-operation and even of obstructions has been withdrawn—not in sack-cloth and ashes that helps no one, but in the recognition of a mistaken and unprofitable policy.
  I 		am surprised that 		you, an eminent soldier 		and man of  
 affairs, should hold such an opinion. How can the withdrawal of a resolution, arrived at jointly by hundreds of men and women after much debating and careful consideration, be a matter of individual conscience? A resolution jointly undertaken can be honourably, conscientiously and properly withdrawn only after joint discussion and deliberation. Individual conscience may come into play after this necessary step, not before. Is a prisoner ever free to exercise his conscience? Is it just and proper to expect him to do so?
   Again, 		you recognize 		“much ability and 		high-mindedness” in 		those who 		represent the 		Congress organization 		and then deplore 		their present policy 		and methods 		as “barren 		and unpractical”. 		Does not 		the second statement 		cancel the first? 		Able and high-minded 		men may 		come to erroneous 		decisions, but I 		have not before 		heard such people’s 		policy and methods 		being described 		as “barren 		 and unpractical”. 		Is it not 		up to you 		to discuss 		the pros 		and cons 		of their 		policy with 		them before pronouncing 		judgment, especially when 		they are also admittedly representatives of millions of their people? Does it  
 become an all-powerful Government to be afraid of the consequences of releasing unarmed men and women with a backing only of men and women equally unarmed and even pledged to non-violence? Moreover why should you hesitate to know their minds and reactions?
   Then 		you have talked of 		the “tragic 		consequences” of 		the “Quit India” resolution. I   have  said 		 enough 		 in  my  replylibtech_88_footnotelibtech_89_footnoteto  the 		Government pamphlet 		Congress 		Responsibility, etc., 		combating the 		charge that the 		Congress was 		responsible for 		those consequences. 		I commend 		the pamphlet 		and my 		reply to 		your attention, 		if you 		have not 		already seen them. Here 		I would 		just like to emphasize 		what I have 		already said. 		Had Government stayed 		action till they had 		studied my 		speeches and 		those of 		the members 		of the Working Committee, history 		would have been written differently.  You 		have made much 		of the 		fact that your Executive Council 		is predominantly 		Indian. Surely their 		being Indians no 		more makes 		them representatives of 		India than non-Indians. 		Conversely it is 		quite conceivable 		that a 		non-Indian may 		be a 		true representative 		of India, 		if he is elected 		by the 		vote of 		the Indian 		people. It 		would give 		no satisfaction 		even if the head 		of the Indian 		Government was 		a distinguished Indian 		not chosen 		by the 		free vote of 		the people.  Even 		you, I am 		sorry, have 		fallen into 		the common error 		of describing 		the Indian 		forces as having 		been recruited by 		“voluntary 		enlistment”. A 		person who 		takes to 		soldiering as 		a profession 		will enlist 		himself wherever he 		gets his 		market wage. Voluntary 		enlistment has 		come to 		bear by 		association a 		meaning much 		higher than 		that which 		attaches to 		an enlistment like 		that of the 		Indian soldier. 		Were those 		who carried 		out the orders 		at the Jallianwala  		massacre volunteers? 		The very 		Indian soldiers who 		have been taken out 		of India and are 		showing unexampled 		bravery will be ready 		to point 		their rifles unerringly 		at their 		own countrymen 		at the orders 		of the 		British Government, 		their employers. Will 		they deserve the 		honourable name 		of volunteers?  You 		are flying all 		over India. 		You have 		not hesitated 		to go among the skeletonslibtech_90_footnotelibtech_91_footnoteof Bengal. May I suggest an interruptionin your 		scheduled flights and 		a descent 		upon Ahmednagar 		and the Aga 		Khan’s Palace in order to probe the hearts of your captives? We are  
 
 all friends of the British, however much we may criticize the British Government and system in India. If you can but trust, you will find us to be the greatest helpers in the fight against Nazism,  Fascism,  Japanism and the like.
   Now 		I revert to your letter 		of the 		25th February.  Shri 		Mirabai and 		I have received replies 		to our representations. 		The remaining 		inmates have received 		their notices. 		The reply received 		by me 		I regard 		as a 		mockery; the 		one received by 		Shri Mirabai 		is an 		insult. According to 		the report 		of the 		Home Member’s 		answer to a 		question in 		the Central 		Assembly, the replies 		received by us seem 		to be 		no replies. He 		is reported to 		have said that the 		stage “for the 		review of 		the cases 		had not yet arrived. 		Government at 		present were 		only receiving 		representations from 		prisoners.” If 		the representations 		in reply 		to the 		Government notices 		are to 		be considered merely 		by the 		executive that 		imprisoned them 		without trial, it 		will amount 		to a 		farce and an 		eye-wash, meant 		perhaps for 		foreign consumption, 		but not as 		an indication 		of a 		desire to 		do justice. My 		views are 		known to 		the Government. 		I may 		be considered 		an impossible 		man—though altogether 		wrongly I would 		protest. But what about 		Shri Mirabai? 		As you 		  know, 		  she 		  is 		  the  daughter  of 		  an  Admirallibtech_92_footnotelibtech_93_footnoteand  former 		Commander-in-Chief of 		these waters. But 		she left the life of 		ease and 		chose instead to 		throw in 		her lot with me. 		Her parents, 		recognizing her urge to 		come to 		me, gave her their 		full blessings. 		She spends 		her time 		in the 		service of 		the masses. 		She went 		to Orissa at my request 		to understand 		the plight 		of the people 		of that 		benighted land. That 		Government was 		hourly expecting 		Japanese invasion. Papers were 		to be 		removed or 		burnt, and 		withdrawal of 		the civil 		authority from 		the coast 		was being 		contemplated. Shri Mirabai made Chaudwar (Cuttack) 		airfield her 		headquarters, and 		the local military 		commander was glad 		of the 		help she could give 		him. Later she 		went to New 		Delhi and 		saw General  Sir 		  Alan 		  Hartleylibtech_94_footnotelibtech_95_footnoteand  General  Molesworthlibtech_96_footnotelibtech_97_footnote,   who   both appreciated 		her work and greeted 		her as 		one of 		their own 		class and 		caste. It, 		therefore, baffles me 		to understand her 		incarceration.The only 		reason for burying 		her alive, 		so far 		as I 		can see, 		is that 		she has 		committed the crime 		of associating 		herself with 		me. I suggest your  
 
 immediately releasing her, or your seeing her and then deciding. I may add that she is not yet free from the pain for the alleviation of which the Government sent Captain Simcoxlibtech_98_footnoteat my request. It would be a tragedy if she became permanently disabled in detention. I have mentioned Shri Mirabai’s case because it is typically unjust.
   I 		apologize to 		you for a 		letter which has 		gone beyond the 		length I 		had prescribed 		for myself. 		It has 		also become very 		personal and 		very unconventional. 		That, however, 		is the 		way my loyalty to 		friends works. I 		have written without 		reservation. Your letter and 		your speech 		have given me the 		opening. For 		the sake of 		India, England and 		humanity, I 		hope, you 		will treat this 		as an honest 		and friendly, 		if candid, 		response to your speech.  Years 		ago, while teaching the 		boys and 		girls of 		Tolstoy Farm 		in South 		Africa, I happened 		to read 		to them 		Wordsworth’s 		“Character of 		the Happy Warrior”. 		It recurs 		to me as I 		am writing 		to you. 		It will delight my 		heart to 		realize that 		warrior in 		you. There 		will be 		little difference 		between the manners 		and methods 		of the 		Axis powers and 		the Allies, 		if the 		war is to resolve 		itself into 		a mere 		trial of 		brute strength.libtech_99_footnote

 DEAR KHAN BAHADUR,
You have given me the following memorandum:
 Mr. Gandhi may reply to messages from his relatives, and Government will, if he so wishes, inform other correspondents that their messages have been delivered to him.
In reply, I   beg  to  say  that   unless   I  can   write  to  senders of
condolences irrespective of relatives, I would not care to exercise the
 
 facility Government have been pleased to give me. As to the other messages, I have no wish in the matter beyond what I have said above. From the newspaper notices of the messages sent to me, I observe that all the messages sent to me have not yet been handed to me. From the memorandum I infer that they will be handed to me in due course. I should perhaps mention that the messages received and given to me during my son Devadas’s presence were handed by me to him.
 Yours, etc.,
 M. K. GANDHI

 THE ADDITIONAL SECRETARY GOVERNMENT OF INDIA (H.D.) NEW DELHI
 SIR,
 I have read with painful interest the answer given on behalf of the Government in the Central Assembly about the facilities, medical and otherwise, given to my deceased wife. I had hoped for a better response to my letterlibtech_100_footnotelibtech_101_footnoteof 4th March, 1944, assuming that it was in Government’s hands when the answer was given. Beyond the admissionlibtech_102_footnotelibtech_103_footnotethat the deceased was never offered release, the statement makes no amends for the misrepresentations pointed out in that letter. On the contrary, it adds one more by stating that “trained nurses were made available.      ” No trained nurse was asked for or supplied. An
ayah, however, was sent in the place of Shri Prabhavati Deviand Shri Kanu Gandhi for whom my wife had asked. The ayah left in less than
 
 a week because she found herself ill-fitted for the work entrusted to her. Only then, and after some further delay and repeated requests about Shri Kanu Gandhi, were the two allowed to come. The facilities have been recited as if they had been granted promptly and willingly. The fact is that most of them, when not refused, were granted as if grudgingly and when it was almost too late. My object in writing this letter is not to make the complaint (though quite legitimate) that the facilities came too late. My complaint is that in spite of my representation of 4th instant, the Government instead of giving the naked truth have seen fit to give a varnished version.libtech_104_footnote

 THE ADDITIONAL SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA (HOME DEPARTMENT)
 NEW DELHI
 SIR,
 I beg to acknowledge your letterlibtech_105_footnoteof 21st March handed to me on the 27th. As to extra medical aid, I wish to state that the first request for the services of Dr. Dinshaw Mehta was made by the deceased   verbally   to   Col.   Advanilibtech_106_footnotesome   time   in   December   last. When repeated verbal requests met with little or no response, I had  to  make  a  written  requestlibtech_107_footnotelibtech_108_footnote,  addressed   to   the   Government   of
 
 India, dated January 27, 1944. On the 31st of January, I senta reminderlibtech_109_footnoteto the Government of Bombay (Appendix A), and so did Drs. Nayyar and Gilder in a letterlibtech_110_footnoteaddressed to the Inspector-General of Prisons (Appendix B). I wrotelibtech_111_footnoteagain on the 3rd of February to the Government of Bombay (Appendix C), who sent a replylibtech_112_footnote(Appendix
 D) which resulted in Dr. Dinshaw being brought in on the 5th of February last, i.e., after an interval of over six weeks from the date of the first request. And even when permission was granted, restrictions were placed upon the number of the visits and the time he was to take in administering treatment. It was not without difficulty that these restrictions were later relaxed and then removed.
 As to the reference in the letter under reply to Dr. Gilder, I showed it to him. The result was the attached letterlibtech_113_footnoteaddressed by him to the Government which he has asked me to forward (Appendix E). While it shows that Dr. Gilder never expressed the opinion attributed to him, it does not alter the tragic fact that Dr. Dinshaw’s services were held up for over six weeks.
 The question of calling in a non-allopath was definitely and formally raised before the Inspector-General of Prisons by my son after his visit to this camp early in December last.libtech_114_footnoteOn Col. Bhandari mentioning to me my son’s request to him, I told him that if my son thought that non-allopathic treatment should be tried, the Government should permit it. While the consideration of my son’s request was on the anvil, the patient’s condition began to worsen and she herself pressed for the services of an Ayurvedic physician. She spoke to both the Inspector General of Prisons and Col. Shah several times, again with no result. In despair I wrotelibtech_115_footnoteto  the   Government  of  India  on
 
 January 27, 1944. On the 31st of January, the Superintendent of this camp enquired on behalf of the Government, among other things, whether the deceased had any particular Ayurvedic physician in mind to which I repliedlibtech_116_footnotelibtech_117_footnotein writing, it being my silence day (Appendix F). As no relief was forthcoming as a result, and the patient’s condition admitted of no delay, I sent an urgent letter to the Government of Bombay on the 3rdof February (Appendix C). It was on the 11th of February that a local vaidya was sent and on the 12th that Vaidyaraj Sharma was brought in. Thus there was an interval of more than eight weeks between the first request for non-allopathic aid and of actual bringing in of that aid.Before Vaidyaraj Sharma came, I had been asked  to  give  a  written  undertakinglibtech_118_footnotelibtech_119_footnote(which   I   gladly   did)   that   I absolved the Government of all responsibility about the result of his treatment (Appendix H). The Vaidyaraj was thus in sole charge of the case for the time being. One would have thought that a physician in sole charge of a patient would have all such facilities of visiting and watching the patient as he considered necessary. And yet there was no end to the difficulties in getting these facilities for him. These have been alluded to in the enclosurelibtech_120_footnotelibtech_121_footnoteto my letterlibtech_122_footnotelibtech_123_footnoteof March 4, 1944, and in Appendix Glibtech_124_footnotelibtech_125_footnote. . .
 All this time the patient was passing through great sufferings and her condition was deteriorating so rapidly that every delay weighed against chances of her recovery. Whether the delays and difficulties experienced by the patient and me were caused by one department of the Government or another, or even by the Government doctors, the responsibility surely rests with the Central Government.
 I note that the Government have maintained complete silence over the written request (which was reinforced by subsequent verbal reminders) of Drs. Nayyar and Gilder to call Dr. B. C. Roy in consultation, and have not even condescended to give their reasons for not granting the request.
Similarly the letter under reply is silent about the discrepancy,
 
 
 pointed out by me in my letterlibtech_126_footnotedated March 20, 1944, in the Hon. the Home Member’s statement in the Assembly that trained nurses were in attendance. The fact is that they never were. Let me add here that nurses of the deceased’s choice who were permitted were brought after considerable delay, especially Shri Kanu Gandhi.
 I hope, after a calm perusal of this  bare  recital  of  facts  and of  the  relevant  copies  of correspondence  attached  hereto,  it  will   be conceded that the claim of the Government of India that “they did everything possible” to ensure that the deceased received all the treatment that I wished during her illness is not justified.Much less can Mr. Butler’s claim be justified. For, he went further when he said, “she was receiving all possible medical care and attention, not only from her regular attendents, but from those desired by her family.” Does not the statement of the Government of Bombay (Appendix D), “Government have decided that no outside doctors should be allowed unless the Government Medical Officer considers that it is absolutely necessary for medical reasons” contradict the above claims?
 On the question of release, and the report received by the Government of India of a “private conversation” my son had with his mother in this connection, a prisoner can have no “private” conversation with anybody from outside. Therefore, so far as I am concerned, the Government are free to make use of the conversation after verification (usual and obligatory in such cases) by my son. In any case the Government would have been absolved from all blame, if they had made an offer of release and laid on me the burden of deciding what was “best and kindest” for her. As to the arrangement for the funeral, my letter to the Government dated March 4, 1944, embodying my actual request, which the Inspector-General of Prisons took down in writing from dictation, speaks for itself. It, therefore, astonishes me that on “enquiries” made by the Government, they were “informed” that I had “no special preference between the first two alternatives” mentioned in my letter. The information given to the Government is wholly wrong. It is inconceivable that, given the freedom of choice, I could ever be reconciled to the cremation of a dear one being performed in a jail compound (which this camp is today) instead of the consecrated cremation ground.
 It is not pleasant or easy for me to write about such personal matters to the Government. But I do so in this case for the sake of the memory of one who was my faithful partner for over sixty-two years.
 
 I leave it to the Government to consider what could be the fate of other prisoners not so circumstanced as Shri Kasturba was.libtech_127_footnote

 It was on January 28 that they were first informed that Mrs. Gandhi had asked for the services of Dr.  Dinshaw Mehta.	If Dr. Dinshaw Mehta was
 not called in earlier, it was due to the view originally expressed by both Col. Bhandari and Dr. Gilder that his services would not be of any use, but he was summoned as soon as the Government doctors revised that opinion.
 The arrangements for the funeral were understood here to be in accordance with your wishes. The Government made enquiries on the point and were informed that you had no special preference between the first two alternatives mentioned in your letterlibtech_134_footnote.
 Dr. Gilder has no recollection of his having given the opinion attributed to him.libtech_135_footnotelibtech_136_footnoteI have never expressed indifference as to whether the deceased was cremated in the consecrated  public  cremation ground or in the jail compound which this camp is.

          DEAR 	FRIEND,           April 	9, 1944 
  	I have your letterlibtech_137_footnoteof 	 28th  March  received  by  me  on  the  3rd instant. Please accept 	my thanks for it.  	I take up the general matter first. You have sent me a frank reply. 	I propose to reciprocate your courtesy by  being  perfectly frank. 	Friendship to be true demands frankness even though it may some time 	appear unpleasant. If anything I say offends you, please accept my 	apology in advance.libtech_138_footnote  	It is a pity that you have refused to deal with important points 	raised in my letter.  	Your letter is a plea for co-operation by the Congress in the 	present administration, and failing that, in planning for the 	future. In my opinion, this requires equality between the parties 	and mutual trust. But equality is absent and Government distrust of 	the Congress can be seen at every turn. The result is that suspicion 	of Government is universal. Add to this the fact that Congressmen 	have no faith in the competence of the Government to ensure India’s 	future good. This want of faith is based upon bitter experience of 	the past and present conduct of the British administration of India. 	Is it not high time that you co-operate with the people of India 	through  their elected representatives instead of expecting 	co-operation from them?  	All this was implied in the August resolution. The sanction behind 	the demand in the resolution was not violence, but self suffering. 	Anyone, be he Congressman or other, who acted against this rule of 	conduct had no authority to use the Congress name for his action. 	But I see that this resolution repels you as it did Lord Linlithgow. 	You know that I have joined issue on the point. I have seen nothing 	since to alter my view. You have been good enough to credit me with 	“intelligence”, “experience”, and “acumen”. Let me say 	that all these three have failed to make me realize that the effect 	of     
 the Congress resolution “must be to hamper the prosecution of the war”. The responsibility for what followed the hasty arrests of Congressmen must rest solely on the Government. For, they invited the crisis, not the authors of the resolution.
 You remind me that you were Commander-in-Chief at the time. How much better it would have been for all concerned if confidence in the immeasurable strength of arms had ruled your action instead of fear of a rebellion! Had the Government stayed their hand at thetime, surely all the bloodshed of those months would have been avoided. And it is highly likely that the Japanese menace would have become a thing of the past. Unfortunately it was not to be. And so the menace is still with us, and what is more, the Government are pursuing a policy of suppression of liberty and truth. I have studied the latest ordinance about the detenus, and I recall the Rowlatt Act of 1919.  It was properly called the Black Act. As you know, it gave rise to an unprecedented agitation. That Act pales into insignificance before the series of ordinances that are being showered from  the  Viceregal throne. Martial Law in effect governs not one Province as in 1919, but the whole of India. Things are moving from bad to worse.
 You say, “it is clear to me that you had lost confidence in our ability to defend India and were prepared to take advantage of our supposed military straits to gain political advantage.” I must deny both the charges. I venture to suggest that you should follow the golden rule, and withdraw your statement and suspend judgment till you have submitted the evidence in your possession to an impartial tribunal and obtained its verdict. I confess that I do not make the request with much confidence. For, in dealing with Congressmen and others, Government have combined the prosecutor, judge and jailor in the same person and thus made proper defence impossible on the part of the accused. Judgments of courts are being rendered nugatory by fresh ordinances. No man’s freedom can be said to be safe in this extraordinary situation. You will probably retort that it is an exigency of the war. I wonder !
 As I visualize India today, it is one vast prison containing four hundred million souls. You are its sole custodian. The Government prisons are prisons within this prison. I agree with you that whilst you hold the views expressed in your letter under reply, the proper place for one like me is a Government prison. And unless there is a change of heart, view and policy on the part of the Government, I am quite
 content to remain your prisoner. Only I hope you will listen to the request made by me through the proper channels to remove me and my fellow-prisoners to some other prison where the cost of our detention need not be even one tenth of what it is today.
 As to my complaintlibtech_139_footnoteabout Mr. Butler’s statement and later the Home Secretary’s, I have received two letters from the HomeDepartment in reply. I am sorry to say, they have appeared to me highly unsatisfactory. They ignore patent facts, and betray an obstinate refusal to face truth even on a wholly non-political issue. My correspondence with the Home Department continues. I invite your attention to it, if you can spare the time and are interested in the subject.
 I am glad and thankful that Shri Mirabai’s (Miss Slade’s) case is being considered in the light of what I saylibtech_140_footnoteabout her in my letter.
 I am, Yours sincerely,

 As to “trained nurses”, I draw attention to the statement made on behalf of the Government that they “were made available for a short period”. That my wife preferred an ayah to a trained nurse is hardly relevant to the consideration whether trained nurses were in fact supplied.

 [After May 6, 1944]libtech_156_footnote
 . . . I had condemned it in my letter to Linlithgow without waiting for evidence. Did you not see it ?  In  my  very  first  letterlibtech_157_footnotewritten in August the day before Mahadev passed away, I had condemned all violence, including the violence that had taken place. It had been the Government’s design to get me to admit responsibility for the violence which would justify their repression, and show them to be innocent before the world. I did not oblige. Nothing would make me do so. Being in jail how could I be expected to know about it ? So when I heard about Kishorelal, I immediately lodged a protest. You must try to understand this. Think over it. I have not been guilty of the slightest error. None but the Government says that I committed an error. That was a false charge. I had condemned all acts of violence. They wanted me to accept the Government’s version and condemn popular violence and condemn it from the jail. I refused to do that. There is no difference between what I am saying now and what I said in 1942. On the basis of the evidence available today, I have condemned certain acts of violence. When that information was given to me without any evidence, I promptly and unequivocally protested. Did you not read my reply to the Government ? I have not gone back upon it. I believe that all type of killing and burning is bad. So, it taught a lesson at least to those who killed and burnt, did it not ? The fact is that my correspondence was released only after the fast. You should read those letters. I have certainly condemned the violence. But how can I admit without any direct evidence that people resorted to such and such acts ?

39,"May 6, 1944","DISCUSSION WITH A
FRIENDlibtech_158_footnote","
      
 [After May 6, 1944]libtech_159_footnote
 Gandhiji questioned the statement that sabotage could be part of the non-violent programme or that it was derivable from the principle of ahimsa as he understood it. The friend, however, persisted that sabotage had come to stay whether one liked it or not.
GANDHIJI: Irresponsible prophesying leads to nowhere. The real
question is where we stand, what our attitude towards it is going to be.
 FRIEND: Was destruction of Government property violence? You say that nobody has a right to destroy any property not his own. If so, is not Government’s property mine? I hold it is mine and I may destroy it.
There is a double fallacy involved in your argument. In the first
 place, conceding that Government property is national property— which today it is not—I may not destroy it because I am dissatisfied with the Government. But even a national government will be unable to carry on for a day if everybody claimed the right  to  destroy bridges, communications, roads, etc., because he disapproved of some of its activities. Moreover the evil resides not in bridges, roads, etc., which are inanimate objects but in men. It is the latter who need to be tackled. The destruction of bridges, roads, etc., by means of explosives does not touch this evil but only provokes a worse evil in the place of the one it   seeks  to  end.libtech_160_footnotelibtech_161_footnoteTo  sterilize  it  needs  not  destruction  but self-immolation of the purest type, which would demonstrate that the authorities might break but would not be able to bend a will that has
 
 resigned itself to the God of truth.
 I agree that the evil is within ourselves, not in the bridge which can be used for a good purpose as well as an evil one. I also agree that its blowing up provokes counter-violence of a worse type. But it may be necessary from a strategic point of view for the success of the movement and in order to prevent demoralization.
 It is an old argument. One used to hear it in old days in defence of terrorism. Sabotage is a form of violence. People have realized the futility of physical violence, but some people apparently think that it may be successfully practised in its modified form as sabotage.libtech_162_footnoteIt lacked the quality of non-violence and could not take the place of full-fledged armed conflict. We have to deal with a power which
 takes pride in not recognizing defeat. In the early part of the British rule there were powerful risings. In several places the British were actually beaten. But they won in the end. A British statesman used to say, “I do not believe in wooden guns.” National struggles could not be won by “wooden guns”.
 It is my conviction that the whole mass of people would not have risen to the height of courage and fearlessness that they have, but for the working of full non-violence. How it works we do not yet fully know. But the fact remains that under non-violence we  have progressed from strength to strength even through our apparent failures and set-backs. On the other hand, terrorism resulted in demoralization. Haste leads to waste.
 You characterized the “Quit India” movement as a non-violent rebellion. Is not non-violent rebellion a programme of seizure of power?
 No. A non-violent rebellion is not a programme of seizure of power. It is a programme of transformation of relationship ending in a peaceful transfer of power. It will never use coercion. Even those
who hold contrary views will receive full protection under it.libtech_163_footnote
 We have found that a person who has had a schooling in violent activity comes nearer to true non-violence than one who has had no such experience.
 That can be true only in the sense that having tried violence again and again he has realized its futility. That is all. Would you maintain also that a person who has had a taste of vice is nearer to virtue than the one who had none? For, that is what your argument amounts to.libtech_164_footnote
 
 Vol. I, Book One, pp. 38-9.
 It is no secrecy, if the person concerned is boldly prepared to face the consequences of his action. He resorts to secrecy in order to achieve his object. He can refuse to take any part in subsequent interrogations during his trial. He need not make a false statement.
No secret organization, however big, could do any good.
 Secrecy aims at building a wall of protection round you. Ahimsa disdains all such protection. It functions in the open and in the face of odds, the heaviest conceivable. We have to organize for action a vast people that have been crushed under the heel of unspeakable tyranny for centuries. They cannot be organized by any other than open, truthful means. I have grown up from youth to  76  years  in abhorrence of secrecy. There must be no watering down of the ideal. Unless we cling to the formula in its fulness, we shall not make any headway.
 I know we have not always lived up to our ideals. There have been grave lapses. Had our instruments been less imperfect, we would have been nearer our goal. But in spite of our temporizing with our ideal, non-violence has worked like a silent leaven among the dumb millions. That does not mean that we can afford to go on like this for ever. We cannot remain static. We must move forward or we shall slide back.
 Are you of opinion then, that the August resolution caused a set-back in the struggle for independence; that all the heroism and courage which our people showed in the course of it was useless?
No, I do not say that. In the historical process, the country will
 be found to have advanced towards freedom through every form of struggle, even through the August upheaval. All that I have said is that the progress would have been much greater, if we had shown the non-violent bravery of my conception. In this sense the sabotage activity has retarded the country’s freedom. I have the highest admiration for the courage, patriotism and spirit of self-sacrifice of people, say, like Jayaprakash Narayan. But Jayaprakash cannot be my ideal. If I had to give a medal for heroism, it would go not to him but to his wife who, though simple and unlearned in politics, typifies in her person the power of satyagraha in its purest form before which even Jayaprakash has to bow. What I have said about the August upheaval is not by way of judgment upon the past—I have consistently refused to condemn it—but as a guidance for the future.
 Our people have faith in non-violence but they do not know how to make it
 dynamic. What is the reason for this failure?
 By hammering away at it through painful years, people have begun to see that there is a potency in non-violence, but they have not seen it in all its fulness and beauty. If they had responded to all the steps that had to be taken for the effective organization  of non-violence and carried out in their fulness the various items of the eighteen fold constructive programme, our movement would have taken us to our goal. But today our minds are confused because our faith in constructive work is so weak. I know, one must push forth undaunted by difficulties.libtech_165_footnote

  As 	you probably 	know Gandhiji 	asked the Government 	to provide 	him with 	Dawn while 	he was in detention. And whenever it came–which was fairly 	regularly–he perused 	it carefully. 	Since our 	coming here, however, 	he has 	been missing 	it. For, 	naturally, the 	Government copy 	has ceased to 	come. He 	has, therefore, 	asked me 	to request you to send 	him a copy of the Dawn 	regularly. In 	case it 	is not the practice 	of your 	management to send 	it free 	to anybody, 	he says 	the subscription 	should be paid 	by you 	out of your 	capacious pocket.

 The oppression was the fancied or real control of the doctors rather than the mind. I believe I have freed myself from the doctors’ control. It does not matter if the freedom is imaginary or imagined. The effect on me is the same. Whatever I may now do will be due either to my weakness or strength. Next fortnight will show us all what is in store for me and us. I am approaching the thing with a detached mind. The difference is this. If I have the strength of mind, what I announced yesterday will abide. If the mind has become weak I do not know to what extent I shall go.
If the medicine is the least thing, you are safe and I am safe.
About visitors I shall be stricter than the doctors have [advised].

  	I went carefully through your Annual Report. I have not yet started 	writing anything. I have written only three letters to invalids. But 	Daridranarayana is the greatest invalid in the world. You are 	one of His matchless devotees dedicated exclusively to His service. 	You celebrate the Rentia Baraslibtech_198_footnoteon the occasion of my birthday and every year you 	make your plan of service more rigorous. This year the test will be 	the hardest so far. May you succeed in it. This time, while in jail, 	I read about Marx and whatever literature I could get about the 	great experiment in Russia. What a great difference between that 	experiment and our spinning wheel? There also, as in India, the 	whole nation is invited to join in the yajna. But the 	experiments there and here are as different from each other as East 	from West or North from South.     
 What a difference between our spinning-wheel and their machines driven by steam or electricity? But all the same I prefer the snail-like speed of the spinning-wheel. The spinning-wheel is a symbol of ahimsa, and ultimately it is ahimsa that will triumph. If, however, we who claim to be its votaries are weak, we shall dishonour ourselves and discredit ahimsa. Your activity is excellent indeed. But you should now introduce some new changes in it. There is a science of the spinning-wheel, as there is one of machines. We have still not fully evolved the “technique” of the spinning-wheel. It requires deep study.
 Just as knowledge without faith is useless, even so faith without knowledge is blind.

 CHI. KRISHNACHANDRA,
 I could just read your letter. At present I am not able to write much. Please, therefore, be content with the little I write. What I write to one of you should be regarded as addressed to all. I do notknow anything about the quarrel between Balvantsinha and Amtussalaam. I think it is good that Munnalal is leaving. It is desirable that he should settle down somewhere. But he is a restless soul and will not do that. God protects him because his intentions are good. What is Parnerkarlibtech_206_footnotedoing? How is his health?
Even if I don’t write, those who wish to write to me may do so.
 I will not be in a hurry to go there. My heart is there, of course. Now I will go over only after it cools down. The silence will end on the 29th. After that I am eager to spend a couple of weeks at Dr. Mehta’s sanatorium. Blessings to all. Why is Shankaran displeased?

 I myself have not seen the papers, but Sushila told me that you obtained Nathubhai’s signature on your bulletin. Nathubhai was the last to come into my life, through Mahadev. But Jivraj and Purushottam Patel had come into it even before you did. They were followed by Deshmukh and then Nerulkar. Dalal is dead. I sent a gentle note of reproach to Nathubhai and asked him why he had not called. If, now, Nathubhai signs as a doctor, you should rope in Deshmukh and Nerulkar too. I know that you were prevailed upon by Dr. Gilder. This protest, therefore, is not addressed to you. It is against that Mayor. The bulletin, of course, is not to be issued. But this is one reason for my blood-pressure. There are other reasons, too, but I will not bother you with them. The pressure, of course, will come down, and then a day will come when I also will go the way Dalal has gone. Despite the different therapies, I and all others will have to go one day under some pretext or other. That is why I tell you that you are welcome to go on torturing me till you have conquered death.

 June 9, 1944 Secrecy, in my opinion, is a sin and symptom of violence, therefore, to be definitely avoided, especially if the freedom of the
dumb millions is the goal.  Hence  all  underground  activity,   in   my
 opinion, is taboo. What I, however, say is that even the content of violence and non-violence, whether as policy, or creed, should be judged by every individual worker according to the dictates of his head and heart. And when there is a conflict between the head and the heart, the heart wins.
 I am not saying anything as the leader of the movement, I must be regarded still as a prisoner with freedom to give opinions, not to issue instructions.

THE VICEROYlibtech_276_footnote","
             JUHU, 
  June 	10, 1944  	The Committee of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and 	Industry congratulate His Excellency the Viceroy on the step taken 	by him in releasing Mahatma Gandhi. Although it is stated   that   	the   action   has   been   taken   on   medical   grounds, the     
 Committee feel that to ignore the political potentialities of Gandhiji’s release would be a great mistake on the part of the Government.
 The Committee firmly believe that the situation in 1942 was thoroughly mishandled by the Government of India leading to the arrest of Gandhiji and other leaders and other  responsible Congressmen throughout the country. The disturbances were the natural consequence which the Government should have  foreseen. The Committee is convinced that had the Government waited and responded to the way of negotiation which was clearly contemplated as can be proved from Gandhiji’s and Maulana Abul Kalam Azad’s and Panditji’s speeches and statements made at the time and not exhibited a panicky mood showed by the arrests, the history of India would be much different today from what it is. While deploring the past mistakes, the Committee feel that these could be rectified by reviewing the position afresh and making a firm attempt to solve the political deadlock. The Committee is convinced that Mahatmaji is a man of peace and goodwill and that his method is not one of giving advantage to the enemy. The Committee, therefore, feel that a solution is not impossible if the Government were to reciprocate the friendliness of Gandhiji. The Com[mittee] feel that in order to enable the Mahatma to render effective help in the war effort, the first natural action should be the release of the members of the Working Committee and all others who have been interned. It is clear to the Committee [that] Gandhiji is powerless without the backing of the Working Committee.
 We believe that even the economic development, for which His Excellency the Viceroy has expressed such great sympathy, is impossible unless there is at the centre a Government which can inspire confidence and enthusiasm among the people. Only a National Government could fulfil the above condition. The Com[mittee], therefore, strongly appeal to His Excellency the Viceroy that in the interest of winning the war, the future Indo-British relations and the improvement of the economic condition of India, it is imperative that the Government should take immediate steps to achieve conditions for the establishment of a truly National Government. The Committee also appeal to Mahatma Gandhi and Mr. Jinnah to make fresh efforts to solve the communal deadlock for the purpose of creating an atmosphere for establishment of a National Government.

 You will confer on me a favour if you will take the trouble of letting me have your reaction upon the correspondence especially upon the points arising from my reply to the Government of India pamphlet. I have endeavoured to answer every item of importance in the Government indictment. I should like to know the points, if any, which require elucidation.

 This 	is after much debating for 48 hours within myself and       
 sleepless nights over my duty towards you on our differences and towards doctors regarding treatment.
 It hurt me yesterday when Ammajan told me that you  had doubt about my willingness to part with the money that you gave me from time to time. The fact is that you having parted with the money even resented it standing in your name in the Ashram books and insisted on the money being made part of the Ashram funds and the expenses on your account being treated as from the Ashram funds. I felt a delicacy in mentioning that it could be retransferred to you without any deduction. I, therefore, allowed Ghanshyamdas to tell you that you could have the money back whether the condition of the Ashram funds permitted the return or not. So when you told me that you would be glad to have the money, the measure of esteem in which I held you went down. It is due to you that I should not withhold this fact from you. But this is not written to affect your decision. The return of the money is irrevocable.
 The second thing I want to tell you is the things I have been hearing from reliable sources about Prithvi Singh. They are terribly disturbing.libtech_288_footnoteHe has been using questionable means to extort money. He made, without success, indecent approaches to two girls of Kathiawar.
 The girl whom he has married was engaged to a person who was her benefactor. Nanabhai who was the person to bring him to me and who testified to his complete change from violence to non-violence has been sadly disillusioned.
 His profession of non-violence when he came to me and in his letters from the jail appears to have been a deep-laid plot to deceive me and through me some day or other to secure his release from the life of hiding which was worrying him. Thus, my prejudice is deepening. I should love to know from experience that the prejudice has no basis.
 It is generally believed that the Communist Party is exploiting you through him. I am carrying on correspondence with Joshi. This you can see from Pyarelal.
 In the circumstances my advice to you is that you should hold your project for a season and judge the situation and watch
 
 developments. I do not know how Devdas and those  who  are connected with you will be able to guide you or interest themselves in your activities. Anyway I shall have to let the public know somehow or other that I am not at the back of any of your activities which are being undertaken in spite of my disapproval.
 This letter is my last warning. I shall trouble you no more. God be your only guide.libtech_289_footnote
 [P.S.]
 There is nothing withheld from the office staff. I am keeping a copy of this letter and enclose herewith a typed copy. Please give me a copy of the letter I wrote to you before this.

  	There is nothing wrong about being formal.  “Familiarity breeds 	contempt.” The letters will not be destroyed. I have nothing to be 	ashamed of. I wrote after intense prayer. My language failed to 	transmit the love and the greatest goodwill that prompted it. The 	only regret is that I dared to be familiar. My love would have been 	as true as now if I had refused to call you by any other name than      
 Miss Slade. I like the English coldness and correctness. But my regret is superficial. The change is good and substantial. I have given the warning. You have no reason to change your course because of any opinion I express. What I did was to suggest your waiting. But you need not since it does not commend itself to you.
 Yes, time and action will show what we are and what we meant. I have patience.

 June 12, 1944
 CHI. JAISUKHLAL,
 I wanted to write this letter immediately after Manu’s departure but I could not. Manu disappointed me very much just before she left.  I thought she had understood everything and would do as she had promised, but I was wrong. Before leaving, she bought and sent a silver toy and a silver cup for Pyarelal’s brother’s daughter. I was very much pained. I poured out all my pain in my letterlibtech_292_footnotelibtech_293_footnoteto her and returned the things. You must have come to know about all this. Now you will have to be on your guard. I had suggested that she should stay for a year at Rajkot in the hope that that would develop all her fine qualities and cure her weaknesses. But Manu was reluctant. On receipt of an enthusiastic letter from the teacher at Karachi, she was beside herself with joy, and I, therefore, sent her there.
 I should like to tell you the thoughts which occurred to me about you. You seem to have such a lot of money that you have taught Manu to spend money as if she was more than even a multi-millionaire. I very much appreciate your  love for your daughters. But the question is from where you got all this money. You could not have saved it from  khadi  work.  Did  you,  then,  save  it from  your  job there?  Is   it   possible   to   save  so   much   money in  this  way?   If   you   have   kept   accounts,   I   should   certainly like to see them. How can I hide from you the suspicion
 
 that has arisen in my mind? When I got angry, Shantikumarwas present. When I asked him, he told me that you could not have saved so much from the Scindia job. He had no reason to suspect you, as strict care was taken to see that there was no scope for corruption among their employees. Now let me have your reply. Sushila must have written to you about Yukti. Take good care of her. Manu’s eyes are very weak. They can be saved only with great care. Otherwise in a few years’ time she might not be able to read and write.

 BOMBAY,

 Amen. So help us God. The contract is that there should be silence on both sides. You may read what you can from the silence.
 Another spell of a few minutes’ silence followed and Mahatma Gandhi was asked, how long they could stay there. By a sign of his finger he replied that the interview would last ten minutes. The journalists replied that they had been waiting at Juhu practically all the days since his arrival, and therefore the time of the “silent interview” should be extended. Mahatma Gandhi wrote in reply:
If there is a good singer amongst you, you can take extra time;
 otherwise what is the use of your wasting time? There is no such thing as silence in journalists.
 The reporters were taken aback at the request, but one journalist came to the rescue of the party, and he sang a song, which seemed to have pleased Mahatma Gandhi. Another gentleman, to everybody’s surprise, volunteered to follow up and Mahatma Gandhi wrote:

 I may say at once that nothing has been issued from this office to say that you were coming to see Gandhiji. He certainly endorses your view that Qaid-e-Azam is the man he should try to see. He does not remember the warning you gave him through the late Dr. Ansari. He has no objection to your publishing your letter under reply. But he very much doubts the wisdom of carrying on public correspondence of the nature of your letter.

      CHI. 	BALKRISHNA,  June 	18, 1944 
  	Krishnachandra writes and tells me that just because a man deceived 	you, you have given up milk at one meal and that you castigated 	yourself too. Both these things can be done on the right occasion 	but was it the right occasion in your case? During the last 	imprisonment I learnt one thing, namely, that one must never be 	hasty in judging the actions of one’s co-workers, one should put 	before the person concerned the other side for consideration and 	then let him judge himself. Think over your action from this point 	of view.  	Do not hesitate to write anything to me. My going there keeps on 	getting postponed. I think I would be lucky, if I could go there by 	the end of July. I can say that I do not intend to wait much longer 	after the end of August.

  	You must not brood over Vidya’s death nor get disconcerted. If she 	was the inspiration of your life whilst she was in the flesh, she 	must be more so having gone to her resting place. That to me is  the 	 meaning of the true union of souls. The classic example is that of 	Jesus and, in modern times, of Ramakrishna. They became greater 	influences after their death. Their spirit did not die, nor is 	Vidya’s dead. You must, therefore, leave off sorrowing and think 	of your duty in front of you. Do not think of running to me whilst 	you are having your treatment and whilst I am having mine. You will 	come when I go to Sevagram.libtech_324_footnote Love.

  	This certainly reads well.libtech_325_footnoteBut the whole thing deserves to be reconsidered. The 	writing can be misinterpreted. For instance, what can a man do in 	the present war? As you say, he cannot remain neutral which means 	that either he should participate in the war or commit harakiri 	by plunging into it. Isn’t it?  	Should he go to jail? The answer is not as simple as we might think. 	The second part deserves a more serious consideration. Must only the 	brave grant forgiveness? One seldom comes across brave people. Hence 	the quotations cited by you, although true, are like    
 reciting the Bhagavata before a buffalo, or casting pearls before a swine, or maybe, attaching gold trappings on to an ass!
 These are but random thoughts as they come to my mind, and I am flinging them at you! It is only for your understanding. Under the circumstances it is best to go on doing our work silently.

         BHAI 	DINSHAW,         June 	26, 1944 
  	I could have only a brief talk with you. But all the time I have 	been thinking about the nature cure. The result is:  	This institution should remain as it is, with some modifications, 	because it is your creation. Do not enlarge its sphere of work.  	Buy about a thousand acres of land near a village under your 	supervision. There should be enough space for patients and also 	provision for the healthy ones to remain so. The rich and the poor 	should stay in the same way, and food for them should be produced 	there itself. Almost all the things should be grown there. Treatment 	through earth, water, light, air and ether should be given. Manage 	everything in such a way that the poor can get what they require. 	Such new institutions should come up as you get more workers. The 	management should be such that the institution is able to meet its 	expenses. Do not take Government aid so long as power is not in the 	people’s hands.  	Convene a meeting of naturopaths and discuss the issue. Take workers 	from among them.  	There should be a trust for this and the new institution which will 	come into being. At least you, Ghanshyamdas and myself should    
 be among the trustees. You can take any fees you think proper. But take [only] the sum fixed for your personal expense. The rest should be debited to the institution’s account. Define what items can come under nature cure, and write books of general knowledge about them.
 There is no need to wait for some occasion to arise. So long as I am out and alive, it will be under my supervision. But it should be so planned that it will function even during my absence.
 I have already started discussing it with Ghanshyamdas. He has agreed to do as I say.
 Think over this and let me know what changes you would like. You are absolutely free to suggest them. This can be accomplished only if you have your heart and mind in it. I can think only of you in this matter. I wish to forget about it, if you are not convinced. I believe we can get the help we need for the institution.

 June 29, 1944
 BROTHERS AND SISTERS,
 When some of you came to Juhu, doctors forbade me to speak a word to you. And I felt very unhappy. When I came over to Poona I thought I would be able to meet you. Even now I am unwell, but still I meet many people and am able to talk to them. Why not with you then? I had hoped to spend some more time with you, but the doctors have permitted only half an hour. I have promised not to take more than the allotted thirty minutes. Hence I omit all preliminaries.
 At my requestlibtech_359_footnote, the Secretary kindly sent me a report  of  the happenings in Maharashtra since August 9, 1942. Besides the names of those assembled here, he has sent some questions. I have read all these papers carefully. I do not propose to reply to all the questions. This will not be possible within half an hour. You will, therefore, excuse me for confining my remarks only to the main issues.
 Today I do not meet you in any representative capacity. In terms (the language) of satyagraha, the moment I was imprisoned I ceased to wield the authority reposed in me by the Congress. And if I am now out of prison, it is not because of my strength or yours, but because of my illness. In a satyagrahi, illness is a thing to be ashamed of. This fortuitous release does not restore to me the authority that lapsed with my imprisonment.
 I discussed my position with some lawyer-friendslibtech_360_footnotelibtech_361_footnotein  terms  of the law prevalent in the land, and they are of the opinion that what I hold to be true in terms of satyagraha happens to be true legally too. What then is my status today? You who have gathered here occupy certain positions of authority in the Congress. I do not hold any such position. I am not even a four-anna member of the Congress. Iresigned from the Congress some years ago to try out the subtler laws of satyagraha. Nevertheless, I know that I hold a big place in your

 hearts, and you would give weight to whatever I might say. What I may say is to be regarded merely as an individual opinion, to be accepted or rejected by you at will. It could have been otherwise, if I were speaking in a representative capacity. Then I would have  expected you as disciplined soldiers to carry out my instructions. I thought of many things after reading the documents sent by you. But instead of discussing past happenings, I shall speak only  of our present duties. What work I have done and am still doing in India or abroad is rooted in truth and non-violence. I have been experimenting all along with the introduction of truth and  non-violence  in day-to-day life. Some people believe that truth and non-violence have no place in the practice of politics and public affairs. I do not agree. I have always believed that these weapons are entirely useless, if they are meant only for personal salvation. I would not like to have even beatitude for myself alone. I am no slave of any rigid school. I have no guru. If I discover a guru, I shall bow before him. My religion teaches me the need for a guru and how to honour one. But today my heart is my only guru. I do not propose to give you a religious discourse today. I must say that if you have lost faith in the efficacy of truth and non-violence, I have no remedy for your despondency. Inside the prison I used to read the newspapers and now, when I am out, I hear from people that a sense of frustration has overpowered the country. But I felt no frustration in my heart in the prison and I feel none outside. If Congressmen feel frustrated, it is because they lack faith in truth and non-violence. Examine your hearts. Has your faith dwindled? You are good for nothing, if you are still in the Congress but have no faith in truth and nonviolence. Your being  in  the  Congress would then be a sign of your ignorance.
 Who are Congressmen? Only those whose names are in its register? The Congress should be a poor organization, if it depended for its strength on the few lakhs of members whose names appeared on Congress rolls. At the Faizpur Congresslibtech_362_footnotelibtech_363_footnote, Deo and Dastane used to stress the point that the work done on behalf of the Congress was beyond description. Huge crowds gathered at Faizpur. But a very small proportion of them was on the Congress rolls.  I  noticed atFaizpur that not even untouchability had disappeared from  the place. A cow could drink water at a well, but not an untouchable. Deo and Dastane did not notice this, but it did not escape my eyes. It has
 
 been my endeavour from childhood to identify myself with the masses. I am one of them and not separate or different. That has enabled me to enter their hearts and to understand  them.  At  the Round Table Conference I claimed that I represented the whole of India, those who supported the Congress and also those who had nothing to do with it. Since the Congress claims to serve all, it represents them all. Congress represents to a greater extent the poor, hungry and helpless millions. I shall not discuss today why they lost the lustre in their eyes. I will merely affirm that you represent Congress, and you cannot represent it without subscribing to truth and non-violence.
 Experience has led me to the firm conviction that our success has been mathematically proportionate to the extent to which we have adhered to truth and non-violence. The phenomenal awakening in the masses during the last 25 years has been entirely due to the purity of our means. And to the extent untruth and violence have crept in, they have hindered our progress. Whatever harm has come our way, it is due to our lack of faith in truth and non-violence. Today I do not wish to sit in judgment upon your actions. I only wish to place my convictions before you. Your faith in me overwhelms me. My fortuitous release has given rise to great expectations. I am doubtful whether I deserve all this confidence. But this much I know that whatever strength I may have is entirely due to my being a votary of truth and non-violence. If I make any suggestions, they are based on my faith in these fundamentals. You want to follow a man like me. You raise minor doubts which trouble me. If you feel frustrated, ask yourself whether your faith in truth and non-violence has ebbed away. If so, you should strengthen it. Dark clouds surround us. The Government is sitting tight. We do not see the way ahead of us. The communal tangle is, of course, there. Many people are cursing me. And yet I suffer from no sense of frustration. Frustration can spring only from one’s own weakness and loss of faith. So long as we do not lose faith in ourselves, it is well with India. My talking to you would have served its purpose, if I am able to drive away your frustration.
 You will ask me, what about the political deadlock, the  communal tangle, the food-scarcity and the like? I have an answer for each of these. But I may not attempt it at this meeting. I am convinced that the sufferings of the people cannot be alleviated until India has real political power. I cannot alleviate the food situation by feeding a
 few hungry mouths. I have friendly relations with millionaires, not for personal gain or in order to flatter them, but in order to get a portion of their wealth for the service of the poor. They too know this. But their money cannot serve the hungry millions at present.
 What is the root cause of this widespread starvation? Under the cover of war, the Government is extorting huge sums. I am of the opinion that if India had been free, there would have been no war with Japan. And if Japan attacked us, we would have defeated it much earlier. I do not want to bring in Japan. I do not want a change of masters. I want to he free from all foreign control. For me the four corners of India are enough for us. If India understands my message thoroughly, freedom can come to us this moment.
 You must have seen my recent correspondence with the Government. Starvation and destitution are stalking the land. Millions of rupees are being drained out of India. We may not be deceived by the wealth to be seen in the cities of India. That wealth does not come from England or America. It comes from the blood of the poorest. I claim to be an economist though not of the academic sort. I understand the roots of misery and [poverty] of India. Are you going to stamp out India’s starvation by feeding a few hungry mouths? There are said to be 7,00,000 villages in India. Some of them have been simply wiped out. Who has kept count of them? I am a villager. I can recognize at a glance the traces of a ruined village. Where has it gone? Where are the villagers? If anyone raises a doubt about my allegations, I can go round with him and show him the devastation. God will give me the strength for that. The Government reports, though an underestimate, of the thousands who have died of starvation and disease in Bengal, Karnataka and elsewhere are shocking. But this devastation is negligible compared to the wider havoc wrought over India through the centuries. Why this havoc? It is because the blood of the poorest is being sucked; whoever eats a morsel more than he really needs, is sucking the blood of the poor. The money that goes to England and America is not your money, it is the blood  of the poorest. I tell you that the pressure from the top crushes those at the bottom. What then is the remedy? All that is necessary is to get off their backs. This is the meaning of non-co-operation with  evil. Wehave the mighty weapon of ahimsa. In action, it takes the form of civil disobedience and non-violent non-co-operation. Civil disobedience is a very potent weapon. But everyone cannot wield it.
 For that, one needs training and inner strength. It requires occasions for its use. But non-violent non-co-operation can be practised by everybody. I have already indicated the areas where we could non-co-operate. If we had stuck to non-co-operation, the prevailing mood of frustration would never have arisen.
 I have been receiving most depressing letters and also stimulating ones. Many Congressmen write to me saying that we must do something. Should we co-operate with the Government in the famine-relief work? The present deadlock, they say, must somehow be ended. Imitating the language of the Government, I would say, where is the deadlock? If the Government does not seek our co-operation, let it be so. The country, no doubt, belongs to us. If we do not co-operate with the Government, it will come to a halt in one day. But we run after the Government. We do so for a mess of pottage, for a monthly salary. The whole country has to suffer because a few fall a prey to the temptation. But we are born to suffer. Our capacity for suffering should not weaken. Many people believe that they are serving the poor by drawing a salary of Rs. 300 a month and contributing Rs. 290 for the welfare of the poor. But this is not correct. One who non-co-operates with the Government, and gives up the remaining ten rupees and prefers to die starving with the poor, renders the greatest service to the poor.
 I cannot offer you any further guidance today. If you grasp the significance of all that I have said, your way will be clear. I have no strength to get into details. The August resolution is still there. I cannot alter, nor do I wish to alter, a single comma in that resolution. You too cannot do so without sanction from the Working Committee. Remember the last few golden lines of the August resolution. On the arrest of the principal Congressmen on the 9th day of August, 1912, every Congressman became his own leader competent to act as he liked, provided that his action fell within the limits prescribed by truth and non-violence. Today you are in a position to meet and exchange notes. Even this is, in fact, not  necessary.  No  hair-splitting  discussions are called for. One step is enough. We must learn resolutely to say ‘No’ when it becomes a duty. Lord Willingdon used to  say,  ‘You  are  all  yes-men.’  We  must  give  up   that   tendency. If  someone  forcibly  raises  my   hand   to   my   forehead,   it   will not   be   a   salute.    And,    in    fact,    despite    his    raising    my hand, he cannot make me salute, if I have the strength to
 resist. My hand will involuntarily refuse. No one can force us to do anything against our will. No one can enslave us against our will.

 Gandhiji said that when he saw in the papers in the detention camp that he was appointed Chairman of the Trust he was surprised, but he reconciled himself to the position by the thought that the conception behind the proposal to make him Chairman was that he should, on his release, guide the trustees in determining the object of the Fund and regulating its application from time to time. The belief was reinforced by the fact that the chief originator of the idea was Shri Narandas Gandhi who had set up the practice of presenting him with a purse collected chiefly in Kathiawar for the purpose of helping the spread of the hand-spinning movement and allied activities in Kathiawar. Gandhiji, however, could not shoulder the burden of attending meetings of the Trust regularly and guiding its day-to-day work. The real Chairman was Sir Purushottamdas Thakurdas, the Vice-Chairman.
 While the Fund was taking shape, the tragic death of Kasturba came. The idea of a National Memorial possessed the public, and the originator responded by combining the purse with the Memorial and merging the former in the latter. Thus the present Trust was formed. Kasturba was a simple woman devoted to village life, actually living and serving among villages. The object of the Fund was very properly the welfare of village women and children. It was well that the trustees and the donors should know the whole of his mind on the question of the welfare of women and children in the numerous villages of India. The welfare of his conception  encompassed the whole life of the women and children in the villages. It, therefore, included maternity, hygiene and the treatment of diseases, and education. Education meant the basic education of the Hindustani Talimi Sangh. The scope of the Fund, therefore, excludes its use in towns and cities or in education abroad or even in the Universities of India. He said that it would be readily conceded that while the sum of rupees 75 lakhs appeared to be big for the purpose of a Memorial, it was ridiculously small for the scope he had indicated. Gandhiji said that he would be a useless Chairman and guide, if the trustees did not share his idea as to the scope of the Fund.
 Proceeding, Gandhiji said that there was talk that he had said  that the collection should be confined to capitalists and that the general public need take no part in the collection. It was a travesty of truth. The principal men who could move in the matter of organizing country-side collection were behind prison bars. He was himself disabled. He, therefore, expected his rich friends to pull their fullest weight. He could never be guilty of harbouring even the thought that the Congress and other
 
 
 workers should sit supine. The Memorial was a National  Memorial  in  which everyone, no matter what his politics, was expected to put in his best effort. It would be no Memorial, if the collections were confined to capitalists. Indeed Mridulabehn, who was one of the most active of workers, had come to him for guidance in the matter of collections in Gujarat.
 An unwarranted but pardonable suspicion seems to have been created by the currency of the conversation he had with Dadasaheb Mavalankar who had come for discussion. Gandhiji had told him that so far as he was concerned his work should be confined to the exercise of his unrivalled influence among the moneyed men. “He is, like me, an ailing man,” said Gandhiji. He would not like him to risk his health in doing the taxing work of house-to-house collection. That could be easily organized by the workers that are still available.
 It would be a thousand pities, if anyone who had faith in the object of the Memorial avoided paying his quota, or inducing his friends to pay theirs, under the false belief that Gandhiji wishes people other than capitalists to refrain from contributing to the Memorial. Indeed he considered it a good sign that so many millionaires of India were not deterred by any real or imaginary fear of harm from identifying themselves with the Memorial of the dead wife of a detenu condemned by the powers that be. For him, the Chairman, it was a matter of gratification.
 Gandhiji said that he did count moneyed men among his friends. He knew that critics were not wanting who considered his association with moneyed men a sign of weakness unworthy of a votary of truth and non-violence. The speaker, on the other hand, considered such association as essentially a sign of his non-violence. His many friends knew well the motive for his association with them. He received money from them for many constructive activities, some of which were also supremely humanitarian. They allowed him to put his hands into their pockets for the All-India Spinners’ and Village Industries’ Associations, and for basic education as defined by the Hindustani Talimi Sangh, and other similar causes. So far as he knew, they had nothing to gain by his association with them. His contact with them took place after they had proved their success as businessmen. His mission was to convert capitalists not into mere friends and patrons of the millions of unemployed, but willing sharers of their goods with them.
 Further he had observed that some had doubted whether the Funds collected would not be used for political ends. He had no hesitation whatsoever in giving the assurance that he had no such idea in view. The All-India Spinners’ Association and the other bodies just referred to by him, even though initiated by the Congress, had no political character about them.
 This Memorial movement, Mr. Gandhi added, had been initiated not by the Congress or Congressmen, but by non-Congressmen and for a purely humanitarian
 purpose. In a higher sense, no great act done by an Indian, whether politician or no, could be without political significance. He had in mind the activities of Indians in the field of literature and science and philosophy.libtech_370_footnote

 There is no light here from 11 p.m. to 5.30 a.m. From 7 to 7.30 prayer. At 8, fruit juice and jaggery. Up to 8.30, work. Up to 12.15, walking, massage and bath. At 1.30 eating, reading or asking someone to read out to me. Thereafter upto 3.30 in the water-closet, followed by a siesta and writing of letters (for half an hour). At 4.30, mud-pack and reading or writing, lying in the bed. I started writing this letter thus lying in the bed and it is now 4.45.

 I saw Gandhi at Panchgani on the 4th July. I told him: “My Editor is anxious to help in solving the political deadlock in India. I went to Delhi and I was disappointed. I hope you will not disappoint me.” I asked: “Supposing you saw the Viceroy, what would you say to him?” He immediately replied:
I would tell him that I sought the interview with a view to help
and not to hinder the Allied war-effort. But I can do nothing without
 
 seeing the members of the Working Committee for I believethat my authority under the August resolution ended with my imprisonment. It was not revived by my release. You are not interested  in  my personal views, but you should be, if I spoke as a representative.
 I interrupted and said: “The Viceroy and everybody else is interested to know your mind because of your hold on the masses of India.” He replied:
I am a democrat and I cannot exploit that hold except through
the organization in the building of which I had a hand.
 But again I interrupted and said: “Before the Viceroy permits you to see the Committee, he would want to know how you would influence the members.” He said:
History does not repeat itself. The conditions of 1942 do not
 exist today. The world has moved on during the last two years. The whole situation has to be reviewed de novo. The point, therefore, for me to discuss with the Working Committee is to know how they react to the knowledge that I gained since my release.
 I have to take up the thread that was broken by the Government in 1942. I was first to negotiate and, on failure, to offer civil resistance,  if I thought it necessary. I want to plead with the Viceroy. I can do so only when I know the Working Committee’s mind.
 But I tell you that the common talk among us is that whatever the Viceroy may wish personally, he has no authority in the political sphere. Mr. Churchill does not want any settlement. He wants to crush me, if he has been correctly reported.libtech_383_footnoteHe has never denied the report.

GELDERlibtech_385_footnote","
      
 July 4[to6 ]libtech_386_footnote1944 I saw Mahatma Gandhi on July 4th at Panchgani. I told him: “My Editor is anxious to help in solving the political deadlock in India. I went to Delhi and I was
 disappointed. I hope you will not disappoint me.” I asked him: “Supposing you saw Lord Wavell how would you begin to talk? What would you say to him?”
 He promptly replied that he would tell the Viceroy that he had sought the interview with a view to help and not to hinder the Allies, and it was to this end he had asked for permission to see the members of the Congress Working Committee. He said, he had no authority to act in the name of the Congress. According to the canons of satyagraha, when a civil resister was imprisoned, the authority vested in him automatically came to an end. Hence the need for him to see the members of the Working Committee.
 I said: “The Viceroy might feel, as you swear by the August resolution and by the weapon of civil disobedience, your meeting the Working Committee members may only result in their re-investing you with authority to carry on civil disobedience in the name of the Congress, and the result will be that when you come out of the interview you will hold the pistol on the Viceroy’s head and say: ‘Do this or I start civil disobedience.’ That would make things worse than they are today.” Gandhi replied:
At the back of that is total distrust of my profession that I am,
 and have always been, a friend of the British. Therefore I can never use the weapon of civil disobedience during the war, unless there was a very grave reason as, for instance, the thwarting of India’s natural rights to freedom.
 My next question was: “Supposing the Working Committee was let out of jail tomorrow and the Government refuses to give India what they want, would you start civil disobedience?” Gandhi replied:
If the Working Committee came out, they would take stock of
 the situation and discuss things among themselves and with me. I can tell you this, that I have no intention of offering civil disobedience today. I cannot take the country back to 1942. History can never berepeated. Even without the authority of the Congress, if I wanted to
 
 do it, I could start civil disobedience today on the strength of my supposed influence with the masses. But I would be doing so merely to embarrass the British Government. This cannot be my object.
 But the Working Committee would not sit still while people are suffering. It is my conviction that we cannot meet fully the situation and alleviate the sufferings of the people, unless power and responsibility are transferred from British into Indian hands. Without such transfer, the attempts of Congressmen and others to alleviate the people’s sufferings are most likely to lead to conflict with the Government.
 I interrupted and said: “When things are as they are, I cannot believe that they will transfer authority now; that is, Government will not concede the demand for independence while the war is on.”
 Gandhi replied that there was a difference between what he would ask today and what was asked in 1942. Today he would be satisfied with a national government in full control of civil administration. It was not so in 1942. Such a government would be composed of persons chosen by the elected members of the Central Assembly. “This would mean declaration of independence of India, qualified as above, during the war.”
 I thought it was a great improvement on the 1942 position. I asked him if the military would control railways and the ports, etc.
 Gandhi replied that the national government would let the military have all the facilities that it might require. But the control would be that of the national government. Ordinance rule would give place to normal administration by the  national government.
 “Will the Viceroy be there?”, I asked. [Gandhiji replied:]
 Yes, but he will be like the King of England guided by responsible Ministers. Popular government will be automatically restored in all the provinces so that both the provincial and the central government will be responsible to the people of India. So far as military operations are concerned, the Viceroy and the Commander-in-Chief will have complete control. But it must be possible for the national government to offer advice and criticisms even in military matters.
 Thus the portfolio of Defence would be in the hands of the national government which would be genuinely interested in the defence of the country and may render great assistance in the shaping of policies.
 The Allied forces would be allowed to carry on their operations on Indian soil; I realize that they cannot defeat Japan without that.
 Gandhi made it clear that the expenses of the Allied operations on the Indian soil should not be borne by India. I asked: “If a national government is formed, would you advise the Congress to participate in it?”
 Gandhi replied in the affirmative. I asked: “So it means that if a national government is formed, the Congress will join and help the war effort. What would be your position?” [Gandhiji replied:]
I am a lover of peace through and through. After independence
 was assured I would probably cease to funtion as adviser to the Congress and, as an all-war resister, I would have to stand aside; but I shall not offer any resistance against the national government or the Congress. My co-operation will be abstention from interfering with the even tenor of life in India. I shall work with the hope that my influence will always be felt to keep India peace-minded and brotherhood among all without the distinction of race and colour.
 I next asked: “Supposing there is a conflict between the civil and military authorities, how would the dispute be settled? If, for example, civil authorities want to use the railway to carry two thousand tons of food, and the military authorities wanted it for carrying munitions, what would you advise?” Gandhi replied:
 As I said before, I would not have to advise on such matters. But supposing I had, I can conceive of the necessity  of allowing precedence to the military. But supposing the military wanted to blow off places or practice manoeuvres in disregard of the life of  the  people, I would say: ‘Hands off.’
 The thing is that with mutual trust such difficulties would not arise and if they did, they would be easily adjusted. If there is no trust, I cannot work. I cannot work for Allied victory without trust. If they trusted, a settlement would be easy to achieve. Freedom for India will bring hope to Asiatics and other exploited nations. Today there is no hope for the Negroes, but Indian freedom will fill them with hope.
 Finally I asked: “What about the Hindu-Muslim differences?” Gandhi replied:
If the British meant well, there would be no difficulties.
 Gandhi said in conclusion:
 Most of us believe that whatever the Viceroy may wish personally, he has not the authority in the political sphere. Mr. Churchill does not want a settlement. He wants to crush me, if he has
 
 been correctly reportedlibtech_387_footnotelibtech_388_footnote. He has never denied the report. The beauty of it, for me, and the pity of it, for him, is that no one can crush a satyagrahi; for, he offers his body as a willing sacrifice and thus  makes the spirit free.
 In the course of his explanatory statement, Mahatma Gandhi said that throughout his talks with the British journalist he had emphasized the fact that he was speaking for himself and in no sense involving the Congress in what he said. He added:
I do not know how far today I represent the views of the
 members of the Working Committee. And about Hindu-Muslim formula which has nothing to do with these two statements, I have not spoken as a Hindu. I have spoken as an Indian first and an Indian last. My Hinduism is my own—I personally think it embraces all faiths. Therefore I have no authority to speak as a representative of the Hindus. That I respond to mass mind and the masses know me instinctively is a fact which cannot be gainsaid but I have not built my case upon it.libtech_389_footnote

 It was after much thought that I declared a trust in connection with my writings. I had observed misuse of Tolstoy’s writings for want of a trust. By curing the defect, I preserved fully the idea lying behind dislike for copyright, i.e., for personal gain for one’s writings. The idea also was to prevent profiteering by publishers or distortion or misrepresentation, wilful or unintentional. I have requested the Navajivan Trust to permit you to publish Shri Prabhu’s compilation with the right for you to multiply editions as long as there is demand for it, provided that the price will be reduced to the minimum, leaving to you a profit of not more than five per cent—one half of which shall be paid to Shri Prabhu as honorarium for his labours. One hundred copies of each edition should be given free of cost to the Navajivan Trust. The Navajivan Trust should have the right to publish a cheaper edition (in English or in any Indian languages) for sale in India including Burma and Ceylon. If, per chance, any profit accrues, it will be equally divided among your firm, Shri Prabhu and the Navajivan Trust.

  	I like your letter very much because it is so candid. But you have 	raised questions one would not expect from a man of your 	intelligence. There are other co-workers like you and I sometimes 	wonder if my company is stifling their intelligence. All the same, I 	answer the questions.   I 		have not 		the least doubt of 		Russia’s bravery. But 		I would 		not weigh 		it on the scales 		of non-violence.  It 		does not 		appear to 		me that anything 		that is happening 		today can 		be likened 		to the 		Dharasana episode. I 		can understand 		the hardship 		resulting from the 		refusal of 		the farmers 		to sell 		the stocks of 		grains lying with them 		to the 		Government at 		rates lower than they 		can afford. 		But the looting 		of Government 		grain stocks cannot be 		called non-violent 		whether it is done 		after serving prior 		notice or not. 		I have 		always considered and 		still consider salt 		public property like water and 		air. I cannot 		include acts 		like sabotage of 		railways, etc., in non- 		violence.  It 		is of course not easy 		to decide on 		a programme for someone 		who is bent 		upon facing bullets in 		a non-violent way, but 		it is not impossible. 		One is 		not duty-bound 		to give 		one’s name. Informing 		about the action 		contemplated would 		suffice. If 		at the time fixed one 		finds that no 		one has come 		to the spot because 		the notice, being 		anonymous, had 		been thrown away, 		another notice can be 		sent. If 		this is 		done again and 		again, one 		day the tiger is 		sure to 		come. However, do 		not conclude 		from this that I 		consider the 		programme mentioned 		in the second question non-violent even if carried out after giving  
 prior information. My answer is intended only to clear the difficulty about the third question.
  The 	information contained 	in the 	cutting is 	more or 	less correct. 	My advice 	to Raojibhai 	was not in 	exercise of 	a right. 	One does 	not advise as 	a matter 	of right. 	One commands. 	Is that 	not so ? 	I lost the right to command from the moment of my incarceration.  Post 	Offices, courts, and 	so on, 	today do 	not belong 	to the 	people. Even when they 	come to belong 	to the 	people, they will not 	be personal 	property. Even personal 	property will be 	property belonging 	to the 	people. Out 	of that, 	only what the nation 	has given 	unto itself or kept 	for itself 	would belong 	to it. 	I hope 	this provides you 	all the explanations 	you seek. 
 I have not revised the above.

 CHI. DHUNDIRAJ,

  From 	a photostat of the Hindi: C.W. 972. Courtesy: Gajanan N. Kanitkar           PANCHGANI,  July 	10, 1944  	As for Bapa’s referencelibtech_413_footnoteof July 6, I see no discrepancy in my opinion 	regarding Nanjibhai’slibtech_414_footnotelibtech_415_footnoteproposed donation and the previous opinion quoted by 	Bapa. My point is that no donor should arbitrarily keep part or 	whole of the donation with himself. He may send recommendation about 	ear-marking. If it satisfies our conditions, the ear-marking may be 	allowed. If my opinion is held good, the fourth condition is 	superfluous.  	Thus while I see no discrepancy in my present opinion and the past, 	my emphasis has changed. In my weakness, I was anxious to make up 	the total of 75 lacs somehow. Now I am strong enough to resist that 	temptation. We shall better serve the object of the Memorial by 	securing what we can by October 2 next, than by letting donors to      
 fritter away the sum by local earmarkings and keeping the bulk with themselves. In the States, generally, we are likely to experience difficulty in spending money in the villages. I prefer the use of the word ‘villages’ to that of the expression ‘rural areas’. There may be rural area of Calcutta but it may not be composed of villages properly so-called. Santa Cruz is a suburban area but not a village. I hope the distinction I have made is capable of being easily understood.
 Again our large donors will be townsmen. Their natural-wish will be to spend their donation in their own way and in their own place. This may defeat the purpose of this Memorial.
 I see the prospect of such questions arising frequently. They will be largely of interpretation. I am most anxious to spare Bapa’s time and trouble. Let him unhesitatingly interpret rulings to the best of his ability and risk difference of opinion with the chairman. In matters of interpretation, Bapa’s shall be final except where he has previously referred any such question to me.
 I would like Bapa, if he can, to be satisfied with my Gujarati. I know it is difficult in old age to change confirmed habits. I have strong objection to the use of English when the use of the mother tongue or the national language is possible. But here again let Bapa’s wish prevail. He is on the active list. I am on the sick list and have therefore time for indulging in preferences.
 This letter should be sent to Bapa wherever he may be. It should also be shown to Sir Purushottamdas. If he differs on the question referred to me by Bapa, I should know.libtech_416_footnote
 This opinion was drafted yesterday. It was typed today. Bapa’s bombshell came later. I hope it will not explode.

232,"July 12, 1944",STATEMENT TO THE PRESS,"
      
 [July 12, 1944]libtech_429_footnote
 I had not authorized publication of the interview or even the substance. I had said that it should not be published, unless I authorized its publication, and in no case had I ever dremt that the interview would be published, with exclusive rights to any one paper. If it was to be published, it should have been broadcast throughout India.
 Therefore I  had  to  offer  that  apologylibtech_430_footnotepublicly  in  order  to soothe myself and also to show to the Press my appreciation that they have respected my desire to be left alone, and also not to report anything which I had not authorized.
 I know that some things have appeared in the Press without authority but, generally speaking, I must confess the Press has obliged me by refraining from reporting things that are not authorized. My object in seeing the Press people is purely to advance the cause for which I am living, namely, the freedom of India through truth and non-violence.
 I do not seek publicity for the sake of it and just now I feel I would serve the cause better by remaining in obscurity, if such things were possible. Therefore I had warned Gelder that he was not to publish anything from me unless I authorized it. He has publishedlibtech_431_footnotewhat he has, I have no doubt, with the best of intentions, but somehow or other I feel he has not served the cause as well as he might have.
 I passed nearly three hours with him distributed over three days in order that he might know the whole of my mind. I believed him, and still believe him, to be a well-wisher of India as he is a lover of his own country, and I accepted his word entirely when he told me that he approached me not as a journalist principally but as one desiring to see that the political deadlock was resolved.
 Whilst I declared my views with absolute freedom, I told him that his first business should be to go to Delhi and, if I could reach the
 
 
 Viceregal  throne,  he  should  see  the  Viceroylibtech_432_footnoteand   give   him   what impressions he had gathered. Having myself failed to get an interview with the Viceroy, I felt that Gelder being reporter of a prominent English daily might be able to serve the cause. Even in South Africa, where I was working in a hostile atmosphere, I was fortunate enough to get journalists and editors to help me when they became impressed by my earnestness and the justice of my cause. I was handling the disabilities of Indians in South Africa.
 The publication, therefore, at this stage, of an abstract [by Gelder] of two interviews seems to me to be misfired. I, therefore, propose to give you two notes prepared after discussion with Gelder one of which, namely, the shorter one, after his pilgrimage to Delhi he was free to send to his paper, and the other he could discuss privately with anybody who cared to understand me or who Gelder thought, should know how my mind was working
 You will see after you have read the two notes that he has compressed the two in the report published by him. You will notice also that there are some glaring inaccuracies in the report  as published. I want to guard myself against being undrestood as  accusing Gelder of wilful distortion.
 But I have found it times without number during my public life, covering a period of over 50 years, that my statements do not admit of being easily abridged or paraphrased. In 1897, I very nearly lost my life when Reuter sent an abridged summary  of  a  pamphletlibtech_433_footnoteI  had written and distributed in India in 1896. The summary was, I have no doubt, an unconscious distortion of what I had written. Fortunately my life was spared when I was lynched, and I was able to show that the case based against me on the strength of the summary was utterly wrong.
 Here the abridgement has no such mischievous consequences. I recall the South African incident in order to emphasize my point. All my life I have handled what seemed to be forlorn causes. I have been also a fairly successful journalist, but I did not embark upon that calling for a living. It was a venture in order to advertise the cause I was handling, and I gave this long preface before handing the two statements to fellow-journalists in the hope that they would respondto
 
 my earnest wish that they would co-operate with me in dealing with the situation which, if properly handled, may yield promising results for mankind.
 I was ill-prepared for this ordeal that is in front of me. I am in Panchgani trying to rebuild my broken body. The desire not to see statements published at this stage was also prompted by regard for my health. I want to get well quickly and to be in full working order. Since things are so shaping themselves that I might not be able to carry out that wish; the statement being before the public, I have to watch the reaction and deal with misunderstandings.
 I have kept you, gentlemen, away from me and you have been very kind to me. You have waited in the hope that some day I would satisfy your natural inquisitiveness. I am afraid that you will be perhaps oversatisfied because, if your chiefs still keep you here, you will give me daily summary of reactions in the Press. I do not expect that I shall want to deal with them all, but in so far as there are misunderstandings I will have to remove them, if I possibly can. Throughout this I have emphasized the fact that I was speaking for myself and in no sense involving the Congress in what I said. I do not know how far today I represent the views of the members of the Working Committee.
 As regards the Hindu-Muslim Formulalibtech_434_footnote, which has nothing to do with these two statements, I have not spoken as a Hindu. I have spoken as an Indian first and an Indian last. My Hinduism is my own—I personally think it embraces all faiths. Therefore I have no authority to speak as a representative of the Hindus.
 That I respond to mass mind and the masses know me instinctively is a fact which cannot be gainsaid, but I have not built my case upon it. As a representative of satyagraha, as I know it, I feel it my duty to pour out my heart to an Englishman who I thought, and still think, is a sympathetic listener. I claim no further authority for my views. I stand by every word that appeared in the two statements I have given to you, but I speak on behalf of no one else than myself.

 [July]libtech_435_footnotelibtech_436_footnote12, 1944
 MY DEAR HORACE,
 I have your long letter—long for the time and the way in which it had to be sent, not for the subject matter. Some of what you tell me  I had known already after coming out, and some of it is startling. All of it is good as coming from you, even the part that I know to be wrong. But that which is wrong does not diminish the importance of what you have said. The defects of your narrative arise from your good nature. I would rather have the latter than have the defects removed at the sacrifice of it. I need not thus have qualified my appreciation of your letter but for the fear of misleading you into the belief that I accept the whole of your version without any deduction. To discuss the deduction is not germane to what I want to say. You know the other side of the picture. The popular fury was pardonable; the vindictive and inhuman retribution wholly indefensible. But I will not take your time over this.
 Your anxiety that I should offer co-operation at least for the alleviation of hunger, I fully understand. My difficulty is  that  I  cannot, for the very valid reason that the alleviation is only apparent. The Viceroy’s good intentions in the matter are not to be doubted. His promptness in rushing to Bengal on arrival was worthy of the soldier that he is. The agency through which he had and has to work is not designed to carry out the work of alleviation. You are entitled to put your noble work and experience against what I am saying. That only shows that evil by itself and in itself has no life. It requires the prop of good for its sustenance. Hospitals, roads, railways are probably good in themselves but when they are instruments of evil they are to be shunned. They become snares. You will now realize somewhat my meaning. Sufficient to say that at no time has India been so bound  down  as  now.  The  remedy  is  liberty  consistent  with the movements of Allied troops. But there is deep mutual
 
 distrust.Authority distrusts the Congress and every public body including the Muslim League. Public opinion is flouted at almost every turn. In this state of things voluntary co-operation becomes impossible. I have tried in vain to see the Viceroy or be permitted to see the Working Committee members. Now tell me what to do. I know what not to do. I am praying to God to tell me what to do. You can assist.

It 	must be so, so long as I am ‘untrustworthy’. If I could plead 	guilty, I would at once mend my way. On the contrary, I know, I have 	done nothing to forfeit the confidence I used at one time to enjoy 	among the official circles.  	You know the attempt I made to see the members of the  Working 	Committee and, failing that permission, to see the Viceroy. Perhaps 	the chief difficulty is the opinionlibtech_442_footnotelibtech_443_footnote, reported to have been held by Mr. Churchill about me. 	You know the oft-quoted passages attributed to him. He is said to 	want to “crush” me “the naked fakir”. The body can be 	crushed, never spirit. But if the report is true      
 and it has never been denied—it gives the clue to all my so-called failures.
 I can give you this assurance that nothing  dismays  or disappoints me. If I represent the truth and if I do as God bids me, I know that the wall of distortion and suspicion will topple. Only be patient with me. I feel for you and friends like you.libtech_444_footnote

            MY 	DEAR SADANAND,         	‘DILKHUSHA’, PANCHGANI,  July 	13, 1944 
  	Your wire. Though this reply is to you as a journalist, and for 	publication, the manner of my reply will be on the basis of your 	claim to be my son, a claim which you have often repeated. You have 	verbally accepted my amendslibtech_450_footnotelibtech_451_footnotebut in action rejected them. Re-read the opening 	parts of your telegram and you will understand my meaning. If you 	do, you will make a public acknowledgement of the offence you have 	given me even in the act of accepting amends.  	As a pleasing contrast to this, I may tell you that the four 	reporters   whom   I   had   the   pleasure   of   meetinglibtech_452_footnotelibtech_453_footnoteyesterday   were       
 graceful enough to accept my amends and to understand fully its implication.
 I have a categorical reply for every one of the questions you have asked me. But I very much fear that they are not sincere but meant to advertise your bravery, and newspaper propaganda of an unworthy type.
 I have read with much pain your writings in your issue of July 12, 1944. They caption a wicked attack upon Rajaji and milder one on esteemed public men. You are doing a great injustice to yourself and shaming your nationalism by attacking Rajaji who, to my knowledge, has no axe to grind, has forsaken everything for love of his country and
 has risked popularity in pursuing the dictates of his conscience. Let me tell you that Rajaji has not discussed his politics with me. My dissent from his politics, as I understood him in jail, continues. Now that I have been involuntarily and prematurely drawn into political controversy, I shall certainly discuss them with him as I am doing with respect in spite of wide political divergence. Courtesy towards opponents and eagerness to understand their view-points is the ABC of non-violence. But you of all persons should know that they are not likely to deflect me from the straight and narrow path I have chosen to tread. They can but strengthen me in my resolve to follow it, never weaken me.
 And I should be all utterly unworthy leader or exponent of non-violence, if I could be led astray by eminent leaders or constant companions like Rajaji.
 In a way the honest mistake made by Mr. Gelder, as his premature publicationlibtech_454_footnotelibtech_455_footnoteof an abridgement of the notes of interviews with him appears to have been, is a blessing in that the country once again has an opportunity of knowing the measure of my compromising nature. I have no reason to be ashamed of it and I have never considered it a sign of weakness in me but strength.
 If you will prove a worthy son of mine, you will revise the whole of your policy and use your journalistic gifts so as to  serve  the  country by the way of truth and non-violence.
 You have had a fair portion of material goods out of your journalistic venture. Now dare to be poor, if need be, and instead of
 
 feeding the public on sensationalism, give them nothing but solid gold. And, if you do not know how to do so, accept a humbler vocation. You will then at least have the credit of ceasing to do mischief.
I hope that you will publish this without alteration.libtech_456_footnote

240,"July 	13, 1944",INTERVIEW TO THE PRESS,"
             PANCHGANI, 
  July 	13, 1944  	Some have said that I have admitted that the August resolution has 	lapsed. Not only have I never said it, on the contrary, at the 	Maharashtra Workers’ meetinglibtech_458_footnotelibtech_459_footnote, I made it clear to the friends who had gathered 	around me at Poona that no comma of that resolution could be altered 	by anybody except those who passed it, namely, the  Working 	Committee and finally the A.I.C.C. What I have said and what I 	reaffirm is that my authority under the resolution had undoubtedly 	lapsed according to my view of the working of satyagraha.  	The premature publicationlibtech_460_footnoteof the interview to Mr. Gelder has led to some 	confusion in the minds of Congressmen. Let me make it clear that the 	lapsing of my authority has nothing to do with the normal activities 	of the Congress. What no one can do in the name of the Congress is 	mass civil disobedience which was never started and which, as I have 	said, I cannot at the present moment, even in my personal capacity, 	start.  	The “Quit India” resolution I hold to be absolutely innocuous. 	The Gelder interview noteslibtech_461_footnotenow published are in no way in conflict with the 	“Quit India” resolution as I have interpreted it and, as the 	joint author of it, I have every right to interpret it.  	The question before me and before the All-India [Congress Committee] 	is how to implement the resolution at the present time, i.e., nearly 	two years after the passing of the resolution. The Gelder interview 	notes show the way how it can be done in a perfectly honourable 	manner. Those who approve of the stand I have taken up will 	naturally support it. People having difficulty are free to refer to 	me but their approval of the stand taken by me must not be 	interpreted to mean suspension of the normal activities of the 	Congress and, if the Government interfere with those activities, the 	inherent right of individual civil disobedience is in no way 	suspended      
 under the statement referred to by me. The statements constitute my individualpersonal effort to end the political deadlock. They are more addressed to the powers that be than to the people. If there is a hearty response, there will be no occasion for civil disobedience, individually or not.
 Answering a question put by a reporter whether the Cripps proposals could be compared with his recent statements, Mahatma Gandhi said:
My proposal is wholly different. The Cripps proposals were
 unacceptable to me for the simple reason that they contemplated  almost perpetual vivisection of India and would have created an effective barrier against Indian independence. I want to say this without the slightest disrespect to Sir Stafford Cripps.libtech_462_footnotelibtech_463_footnoteHe still remains to me the same friend that he claimed to be when he was here. For me friendships abide in spite of political differences.
 One fundamental element in my attitude is that I shall never be a party to the sale of the rights of the people of the States for the sake of freedom of the people of British India. At the same time I am no enemy of the Princes. I consider myself to be their friend and, if anybody cares to understand, I am quite prepared to suggest  a  solution at once honourable to them and to the people. I live for a cause and, if I perish, it is for the cause.
 A reporter suggested that it might be that His Majesty’s Government do not, for the duration of the war, entertain any idea for the transference of power, and it was feared that Mr. Jinnah would not be agreeable to accept Mahatma Gandhi’s suggestion because a national government might, in his opinion, consolidate the position of the Hindus in the centre. Mahatma Gandhi explained:
If Mr. Jinnah does not accept my suggestion or if the powers
 that be do not, I would consider it most unfortunate. That would show that neither of them wants India to be really free at this juncture and give India a full share in winning the war for freedom and democracy.
 I myself feel firmly that Mr. Jinnah does not block the way, but the British Government do not want a just settlement of the Indian claim for independence which is overdue, and they are using Mr. Jinnah as a cloak for denying freedom to India. I have uttered my warning in the talk I gave to Mr. Stuart Gelder.
 Mahatma Gandhi said that it must be the duty of all fair-minded people to break what he called “the diabolical conspiracy to stifle India’s aspiration”. He declared:
 
 I have the firmest faith that they may win the war in the trial of brute strength, because brute strength when applied to limitless finances will naturally be supreme, but it will be only a physical victory and lead to another world war. This is the outpouring of a lacerated heart.

248,"July 	14, 1944",INTERVIEW TO THE PRESS,"
             PANCHGANI, 
  July 	14, 1944  	I have been receiving letters from several provinces complaining of 	the ill-treatment of detenus. I cannot vouch for their accuracy. I 	have no means of verifying the accounts. But correspondents who have 	written are most of them known personally to me and they are not 	likely to exaggerate.  	One instance came to my notice only yesterday. It is  from Ajmer. 	The prisoner was fasting. His wife wrote several letters to me 	asking me to advise her husband to give up the fast. As it was, the 	prisoner was willing. I telegraphedlibtech_480_footnotelibtech_481_footnoteto 	the Superintendent conveying my advice to the prisoner to desist 	from fasting. He accepted it and gave up his fast. I now learn that 	the prisoner was being prosecuted under some jail regulations for 	having committed the crime of fasting.  	I know when I was a prisoner in Yeravda that there was some such 	regulation and I thought that when a prisoner gave up his fast, he 	would not be prosecuted. I also fasted, and I could also be 	punished, but I escaped punishment, I suppose, because I was 	regarded as a celebrity. Assuming that I have been correctly 	informed, I  would  plead with the authorities that they should 	ignore such cases. There would be nothing wrong if they allowed 	prisoners to fast at will. The most reasonable thing would be to 	investigate the complaints  for  which they were fasting and 	promptly give redress, if the complaints were found justified. These 	things have been done before. There is no reason why that admirable 	practice should not be followed now.  	I plead for humane treatment to prisoners, more especially when they 	are in detention on mere suspicion or found guilty of crimes created 	by special ordinances and not under the ordinary law.  	Other cases that have come to my notice are not of fasting but of 	alleged ill-treatment in order to break the spirit of prisoners. I 	dealt with such cases when I edited the Young India and later 	the Harijan, and in many cases the authorities gave redress.  	I happen to know that such cases sometimes do not reach the higher 	authorities. My purpose in bringing this to public notice is to    
 seek redress. It is well known that in most provinces prisoners are suffering hardships which are perfectly avoidable. All those who are at all ill or are losing weight should at once be discharged. This will surely not prejudice the war-effort or endanger the peace of the country.libtech_482_footnote
 I have received bitter criticism of my viewslibtech_483_footnoteexpressed in  the Gelder interview. Some of my correspondents say that under the influence of Moderates and moneyed men, I have betrayed the cause of the country. If for nothing else, for dealing with such criticism, I am glad of the premature publicationlibtech_484_footnoteof the interview. I do not want to sail under false colours. The country as well as the Government should know me exactly as I am. I have never concealed the fact that I am a friend of everybody, Moderates, moneyed men, Englishmen, Americans or any other, irrespective of caste, colour or persuasion. My belief and practice are directly derived from my non-violence. My non-co-operation is non-co-operation with evil, not with the evil-doer. Underneath my non-co-operation is my earnest desire to wean the evil-doer from the evil or harm he is doing, so that I can give him hearty co-operation. Again if I associate with the so-called Moderates or with moneyed men, I do so to seek their co-operation in the cause I am handling. But I approach them with an open mind, so that I correct myself where I find myself in the wrong. I have known of no cause that I have espoused that has suffered because of such association.
 Some critics have suggested that by my present attitude I am lending moral weight to the Allied cause. They forget that my offer, such as it is, is conditioned upon the Allies, in this case the British Government, recognizing full independence, qualified during the pendency of the war. I see, therefore, no conflict between  the principles enunciated in August resolution and what I have now suggested. May I suggest to critics that they should wait till the British Government have spoken? The statements made by me were meant in the first instance for the Government. Mr. Gelder sprang a surprise.
 
 He has done so with the best of motives. After all, there is a higher Power ruling all the actions of human beings.libtech_485_footnote

  July 	15, 1944  QUESTION: 	Will you kindly explain the exact difference between the Cripps Plan 	and your own as revealed in the Gelder interview? ANSWER: 	My plan contemplates an immediate recognition of full  	independence for India as a whole, subject to limitations for the 	duration of the war to meet the requirements of the Allied 	operations. The Cripps Plan, as I understood it, dealt more with the 	future than with the immediate arrangements. Moreover, in my 	opinion, the Cripps Plan meant dismemberment of India, the Indian 	States being set up as an all-extensive disintegrating factor. But 	if my plan is considered by British statesmen to be not very 	different from the Cripps Plan, it should be all the easier for them 	to accept it.libtech_502_footnote  What 	if Mr. Jinnah sticks to a plebiscite of Muslims only in the 	districts or provinces where the Muslims are in majority? Neither 	Qaid-e-Azam Jinnah nor the Muslim League have  	pronounced their opinion on Rajaji’s Formulalibtech_503_footnotelibtech_504_footnote.  I  would  deprecate anticipating them. Rajaji is 	with me. We have agreed for the sake of conserving my limited energy 	that he should deal with the questions arising from the Formula. For 	my part I would appeal to the questioners, foreign or Indian, not to 	forestall the Muslim League.  How 	do you propose to fix the ratio of the League and Congress in the 	national government? I 	must not be drawn into details. If the indication of my mind  	affords any satisfaction to the authorities, they should open the 	gates of the prison, and let those who can speak with authority 	pronounce upon my proposal or at least let me confer with them. As 	it is, I do not know that I have not embarrassed them by my sharing 	my personal opinion with the public before first sharing it with 	them.

Even if that did  not 	happen, you would have peace. I 	am not an invalid that you imagine me to be. And mentally       
 
 not at all. That is why whatever I do, I do with deliberation and carelibtech_519_footnotelibtech_520_footnote. There was a time when you could understand me from a mere hint. You could explain to others my intentions and my words. Why is it that that is no longer so ? Think about it. The reason lies only in you. If I were as ill as you and did not forget the outside world, I too would be in the same situation. You do not understand Rajaji at all. His modesty and his conduct are worth emulating. I did not lose my alertness during my fast. And when I broke my fast he showed me his draft. I am astonished that you can think him so mean as to take advantage of my weakness. To say that my statement means Pakistan shows ignorance. What can one do if Gelder bruit about it ? Rajaji’s draft had nothing to do with the interview. Contain your anger. Calm youself. And be sure that there is no contradiction in what I have done. As for Paramanand, let me see what is possible. I hope Dilip is calm. Send him to me if he is disturbed. Did your cloak fit ? I am fine.

 CHI. BHANSALI,
 Discipline demands that you should ask me. If you do not observe it, who else will? But what guidance can I give you in this matter? If you have faith in yourself, by all means go and relieve the suffering of the people. I must admit, however, that you have excelled me and I derive comfort from the thought that my  teaching  has proved fruitful. Isn’t he a true teacher who is surpassed by his own pupil? May God increase your strength still further.
I  keep on reminding myself daily that I  must go there as early

 It was a pleasure to receive your letter of 10th in appreciation of my correspondence with Government. This however I write not merely to acknowledge your letter, but to complain about the opinion you have expressed on Rajaji’s formula on the communal tangle. I had heard that you were in sympathy with the formula if you had not fully endorsed it. Be that as it may I should have thought that regard being had to the relations between us and also yourself and Rajaji, you would have come and discussed the pros and cons before publishing your views. I suppose it is common cause between us that the problem should be solved, the earlier the better. If you have the time and are so minded, we can still discuss the question.libtech_550_footnotelibtech_551_footnoteI expect Rajaji will be with me at Sevagram which D[eo] V[olente]libtech_552_footnotelibtech_553_footnoteI expect to reach early   in August.

  	Your best and descriptive letter is before me. Devdas described your 	grief over my reverting to your original name. I have capitulated. I 	am having rich experiences of life. I am learning every day. I must 	not cause dear ones grief when it is avoidable. This was and is 	avoidable. I know you forgave me long ago. But it is good to ask for 	forgiveness.

 Your money causes me anxiety. I am eager to transfer the sum to you. But I cannot get the proper account. You can understand the difficulty. For donations separate accounts are never kept, so at a given moment it is a difficult process to say what the Ashram’s donations are.
 That is your case when account was closed. And Narandas has nothing free. I shall overtake that difficulty. I shall take some time. But when you need the money for your adventure you have but to tell me and I shall place a sum at your disposal. Khurshedbehn is here. She is writing. You are following the papers.

 Your wire of 11th instant was received here on 14th, but due to pressure of work on the staff that is here, it was  given  to  me onlytoday. Pressure on my time is answerable for the absence of the promised letter. Evidently I forgot all about the letter I had promised.
 I am sorry because I know your care and affection for me. This is the treatment I am having: massage for about an hour all over the body and a hot-water bath, lying in a full length tub for about 20 minutes. This is all very soothing for me. Often before entering the tub I have hot-and-cold hip baths for five minutes each. My food, you know, milk, vegetables, fruit and gur. Between three and four, I have an earth bandage—this too, I think, you know. Clean earth is mixed with water and made into a dough. I take a similar bandage before retiring. Horrible medicine I have is bhilama. Boiled in water, strained, mixed with milk, I had it for seven days. There has been an interval of more than seven days. I propose to take it from tomorrow again for seven days.
 In Poona, I had what is supposed to be a specific against hook-worm. It is called Carbon Tetrachlor Ethylene.
 I am on the onward march. Dr. Jivraj Mehta is in Panchgani looking after me. Sushila whom you know was with me even in jail. I have sent her to Delhi.
 The medical report is that anaemia is subsiding and probably the two enemies, hook-worm and entamoeba histolytica, are lying low, not gone altogether. I expect to go to Sevagram, Deo volente, in the early part of August. I am here at least till the end of the month.

 RESPECTED MRIDULABEHN,
 Your letter has been received. It was read out to Bapu. Respected Bapuji wants me to say that he has no doubt made changes in the translation but such changes will not distort or modify the meaning. Even so, if there are any doubts, somebody who comes can check. As it is, it has been sent after checking.
 It does not matter if the Congress Committee is not involved. We are concerned only with propaganda. Hence, it is enough if it has been delivered at Poona. It would be good if it could be translated into other languages also. It will not be bad if it is translated into Marathi and published in newspapers. There is after all nothing in it that we should regret. It was and is an open talk. Hence, Shri Audh and you should in consultation decide how best this thing can be propagated. Bapu was pleased to know that Bharatanandjilibtech_555_footnotewould be looking after correspondence with the Government.
 You are free to come here whenever you choose.
 Bapu is recovering slowly. Bapu gave an interview to the Press after hearing from you. You will have seen in the newspapers the views that he expressed. What is your opinion ?

               DEAR 	FRIEND,             	“DILKHUSHA”, PANCHGANI, 	July 19, 	1944 
  	I appreciate your very frank letter. I shall return the courtesy by 	being equally frank.  	The difference between now and August, 1942 is that at that time I 	had no knowledge of the response the people both pro- Congress and 	anti-Congress would make. Now I know the kind of response they made. 	The heroism, the suffering and the self-sacrifice of those who took 	part in the struggle are beyond praise; but weighed in the scales of 	Truth and Non-violence there were glaring defects in the 	demonstration and I can only say that India failed to reach her 	natural goal because of those defects. Whatever may be true of other 	nations I have no doubt that India can come to her own fully only by 	truthful and non-violent means. In the face of sabotage and the like 	the rulers as usual lost their heads and resorted to reprisals 	unheard of before. I write under correction. I have asked for an 	impartial tribunal for investigation of the charges against the 	Congress and counter- charges against the Government. Unless I am 	convinced to the contrary, I shall continue to believe that the 	mole-hill of popular violence has been shown on behalf of the 	Government to have been a mountain and the Himalayan violence of the 	authorities has been generally defended as no more than necessary 	for the occasion. I must, therefore, refuse to judge popular action 	by the footrule of Truth and Non-violence unless I can apply the 	same measure for the    
 Governmental action. This is one difference.
 The second difference is the terrible and progressive starvation of the people. Whether it is due to the wrath of God or the incompetence of the rulers or the universal pressure of the War is not relevant to the elucidation of my reply.
 I hold that these two causes mark a decisive difference between now and 1942. I would be unworthy of my creed if I failed to make use of all the resources of head and heart that God has vouchsafed to me for discovering a solution of the deadlock. What is that solution submitted by me ? It is nothing less than the present declaration of freedom of India, limited during the War period by the exigencies of the War. This limitation you know. If that offer is accepted then I would be criminally guilty if I did not advise the Congress to accept it. If my proposal reaches full fruition, what is today a war of brute strength against brute strength would be turned into a war for the liberation of the exploited people of the world. Then it would be a war between predominantly moral strength plus minimum of  brute strength matched against pure brute strength which is being used for the exploitation of China and the weaker states of Europe. I hope you will now agree with me that my move is not one of political expendiency but a necessary corollary of the creed which I cherish dearer than life. If you have further difficulty about understanding my position, please write again.

287,"July 	19, 1944","INTERVIEW TO THE
PRESSlibtech_565_footnote","
  From 	a facsimile of the Hindi: Mahatma, 	Vol. VI, between pp. 	336 and 337           PANCHGANI,  July 	19, 1944  	I am glad you have put the question exactly as you have seen it in 	the critical Press. I confess that I am not able to go through all 	Press criticisms and, therefore, I find myself at a disadvantage.  	Your question, therefore, is doubly helpful to me. Let me remind 	critics at the outset that publicity of the interviewlibtech_566_footnotelibtech_567_footnote(to 	Mr. Stuart Gelder of the News Chronicle) was 	not of my seeking. As I have already remarkedlibtech_568_footnotelibtech_569_footnote, it was meant for the powers that be. I ask for a 	dispassionate examination of my proposals on their merits. I should 	not mind a climb down, if it resulted in the attainment of Indian 	independence. I may say that the favourable war situation had 	nothing to do with my proposal, if only for the simple reason that 	in the  flush  of  approaching victory, my proposal was not likely 	even to receive a hearing. But as a lover of peace, not merely in 	India, but peace among all mankind, I could not but make a proposal 	for what it is worth. After all, there is such a thing as world 	opinion, apart from  the opinion of authorities.  	A united, enlightened, powerful opinion of the world is bound to 	affect those who are today wielding what appears to be absolute 	power in waging the war, and experience has taught me that one 	should not be afraid of being misunderstood or of rejection of one’s      
 proposal, if it is sound in itself.
 The heavy defeat of the Congress I do not feel at all. I have not  a shadow of doubt that this passage through fire and suffering by thousands of Congressmen and Congress sympathizers has raised the status of India and the strength of the people. Throughout all my long public life I have not experienced a sense of defeat, heavy or  otherwise. I know many Congressmen are labouring under a sense of frustration. Poor men, they do not know the value of self-suffering. But even that frustration is only momentary. Victory, that is, independence of India as a whole, is a certainty. That it may not come in my lifetime is a matter of indifference to me. I can but work for it till the end of my life. Victory will come when God wills it.
 Only today I wrote to a friend who wanted to know the  difference between now and August 1942. From it I quote relevant sentences. I have said the difference between now and August 1942 is that at that time I had no knowledge of the response the people, both pro-Congress and anti-Congress, would make. Now I know the kind of response they made. The heroism, suffering and self-sacrifice of those who took part in this struggle are beyond praise, but weighed in the scale of truth and non-violence there are glaring defects in the popular demonstration. And I can only say that India failed  to reachher natural goal at the time because of these defects. Whatever may be true of other nations, I have no doubt that India can come to her own fully by truth and non-violent means. In the face of sabotage and the like, rulers have as usual lost their heads and resorted to reprisals unheard of before. I write this under correction. I have askedlibtech_570_footnotelibtech_571_footnotefor an impartial tribunal for the investigation of charges against the Congress and my counter-charges against the Government. Unless I am convinced to the contrary, I shall continue to believe that the molehill of popular violence has been shown on  behalf  of Government to have been a mountain and the Himalayan violence of the authorities has been generally defended as no more than necessary for the occasion. I must, therefore, refuse to judge popular action by the footrule of truth and non-violence unless I can apply the same measure for Government action. This is one difference. The second difference is the terrible progressive starvation of the people. Whether it is due to wrath of God or incompetence of the rulers or universal
 
 pressure of war, is not relevant to the elucidation of my reply. I hold that these two causes mark decisive differences between now and August 1942. I would be unworthy of my creed, if I failed to make use of all the resources of head and heart that God has vouchsafed to me for discovering a solution of the deadlock. What that solution is, is submittedlibtech_572_footnoteby me. It is nothing less than the present declaration of freedom of India, limited during the war period by the exigencies of the war. This limitation you know. If the offer is accepted, then I would be criminally guilty if I did not advise the Congress to accept it. If my proposal reaches full fruition, what is today a war of brute strength would be turned into a war for the liberation of the exploited peoples of the world. Then it would be a war between predominantly moral strength plus the minimum of brute strength matched against pure brute strength which is being used for the exploitation of China
and the weaker States of Europe.
 Rajaji’s offerlibtech_573_footnotehas seen the light of day only now, but I   had personally subscribed to it when I was fasting in prison camp. It is now sixteen months old. For the rest of the offer, I must carry out the contract between Rajaji and myself. He is to bear the brunt of all criticism that might be made about that offer.
 Finally I would say to my critics to enter with me into the sufferings not only of the people of India but of those, whetherengaged in the war or not of the whole world. I cannot look at this butchery going on in the world with indifference. I have an unchangeable faith that it is beneath the dignity of men to resort to mutual slaughter. I have no doubt that there is a way out. I am vain enough to think that my malaria was a godsend, and He used Government as His instrument for discharging me.
 I should be never reconciled to myself if, for fear of hostile criticism or wrath of impatient Congressmen or even possible displeasure of members of the Working Committee, I did not express personal opinion, the acceptance of which, I hold, must result in bringing peace to the world, even out of the present turmoil.libtech_574_footnote

           PANCHGANI,  July 	20, 1944  DEAR 	AMIYA,  	I was delighted to receive your letter. Death leaves no family 	without His toll. Why should we not treat His messengers as friends 	and pay the toll with a willing heart? I had to make His 	acquaintance when I was quite a youth and I learnt to regard Death 	as a welcome deliverance whether it is a suckling baby or one in 	prime of life like your brother or an elderly person. I long ago 	ceased to regard as affliction or punishment the so-called 	misfortunes. On my return to India I think it was Kakasaheb who 	recited a verse and reminded me that I was presenting no new thought 	when I expounded the view just mentioned. From that time onward we 	have recited at the morning prayer the following verselibtech_577_footnote: foinks 	uSo foin % lainks u So lain%Afoin~ foLej.ka fo"".kks%

 Hence the puzzle that taxes the philosphers of the West and the East has no worry for me. I know this arises from my ignorance of writings on philosophy. I console myself with the thought that my ignorance is bliss if it promotes my peace of mind.
 This is my contribution towards assuaging your grief and my answer to the question propounded by you.
 The second question is simple. Of course, there must be organized resistance to organized evil. The difficulty arises when the organizers of satyagraha try to imitate the organizers of evil. I tried and failed hopelessly. The way of organizing forces of good must be opposite to the evil way. What it exactly is I do not yet know fully. I feel that it lies through perfection, as far as may be, of individuals. It then acts as the leaven raising the whole mass. But I am still groping.
 I hope I have given you sufficient food for thought for the time being. More when we meet. I hope to be in Sevagram  in  the  beginning of August. Gurudev was an institution. We must feel the loss.

  	I have both your letters. I have just been able to finish reading 	the second long one. You could have abridged both the letters and at 	the same time conveyed more. I do not say this by way of criticism. 	I see this defect in many writers. I have just pointed it out so 	that you may try and learn brevity in writing. What 	you have written is all right. But it is a half truth. This does 
 not mean that you have anywhere tried to hide the truth. I have no doubt that you have written what you believe to be the whole truth. But I who know the other side see but half truth in your letter. Just think over this: If we give up all those whom you have criticized, who will be left to work in the Congress? You and I? As a matter of fact you alone can work because I sit with those whom you have criticized. What then is my value? I do not write this to criticize you but to show the defect in your argument. We have to work with the best possible people available. Since we are imperfect ourselves we can make progress only by putting up with imperfect co-workers. Though there is some truth in your criticism, the world has seen the strength of the Congress. That proves that on the whole the achievement of the Congress is not bad. I shall write no more just now. Think over this and, if you still do not see your way, write to me. The world is good, if we are good. Let others do nothing or do something wrong. You go on with your own proper work. There is no time to sit idle.

 I see no chance for the groaning world, unless the three States now demonstrate to the world that they have one mind, that they are not putting forth the effort they are doing for any selfish design, butthat they are truly fighting for all democracies on the face of the earth.
 My proposal is an acid test, and I have no shadow of doubt that its hearty acceptance by Britain will immediately turn the scales and ensure the defeat of the belligerent powers and fill exploited nations of the earth with hope.

 PANCHGANI,
 July 23, 1944
 The Sind Home Ministerlibtech_590_footnote, in defending the forcible prevention of a member of the Sind Legislative Assembly from exercising his right of attending the Assembly meeting, is reported to have said: “Our information is that, since the release of Mahatma Gandhi, the subversive movement had been restarted throughout India and that leading personalities behind that movement were again trying to direct it.” He referred in this connection to the escape from Karachi jail of three under-trial prisoners concerned in the Marriot Road dacoity case and said, “this is all in pursuance of the policy of reviving the movement.”
 All the information that I have gathered since my discharge is absolutely contrary to the statement alleged to have been made by the Sind Home Minister. May it be that he is badly served by his informants? Is it not his duty to supply the public with details of the information in his possession? Who are the leading personalities, and what is the subversive movement?
 If there is any connection between the escape from Karachi jail of the under-trial prisoners and the supposed revival of the so-called subversive movement, the least that is necessary is to mention these names and show the connection.
 I would not have taken notice of the Sind Home Minister’s statement but for the fact that it is likely to be used by enemies of India’s freedom to frustrate the efforts that I am making for the cause of independence. I am sure the Sind Home Minister is as anxious as I am for India’s freedom, attained through peaceful means.
 I may add, too, that throughout this anxious period my attempt has been, through the Press and in my talks with Congressmen and others, to show that I am opposed unequivocally to sabotage and the like. I have also stated in explicit terms that I never have had an opportunity of starting civil disobedience and that the authority vested in me by the A.I.C.C. expired on my imprisonment, and could not automatically be revived by my discharge on grounds of ill-health.
 
 Therefore assuming that civil disobedience is described as subversive movement, which I deny, even that cannot be offered by anybody on behalf of Congress.
 But I have said at the same time that normal Congress activities of a purely peaceful nature must be carried on even if restrictions are imposed upon them. It is up to the authorities, therefore, if they are at all inclined to respond to my advice, not to interfere with such activities as were permissible, say, before August 1942, such as, for instance, monthly flag demonstration, public meetings and the like.

 I was to put before the Working Committee my view of the negotiations which I was to carry on with the Government. They were to cover a period of at least three weeks. The instructions were to see the light of day only on failure of the contemplated negotiations.
 The object of publishing the draft at present is twofold. It shows how my mind was running at the time. The draft is an additional answer to the adverse suggestions made in the Government indictment about my non-violence. The second and more relevant object is to let Congress workers know how I would have acted at the time.
 I have come to know that my name was freely used to justify acts of sabotage and the like. I would like every Congressman and for that matter every Indian to feel that on him and her lies the responsibility of freeing India from the incubus of foreign  rule.Non-violent suffering is the only way. Freedom of India means
 
 everything for us but it means also much for the world. For, freedom won through non-violence will mean the inauguration of a new order in the world.
There is no hope for mankind in any other way.

It is not right that I 	shouldanswer them without you. I won’t drag you to Panchgani. But 	I do want you to be in Sevagram when I reach there. I hope to be 	there on 3rd August.

  	I am glad that Manilal and Sita have come. I am still more pleased 	that you yourself stayed behind. I had thought that that would be 	beyond your capacity. You have risen higher in my estimation. May 	God keep you both on a high plane.  	I have had quite long talks with Manilal, though not to my heart’s 	content. There wasn’t sufficient time for that. We will talk still 	more after we reach Sevagram or on our way there.    
 Sita is a very good girl. I have not been able to make friends with her as much as I would wish. But I think, I will be able to do so. She is intelligent. The most important thing is to see that she always remains as healthy as she is today. Good health is the most important blessing of life. Do not worry about her. If you worry about Manilal, I would certainly consider you silly.
 About myself Manilal will write. There is no cause for worry. I am in God’s hands. He will do what He wants.
 According to the present plan, I understand that you will arrive after December. The immediate plan is that Manilal and Sita will join me in Sevagram, via Akola, provided of course there are no unforeseen developments.

If it is not accepted, even as a basis for a friendly 	discussion and for permission to be given to see members of the 	Working Committee, who alone can speak with authority, I must 	reluctantly come to the conclusion that the British Government do 	not want a fair solution of what I consider is a deadlock, but what 	they may not consider as such.  	However earnest I may be in my efforts to reach a solution, I know I 	can do nothing, if there is no response from the British     
 Government. How I wish that the bogey of communal differences had not been raised in the debate. I have contended, as I contend even now, that differences there must be so long as there is a ruling third party to exploit them. I have spoken what I feel to be the truth.

  	I must admit my disappointment over your letterlibtech_613_footnoteof  the  22nd instant. But I am used to work in the 	face of disappointment. Here is my concrete proposal.  	I am prepared to advise the Working Committee to declare that in 	view of the changed conditions, mass civil disobedience envisaged by 	the resolution of August 1942 cannot be offered and that full      
 co-operation in the war-effort should be given by the Congress,if a declaration of immediate Indian independence is made and a national government responsible to the Central Assembly be formed subject to the proviso that, during the pendency of the war, the military operations should continue as at present but without involving any financial burden on India. If there is a desire on the part of the British Government for a settlement, friendly talks should take the place of correspondence. But I am in your hands. I shall continue to knock so long as there is the least hope of an honourable settlement.
 After the foregoing was written, I saw Lord Munster’s speech in the House of Lords. The summary given by him in the House of Lords fairly represents my proposal. This summary may serve as a basis for mutual friendly discussion.libtech_614_footnote

Pancholi               PANCHGANI,  July 	28, 1944  	The question most discussed with me by visitors is whether I approve 	of underground activities. These include sabotage, the publication 	of unauthorized sheets, etc. It has been suggested to me that 	without some workers going underground they could have done nothing. 	Some have contended that destruction of property, including 	dislocation of communication, provided that safety of human  life 	could be ensured, should surely be counted as  non-violence. 	Examples of other nations as having not hesitated to do all these 	things and much worse have been cited. My reply is that no nation 	has, so far as I know, deliberately used truth and non-violence as 	exclusive means for the attainment of freedom. Judged by that 	standard, I say unhesitatingly, that underground activities, even 	though utterly innocent in themselves, should have no place in the 	technique of non-violence. Sabotage and all it means, including 	destruction of property, is in itself violence. Though these 	activities may be shown to have touched the imagination and 	enthusiasm, I have no doubt that they have harmed the movement as a 	whole. I 	swear by the Constructive Programme. Let me recount the 
 items of that programme:

 Ninth August is a great day and it is the duty of all to observe it. But that part of the resolution which speaks of mass civil disobedience cannot be brought into force because the authority to put it into force was vested solely in me. Today I see no possibility of mass civil disobedience either according to that authority or according to circumstances.
 Mass civil disobedience is one thing and the exercise of citizen’s right and civil disobedience in pursuance of it is different. The people have been exercising the right of defensive individual civil disobedience since 1920. People in general may not understand the difference between mass civil disobedience and civil disobedience for the defence of individual citizen’s rights. But it is necessary to know the differences.
 On such occasions as 9th August, people have to understand the difference, and exercise this right of individual civil disobedience for the defence of civil rights. In such places where it is necessary to take the permission of police for meetings, processions and such common civil rights, permission from the police should be asked for. But, if such permission is not granted, people should exercise their civil right in spite of the refusal.libtech_628_footnote

338,"July 30, 1944",LETTER TO P. C. JOSHI,"
                DEAR 	FRIEND,           AS 	AT SEVAGRAM, 	CAMP PANCHGANI, 	July 30, 1944 
  	I had duly received your letterlibtech_629_footnoteof 14th June and also your letter of 26th of July 	sent with Shri Kumaramangalam.  	Your answer to my first question provokes further question for your 	reply. I understand that although the chief actors among the Allied 	powers are by no means inclined towards real democracy, you think 	that by the time the war ends, their designs will be confounded and 	that the people all the world over will suddenly find  	self-expression and overthrow the present leaders. In the peoples, 	according to answer, I am entitled to include us, other Asiatics and 	Negroes, for that matter perhaps, also the proletariat of Japan and 	Germany. If such is your belief, I must confess that I do not share 	it but I keep myself open to conviction. Meanwhile I suggest that 	the title ‘people’s war’ is highly misleading. It enables the 	Government in India to claim that at least one popular party 	considers this as people’s war. I suggest, too, that Russia’s 	limited alliance with the Allied powers cannot by any stretch of 	imagination convert what was before an imperialistic war against 	that Nazi combine, into a people’s war.  	Holding the view I do, it is superfluous for me now to answer your 	argument that “this war has split the world into two camps”. 	Between Scylla and Charybdis, if I sail in either direction, I 	suffer shipwreck. Therefore I have to be in the midst of the storm. 	I suggested a way out. Naturally it has been rejected because the 	powers that be do not want to relax their grip on India. As I am 	composing this letter to you, I have read and re-read your argument. 	Every paragraph offends; for, to me, it lacks reality. Please 	believe me that my prejudice against your party has nothing to do 	with my examination of your answer to the first question.  Q. 2. Your answer, as far 	as it goes, I hold to be completely satisfactory. I will not ask you 	for further proof about your finances. After I have dealt with your 	answers, I will put my difficulties before    
 you. Your answers to the other questions do not admit of a categorical reply. I understand your answers and appreciate them too. If I was free from prejudices, I would have no hesitation in accepting your answers.libtech_630_footnoteBut my difficulty is real and I ask for your sympathy. When I make the admission that I have prejudices, it is an appeal to you to have patience with me and to disarm my prejudices in the best manner you can. I can only give you my assurance that I am ready to see anybody you want me to see, to read anything you want me to read and to examine every argument or fact produced by you as dispassionately as I can. I give you this further assurance that I have not acted upon my prejudice, nor shall I do so, unless the prejudices harden into a confirmed belief that your party represents a force of evil and is really an obstacle in the way of the fight for freedom. I am not likely to have that belief easily and, if I have it, you shall have ample notice so as to enable you to wean me from it. I know your worth. You have very able young men and women, as selfless as I would claim to be. You are all hard working and possess great energy and you impose strict discipline on your workers. All this I prize and admire. I would not easily lose such a force because of any preconceived notions of mine.
 If I have been inordinately long in dealing with your answers which you sent me so promptly, it was because, as you are aware, I was preoccupied and also because I was examining the evidence that was pouring in upon me unsolicited against your party.libtech_631_footnoteI asked them to let me use their names and they have given me the permission. I take the latest first, i.e., Babu Manoranjan Chaudhary. I did not even know that he was coming and when he did ask for an appointmentlibtech_632_footnote, it was in connection with my acceptance of the Rajaji Formulalibtech_633_footnote. Butreally he took the greater part of my time to tell me that the communists had done great injury to the national cause. I am using a milder term than

The printed book can be seen by any deputy you may choose to send. Probably you have seen it yourself.libtech_636_footnote
 The other is Sjt. Kaleswara Rao of Bezwada. He also sent me a long letter from which I quote the salient passageslibtech_637_footnote(see enclosurelibtech_638_footnote). Add to this the numerous letters I have received from correspondents, known and unknown, all impeaching the party. I understand, too, that Shri Jayaprakash Narayan is also ‘disillusioned’.
 You  have  referred   me   to   Mian   Iftikharuddinlibtech_639_footnoteand   Shaukat Ansari, both of whom I know well and for whom I have great regard. Unfortunately Iftikharuddin is in jail. I have never talked about Communism to Shaukat, because I know him and his wife Zohra apart from their politics. But no general assurance from them will obliterate the evidence that has forced itself upon me and of which I have given you a bird’s-eye view. I will ask you not to dismiss all this evidence as so much prejudice. I would ask you not to be angry with your critics, however ignorant they may be. You will have legitimate cause for anger, if their criticism is malicious and conceived with  a  hostile intent. Lastly, I ask you to believe me that I want to impress the services of every one of you for the cause of independence to be fought along the lines that I have chalked out for myself and the whole country. And if I am convinced that I am going astray and that yours is the correct method, I would like to be won over by you

 Mr. Amery knows better, but it is convenient for him to brush aside my offerlibtech_642_footnoteby saying that the formula is not even the starting point. Had it not been the starting point, there would not have been all the discussion about my formula that has taken place in the Press.
 Asked if he shared the feeling that the British Government is planning to by-pass the political problem by focussing public attention on economic issues, Gandhiji said:
Imagine the economic regeneration of England if she is
 
 politically subjected to an extraneous power. I can understand theruthless exploitation of the economic resources of India  by  a power that has held her in bondage for over 150 years, but that will not be economic prosperity for India. It will spell economic dejection and political degradation. I am amazed that British statesmen who happen to be ruling India today are not satisfied with the mere rejection of a plan conceived in all honesty, but that they should even suggest that the political question should be shelved during the war and that attention should be concentrated on India’s economic salvationlibtech_643_footnotelibtech_644_footnote.
 The Hindu, 1-8-1944
 "
340,"July 30, 1944",INTERVIEW TO THE PRESS,"
    
 PANCHGANI,
 July 30, 1944
 I have noticed this.libtech_645_footnotelibtech_646_footnoteIt has caused me pain as also amazement that the representatives of the British nation, who have a long and distinguished record of heroic fight for political freedom, should divorce the economic development of India from political subjection and give the former preference over the latter. To me it looks like putting the cart before the horse, and I have not yet seen any horse performing the trick of pushing the cart with its nose. It was, therefore, a pleasure to find two noted industrialists, Mr. J. R. D. Tata and Sir Homi Mody, summarily rejecting the idea put forth in the House of Commons and holding out, I suppose, from bitter experience, that the economic development of India was dependent upon the solution of the political deadlock, in other words a proper national government functioning at the Centre. I suppose they had in mind the gigantic concessions that have been made during recent years to British monopolists. They must have had in mind also the  strangling  of Indian enterprise. What can, therefore, happen without a national government is not the economic development of India, but its exploitation and degradation.
 
 
 Members of the House of Commons, not knowing the realities in India, may philosophize and talk of the immediate importance of economic development. I wish they can see what is going on today inIndia. I have no shadow of doubt in my mind that the Bengal famine, as also famines in other parts of India, were man-made and not God-made. I need not impugn the honesty of the rulers who have been sent out to India from Britain.
 I hold that in spite of all the honesty that the British rulers can summon to their assistance, it is impossible for them to get behind the Indian skin and know the real disease. The consensus of opinion in the House of Commons, therefore, is for me a terrible pointer. It confirms me in my opinion that the “Quit India” resolution was no hasty cry conceived in anger. To put the same in parliamentary language, it demands that India must be now governed by Indians chosen by her own people—not a coterie but the whole mass of the people without distinction of race, creed or colour. It is unfortunate that the House of Commons has once more missed the opportunity of making the issue between the Allied powers and the Axis powers a real issue of democracy versus autocracy, or the exploitation of classes or nations by a class or a nation armed to the teeth. My offer presented that issue in the clearest possible language that I could command. It was presented on behalf of all the exploited nations and races of the earth. It is a great pity that the Lords and the Commons have turned down my offer. The Allies will have their victory, but the exploited races will not feel the glow of it. They will know that the seeds of another and deadlier war will be sown by that very victor. I ask myself the question: ‘Must rivers of blood flow for such an empty victory?’
 Asked when he expected to meet Mr. Jinnah, Mahatma Gandhi said:
 I expect to meet the Qaid-e-Azam as soon as he wants me, of course,  health  permitting.   The   publication   of   the   Formulalibtech_647_footnoteis  in pursuit of negotiations for a communal settlement. It is not an idle effort. It is conceived in all sincerity. It is  unfortunate  that  the criticism that has been levelled against it, so far as I can see, has been conceived out of prejudice or careless study of the Formula. Nor is it an offer on the part of any party. It is a contribution from two life-servants of the nation towards the solution of the communal tangle, which has hitherto defied solution. It is in open invitation to all
 
 parties to apply their minds to the solution. The Rajaji Formula is intended as a help to all lovers of the country. It is the best we could conceive, but it is open to amendment, as it is open to rejection or acceptance.
 Gandhiji told that British Government’s rejection of the offer does not affect the Rajaji Formula in anyway whatsoever. As far as he remembered, Gelder did notthe proposal, and, if he did, he must have got it from Rajaji and not from him.libtech_648_footnote
 In a way the rejection of my offer for the resolution of the political deadlock enables all parties to concentrate their attention on communal settlement. Whilst I had said and repeat that the presence of a third party effectively prevents a solution, it was never meant to convey that I would make no attempt at an honourable solution, even while the third party continued to dominate this land of ours. No one will be more pleased than I, if we can pull through a solution which satisfied all parties.
 To a reporter who asked if Mahatma Gandhi would advocate Congressmen going back to jail in view of the British Government’s rejection of his proposals, Mahatma Gandhi said:
 Have you ever known any sane person without any cause going to jail, or after discharge going back to jail? But a person who holds his self-respect or his country’s liberty dearer than life itself invites suffering even unto death in defending either and, in that process, if jail comes his way, he welcomes it. The question, therefore, should be addressed to the Government: ‘When do you propose to take back to jail those whom you have released?’ I know that Government are not going to oblige you by answering your question.

350,"August 	2, 1944",INTERVIEW TO “DAILY WORKER”,"
           BOMBAY, 
  August 	2, 1944  Q. 	You promise all aid to the Allied war effort.libtech_662_footnoteHow concretely will 	the character and quantity of the war effort in India and other 	countries be changed through the establishment of a national 	government in India?  Mahatma 	Gandhi replied that the question required a detailed answer, whereas 	the basis of his offer was to give moral weight to the Allied cause. 	This the cause lacked at present.  Asked 	to explain what he meant by “adding moral weight to the Allied 	cause”, Mahatma Gandhi said: The	Allies 	  are	today	making	brave	declarations	about  	democracy and liberty which to me, or, to put it plainly, to the 	exploited nations, mean nothing. Mere declarations, pleasing to the 	ear, can give no satisfaction to the sufferers. By “the exploited  	nations” I mean the Asiatics and Africans. If the Allies are 	fighting for democracy, their democracy should include all the 	exploited races of the earth. Facts, as I see them, prove the 	contrary. Almost all, if not all, parties agree that India was never 	so much under foreign domination as it is today.  	A clear acceptance of the Indian demand for independence and the 	consequent establishment of a national responsible government, 	subject to the limitations I have mentioned, would immediately 	change the character of the Allied cause. It will be immediately 	differentiated from the cause of the Axis Powers, if the latter’s 	fight can  be described as a cause.  What 	material gain will accrue to the Allies from the recognition of 	India as an independent country, subject to the provision accepted 	by you? I 	must refuse to descend from the platform I occupy. Surely, if  	the character of the Allied cause is so radically altered, as I 	claim it must be by the acceptance of my offer, all else must follow 	as a matter of course. But whether it does or not, I want the 	acceptance of my offer to be on the unadulterated moral basis. It 	should be enough for the Allies to have the guarantee that their 	military operations will not, in   any  way,  be   adversely  	affected  by  India  being  counted   as an    
 independent nation, not merely in word but in fact.
 I hold that the effect of the declaration of India’s independence, accompanied by simultaneous sincere action, should, by itself, take the wind out of the sails of the Axis Powers. And I should be surprised if they do not capitulate almost immediately on the declaration.
 Suppose England was under foreign rule today, like India, and the ruling power was engaged in a war with some other nation or nations, and involved England willy-nilly in the war. Suppose further that the foreign power suddenly declared England independent without the latter having put up an armed fight for freedom, would not every Englishman enthusiastically support the erstwhile foreign ruler, now turned a friendly power? You can now understand what will happen to India if, when Britain is in sight of victory, she were to declare the independence of India.
 Having said all this to elucidate my answer, I wish to suggest that my offer furnishes a basis for honourable negotiation and release of the members of the Congress Working Committee. A discussion of details and filling in the gaps, deliberately left in my offer, must  follow as a matter of course.
 The correspondent then told him that the Tory Press in Britain confuses the people by stating that “Gandhi still adheres to the ‘Quit India’ resolutionlibtech_663_footnote.’’ They exploit the fact that the British people are unaware of the burning anti-Fascist and patriotic content of the resolution. The correspondent asked him to clarify his statement that the resolution was “innocuouslibtech_664_footnote”.
 The whole of the resolution is a noble document. The ‘Quit India’ slogan is an innocuous and natural cry. The sting was in the sanction clause of the resolution authorizing me to offer mass civil disobedience in the event of the rejection of the national demand. As I have said, my authority has lapsed, and even if it has not, I cannot organize mass civil disobedience at the present moment. Therefore, the resolution should be read without the sanction clause, and I challenge anybody to take exception to a single word in that resolution. ‘Quit India’, read together with the Congress offer that the Allied operations on the Indian soil might continue, means nothing more and nothing less than that the British rule should end in its
 
 entirety, even while the war is going on—if the war is merely for the deliverance of the exploited nations of the earth.
 The correspondent next reminded him of his statement that the Cripps offerlibtech_665_footnotecontemplated almost perpetual vivisection of India and asked him what it meant. Mahatma Gandhi smiled and said:
Surely it can mean only one thing. The Cripps offer divided

 We do not think Gandhiji would make any such admission. Has he not said that every art would be richer for the artist spinning? Gandhiji would accept the Poet’s offering for what it is worth but he would accept nothing as a substitute for hand spinning.

 MY DEAR BARDOLOI,
 I have your letter. I have read the papers and I have had long chats with the friends. I will not, because I cannot, give specific instructions. But I would lay down general principles to guide you. There should never be the slightest departure from truth and non-violence. There should be perfect fearlessness. There should be no secrecy, and there should be complete non-co-operation with evil. Thus under the lure of saving starving people I may not co-operate with evil even as I may not pour milk in a poison bowl in the hope of feeding the poor.
 The Bihar example will mislead if not properly understood. I co-operated and spent the money that was collected. There were two parallel collections. Ours was the biggest and best spent. Today there is no such scope. Do not think of the past except to learn lessons from it.
Love.

RAMASWAMIlibtech_682_footnote","
           SEVAGRAM, 
  [On or after August 3, 1944]libtech_683_footnote  	Re-organization of the villages is a very intricate problem, but if 	we can find even half a dozen workers of the right type, we can 	solve it in due time. The time factor is important, but given the 	right start the thing will grow like a snowball. You have heard of 	Booker T. Washington. We have to produce better workers than even 	him in order to achieve our object.  	As for you, your ambition will be fulfilled if, besides  your 	ability and enthusiasm, you introduce something else in your life, 	i.e., a living faith in God. Then all insipidity will vanish. A 	cosmopolitanlibtech_684_footnoteoutlook 	is a necessity but it can never be a substitute for God. God is 	there, but our conception of God is limited by our mental horizon 	and by our physical environment. For instance, when you read the 	Bible, you find that the God of the Hebrews was quite different from 	the God of Jesus Christ. You are dissatisfied with the prevalent 	idea about God for the simple reason that those who profess belief 	in God do not present a living God in their own lives.  	Unless you have a living faith in God to sustain you, when failure 	stares you in the face, there is disappointment for you. You may 	develop a revulsion for the work that you have taken up. You may 	begin to feel that after all what Dr. Ambedkar said was the right 	thing and you made a mistake in rejecting the high posts which you 	had been offered. My advice to you is that you should not leave this 	Ashram till you have found God. In spite of my limitless failings I 	am a seeker after Truth and so are my companions in this place. The 	Ashram, apart from its inhabitants, the sum total of energy that it 	represents, the principles for which it stands, may enable you to 	know God to the extent that you may be able to say ‘God is’, 	just as you can say ‘Truth is’.  RAMASWAMI: 	I can say that in the sense that Truth is the antithesis of      
 falsehood.
 GANDHIJI: That is good enough. The seers have described God as “ Neti, neti” (‘Not this, not this’). Truth will elude you. The sum total of all that is true is Truth. But you can’t sum up all that is true. Like most of those who have had Western education, you have got an analytical mind. But there are things that can’t be analysed. God who can be analysed by my poor intellect won’t satisfy me. Therefore I do not try to analyse Him. I go behind the relative to the absolute and I get my peace of mind.
 R. I have carefully gone through your writings in the Harijan and Young India . Your way of life appeals to me very much. It offers scope for the exercise of individual will. The idea of God introduces a determinism and that limits man. It interferes with his free will.
G. Is there such a thing as free will? Where is it? We are mere
playthings in the hands of Providence.
 R. What is the relationship between God and man, between-Truth and God?
 G. I used to say ‘God is Truth’. That did not completely satisfy me. So I said ‘Truth is God’. He and His law are not different. God’s law is God Himself. To interpret it man has to resort to intense prayer and merge himself in God. Each one will interpret the same in his or her own way. As for the relationship between man and God, man does not become man by virtue of havinglibtech_685_footnotetwo hands. He becomes man by becoming a tabernacle of God.
 R. When my idea of God itself is not clear, your talk of man becoming a tabernacle of God makes things still more confusing. . . .
 G. Yet it is the true conception Unless we have the realization that the body is the house of God, we are less than men. And where is the difficulty or confusion in conceiving Truth as God? You will concede that we are not tabernacles of Untruth; we are of Truthlibtech_686_footnote.
 Everyone who wants to live a true life has to face difficulties in life, some of which appear insurmountable. At that time it is faith in God, that is, Truth alone, that will sustain you. The fellow-feeling which makes you feel miserable because of your brother’s misery is godliness. You may call yourself an atheist, but so long as you feel akin with mankind you accept God in practice. I remember of
 
 clergymen who came to the funeral of the great atheist Bradlaughlibtech_687_footnote. They said they had come to pay their homage because he was a godly man.
 If you go back with a living faith in God, in Truth, I have no doubt that your work will flourish. You should feel dissatisfied with everything till you have found Him and you will find Him.libtech_688_footnote

 [On or after August 3, 1944]libtech_690_footnote
 FRIEND: If you pray to  God,  can  He  intervene  and  set  aside  the  law  for your sake?
GANDHIJI: God’s law remains unaltered but since that very law
 says that every action has a result, if a person prays, his prayer is bound to produce an unforeseeable result in terms of His law.	libtech_691_footnote
 But do you know the God to whom you pray?
No, I don’t.
 To whom shall we pray then?
 To the God whom we do not know—we do not always know the person to whom we pray.
 Maybe, but the person to whom we pray is knowable.
 So is God; and since He is knowable, we search. It may take a billion years before we find Him. What does it matter? So, I say, even if you do not believe, you must continue to pray, i.e., search. “Help thou my unbelief” is a verse from the Bible to be remembered. But it is not right to ask such questions. You must have infinite patience, and inward longing. Inward longing obviates all such questions. “Have faith and you will be whole” is another tip from the Bible.
 
 When I look at nature around me, I say to myself, there must be one Creator, one God and to Him I should pray.
That again is reasoning. God is beyond reason. But I have
nothing to say if your reason is enough to sustain you.

  	Your letter is very good. But why with a pencil? Now that your 	tonsils have been removed, won’t you put on some flesh?  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	the Gujarati original: Mrs. Sumitra Kulkarni Papers. Courtesy: Nehru 	Memorial Museum and Library         [On or before August 4, 1944]libtech_694_footnote  	Organizing yourself, you will achieve success. This is the message 	of Gurudev. Make this message your motto.  The 	Hindu, 6-8-1944         SEVAGRAM,  August 	5, 1944  	Many Congressmen ask me how to celebrate the forthcoming 9th of 	August. That date was a turning point in India’s fight for 	freedom. I had intended to spend 9th August, 1942 in peaceful 	introspection and to inaugurate negotiations for a settlement. But 	the Government or Fate had decided otherwise. The Government went 	mad, and so did some people. Sabotage and the like were resorted to      
 and many things were done in the Congress name or in my name. I am aware that I do not represent the Congress mind always. Many Congressmen repudiate my non- violence. The Working Committee is the only body  which can legitimately and truly  represent  the Congress.
 As an old servant of the country, however, I can advise, and Congressmen are at liberty to treat my advice as instructions. I have already saidlibtech_695_footnotethat mass civil disobedience cannot be offered now; but mass civil disobedience is one thing and individual action in defence of self-respect and liberty is wholly another. It is a universal duty for all time, the discharge of which requires no sanction save that of one’s own conscience. In a previous note, I have pointed out when and where the duty arises. But the forthcoming 9th is a special occasion.
 There has arisen much misunderstanding about the Congress purpose and mind. I must avoid all avoidable risks. Therefore, in all places except in Bombay, my advice is not to disregard special police prohibitions for that day. For Bombay, I have already given advice through the Mayor of Bombay. I need not reiterate the advice here. I have selected Bombay as the most suitable place for the simple reason that it is most easily accessible to me and is the place where the  historic meeting of August 1942 was held. Whatever it is to be, it will be a symbolic act. Curiosity is natural and pardonable, but I plead for restraint. The self-imposed curb will be finished if I succeed  in carrying conviction to the human family, that every man or woman, however weak in body, is the guardian of his or her self-respect and liberty. This defence avails, though the whole world may be against the individual resister.
 I have suggested the present symbolic procedure to see whether those who organize the demonstration have co-operation from the local public. Freedom of 400 million people through  purely non-violent effort is not to be gained without learning the virtue of iron discipline, not imposed from without, but sprung naturally from within. Without the requisite discipline non-violence can only be a veneer.
 The second thing that I should like done on the forthcoming 9th August is for those who have gone underground to discover themselves. They can do so by informing the authorities of their
 
 movements and whereabouts or by simply and naturally doing their work in the open without any attempt to evade or elude the police. To go underground is to elude the police. Therefore, real discovery is to discover oneself to the party eluded. Nothing should be done unless the conviction has gone home that a particular action is essential for the cause. In the absence of such a conviction, those who see this note may ignore it and should follow what they consider best for the country.
 What everyone should do on the 9th, whether they have the conviction as to nonviolence or not, or whether they are Congressmen or not, is to carry out on the 9th the whole or any part of the fourteenfold   programme   reiterated   in   my   recent   notelibtech_696_footnote.   Just   for example, everyone should spin. Communities should find ways of giving expression to mutual understanding and brotherhood. Hindus and Muslims may organize joint programmes of prayers—God may bless the Quaid-e-Azam and me with wisdom to reach a common understanding in the interest of India. Hindus should visit Harijans and render them the service they may need. The spirit of service and helpfulness should pervade the atmosphere everywhere.
 I have experienced friendliness from Englishmen  and Americans wherever I have met them, whether officials or laymen. I invite their co-operation especially on the 9th. Let them realize that the August resolution was not conceived in hatred. It was an unvarnished statement of the natural right of the people of this land.
 To those who share my faith I would advise fasting and prayers on the auspicious day. This must not be a mechanical act. It must be done without ostentation, for self-purification and penance. Its uplifting power is capable of being tested by every individual for himself.
 If the demonstration is carried out in the spirit in which I have conceived it, I have no doubt that it will lead to an early end of the misery of the masses.

 past you had said: “Partition means a patent untruth. My whole soul rebels against the idea          To assent to such a doctrine is for me denial of God (Harijan,  13-4-1940).libtech_712_footnote
 The partition proposal has altered the face of the Hindu-Muslim problem. I have called it  an  untruth. There can be  no  compromise with it.       It cannot come by
 honourable agreement (Harijan, 4-5-1940).libtech_713_footnoteI consider vivisection of India to be a sin. . . . ( Harijan, 24-5-1942) .”libtech_714_footnoteWould you kindly enlighten me how they are consistent? The Mahasabhaites seem to argue in the above style and hence clarification is sought.
ANSWER: Though I would avoid answering all questions on the
 subject before the forthcoming meeting between Quaid-e-Azam and me, I must not postpone answering yours. I know my present attitude has puzzled and pained many people. I have not revised the opinion quoted by you. At the same time that I made the statement you refer to, I was also a party to the self-determination resolution of the A. I.
 C. C. I hold that the Rajaji Formula gives effect to that resolution. I would however urge critics not to mind my inconsistencies, so-called or real. Let them examine the question on merits and bless the effort if they can.
 Q. What is your reaction to Mr. Jinnah’s speechlibtech_715_footnote? If Mr. Jinnah does not accept your proposal or your talks with him end in failure, will you withdraw your support to Rajaji’s proposals or will the proposals stand?
A. I do not believe in dying before my death. I do not approach
 the forthcoming visit with the expectation of failure. I always hope for the best and prepare for the worst. I would therefore ask you not to anticipate failure. Ask me when failure stares you and me in the face.
 
 
 Q. What have you got to say to the Sikhs who have expressed apprehension in the All-Party Sikh Conference at [Amritsar]libtech_716_footnotethat you will further surrender to the Muslim League?
A. My Sikh friends are unnecessarily perturbed. I can settle
 nothing for anybody but myself. The Congress Resolution is a sacred trust and I have no doubt that it will be discharged fully. Brave people are never frightened by bogeys. Let the Sikh friends examine the proposal on merits. And if they find an evident flaw in it, I shall correct it and so, I am sure, will the Quaid-e-Azam if he is satisfied that there is a flaw.

 August 8, 1944
 The question asked is whether my statement contemplates civil disobedience or its avoidance. It asserts a universal right which becomes a duty when there is an attack upon its ordinary exercise. It therefore contemplates civil disobedience if Government wants it. Twenty-five citizens of Bombay sent notices on the 3rd instant to the Police Commissioner of their intention to march in batches of five and offer silent prayers and sing Jhandavandan and Vandemataram at a common gathering place and asked for permission to perform the act.libtech_723_footnotelibtech_724_footnoteIf permission is not granted, there will certainly be disobedience. In order that the public may not know the time or place, the Police Commissioner has been fully informed, while the public has not been. If this extraordinary forbearance is not appreciated and the authorities withhold permission and interfere with the simple symbolic exercise of a public right, the fault would be that of the authorities. The Press and the public have to judge whether, under circumstances such as these, civil disobedience does not become a duty.

DEAR RAJA SAHEB,
 Gandhiji has your letter of 16th inst.
 Your argument is built partly on fallacy and partly on disregard of facts. Acceptance of the C.R. formula by Gandhiji concedes nothing but the insistent demand of the minorities for self-determination. It carries no other implication. Far from absolving the seceding units from ‘moral obligation’ to give their support to [the] freedom movement, it lays down that the separation can only come after attainment of complete independence with [the] co-operation of those who claim the right to secede. Further, it stipulates the creation of a special machinery for the joint administration of matters of common concern to the two sovereign states such as defence, foreign affairs, railways, currency, economic planning, etc. The provision embodying this arrangement will be an integral part of the charter for separation.
 Nationalist Muslims are not let down by the formula, since they were parties to the self-determination resolution of the Working Committee that met at
 Delhi in April, 1942.
 The need for them to stand by their principles will be even greater under independence. That will be the real testing time for them.
 Yours sincerely,

         DEAR 	SIR,  SEVAGRAM,  August 	9, 1944 
  	With reference to your letter of 2nd inst., since the Oxford 	University Press is not conducted for profit, I should think that a 	net profit being stipulated for, there should be no objection to a 	minimum profit. The only inducement to the Navajivan Trust, and  for 	 that matter also for me, to have a well-known concern like  yours 	publishing Shri R. K. Prabhu’s compilation can be to acquire the 	widest publicity possible outside India for it.  	The Navajivan Press exists only  for  printing  writings  like Shri 	Prabhu’s compilation as cheaply as possible for Indian readers. 	The object therefore undoubtedly is to publish an edition as cheap 	as possible and certainly cheaper than yours. Therefore it would be 	improper to hold over publication of such an Indian edition till 	your stock is exhausted. If you rely chiefly on Indian sales, I 	think the contemplated publication by you might be dropped. Labours 	of the authors will not go unrewarded in any case. I will ask the 	Navajivan Trust to cover them and publish their compilation whenever 	they are in a position to do so.libtech_725_footnote  Yours 	sincerely,    THE 	GENERAL 	MANAGER 	OXFORD 	UNIVERSITY 	PRESS 	POST 	BOX 	31  BOMBAY  From 	a copy : Pyarelal Papers.

 DEAR KATJUJI,
 I had your letter of 24th July which I placed before Bapuji.
 By the time this reaches you you will have seen the summary of Bapu’s recent talk with Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherji—not the United Press summary that has appeared in the Bombay Chronicle of the 7th August, but the authentic and authorised version. . . .
 Gandhiji cannot and will not be party to an arrangement which implies freedom to wage war against India and imperil her defence. “That would be sin”, and it cannot be had by ‘agreement’. That would be a contradiction in terms.

DESAIlibtech_727_footnote","
           WARDHAGANJ, 
  August 	10, 1944  	August l5 is the second anniversary of Mahadev Desai’s death. Two 	or three correspondents have administered a gentle rebuke. The 	following is my paraphrase of the first of their remarks:  	You have become President of the Kasturba Memorial Fund Trust. 	Mahadev renounced everything for your sake and even laid down his 	life for you. He died at a much younger age than Kasturba and yet 	how much he achieved in that relatively short space of time! 	Kasturba was verily a sati, but while India has produced many 	satis, all will admit that it has produced only one Mahadev. 	If he had not chosen to throw in his lot with you, he might have 	been living today. His talents would have enabled him to achieve 	front rank distinction as a savant and man of letters. He might have 	even been rich, brought up his family in all material comfort and 	provided his son with the highest education. Instead, he chose to 	merge himself in you. You regarded him as your son. May I ask what 	you have done for him?  	These sentiments seem to me to be natural. The contrast between the 	two is too striking to be missed. The one was ready to drop off like 	a fully ripe fruit. The other had yet to ripen and mature. Life 	still lay before Mahadev as ordinary standards go. He had aimed at 	living up to a hundred years. The amount of material that he had 	piled up in his voluminous note-books called for years of patient 	labour to work up and he had hoped to do all that. In his trunk was 	found a memo of my talks taken down on the day previous to his final 	end. Probably, none besides myself can today make them out, and even 	I don’t know to what use he would have put them. He was a living 	example of “the wise, who live and work as if they were born to 	immortality and everlasting youth”.libtech_728_footnoteBut,  if  all  our  dreams  could  be  realized,  	life would become a phantasmagoria, and there would be utter chaos 	on      themselves 	to learning and worldly welfare as if they were immortal and would 	never grow old, and follow the path of dharma as if Death had seized 	them by the hair.” 
 earth. God in His mercy, therefore, has ordained that His will alone should prevail on earth.
 Mahadev, though an idealist and a dreamer, never allowed his feet to be taken off the firm earth. He, therefore, adorned everything that he attempted. To Mahadev’s admirers, I can only offer this consolation, that he lost nothing by his association with  me. His dreams rose above scholarship or learning. Riches had no attraction for him. God had blessed him with high intellect and versatile tastes but what his soul thirsted for was the devotional spirit. Even before he came to me, he had assiduously sought and cultivated the company of devotees and men of God after his heart. One may say that it was in furtherance of this quest that he came to me and, not obtaining full satisfaction even with me, (shall I say) he turned his back upon me in the fullness of youth, leaving behind him his weeping relations and friends, and set forth to seek realization of his quest in the bosom of his Maker. The only fitting service that I can render his memory is to complete the work which he has left behind him unfinished, and to make myself worthy of his devotion—obviously a more difficult task than merely raising a fund for his memorial. It can be fulfilled only through Divine grace. Mahadev’s external goal was the attainment of swaraj; the inner, to fully realize in his own person his ideal of devotion, and if possible to share the same with others.libtech_729_footnote
 The raising of a material memorial to the deceased’s memory is outside my scope. That is a task for his friends and admirers to take up. Does a father initiate a memorial for his son? I was not responsible for   the   Kasturba   Memorial.   In   my   previous   statementlibtech_730_footnotelibtech_731_footnoteI   have explained its origin. I have become the President of the Committee only in order to ensure the use of the fund in accordance with its object. If friends and admirers of Mahadev similarly set up a  committee to raise a memorial fund and invite me to become its president and give guidance for its proper use, I shall gladly accept it.libtech_732_footnote
 A word to litterateurs. They know or should know that he put the charkha above literature. He took delight in spinning for hours. It was a daily duty. He would encroach upon his sleeping hours to finish
 
 his daily minimum of spinning. Why this insistence? Not, I assure them, to please me. He threw in his lot with me after much deliberation. I never knew him do a thing without conviction. He thought with me that the material salvation of India’s teeming but famishing millions was bound up with the charkha. He discovered too that this daily labour with the hand enriched whatever literary work he did. It gave it a reality which it otherwise lacked. The raising of funds is good and necessary. But a sincere imitation of Mahadev’s constructive work is better. The monetary contribution to a memorial fund ought not to be a substitute for the more solid appreciation.

  August 	11, 1944  	I am writing to you in my mother tonguelibtech_733_footnotewhich I believe you will tolerate.  	The Congress policy has been definite and determined. With this 	nothing can be mixed. An independent India cannot entertain any 	other stranger in its midst. The consent which I have given to a 	particular scheme depends upon the fact that it is based on a 	cardinal principle of the Congress.libtech_734_footnoteI command an influence over the masses and therefore 	I cannot hide that which I consider against the good of my country.

To remove this fear, the way lies in freely but respectfully 	expressing our opinion and only in this way can we conquer and win; 	this is my respectful opinion. Permit me to tell you that no 	particular work of mine has resulted in any loss to my country. At 	least I have never heard that it has. All your writings, I have read 	with great patience and care but I have always felt that you do not 	examine my side with patience and care. Your time is occupied mostly 	in different types of work and this is not beyond my constant 	thought. In 	the end it seems to me that the substance of your letters leads     
 to the inference that India is going to be for very long time under the rule and sway of the English. From your writings this appears to be India’s destiny. But my firm belief is quite the opposite of this. Moreover you crush our spirit and make us appear blind. Our leaders also forget this fundamental difference in our views.

 self-determination. After this on April  30libtech_746_footnote,  Rajaji’s  Resolution  was turned down and Jagat Narayan’s Resolutionlibtech_747_footnoteabout not partitioning India was adopted. In my view this was a highly inappropriate and hasty step and due to this alone Jinnah has been able to spread poison in the Muslim masses.
  I had discussed this matter with Maulanalibtech_748_footnotelibtech_749_footnotealso. According to him, 	in spite 	of Jagat 	Narayan’s Resolution, I 	still retain the 	authority to 	discuss the matter with Jinnah because the Resolution of April 2 	still stands.  Later 	on when 	I had 	negotiations with Jinnah 	I had 	asked him 	whether he would 	accept help from a 	foreign Power if 	he was granted 	a sovereign 	State. To this 	he said: “Yes.” 
 I then asked him if, after securing that help, he would invade India. To this (also) he said: “Yes.”
 Then I told him: “It would be a sin to do such a thing and I cannot be a party to it.”
  When Dr. Latiflibtech_750_footnotelibtech_751_footnotementioned Pakistan I asked him to discuss the 	question with 	Maulana; but 	it was 	in deference 	to Maulana’s 	wish that 	I discussed it with him.  Rajaji’s 	offer does not 	seem to have the 	virulence of his 	earlier talk 	and hence 	I am 	in agreement with 	it. According 	to this 	offer if there 	can be 	a separate treaty 	regarding Defence, 	Foreign Affairs 	and Communications, 	I do 	not see any harm in 	giving him 	the rest. And after this, Pakistan seems to have no meaning at all.  It 	is not that everybody 	has been in 	agreement with 	me about 	everything from 	the beginning of 	[my] life. 	There is bound 	to be a 	difference of 	opinion and 	it is good 	that it is there. 	But nobody 	has ever 	told me that 	I have 	done anything in 	bad faith. 	Thus it 	was that I 	had won over Motilallibtech_752_footnotelibtech_753_footnote, C. R. Das and others. In spite of difference of opinion 	they often came to 	me and shed 	tears when they saw my 
 
 determination to abide by Truth. From his death-bed C. R. Das had enjoined upon his followers: “Do as this man says. He is a true leader.” I wish to conquer even Jinnah with trust and love. I have no other weapons at all.
  Jinnah 	too has complete 	faith in me. 	He knows 	that I 	have no 	axe to grind 	in these 	negotiations. And 	he seems 	to have 	somewhat softened by my last letterlibtech_754_footnotelibtech_755_footnote, and hence, my only advice can be that at such 	a time 	nobody should create any 	obstacle. Jinnah 	has hated 	me since 	the day I 	asked him 	in a 	meeting to 	give up 	English and 	speak in 	Gujarati. Sir 	Chimanlal Setalvad also 	feels the 	same way about me 	from that day and it has not changed to this day.  Jinnah 	is definitely 	not unselfish. 	He is prone 	to be easily 	led by 	others because of 	his vanity. 	(Just) because I am 	going to 	meet him 	 I am 	not led away by 	him. I 	have not accepted 	everything that he 	has said. Otherwise it 	would mean that he 	has won me 	round. That is 	why even 	when I meet him it will be with some misgivings.  Munshi 	has raised 	a new 	cry, and I cannot 	stop him. And it 	would not 	befit me 	even if 	I did it.  But 	Munshi very much loves 	to dominate 	everywhere and become a 	leader. I 	know that everybody 	hates him for that 	reason. Everybody 	believes that even in 	the Congress 	he wants 	to set 	up his 	own protagonists. 	But how can one prevent 	a person 	if he is capable 	of spreading 	his influence 	because of his 	own power? Only the 	person who 	has all his teeth intact 	can crack 	a betel-nut 	and so, there 	is no 	need to 	be scared of 	him. He 	seems to 	be much perturbed.

 August 12, 1944
 BHAI RAMESHWARDAS,
 I have been wanting since long to write to you but just couldn’t find the time. However, now I must. Jinnah Saheb’s letter may arrive any time now. I have written to him to let me know three or four days in advance. I am under a great deal of pressure that in no case should I put up at Birla House.libtech_765_footnotelibtech_766_footnoteI have plainly said that I cannot give up staying at Birla House without any reason. The question arises only if for some reason my stay at Birla House is deemed improper. In that case you should not hesitate to tell me. This issue arose in Poona also, and at that time it was agreed that there could be no hesitation from your side. I do not remember if you were present then. I had discussed the matter with Ghanshyamdas. By way of caution and in order to safeguard your interests, it is my duty to ask you now that I will be leaving for Bombay shortly.
 The other matter is more important though it is not as urgent as the question of where to stay in Bombay. If I am about to be arrested it will give me some satisfaction if I am able to accomplish all that I must before my arrest. I believe that the work of the Talimi Sanghlibtech_767_footnotelibtech_768_footnoteis quite valuable, and I wish to arrange for half a lakh of rupees for it.
 I wish to return the money that was received as donation for Mirabehn. It would only be proper to return it to her. Normally the money for the Talimi Sangh must be drawn from the Satyagraha Ashram funds. There is some money there but Narandas has invested
 
 it in constructive work. I can draw upon it but I can only do so at the cost of that work. And as far as possible I don’t want to do that. All told, it may require half a lakh or one lakh. I do not know the exact amount that has to be paid. The amounts that have been coming over the years are registered as charities, and it takes time to trace them out. All the books of the Ashram are lying here and there. To trace out such amounts even from well-maintained ledgers is like seeking a needle in a haystack. Nevertheless I have given instructions that all such accounts should be examined.
 There is some miscellaneous expenditure too. Something has to be done about that. That will require about half a lakh, though I have not figured out the exact sum.
 Can you easily provide for all this? You can certainly say ‘no’ without any hesitation. All my undertakings are in the hands of God. If God does not wish that a particular work should be held up, He provides me with the means through someone or another as His agent. Hence, even if I do not get the money I will not be angry with God or with you. Till now I have never cut the tree under which I have taken shelter and with God’s grace I shall not do so in future.
 I hope all of you are keeping well. I am sending this letter with Chi. Jagdish. He has come here with Bhai Munshi’s letterlibtech_769_footnote. Nowadays it is difficult to decide what should and what should not be sent by post.

 BHAI GOPICHAND,
 I have read your letter to Pyarelal. Munshiji had been there and he has posted me with news from there.
 What you write about Rajaji is not correct. I have already discussed the matter with Rajaji. Whatever be the case, I am not going to meet himlibtech_770_footnotewith that in mind. To me, Rajaji’s formula is the final
 
 
 thing. If it is proved that there is any fault in it, I can amend it. You at least should not have any fear in your mind. If anybody from Puniab desires to meet me, I shall certainly meet him. For instance people from Bengal were here. Even if I have not been able to satisfy them, at least I have succeeded in removing their feeling of disappointment. In fact my impression is that I have even been able to satisfy them. Even if somebody cannot come here from Punjab, he can certainly write.
You will have recovered your health.

 My reluctance to comment on the Rajaji Formula has led to my attitude being misunderstood by many friends all over the country.
On the whole it is my advice that you should maintain peace till
the conference to be held between us is over.
 BAPU
 I cannot approve of the Rajaji Formula. The division of a Hindu and a Muslim area is conditional in the Formula.	A partition, on  the other hand, will enable the
 Hindus and Muslims in those provinces to settle down in their respective areas.
The second argument does not seem to support the first One.
 My objections to the Rajaji Formula, however, go deeper. The force behind disruptionism is the urge to convert Islam in India into a religio-political party and to dominate the country by overawing the Nationalists into submission. . .
 . Mr. Jinnah’s recent utterances are too fresh to be forgotten easily. He will accept no alliance on a conditional acceptance of Pakistan as in the Formula, and if any is made   it will not last a day after the principle of Pakistan is accepted by the Nationalists.
 These objections are not deeply rooted. If you have no better argument, nothing will be lost by remaining silent.libtech_773_footnote

 SEVAGRAM,
 August 15, 1944 Mahatma Gandhi was in a cheerful mood talking to the deputationists and was smiling throughout. When asked by the Mahatma, Mr. Ibadat Yar Khan explained to
 him about the development that has taken place during the last 20 years, specially the establishment of an engineering college and the foundation of a medical college during the term of Dr. Sir Ziauddin Ahmed, the Vice-Chancellor of the University . . .
 The deputation also discussed the present political situation with the Mahatma and urged for an honourable settlement between the League and the Congress in the forthcoming meeting of the two great leaders of the Hindus and the Muslims. Mr. Gandhi showed his willingness to concede every reasonable demand of the Mussalmans and said:
 I want that myself and the Quaid-e-Azam should be locked up and should not be allowed to come out till we come to some decision to remove this deadlock.
 The members of the deputation again requested him to end the deadlock and see India governed by Indians themselves for which he had been trying for such a long time. Gandhiji replied:
 I wish to see a free India in my lifetime, for God knows what will happen when I am no more.

 BHAI SATIS BABU,
 Received your letter. Balvantsinha  has  well  apprised  me  of your work. I am amazed at your tireless efforts. Isn’t it  your  discovery that cow’s milk is available in so much quantity in Bengal? And that the milkmen are all Muslims! Balvantsinha has become your devotee. I like it. He himself is a goseva enthusiast. He works hard. I have found his knowledge to be haphazard and his outlook is not scientific. He therefore needs guidance. He has strongly refuted this opinion and believes—or had been believing—that I have, maybe unknowingly, done him an injustice. There always has been antagonism between Parnerkarlibtech_781_footnotelibtech_782_footnoteand Balvantsinha and  it  has  always caused me trouble. I was not able to take from them as much work as   I wanted to because of this antagonism. Now Parnerkar is also there and he has got the work of his liking. He also loves to serve the cow. I happily watch from this distance this confluence of the three and also hope that its outcome will be good.
 I have a few minutes during which I am dictating this letter. You must have understood the reason for my giving a little background. I shall be satisfied if both of them remain there and you can take full work from them although both are required here. The work of the goshala here goes on but perhaps it is not satisfactory. I do not at all want either of them to leave your work to come here. Nor do I want both of them to come here. I can have no definite programme. God only knows what will happen. I am reaching Bombay on the 19th. Let

 August 17, 1944
 MAHAVIR PRASAD,
 I do not know whether Ghanshyamdas has told you about my scheme for nature cure. If my ideas can be implemented, I would have used, to the best of my ability, all my God-given talents. These ideas came to me while I was at Dinshaw’s Arogya Bhavanlibtech_788_footnotelibtech_789_footnote. I shall not give a full account of their evolution. Here I am giving you in short the ideas in their final form.
 Select a plot of a thousand acres near any village. It will be better if the land is situated in a salubrious region. It does not matter if the village is far away from a town or the railway station. Select two such plots or at least one. Get a layout of the land made right now— even before purchasing the land. Keep in view the following points while making the plan. Have the roads marked out in the plan. One road shall be broad but right now it will not be made motorable, only bullock-carts or horse-driven carriages will ply on it. The plot must be provided with fresh water. There should be a nice swimming-pool, a gymnasium or two to provide facilities for physical exercise. Arrangement should be made to grow fruits, trees, vegetables and foodgrains. There shall be facilities on this land to treat patients by nature-cure methods. Nature cure will include the various methods of mud-pack, treatment with water, such as hip-bath, friction-bath, steam-bath, etc., treatment with light, such as sun-bath, suryanamaskaralibtech_790_footnotelibtech_791_footnote, moon-bath, watching the stars, utilizing all the lights of the rainbow through the medium of cloth, water, glass bottle, etc., treatment with air such as  pranayamalibtech_792_footnotelibtech_793_footnote, subsisting on air, etc. In the
 
 initial stage, use of modern devices like electricity, etc., will be avoided. This is with a view to initially using mechanical aids to the minimum and developing such devices as the villagers can use easily as also exploring their usefulness. Not only will sick  persons be treated in this institution, but even normal persons likely to benefit from nature cure will be admitted to it. We should try to give vigour and vitality to the weak. Children will be admitted to the institution with this view, and efforts will be made to build their health according to the laws of nature. Health will be our prime concern. Special emphasis will be placed on preservation and improvement of health. Thus the aim of this institution will be self-reliance in all respects and its message will be universal. It will tend to become an ideal village with facilities for basic education and village industries like khadi, etc. Initially it will certainly require a lot of money but I cannot think of a better use of money than this. A trust should be constituted for this purpose. I had thought of Dinshaw Mehta, Ghanshyamdas, and myself as trustees; Ghanshyamdas added two more—Devdas and you. I had of course thought of you but I had no idea how far you could go with this. If I accept your name you should free yourself from all other work and devote yourself to this work. Ghanshyamdas believes in nature cure and he can either attract donations or give one himself. Devdas will fulfil this function by becoming Ghanshyamdas’s representative. I will be the guide—since the whole idea is mine. It can be said that I am a devotee of nature cure for the last fifty years. This venture was conceived with the expectation that Dinshaw could be put in charge of fully implementing the ideas. And I shall like very much your joining this provided you can devote the rest of your life entirely to this work. Meet me at the earliest if you find these ideas good enough.

DURDINlibtech_794_footnote","
    
 [After August 17, 1944]libtech_795_footnote
 Q. Does the Viceroy’s rejectionlibtech_796_footnoteof your offer in any  way  lessen  the desirability of or urgency for a communal settlement now?
A. Not in the least. As I have already said in several interviews
 the simultaneous publication of my offer to the Viceroy and the Rajaji Formula established a wholly unintended connection between the two. The rejection makes the urgency doubly urgent. This I say although I believe that past experience shows that so long as there is a third party dividing communities and interests there is no adjustment possible. This has never meant for me that I should not strive for a settlement even before independence.
 Q. From the point of view of non-violence, is it not preferable for a national government to take office after, rather than during, the present war?
A. Not if a national government comes into being even during
 the war by the spontaneous act of Great Britain or the Allies. For then the war itself will have changed its course and the peace to come will be wholly honourable and calculated to promote non-violence.
 Q. Would not a strong group of nationalist ministers, Hindu and Muslim, responsible under the present constitution to the Viceroy rather than to the Legislature in point of fact, nullify the Viceregal veto? Would not a common front presented by strong nationalist leaders make acceptance of their programme and plans inevitable?
A. No such manipulation can possibly electrify the whole nation.
 Such an experiment is doomed to failure ab initio. It would lack trust on the part of the British Government in the people of India.
 Q. I am not clear on your attitude toward mass civil disobedience. Am I right in thinking that you would consider its use justified if your appeal to the Viceroy and the talks with Mr. Jinnah fail?
A.  Mass civil disobedience can only take place if other efforts to
 
 
 The Free Press Journal.
 achieve the object aimed at fail. Here the object is independence. Appeal to the Viceroy was for a settlement. The appeal having failed the case for civil disobedience is complete. Successful negotiations with the Quaid-e-Azam need not affect the case for civil disobedience. But as I have said—for reasons I need not enter into here but which I have already publicly stated—I may not offer civil disobedience at the present moment. Mass civil disobedience is conceived as an entirely effective substitute for a bloody war and is any day far superior to it. But just as wars do not take place just for the sake of war, but only for a cause just or unjust, mass civil disobedience can take place only for a cause wholly just. If I have understood your question correctly, this answer ought to set at rest all your doubts.
 Q. By American management of a section of the Burma-Assam Railway and part of the port of Calcutta I think we can say that the war in Burma is being shortened. Would a national government permit such American controls?
A. I have already answered the question in my previous public
 statements. Permission for all such controls is clearly indicated under my offer. Of course, it is only for the purpose of the war.
 Q. Would you consider courting rearrest if your proposals or those of yourself and Mr. Jinnah are not accepted?
A. I really do not know future plans. You will believe me when I
say that they are in God’s hands.
 Q. Non-violence may be relative, not absolute. Some participation in the already existing violence, participation for the purpose of producing real and lasting peace, may be unavoidable and even desirable. Is this a fair statement of the position?
A. It is a fair statement. I cannot challenge it merely because it is
 likely to lead to dangerous abuse from the non-violent standpoint. Pure unmixed non-violence is impossible as Euclid’s line.
 Q. I understand your answer to mean that mass civil disobedience presents no solution of the present deadlock.
A. You are right.
 Q. May I quote you as saying that the national government you conceive of would do nothing which, as far as the war in the Far East is concerned, would jeopardize one additional American life or which would lengthen the war for an American soldier—that such a government would on the contrary make every effort to hasten the conclusion of the war against Japan?
A. You will be safe in using the language as if it was mine.

INDIA","
    
 SEVAGRAM, (WARDHA),
 August 18, 1944 The   published   correspondencelibtech_799_footnoteshows  that   I   left   no   stone unturned  to   conform  to   the   Viceregal   requirements.   The  final
Government reply is positive proof that the British Government have
 no intention of winning public support. I do not confine myself to the Congress, since its main demand has been backed by almost  all political parties.
 So far as the technical winning of the war is concerned, they have evidently no need for such support. Moral support they seem to despise. Boiled down, the Viceroy’s proposition means that unless all the main parties agree as to the constitution of the future and there is agreement between the British Government and the main parties, there is to be no change in the constitutional position, and the Government of India as at present is to be carried on. The names of the parties given in the Government reply are illustrative only. I have no doubt that on due occasions more will be exhibited as from a conjurer’s bag and who knows how and when the British Government will agree to surrender control?
 It is as clear as crystal that the British Government do  not  propose to give up the power they possess over four hundred millions, unless the latter develop strength enough to wrest it from them. I shall never lose hope that India will do so by purely moral means.
 The problem of food, meanwhile, remains unsolved. Only a
 
 national Government envisaged by me can provide a genuine solution. Any other will be a mirage. It is most unfortunate that at this critical juncture the Quaid-e-Azam has fallen ill and under medical advice cannot see me till he is free from his illness. A proper heart-agreement between us can induce a revision of the firm refusal of the British Government as conveyed through His Excellency’s letter. Let us all pray that the Quaid-e-Azam may be soon restored enough to see me and that God may so dominate our hearts as to lead us to a right solution.
 I would like to assure all parties to be affected by our solution that we will not come to any terms which will compromise or ignore a single interest. The Rajaji Formula is capable of being amended if it is found to contain flaws as many Hindu and Sikh friends  have suggested it does. No solution is likely to last unless, on the face of it, it is right and is acceptable to the people of India as a whole.

     MY 	DEAR HUMAYUN,  August 	21, 1944 
  	I value your frank letter received today. You deserve a long reply 	but I must be brief, if I am to reply at once which I am doing.  	I do not endorse any Pakistan but I do endorse Rajaji’s scheme 	even if it be called Pakistan. It is a concrete form of the Congress 	resolution. The Rajaji Formula merely furnishes a basis for 	discussion. It opens a way to the solution of the communal tangle. 	Everybody who does not like it is free to oppose it. If you think 	that it will harm the country you are bound to oppose it. If Muslim 	opinion dislikes it, it must go. It will go also if Hindus and 	others oppose it. The Rajaji Formula furnishes a scheme for 	voluntary acceptance. There is no room for discussion, if it is to 	be imposed by force. I could be no party to a forcible imposition of 	a thing even if of my own coining. Here therefore there is no 	question of ignoring or disregarding nationalist Muslims of any 	other section. Quaid-e-Azam represents the League. I represent 	nobody but myself.  	I did read your contribution to Bharat Jyoti. Your book, I am 	sorry, I have not been able to touch.  	You should know that we (Rajaji and I) have reserved the right to 	oppose even the modified scheme of partition, if it ever goes to the 
 poll. We are not enamoured of it. But if there must be sovereign states, we have said what we will voluntarily endorse. But we would  be pleased if the country, i.e., in this case the majority of Muslims concerned reject it jointly with other inhabitants of the areas concerned.
 So you see that you should come if you can spare the time. It is not too late.
 Amtul Salaam had a lot to say about you and your wife’s kindness to her. She also told me that you had stolen a Hindu girl for wifelibtech_814_footnote, that she was extremely devoted to you and that she was able to remain Hindu.

 The Nightingale of India has sent on to me the letter you wrote her. I have perused it carefully.

So long as the Hindus and the Muslims live in fear of each other, we will always have the British as our overlords. It has been my endeavour to give up that fear myself and persuade others to do the same. It is with that very purpose that I am going to meet the Quaid-e-Azam. Let us see what God grants us.

There doesn’t seem to be any other way for me. You know yourself the high regard I have for you. So long as I am out, I am with you. I am aware of your faith in me.
 Chimanlal is the principal manager. His sacrifice is great indeed. You yourself admire his sacrificing his family life and other things. Doesn’t this show that he would not be taking any decision with a view to his own self-interest? I have had a talk with him and in order to save my time he has agreed that if there is any complaint or difference of opinion Jajuji’slibtech_821_footnotedecision will  be  acceptable  to  all.  I hope you will at least agree that when there is a difference of opinion one should not claim that one’s view is always correct. You are right in saying that the work should be divided. But even then sometimes there is a clash of views. In organizations someone’s opinion has to be accepted as final.
 This should clear all your doubts. However, if there is still anything more you may ask me. You should not get upset at all. Come what may, don’t lose your peace of mind.

428,"August 23, 1944","ANSWERS  TO 
QUESTIONSlibtech_825_footnote","
    
 August 23, 1944
 QUESTION : Mahatmaji, you have been during your whole political career a strong supporter of the integrity of India and an opponent of vivisection. How do you reconcile your present position in giving support to Rajaji’s proposals ?
ANSWER : There is no change in my views. I am even today as
 much against vivisection of India as ever before. Rajaji’s formula concedes right of self-determination, but it does not concede Pakistan—an indefinite and undefined expression. As a believer in non-violence I cannot use force in keeping people of a particular area inside India if they want to separate. All I can do is to persuade them.
 Q. Whatever be the result of your negotiations with Mr. Jinnah, don’t you think that the British statesmen taking advantage of Rajaji’s offer, which has your support, will divide India into two parts and establish two rival federations instead of one and thereby find an additional reason for the continuance of British control ?
A. I do not think the British statesmen will do it, unless they want
 it themselves and have independently so decided. They know that forty crores of people cannot be kept under permanent bondage. The world forces are moving so fast that whether the British Government will or not India must be free at no distant date. Furthermore, Rajaji’s formula definitely lays down that the exercise of the right of self- determination can only accrue after independence.
 Q. The non-Muslims of the Punjab and of Bengal feel panicky about Rajaji’s formula because they are afraid that under this formula the non-Muslims in the separated areas will be thrown into Pakistan.
 A. From the reports that I receive it is evident that so far as the Punjab is concerned there is already Pakistan in action. The religious and cultural rights of the non-Muslims they say are denied to them. My informants say that undue restrictions are placed on non-Muslim leaders and their womenfolk cannot even move about freely for fear of molestation. If this is a true picture I don’t think the position will be in any way worse in “Pakistan” if ever it is established.
 The people of the Punjab and Bengal need entertain no false fears, as I am not going to sell them off. I have no right to do so. No individual can barter away rights of brave people endowed with self-
 
 confidence. Today I enjoy the confidence of the people because they believe that their interests are safe in my hands and I cannot betray them. If tomorrow I act against their wishes and interests I shall be stoned by these very people who now trust me. I am rather pained at the nervousness exhibited by the Sikhs who are a brave community. Unless they have lost the chivalrous spirit and  bravery  which  the Gurus infused in them, they need entertain no fear about my coming talks with Mr. Jinnah.
 I have already explained in my Press statement and I repeat again that nothing will be done by me or us to the prejudice of any section of the Indian population and whatever proposals are agreed to between Quaid-e-Azam Jinnah and myself will be open to confirmation, amendment and rejection by the representatives of various communities and interests. There is no idea of  forcing anything on anybody against his will.
 Q. If Pakistan ever comes into existence don’t you think, Mahatmaji, the existence of a rival independent state in the north- west will be a constant danger to the independence of India ?
 A. Thirty crores and over of inhabitants living in India have nothing to fear from two crores of Muslims living in the north-west.  If the former are so weak as not to be able to defend themselves against two crores in the north-west, then they have  no right  to ask  for independence.
 I have no doubt in my mind that if India becomes independent, Indians will be able to defend themselves against any outside aggres- sion with the resources at their disposal.
  Mahatmaji, 	all your attempts 	during the last twenty 	years or over for 	bringing about 	Hindu-Muslim unity 	have gone in vain 	and Hindu-Muslim 	relations today 	are as 	much strained as 	ever before. Don’t you 	think that India has 	been put 	on the 	wrong track and communal electorates are the bane of the Indian 	constitution? The Muslim 	demand for Pakistan 	and Mr. Jinnah’s 	propounding of the 	two-nation theory 	are the natural sequences 	of separate 	electorates and communal 	reservations and so 	long as 	the principle 	of separate 	electorates on religious 	basis continues to 	disfigure the 	constitution of 	our country, 	there is no chance 	of the 	Hindus and 	Muslims living 	at peace 	as members 	of the 	great Indian nations ? 	If you agree with the above 	contention why 	don’t you 	give a 	right lead to 	the country 	by pressing 	for joint 	electorates as 	the basis 	of political 	rights ? 
 A. I do believe that separate electorates have done more harm than good.

 find possible in one village I would apply to all villages in similar conditions. If I think, and can persuade the institutions concerned to think, about paper-making from this point of view, we might find it easier to reach our goal. If the people of a village can produce energy from some source in the village itself so that they can invent a device whereby, instead of every person making paper, a few hands are able to produce all the paper needed, I would welcome such an invention. If the attempt to produce everything through the power of man’s hands and feet puts such constraints on him that further development of this triple faculties would be completely arrested, I would regard such an arrangement as faulty. By triple faculties I mean those of the body, the mind and the spirit.
  If 	I have 	understood the 	third question 	correctly, you will see 	that it 	is implied in 	the second. 	If you 	do not, 	please put it 	up to me [accordingly].

She says that when one seeks 	your help for my work, one always gets a negative reply. The result 	is, you do not profit from the ideas that occur to workers like her. 	You attach no value to the help offered by these workers. You behave 	with absolute confidence in yourself as if whatever you do is beyond 	criticism or improvement. Since you are involved in these 	complaints, and since you are one of the founders of these 	institutions, people generally believe that what the Gandhians do 	can hardly warrant any criticism. And the Gandhians, on their part, 	boastfully say to workers like her: ‘Look at our work and our 	skill in keeping our balance. We are supplying cheap and ennobling 	literature to the people; and we never sit idle. We have acquired 	the secret of unremitting work. Now, we do not understand what you 	critics want to say. You cannot find fault with the work we are 	doing. We do not work the way you do. It does not suit us. The field 	for service is very wide. You can do as you please and let us do 	what we like. So our plea is that we should bear with each other and 	carry on our work. Moreover, we are always ready to carry out 	Gandhiji’s wishes.’ Mridulabehn depicts this picture of 	Navajivan Karyalaya and the Vidyapith and allied institutions. The 	language is not hers but mine. I have used garish words. Without 	them  I cannot make you see Mridulabehn’s meaning as I understand 	it. She is sarcastic but not virulent. I have regarded her criticism 	as friendly.

The replylibtech_832_footnotewhich 	I gave to the Government’s allegations has been translated into 	many languages by the Aundh Press. According to Mridulabehn, a 	Gujarati translation in simple language and in my style can be 	rendered truthfully only by those who are called Gandhians. 	Mridulabehn is particular about this style of language. She tried to     
 secure this translation but no one paid any heed. It is getting late and I shall therefore cut my letter short. But this is enough to explain to you what Mridulabehn wants. Please send your reply to me.
 I gave this letter to Mridulabehn to read. She wants to add two points to it. First, it was my idea to send the material to the Aundh Press. This is right. I thought that due to the scarcity of paper, etc., it would be difficult to sort out things anywhere else. Secondly, she expects mutual understanding between you and her, so that she should not be required to rush to me. This is right so far as it goes. But sometimes it may become unavoidable to come to me. There is no means in the world to bar this road in anticipation.

 Who can accept the propriety of my writing a preface for this venture? But if by doing so, I can help fill the purse for the poor, why need I hesitate?

  	Seven annas had to be paid for your unstamped letter. Why are you in 	such a great hurry? Such waste is not a sign of our poverty.  	I do not remember that I failed to address you as ‘Daughter’. I 	allowed the pen free play. I do not see any difference between 	‘Daughter’ and ‘Chi’. It might have made some difference if 	I had written ‘Behn’. But is there any cure for suspicion? You 	can do any work without seeking my consent. Then the     
 question of my displeasure will not arise at all. When you had asked me earlier, I had told you what was proper work for you. The work which you are doing covers the Hindu-Muslim problem too.
 I waited for the Maulvi you mention. But he never turned up. It was clear you had made a mistake. In spite of it, I had sent word to the Maulvi that he could certainly come.
You must have received the letter I sent through Bhagirathji.
 You can certainly draw Rs. 75 a month for your expenses. Do not ask your brothers for it. If they send anything of their  own  accord, pass it on to the Ashram.

He does not get a minute to spare. After the arrival of 	the Bishop of Rangoon his work has increased a lot. I, therefore, 	took up the drafting of the resolution in my own hand. I did this on 	the spur of the moment, but the work was too much. Whatever I have 	done is enclosed herewith.libtech_864_footnoteIt seems to me that I have compressed a great deal in 	a short space, multum in parvo.

You 	may, therefore, add anything to or remove anything from the draft. 	You need not fear that I would feel offended. He is a true co-worker 	who finds out the shortcomings of his colleague and helps him to 	correct them in a friendly spirit.  	The interview with the Bishop shaped very well. The result lies in 	the hands of God.  	I hope your study of Urdu is going on. If it was discontinued owing 	to pressure of work, please resume it. Drop by drop fills the ocean.

469,"September 	1, 1944",SPEECH AT A. I. S. A. MEETING-I,"
          SEVAGRAM, 
  September 	1, 1944  	More than two years have passed since we last met. I have come to 	know a little, that is to say, not the whole of what happened 	outside [the jail] during these two years. It seemed as though one 	age had succeeded another, bringing in the process trouble for the 	whole of India. How could the Charkha Sangh have escaped it?  	Today, we have once again come together under these circumstances 	but whatever little work we might yet be able to do would not be 	enough for us. A large amount of the Charkha Sangh property has 	either been destroyed or is in Government custody. Besides, many of 	our colleagues could not be among us today. Here, I am not talking 	of Congressmen but of those who were especially helpful in the Sangh 	work and are its trustees. But I have realized that even with these 	few we can carry on the Sangh work. We are sure of    
 their ability to do it.
 I have thought a great deal over the subject of khadi during my detention. I shall briefly state the conclusions I have arrived at.
 The most important discovery I made was that the foundation of the A.I.S.A. was so weak that the Association could be easily wiped out of existence. It had not taken root in the life of the people. The Government could destroy it by imprisoning its leaders. Though some of its activities continued, I saw clearly that the Government could exterminate it at its pleasure. That is to say, my belief that the movement for the revival of the spinning-wheel was indestructible, whatever the circumstances, had been dashed to the ground. The work had not been organized on an imperishable basis.
 I am not a man to accept defeat easily but it was in the jail that I discovered that we live at Government’s mercy and it hurts me. If it were in my power I would choose to live at no one’s mercy except God’s. True, it is Divine dispensation that no man may live without the goodwill of his fellow-beings but I am not talking of such help. My activities are founded on my own thinking. The Charkha Sangh was also founded on the same principles. In South Africa, I discovered that if India was to survive and progress non-violently, it could only be through the charkha—the charkha alone can be a symbol of non-violence. We may draw strength from other symbols as well but such strength may not lead to the world’s well-being.
 I realized in jail that there was something wrong in our method of khadi work, which must needs be amended. I had asked India to carry on spinning. I knew how this spinning work was to be carried on. But I did not lay the necessary stress on the requisite outlook and the spirit which was to underlie it. I looked at it from its immediate practical aspect. All my co-workers also laid stress on this practical side. So I suffered it, and also lent my helping hand to it. We have gone far in that direction. But today I cannot continue to ask people to spin in that manner.
 I contemplated how to work in the future. I even thought of disbanding the Sangh on my own and distributing its property and funds among the people. I saw that our work would be incomplete, so long as we did not carry the message of the charkha to every home. That, I thought, accounted for our being far from our ideal. There are seven lakh villages in India. Thousands of them do not even know what the charkha is. This is our fault and it is because of this fault that
 
 we have failed to put khadi work on a sound basis. You must ponder over it.
 All the thought and study I have been giving to this subject lately make me feel that the work would have to be decentralized if it is to spread far and wide and take permanent root. The above line of thought led to the idea of decentralization and I thought it would be very good indeed if its worth could be proved. I realize that the difficulties in my way are many but then hardly anyone has devoted as much thought and effort to the charkha as I have. This is a rather tall claim and it also smacks of pride, but not to mention it on the right occasion would be false modesty. In the jail too I had no other thought but the charkha.
 The strength behind all my activities including civil disobedience is derived wholly from the charkha to which I have devoted most of my energy and funds. Most of the ten million rupees of the Tilak Swaraj Fund was also used up for the spinning activity. This brought about a spate of charges against me but I regard them as so many bouquets. For whatever I did, I did after due deliberation and with full knowledge of its consequences. I did not deceive anyone. Nothing was spent on the charkha without convincing  the  public about it. That is how this institution came into being.
 After much reflection and study I have arrived at the definite conclusion that, however intense, my  sadhanalibtech_866_footnoteof  the  charkha  has remained imperfect and I must admit that my study too has not been as thorough as it ought to have been. Today, my words have a greater force because I can see these things more clearly.
 Besides the Charkha Sangh members, as well as sympathizers and those who share my feelings, today’s gathering includes some representatives of the public also. Had we only directed the strength the country displayed during the movement along the right channels, we could have shown how much public support we had. But we failed to do so. The fault is not yours but mine and when I say all this, it is not so much to blame you, as to whip up your intelligence and my own.
 We plied the charkha but mechanically, not intelligently. Had you yourselves appreciated the full significance of the charkha, you would have given it the same importance as I do. It also has political
 
 significance. It has however no place in the dishonest game of politics. More than any other thing it is the charkha that stands for clean, noble politics. If there is [no] truth in this statement, how can we claim swaraj through the charkha? It certainly does not mean that as soon as the yarn snaps swaraj comes to nought.
 It is often alleged that workers of the A.I.S.A.  and  the A.I.V.I.A., if not Gandhiites in general, are unintelligent and lifeless. People repose trust in them. But they (the Gandhiites) are not able to tell the people what exactly are the problems facing the country and how our programme is calculated to resolve these problems and take us to our goal. On the other hand, Marxian literature is fast increasing in the country and Gandhiites are not able to resist the impact of these external forces.
 We say that we are devoted to non-violence. If so, we must reveal in our lives the force of non-violence. Unless we can reveal its force in our own lives, we will not be true Gandhiites. In fact, there is no such thing as Gandhism. If anything, it is non-violence that deserves to be called an ideology. Every member of the Charkha Sangh should be a living witness of non-violence. If he is a devotee of non-violence or Gandhism, he must be a live wire. Today Gandhism is a word of reproach. It no more connotes something virtuous or praiseworthy. Let us admit we have failed to make non-violence a part of our being. Otherwise we would find the charkha established in every village. I confess that I have failed. Had I been an adept in this art, I would have produced a concrete pattern of reconstructed village life in Sevagram at any rate. But today even if I put the charkha in the hands of the people of Sevagram they do not accept it. We teach them how to use it, tempt them by providing them with work, pay them more wages and serve them in various ways, yet all to little purpose. But my faith in the charkha is unshakable even when I have failed as President of the Sangh.
 That is why I said that we should admit that we have failed to do what we ought to have done. It is not due to want  of  sacrifice  in  us. Amongst us are men and women who have sacrificed much. My head bends low before them. When I think of each of them my heart is deeply moved. My conscience tells me that a  country  which abounds in persons instilled with such a spirit of sacrifice can never fail. Yet in spite of this sacrifice, we have not yet made our country free. Freedom is coming, perhaps sooner than we believe. But it does
 not satisfy me. I even question my own share in it and then console myself with the thought that we have at least tried our best. I do not hold anybody guilty. I am only pointing to the situation as it is. Correct assessment of a situation is also a sign of intelligence. We should not feel satisfied with what we have done. We have tried our best, no doubt. But had we been able to develop the work of the Sangh according to the standard we had set before ourselves, there will not be the despair amongst us which we see today. In that case we would have accomplished forthwith a non-violent swaraj.
 I lay before you a hard prescription. If you are prepared for it, well and good. But it should not be accepted in ignorance, nor out of foolhardiness. You should examine it thoroughly. If you agree with me you would wind up the A.I.S.A. and distribute all its property and assets among its workers for carrying on the work. The Sangh need not keep even a pice for future activities. All of us should be convinced that the charkha is the symbol of non-violent economic self-sufficiency. If we and the people grasp this significance of the charkha not a pice need be spent on propaganda for the charkha. There would then be no reason to fear Government ordinances either. Nor need we look to the rich for alms. We shall without effort become the centre of hope, and the people will come to us of their  own accord. They will not go elsewhere to seek work. Every village will become the nerve-centre of independent India. India will then not be known by her cities like Bombay and Calcutta, but by  her  400 millions inhabiting the seven lakhs of villages. The problems of Hindu-Muslim differences, untouchability, conflicts, misunderstan- dings and rivalries will all melt away. This is the real function of the Sangh. We have to live and die for it.
 You will argue it is a very big task requiring much intelligence. I tell you that this cannot be acquired by mere study in libraries. We have to develop it by the labour of our hands. This is the idea underlying the Nayee Talim according to which the intellect is developed by the effort put forth by the hands and feet. Books need not be burnt but their importance is only secondary. The charkha has to rank first of all. In the same manner the pursuit of the charkha must become the mainspring of manifold other activities like village industries, Nayee Talim, etc. If we are able to adopt the charkha intelligently we can revive the entire economic life of our villages once more. But we can progress only as far as the strength of our
 members takes us. I do not wish to create a fresh universe, like Vishwamitra, who wanted to take Trishanku to heaven but the poor fellow remained suspended half way. Therefore, we have to work within the limits of our strength with our feet on the hard earth.
 If we ourselves disband the Sangh the Government will have little left to attach. They could surely not destroy us all, for our strength would have gone up to forty crores. If they want to liquidate us we shall submit to it cheerfully. And what does it matter if a few million among us are done away with? An ocean does not dry up if a few drops evaporate. Nothing can diminish its greatness. Similarly, the more we are suppressed, the more powerful we shall grow. The only condition is that we must recognize the power of non-violence.
 We must carry on untiring research on the charkha. No doubt we have put in a lot of effort for the charkha and made some improvements in it. We have also manufactured scores of charkhas but now we have to produce an expert, a shastri who is well-versed in the manufacture of machines. We should like him to devise such charkhas as can yield more and better quality of yarn. But even if we fail to find such an expert, I am not going to accept defeat. I will prove my point with the help of reasoning. We should have undying faith in the charkha. When faith materializes it manifests itself through reason. It is not self-luminous. For when faith transcends its bounds and finds another medium to express itself it shines forth all the more. Faith is never lost; in fact it grows and sharpens the intellect. And then faith can challenge reason. It is no use merely making speeches or giving lectures; we must make scientific experiments and declare from the house-tops the results of our experiments. We have been suppressed and we have to work our way up. Let us therefore do away with mutual recriminations, disabuse our minds of any reservations, iron out all the differences and thus simplify our work. We should repose full confidence in our representatives and be frank. We are votaries of truth and should, therefore, not be afraid of speaking the whole truth, for the greater the fear in our hearts, the less we shall be able to speak the truth. That is why the Gita gives the pride of place to fearlessness.
 I am telling you this on the strength of my inner experience. We should be fearless and not hide anything. Selfishness has already impeded our progress and unless we get rid of it, we would not be able to organize our strength and would thus prove traitors to  Mother India.

470,"September 	2, 1944",SPEECH AT A.I.S.A. MEETING-II,"
           SEVAGRAM, 
  September 	2, 1944  	Yesterday, I was a little hasty while talking to you. Some work was 	indeed done but later I kept thinking over it. I had undertaken the 	stupendous task of preparing a draft for you. I even entered silence 	for the purpose. After much reflection last night and this morning I 	have prepared a draft which I shall now read out for your 	consideration.   The 		village is 		the centre 		for the charkha, 		and the Charkha 		Sangh can 		realize its highest 		ambitions only when 		its work is decentralized in the villages. Keeping this in view, this meeting of the   I. 		S. A. resolves that 		the following changes 		be implemented 		in its 		present methods of work:   The 			largest number of 			workers whose one 			passion is 			the charkha and whom the A. I. S. A. approves should go to the villages.  The 			present sales-depots 			and production-centres 			should be 			curtailed.  Training 			institutions should 			be developed 			and teaching courses enlarged.  The 			Sangh should 			permit any province 			or district 			which wants to 			be independent and 			self-sufficient to 			become so.     A 		Standing Committee 		composed of 		the members 		of the A.I.S.A., 		A.I.V.I.A. and 		the Hindustani 		Talimi Sangh 		should  be formed 		in order 		to issue 		necessary directions in 		the light 		of the 		new ideology. 		The three institutions 		must realize that their 		task  is  to achieve 		perfect non-violence. Complete swaraj will follow in 		its wake. The three 		institutions must be 		so equipped that 		the entire government 		machinery should 		depend upon them and 		not vice versa. 		This means 		the workers 		of these 		three bodies should attain in 		some measure the 		quality of a  sthitaprajnalibtech_867_footnotelibtech_868_footnote. They must be men of secure understan- ding. 		If this 		is not 		possible we 		should stop 		making tall 		claims for 		the charkha. 		We shall 		have to lower our ideal 		and plan 		our work 		accordingly.  This 	united body composed, as suggested above, of members of    
 the three Sanghs should so regularize the constructive work that all political activity will be dependent on it. Today our condition is most pitiable.
 Some workers of the A. I. S. A. complained to me that they do not receive any help from Congressmen. The experience of the last two years is also before us. During my detention, I read a lot of newspapers and was aware of the wretchedness that was apparent in our workers.
Now after talking to them it has all become very clear to me.
 In the jail, I read all the Communist literature [I could get]. It contained nothing new for me. Whenever Maulana Hasrat Mohani visited the Ashram, we used to spend the day in such discussions. Today the Socialists have a number of sincere workers holding university degrees. Those among them who are neutral come to me and ask me to put my philosophy and my faith before the world. I have placed before the world a novel idea which, although it has no long history of its own, represents my achievement based On forty years’ experience.
 We must admit that we have few degree-holders among us. We have neither much money nor any comparable efficiency. I realize all these difficulties but undaunted I made my way through them cheerfully for seventy-five years. I hope you will be equally fearless.
 We can make intelligent progress along our chosen path and face the challenge coming our way only if we have this courage. What indicates light is its progressive dispelling of darkness. Absence of light is darkness. It has been the law of the world that light spreads. Darkness then has nowhere to go but cease to be. That is the way of non-violence too. My deep-rooted faith in non-violence gives me the courage to fear nothing—and in spite of impediments my progress has not stopped. This manifestation of non-violence will be clear to you only after my death, not before it.
 We have been looking up to the Congress because we have been crippled so far. It is true that with the Congress help, our work can be carried on, but then it was I who had introduced the Charkha Sangh Resolutionlibtech_869_footnotelibtech_870_footnotein the Congress realizing that the Sangh was to continue
 
 longer.
 But it is our fault that we have not won the confidence of Congressmen sufficiently to make them come to us to help them in village work. If we were capable of doing this, which Congressmen would dare remain outside the Sangh? Nay, the Congress and the Sangh would then have felt one with each other, and the one would have acted as a supplement to the other, i.e., the Sangh would have carried out the Congress constructive programme, and the Congress would have fought the Government in the legislatures. There would then have been no antagonism between the two.
 Therefore, we have to look at the whole thing from a new angle and a new order of priorities. I have put nothing new before you. It would indeed be a great achievement if you could prove the power of the charkha through your own lives. Today, we are in a strange situation. I have no doubt at all that we have failed to realize the significance of the charkha only because of the inadequate manner in which we have done our khadi work.
 It cannot be denied that believers in big industry and industrialization are also the friends of India. But the difference between them and me is like that between the two poles. Citydwellers might well follow those who advocate mill production. But if you of the countryside were, even by mistake or oversight, to take to it, the picture of India would be thoroughly changed. Her face would then be altered beyond recognition. Thereby hundreds of millions of our poor people will meet their end while only a few millions will survive.  I do aspire to live for 125 years. But I cannot bear the sight of a crore of people living after reducing to ashes 39 crores. What I have tried to do is to serve the most oppressed and the handicapped, and to keep pace with them. It has been our endeavour to do this work through khadi during these years. Not many years ago we began. If you feel that no changes are desirable, well and good, but I will not accept defeat. You should come to a decision after weighing all the pros and
 of the machinery and funds of the Congress, save and except such funds and assets as are specially earmarked and belong to the All-India Khaddar Board and Provincial Khaddar Boards, which shall be handed over with all existing financial obligations to the All-India Spinners’ Association started by Mahatma Gandhi as an integral part of the Congress organization, but with independent existence and full powers to administer these and other funds for the fulfilment of its object.” For Gandhiji’s speech introducing the Resolution, vide “Speech at A.I.C.C. Meeting, Patna”, 22-9- 1925.
 cons. Who knows when it will be possible for so many of us to meet again? I have laid my heart open before you.
 If you believe that the charkha is the supreme symbol of our objective and that we have not been able to achieve our objective by the present methods then our mode of working must needs be changed.
 I do not mean to say that all we did so far was absolutely wrong. Whatever we did, we did with devotion to truth. And that is no small matter. Even with our limited funds, we were able to distribute among our village brethren more than four and a half crores of rupees up to date. The amount we spent in organizing this work was in comparison little. Yet from the standpoint of our objective, the work is not up to the standard. We must not allow ourselves to be weighed down by the commercial aspect of our work. Jawaharlal has sent me a book describing the achievements of the co-operative movement in China. That movement, it seems to me, is nothing compared with what we are doing here. But judged by our own objective we have done little, very little. We have not yet reached the seven hundred thousand villages. We have done only one per cent of what the mills have done. Then what is there to be proud of? That is why I say that if we are not prepared to change our methods we shall be reduced to a mere philanthropic institution. I shall not be ashamed of it. If, on the other hand, we want to uphold our claim for khadi we shall have to live up to it. We should not deceive the public. We must think out ways and means of increasing our strength. If in seeking to change our mode of work you agree that it would be well to close the A.I.S.A. in its present form, rest assured that it would add to your strength.

which has overtaken areas through devastating floods. The Congress,
 as an organization, is not functioning. The general rule is non-co-operation, while the Government is warring against the Congress. There should be no hesitation about individuals associating, if effective relief can thereby be given to the distressed people. Every case should be judged on its own merits. The test should be, is any initiative and responsibility left with the individuals? The golden rule is to follow fearlessly one’s own judgment even at the risk of its proving erroneous.

477,"September 	3, 1944",SPEECH AT A. I. S. A. MEETING—III,"
         SEVAGRAM, 
  September 	3, 1944  	Today, I will try to explain my thoughts to you more clearly and 	present them to you in a different frame from what I have said 	during the last two days. Our work had a very humble beginning. When 	I started khadi I had with me, apart from Maganlalbhailibtech_876_footnoteand others who had elected to live and die with me, 	Vithaldasbhailibtech_877_footnoteand 	 a few sisters. Vithaldas was, at that time, fighting for the 	labourers, but [at my call] he gave up his shop and joined me in 	this unremunerative work. We had then not the faintest idea as to 	what the future had in store for us. We have travelled a long way 	since then and today about two crores of people have come under the 	influence of the charkha. So far, we have maintained that the 	charkha has the power to bring us freedom. With its help we have 	been able to provide the village people with a large amount of 	money. But can we still hold, as we have always maintained, that 	swaraj is impossible without the charkha? So long as we do not 	substantiate this claim the charkha is really no more than a measure 	of relief, to which we turn because we can do nothing else about it. 	It would not then be the means of our salvation.  	Secondly, we have failed to carry our message to the crores of our 	people. They have neither any knowledge of what the charkha can do 	for them nor even the necessary curiosity for it.  	The Congress did accept the charkha. But did it do so willingly? No, 	it tolerates the charkha simply for my sake. The Socialists ridicule 	it outright. They have spoken and written much against it. We have 	no clear or convincing reply to offer to them. How I wish I could 	convince them that the charkha is the key to swaraj! I have not been 	able to justify the claim all these years.  	Now for my third  point:  non-violence  is  not something of  the 	other world. If it is, I have no use for it. I am of the earth and  	if  non-violence  is  something  really  worth  while  I  want  to   	realize it here on this earth while I am still alive. The 	non-violence I want is one which the masses can follow in practice. 	And how else can it be     
 realized except in a society which has compassion and other similar virtues as its characteristics?
 If you go to the house of one who has use for violence you will find his drawing-room decorated with tigers’ skins, deers’ horns, swords, guns and such like. I have been to the Viceregal Lodge, I also saw Mussolini. In the houses of both I found arms hanging on the walls. I was given a salute with arms, a symbol of violence.
 Just as arms symbolize violence the charkha symbolizes non- violence, in the sense that we can most directly realize non-violence through it. But it cannot symbolize non-violence so long as we do not work in accordance with its spirit. The sword in Mussolini’s hall seemed to say ‘Touch me and I will cut you.’ It gave a vivid picture of violence. It seemed to ask you to touch it and realize its power. So also we must illustrate the power of the charkha so that a mere look at it may speak to us about non-violence. .But we are bankrupt today. What is our answer to the Socialists? They complain that we have been harping on the charkha for years and yet we have achieved nothing.
 The charkha was there during Muslim rule also. Dacca was famous for its muslin. The charkha then was a symbol of poverty and not of non-violence. The kings took forced labour from women and depressed classes. The same was later repeated by the East India Company. Kautilyalibtech_878_footnotementions in  his  Arthashastra  the  existence  of such forced labour. For ages the charkha was thus a symbol of violence and the use of force and compulsion. The spinner got but a handful of grain or two small coins, while ladies of the court went about luxuriously clad in the finest of muslins, the product of exploited labour.
 As against this, I have presented the charkha to you as a symbol of non-violence. If I did not make it clear to you so far, it was my mistake. You know I am among the maimed and can move but slowly. Yet I do believe that the work done so far has not been a waste.
 I shall now pass to my fourth point. We have not yet proved that there can be no swaraj without the charkha. It cannot be proved so long as you do not explain it to Congressmen. The charkha and the Congress should become synonyms.
 The task of proving the superiority of non-violence is a difficult one. We have to fathom its depths if we are to realize its truth. I have
 
 always supported all that I have said so far. The world is going to put me to the test. It may declare me a fool for my tall talk about the charkha. The task of making the charkha, which for centuries had been a symbol of poverty, helplessness, injustice and forced labour, the symbol now of mighty non-violent strength, of the new social order and of the new economy, has fallen on our shoulders. We have to change history. And I want to do it through you.
 I hope you follow what I am saying. But if in spite of it you do not believe that the charkha has the power to achieve swaraj, I will ask you to leave me. Here you are at the crossroads. If you continue with me without faith you will be deceiving me and doing a great wrong to the country. I beg of you not to deceive me in the evening of my life.
 It is I who am responsible for defects in our working so far. The fault is mine because I have remained the head even when I was conscious of its defects. But let bygones be bygones. Do we honestly believe today that the charkha is the emblem of non-violence? How many of us are there who believe so from the depths of our heart?
 Now we have the tricolour flag. What is it but a piece of khadi of specific length and breadth? You can well have another piece in its place. But behind that khadi cloth lie encased your feelings. It is a symbol of swaraj, a symbol of national emancipation. We cannot  forget it. We will not remove it. We are prepared to die for it. So also the charkha should be an emblem of non-violence.
 What does the charkha, as an emblem of non-violence, signify in the economic sphere? Call it self-sufficiency or what you like. In the name of national reconstruction and self-sufficiency  millions  are being bled white in Western countries, as also in other countries for their sake. Ours is not a self-sufficiency of that pattern. The charkha is the way to get rid of exploitation and domination. I am not so much concerned with words as with the thing itself. Still, words have a miraculous power. They embody the feelings, which then acquire a definite shape with the aid of language.
 We are familiar with the controversy in our religion  as  to whether God has a form or no. The believers in form prefer  to  worship God through an emblem. So if non-violence is to be pursued as an ideal, the charkha must be acknowledged as its true form and emblem, and kept ever before view. Whenever I think of non-violence
 the picture of the charkha comes before me. A  nirakaravadilibtech_879_footnotelibtech_880_footnotewould not accept Krishna. He has one foot on the mountain top and the other in the clouds above. But we tread the solid ground. We cannot visualize non-violence in the abstract. So we choose an object which can symbolize for us the formless. That is what the charkha does for me and that is why I worship it. If you can realize this truth, you will understand the force of my argument. Even to Jajuji I had never before spoken with so much conviction. Jerajani says I am being hasty. Unless you understand and imbibe this spirit behind  my  worship of the charkha you will not gain an understanding of non-violence even for a hundred years. That capacity for non- violence which I find in the charkha can also be perceived by you only if you approach it with a heart like mine. That is why I say: Follow me or leave me. If you want to come with me, I will give you a scheme and do everything possible. If you have not understood what I mean I am prepared to sit and discuss it with you the whole day. But if you say that you have grasped my meaning when you really have not, you will be deceiving both yourselves and me. Ours is not an association for making profit. We do not seek loaves and fishes. There are a thousand fields in which we can serve the country. Why then remain in charkha work and sail under false colours? Please do not therefore remain with me under an illusion. Let me go my way alone. But if it were found that I was myself suffering from an illusion and that my belief in the charkha was mere idol-worship, either you may burn me to ashes with the wood of the charkha, or I myself would set fire to the charkha with my own hands.
 If the Charkha Sangh has to go, let us wind it up with our own hands. That will put an end to all our struggle like the sun clearing the mist. Then the charkha which has for the moment put us into a labyrinth of difficulties will be left in the hands of a few who believe in it, and may in their hands prove to be a mighty weapon. If you regard it as sheer folly I certainly have no ambition to run an idiots’ association and thus degrade the country. On the other hand, if you can demonstrate non-violence through the charkha, it will not merely move but sweep forward. You will not then have to worry about keeping it alive.
 I repeat that you either leave me alone or digest what I say and follow me. I have brought this new idea to you after two years
 
 of penitential thinking. I do not know if I have succeeded in conveying my idea to you. If I have been able to carry conviction please do one thing. Those of you who want to remain with me give me in writing that you regard the charkha from today as the emblem of non-violence. You have to make your decision today. If you do not or cannot regard the charkha as the emblem of non-violence and yet remain with me, then you will thereby put yourself in an awkward plight and also drag me down with you.

 [On or before September 4, 1944]libtech_881_footnote
 CHI. CHIMANLAL,
I saw yesterday that my point had not been understood.
 The matter of utensils, etc., was only an instance. It made me see the extent of our imperfections.
 In my view, in moments of crisis we have not shown the qualities that the inmates of the Ashram should have. Those qualities cannot be cultivated in a day. A handful of you may maintain some order. But how does that help ? What knowledge do women have ? What part can they intelligently play ? Can everybody sacrifice himself in a way that would befit the Ashram ? Can you stand today before India as an embodiment of the Ashram ? Let us realize our weakness. There is something lacking in my training. If that is the case, then we must proceed with that realization. Balkrishna cannot be of much help in this. Jajuji can. Vallabh can. If you want, do discuss it with me. If I have been able to put across my point, you can take a decision without discussing it with me. I shall accept whatever you do. I see no harm since Jajuji has been involved. His guidance would be invaluable. You should not think it shameful to wind up the Ashram. Its winding up may mean building it up. If you wind it up, give thought to my idea
 
 of a smaller one.
 Do not feel perturbed. Have the utmost patience. All of you should read this and think it over. There is no harm if you cannot come to any decision before I go to Bombay."

  	Day before yesterday, that is, on the night of the 6th, Shri 	Deshpandeji told me that Jajuji is not fit for the post of Secretary 	as he does not have administrative, that is, management talent 	although he is a saintly man. He can hold the highest position in a 	society of saints. In support of his opinion he told me that the 	Provincial Secretaries or Agents of the A.I.S.A., who have returned 	from here, have all gone back disappointed and helpless. Therefore, 	hefears that the A.I.S.A. is going to die under its own weight. If 	this is true, as head of the A.I.S.A., I have to give it a second 	thought because my experience is completely contrary to 	Deshpandeji’s opinion. My experience tells me that true 	saintliness implies efficiency, and Jajuji is a living embodiment of 	this truth. I have, therefore, decided to have Jajuji’s 	administrative talents verified. I have already talked to Jajuji and 	he also agrees to this. If you have accepted Jajuji as Secretary out 	of despair and only to please me, you have not been truly faithful 	to the  	A.I.S.A. and if Deshpande’s prophecy comes true and the A.I.S.A. 	comes to nought, in my opinion, it will not be on account of Jajuji 	but due to your own weakness. How can any secretary, however able, 	attain success without the whole-hearted co-operation of his 	subordinates? The A.I.S.A. has no power to compel any one. Its 	strength lies in the whole-hearted co-operation among all its 	office-    
 bearers, i.e., their mutual love and fellow-feeling. If this is lacking nothing avails. Please, therefore, let me have your true opinion whether Jajuji is unfit for the secretaryship, whether he lacks administrative talents, whether you have reluctantly accepted his candidature. If your answer is in support of Deshpandeji’s statement, please write to me substantiating your objections with concrete instances so that I can decide the course of my duty.

A. JINNAHlibtech_898_footnote","
         BOMBAY, 
  September 	9, 1944  	It was a test of my patience. . . . I am amazed at my own patience. 	However, it was a friendly talk.  	His (Jinnah’s) contempt for your Formula (Rajaji Formula) and his 	eontempt for you is staggering. You rose in my estimation that you 	could have talked to him for all those hours and that you should 	have taken the trouble to draw up that formula.  	He says you have accepted his demand and so should I. I said, “I 	endorse Rajaji’s Formula and you can call it Pakistan if you 	like.” He talked of the Lahore Resolutionlibtech_899_footnotelibtech_900_footnote. I said, “I have not studied it and I do not want to 	talk about it. Let us talk about Rajaji’s Formula and you can 	point out any flaws that you find there.”  	In the middle of the talk he came back to the old ghost: “I 	thought you had come here as a Hindu, as a representative of the 	Hindu Congress.” I said, “No, I have come here neither as a 	Hindu nor as a representative of the Congress. I have come here as 	an individual. You can talk to me as an individual or as the 	President of the League, whichever way you prefer. If you had agreed 	with Rajaji and accepted his Formula, you and he would have gone 	before your respective organizations and pleaded with them to accept 	it. That is why Rajaji came to you. You would then have placed it 	before other parties, too, in the same way. Now you and I have to do 	it.” He said he was the President of the League. Where was the 	basis for a talk if I was there representing nobody except myself? 	Who was to deliver the goods? I was the same man as he had found me 	in 1939. There was no change in me. I almost felt like saying, “Yes, 	I am the same man and since you think it is no use talking to me, I 	will go away.” But I resisted the temptation. I told him, “Is it 	not worth your while to convert an individual? I am the same man no 	doubt. You can change my views if you can and I will support you 	whole-heartedly.” “Yes, I       
 know, if I can convert you, you will be my Alilibtech_901_footnotelibtech_902_footnote,” he said.libtech_903_footnote
 He said I should concede Pakistan and he would go the whole length with me. He would go to jail, he would even face bullets. I said, “I will stand by your side to face them.” “You may not,” he said. “Try me,” I replied.
 We came back to the Formula. He wants Pakistan now, not after independence. “We  will have independence for Pakistan and Hindustan,” he said. “We should come to an agreement and then go to the Government and ask them to accept it, force them to accept our solution.” I said I could never be a party to that. I could never ask the Britishers to impose partition on India. “If you all want to separate, I can’t stop you. I have not got the power to compel you and I would not use it if I had.” He said, “The Muslims want  Pakistan.  The League represents the Muslims and it wants separation.” I said, “I agree the League is the most powerful Muslim organization. I might even concede that you as its President represent the Muslims of India, but that does not mean that all Muslims want Pakistan. Put it to the vote of all the inhabitants of the area and see.” He said, “Why should you ask non-Muslims?” I said, “You cannot possibly deprive  a section of the population of its vote. You must carry them with you, and if you are in the majority why should you be afraid?” I told him of what Kiron Shankar Roy had said to me “If the worst comes to the worst, we in Bengal will all go in Pakistan, but for goodness sake do not partition Bengal. Do not vivisect it.”
 “If you are in majority,” I said, “you will have your choice. I know it is a bad thing for you, but if you want it all the same you will have it. But that will be an adjustment between you and me. It cannot occur while the Britishers are here.”
 He began to cross-examine me on the various clauses of the Formula. I said to him, “If you want clarification of those things, is it not better to have it from the author of the Formula?” “Oh, no”, he did not want that. I said, “What is the use of your cross-examining me?”
 He recollected himself. “Oh, no. I am not cross-examining you”, and then added: “I have been a lawyer all my life and my
 
 
 manner may have suggested that I was cross-examining you.” I asked him to reduce to writing his objections to the Formula. He was disinclined. “Must I do so?” he asked. “Yes, I would like you to.” He agreed.
 In the end he said, “I would like to come to an agreement with you.” I answered, “You remember that I have said that we should meet not to separate till we had come to an agreement. He said, yes, he agreed. I suggested, “Should we put that also in our statement?”libtech_904_footnoteHe said, “No, better not. Nevertheless that will be the understanding between us and the cordiality and friendliness of our talk will be reflected in our public utterances, too.”libtech_905_footnote

Courtesy: Narandas Gandhi       September 	11, 1944  DEAR 	QUAID-E-AZAM,  	I received your letterlibtech_911_footnoteyesterday at 3.30 p.m. I was in the midst of 	appointments. I hasten to reply at the earliest opportunity.  	I have said in my letter to you, it is implied in the Rajaji Formula 	and I have stated publicly that I have approached you as an 	individual. My life mission has been Hindu-Muslim unity, which I 	want for its own sake, but which is not to be achieved without the 	foreign ruling power being ousted. Hence the first condition of the 	exercise of the right of self-determination is achieving 	independence by the joint action of all the parties and groups 	composing India. If such joint action is unfortunately impossible, 	then too. I must fight with the assistance of such elements as can 	be brought together. I am glad, therefore, that you did not break 	off our talks when I refused to assume or accept a representative 	capacity. Of course I am pledged to use all the influence I may have 	with the Congress to ratify my agreement with you. May I remind you 	that the Rajaji Formula was designed in the first instance for your 	acceptance, and submission thereafter to the League? It 	is true that I said an ocean separated you and me in outlook.     
 But that had no reference to the Lahore Resolution of the League. The Lahore Resolution is indefinite. Rajaji has taken from it the substance and given it a shape.
Now for the points raised by you:
 I 	have already answered 	this in the foregoing.  The 	constitution will 	be framed by 	the Provisional 	Government contemplated 	in the 	Formula or 	an authority specially 	set up by it 	after the 	British power is withdrawn. The 	independence 	contemplated is 	of the whole of 	India as 	it stands. 
 The basis for the formation of Provisional Interim Government will have to be agreed to between the League and the Congress.
  The 	Commission will be 	appointed by the 	Provisional Government. 	“Absolute majority” 	means a 	clear majority over 	non-Muslim elements as 	in Sind, Baluchistan or 	the Frontier Province. 	The form of 	plebiscite and 	the franchise 	must be a matter 	for discussion. “All 	parties” means, the 	parties interested.  	“Mutual 	agreement” means 	agreement between 	contracting parties. 	“Safeguarding defence, etc.,” means 	for me a 	central or 	joint board 	of control. 	Safeguarding means 	safeguarding against 	all who 	may put the common 	interests in jeopardy.  The 	power is 	to be transferred to 	the nation, 	that is, 	to the 	Provisional Government. 	The Formula 	contemplates peaceful transfer 	by the 	British Government. So 	far as 	I am 	concerned I 	would like 	the transfer to take place as early as possible.libtech_912_footnote

506,"September 11, 1944",SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING,"
    
 September 11, 1944
 Speaking in Hindustanilibtech_913_footnoteat the end of the prayers at Bombay, on September 11, Gandhiji as usual appealed for contributions to the Harijan Fund. Referring next to the exuberant affection of the crowd on the previous evening he said that after
 
 years of training such exhibition was a reflection on the good name of Bombay. It was a bad sign. But for the precautions taken on the spur of the moment he and some of the sisters accompanying him might have been hurt and so too Mr. Shantikumarlibtech_914_footnote. And what is more, in the confusion, the latter might have easily lost the Harijan purse that he was carrying. They knew how jealous he was of every pie belonging to the Harijans. Therefore he requested the public never again to repeat the performance of the day before. Why should the volunteers have to form a cordon around him? He did not want to have any guard. God alone was his guard. He was doing God’s work and he had faith that so long as He required his services He would protect him.
 Referring to his meeting with Mr. Jinnah, he said, he knew how eager they must be to be acquainted with the progress of the talks. It was a natural eagerness on their part which he would like to satisfy as far as possible consistently with the interest of the cause which they all shared with him in common.
 All that he could say at the present stage was that Jinnah Saheb and he had met as old friends on Saturday (September 9), and again that day (Monday). He added that they would be meeting again the next day from 10.30 a.m. to 1 p.m. and from 5.30 to 7 p.m. This would leave them a little time to attend to other work and to digest the substance of the talks. They fully realized what a heavy responsibility rested on their shoulders. They knew that millions were watching the talks and were anxious that a settlement should be arrived at which would subserve the interests not of any  particular group or community, but of the whole of India. Gandhiji said:
Our goal is the attainment of independence for the whole of
 India. It is for that we pray and are pledged to lay down our lives. Jinnah Saheb and I have only God between us as witness. My constant prayer these days is that He may so guide my speech that not a word might escape my lips so as to hurt the feelings of Jinnah Saheb or damage the cause that is dear to us both. I am sure the same is the case with Jinnah Saheb. He told me today, “If we part without coming to an agreement, we shall proclaim bankruptcy of wisdom on our part.” What is more, the hopes of millions of our countrymen will be dashed to pieces. Today the eyes of all the oppressed people of the world are on us. We therefore are fully alive to our responsibility and are straining every nerve to come to a settlement. But we realize that ultimately the result lies in God’s good hands. You should therefore all pray that He may guide us and give us wisdom to serve the cause of India.
 An assurance that he would not sacrifice the interests of a single individual or
 
 
 community was given by Mahatma Gandhi.libtech_915_footnote
 In conclusion, Mahatma Gandhi appealed to the Press to put a curb on their inventiveness and not to give free rein to their imagination. Since neither he nor Mr. Jinnah was opening his lips to anybody, there could be no question of leakage.

  	I have your letter. I understand what you say. I like your 	suggestion. Give on loan to the Kathiawar Khadi Mandal the money not 	already invested. When a new association is formed, it may make its 	own arrangement. Make some suggestions regarding the new 	association. Consult friends there.  	Janakibehn will not be able to go. Chi.

If the programme does not succeed so well there this time 	as in the previous years, console yourself with the thought that it 	is your own venture that has now become a country-wide movement. If, 	therefore, your little rivulet, which was the source, looks small in 	comparison, you should not feel bad about it. Whether I will live 	long enough to see the National Fund put to good use or whether 	others who follow me will manage it in a worthy manner, is entirely 	in God’s hands. For us one step is enough.

A. JINNAHlibtech_916_footnote","
    
 September 12, 1944 GANDHIJI: He drew a very alluring picture of the Government of Pakistan. It would be a perfect democracy. I asked him if he had not
 told me that democracy did not suit Indian conditions. He did not remember it. He asked me to tell him what he had said. So I told him all that and said that I might have misunderstood him. In that case he should correct me. But when I repeated in detail what he had said, he could not say no. He said, yes, he had said that, but that was with regard to imposed democracy.
 Then he said, “Do you think it is a question of religious minority with us?” I said, “Yes.” If not, he should tell me what it was. He harangued. I won’t repeat all that here. I asked him what would happen to the other minorities in  Pakistan:  Sikhs,  Christians, Depressed Classes, etc. He said they would be part of Pakistan. I asked him if he meant joint electorates. He knew I was coming to it. He said, yes, he would like them to be a part of the whole. He would explain the advantages of joint electorates, but if they wanted separate electorates they would have it. Sikhs would have Gurumukhi if they wanted and the Pakistan Government would give them financial aid. I asked, “What about Jats?” At first he pooh-poohed the idea. Then he said, “If they want it, they will also have it. They will have separate existence if they want it.” I said, “What about Christians? They also want some place where they are in a majority and where they can rule, as for instance in Travancore?” He said that was a problem for the Hindus. I said supposing Travancore was in Pakistan? He said he would give it to them. He cited the instance of Newfoundland. The rest of the talk was nothing. I am to continue exploring his mind.libtech_917_footnote

 September 14, 1944
 DEAR QUAID-E-AZAM,
 I have your letter of the 13th instant.libtech_920_footnotelibtech_921_footnoteI  understood  from  our talks that you were in no hurry for my answer I was, therefore, taking the matter in a leisurely fashion, even hoping that as our  talks proceeded and as cordiality increased, mutual clarification  would  come of itself and that we would only have to record our final agreement. But I understand and appreciate the other viewpoint. We should take nothing for granted. I should clarify your difficulties in understanding the Rajaji Formula and you should do likewise  regarding yours, i.e., the Muslim League Lahore Resolution of 1940.
 
 With reference to the Lahore Resolution, as agreed between us I shall deal with it in a separate letter.
 Perhaps at the end of our discussion, we shall discover that Rajaji not only has not put the Lahore Resolution out of shape and mutilated it but has given it substance and form.
 Indeed, in view of your dislike of the Rajaji Formula, I have, at any rate for the moment, put it out of my mind and  I  am concentrating on the Lahore Resolution in the hope of finding a ground for mutual agreement.
So much for the first paragraph of your letter.
 As to the second, I do hold that unless we oust the third party we shall not be able to live at peace with one another. That does not mean that I may not make an effort to find ways and means of establishing a living peace between us.
 You ask for my conception of the basis for a provisional interim government. I would have told you if I had any scheme in mind. I imagine that if we two can agree it would be for us to consult the other parties. I can say this, that any provisional government to inspire confidence at the present moment must represent all parties. When that moment arrives, I shall have been replaced by some authoritative person, though you will have me always at your beck and call when you have converted me or I you, or by mutual conversion we have become one mind functioning through two bodies.
 As to the third point, the provisional government, being the appointing authority, will give effect to the findings of the Commission. This I thought was implied in my previous answer.
 Rajaji tells me that ‘absolute majority’ is used in his Formula in the same sense as it is used in ordinary legal parlance wherever more than two groups are dealt with. I cling to my own answer. But you will perhaps suggest a third meaning and persuade me to accept it.
 The form of the plebiscite and franchise must be left to be decided by the provisional interim government unless we decide it now. I should say it should be by adult suffrage of all the inhabitants of the Pakistan area.
 As to the fourth, ‘all parties’ means you and I and everyone else holding views on the question at issue will and should  seek  by peaceful persuasion to influence public opinion as is done where democracy functions wholly or in part.
 
 As to the fifth, supposing that the result of the plebiscite is in favour of partition, the provisional government will draft the treaty and agreements as regards the administration of matters of common interest, but the same has to be confirmed and ratified by the governments of the two States. The machinery required for the settlement and administration of matters of common interest will, in the first instance, be planned by the interim government, but subsequ- ently will be matter for settlement between the two governments acting through the agencies appointed by each for that purpose.
 As to the sixth, I hope the foregoing makes superfluous any further reply.libtech_922_footnote

514,"September 15, 1944",LETTER TO M. A. JINNAH,"
    
 September 15, 1944
 
DEAR QUAID-E-AZAM,
This is in terms of our talks of Wednesday the 13th instant.
 For the moment I have shunted the Rajaji Formula and with your assistance am applying my mind very seriously to the famous Lahore Resolution of the Muslim League.
 You must admit that the Resolution itself makes no reference to the two nations theory. In the course of our discussions, you have passionately pleaded that India contains two nations, i.e., Hindus and Muslims, and that the latter have their homelands in India as the former have theirs. The more our argument progresses, the more alarming your picture appears to me. It would be alluring if it was true. But my fear is growing that it is wholly unreal. I find no parallel in history for a body of converts and their descendants claiming to be a nation apart from the parent stock. If India was one nation before the advent of Islam, it must remain one in spite of the change of faith of a very large body of her children.
 You do not claim to be a separate nation by right of conquest, but by reason of acceptance of Islam. Will the two nations become
 
 one if the whole of India accepted Islam? Will Bengalis, Oriyas, Andhras, Tamilians, Maharashtrians, Gujaratis, etc., cease to have their special characteristics if all of them become converts to Islam? These have all become one politically because they are subject to oneforeign control. They are trying today to throw off that subjection.
 You seem to have introduced a new test of nationhood. If I accept it, I would have to subscribe to many more claims and face an insoluble problem. The only real, though awful, test of our  nationhood arises out of our common political subjection. If you and I throw off this subjection by our combined effort, we shall be born a politically free nation out of our travail. If by then we have not learnt to prize our freedom, we may quarrel among ourselves and, for want of a common master holding us together in his iron grip, seek to split up into small groups or nationalities. There will be nothing to prevent us from descending to that level and we shall not have to go in search of a master. There are many claimants to  the  throne  that  never remains vacant.
 With this background, I shall present you with my difficulty in accepting your Resolution.
 I. Pakistan is not in the Resolution. Does it bear the original meaning Punjab, Afghanistan, Kashmir, Sind and Baluchistan, out of which the name was mnemonically formed? If not what is it?
 Is 	the goal 	of Pakistan pan-Islam?  What 	is it that 	distinguishes an 	Indian Muslim from 	every other 	Indian, if 	not his religion? 	Is he different 	from a 	Turk or 	an Arab?  What 	is the Connotation of 	the word “Muslims” in the Resolution 	under discussion? 	Does it 	mean the 	Muslims of 	India of 	geography or 	of the Pakistan 	to be?  Is 	the Resolution addressed 	to the Muslims by 	way of education, 	or to the 	inhabitants of 	the whole of 	India by way 	of appeal, or 	to the foreign 	ruler as an ultimatum?  Are 	the constituents in the two zones 	to constitute 	“Independent States”, 	an undefined 	number in 	each zone?  Is 	the demarcation 	to take place 	during the 	pendency of 	British Rule?  If 	the answer 	to the 	last question 	is in the 	affirmative, the 	proposal must 	be accepted 	first by Britain 	and then 	imposed upon 
 
 India, not evolved from within by the free will of the people of India.
  Have 	you examined the 	position and 	satisfied yourself 	that these 	“Independent States” will 	be materially 	and otherwise 	benefited by 	being split up 	into fragments?  Please 	satisfy me that 	these Independent 	Sovereign States will 	not become 	a collection 	of poor 	States, a 	menace to 	themselves and 	to the 	rest of India.  Pray 	show me by facts 	and figures 	or otherwise 	how the 	independence and 	welfare of 	India as 	a whole 	can be 	brought about 	by the 	acceptance of 	the Resolution?  How 	are the Muslims under 	the Princes 	to be disposed 	of as 	a result 	of this scheme? What 	is your 	definition of “minorities”?  Will 	you please 	define the 	“adequate, effective 	and mandatory 	safeguards” for 	minorities referred to 	in the second 	part of 	the Resolution?  Do 	you not see that the 	Lahore Resolution 	contains only 	a bare 	statement of 	the objective 	and does not give any 	idea as to the 	means to be adopted 	for the 	execution of the 	idea and  the 	 concrete corollaries 	thereof? For 	instance: (a) 	Are the people in 	the regions 	falling under the 	plan to have 	any voice in 	the matter 	of separation 	and, if 	so, how is 	it to be ascertained? 	(b) What 	is the 	provision for 	Defence and 	similar matters of 	common concern 	contemplated in the 	Lahore Resolution? (c) 	There are many groups of 	Muslims who 	have continuously 	expressed dissent from the 	policy of 	the League. 	While I am 	prepared to 	accept the 	preponderating influence 	and position 	of the 	League and 	have approached you 	for that very reason, is 	it not our 	joint duty to 	remove their doubts and 	carry them with us 	by making them 	feel that they and their 	supporters have 	not been practically 	disfranchised? (d) 	Does this not lead again to 	placing the 	Resolution of 	the League 	before the people 	of the 	zones concerned 	as a 	whole for acceptance? 
 As I write this letter and imagine the working of the Resolution in practice, I see nothing but ruin for the whole of India. Believe me, I approach you as a seeker. Though I represent nobody but myself, I aspire to represent all the inhabitants of India, for I realize in my own person their misery and degradation, which is their common lot, irrespective of class, caste or creed. I know that you have acquired a
 unique hold on the Muslim masses. I want you to use your influence for their total welfare, which must include the rest.
 In this hastily written letter, I have only given an inkling of my difficulty.

LETTER TO M. A. JINNAH","
 September 15, 1944
 
DEAR QUAID-E-AZAM,
I have yours of the 14th instant,libtech_923_footnotelibtech_924_footnotereceived at 9.40 a.m.
 I woke up at 3 a.m. today to finish my promised letterlibtech_925_footnoteon the Lahore Resolution.
 There is no mistake about the date, for I wrote in answer to your reminder of the 13th instant.
 Independence does mean as envisaged in the A.I.C.C. Resolution of 1942. But it cannot be on the basis of a united India. If we come to a settlement, it would be on the basis of the settlement, assuming, of course, that it accrues general acceptance in the country. The process will be somewhat like this. We reach by joint effort independence for India as it stands. India becoming free will proceed to demarcation, plebiscite and partition if the people concerned vote for partition. All this is implied in the Rajaji Formula.
 As to the provisional interim government, I am afraid I cannot carry my answer any further than I have done. Though I have no scheme for the provisional government, if you have one in connection with the Lahore Resolution, which also, I presume, requires an interim government, we can discuss it.
 The Formula was framed by Rajaji in good faith. I accepted it in equal good faith. The hope was that you would look at it with favour. We still think it to be the best in the circumstances. You and I have to put flesh on it, if we can. I have explained the process we have to go through. You have no objection to it. Perhaps, you want to know how I would form the provisional government if I was invited thereto. If I
 
 was in that unenviable position, I would see all the claimants and endeavour to satisfy them. My co-operation will be available in that task.
 I can give you full satisfaction about your inquiry, “What I would like to know would be, what will be the powers of such a provisional interim government, how it will be formed, to whom it will be responsible.” The provisional interim government will be responsible to the elected members of the present Assembly or a  newly elected one. It will have all the powers less that of the Commander-in-Chief’during the war and full powers thereafter. It will be the authority to give effect to the agreement that may be arrived at between the League and the Congress and ratified by the other parties.
 Yours sincerely,

  	I read your letter addressed to Manilal. I have some free time today 	and, therefore, am writing letters.  	I have written to Sharda and told her that she should not put off 	her visit for fear of public criticism.  	Your idea of disbanding the Ashram seems right. We should let 	ourselves be seen as we are. We are likely to make better progress 	as individuals after disbanding the Ashram. Even after it is 	disbanded, those who are one at heart may stay together and jointly 	take up some activity. Those who wish to stay on in Sevagram may do  	so. Everybody may leave in an orderly manner and after due thought. 	Talk and exchange views among yourselves along these lines.  	I understand what you say regarding me. It should involve no burden 	on Chhaganlal and Kashi. Neither of them should have to join 	directly in the cooking. This 	letter may be read by all concerned.  	I hope Shakaribehn is perfectly calm. You must have thought about 	the problem of her training. It must not be neglected.  Blessings 	from  BAPU

 CHI. MUNNALAL AND KANCHAN,
 My return has been delayed. If I had definitely known that I would be staying here so long, I would have brought Kanchan with me. Still, if she had come, God knows what she would have done because I hardly talk with anyone. She would not have been able to serve me either. The chief service is being done by Dinshawji, and the rest by Manilal. From that point of view, therefore, it is all to the good that Kanchan stayed there. Both of you got an opportunity for introspection.
 I hope you meet Bhai Patil often. His health must  have improved.

522,"September 16, 1944",523. SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING,"
 September 16, 1944
 Gandhiji said that at prayer time there was usually great rush. People came to him to give money for the Harijan Fund and to take autographs. Due to this, children and weak persons experienced considerable difficulty every day. Gandhiji, therefore, said that only those who wanted autographs or who wanted to give him money should stay behind while the rest should leave the prayer ground immediately the prayers were over.
 Secondly he said that the moment he started moving, everybody rushed after him. This caused trouble. Women and children were put to inconvenience. At Juhu there was a lot of space. Though there was not as much space here, there was enough. There was no need to crowd. If nobody crowded and followed him, people would be able to go away from the prayer ground soon. They would be happy and he would be comfortable. He would also be able to collect money and give autographs at leisure.
 Thirdly Gandhiji said that the prayers began with a Buddhist invocation followed by two minutes’ silence. The silence was an integral part of the prayer. He found people talking during the silence. When silence was a part of prayer they should close their eyes and contemplate. Nobody should talk. This was the proper behaviour and correct discipline. Everyone should observe this discipline.

And don’t you have there veterans like Nanalallibtech_933_footnoteand Nanabhailibtech_934_footnote?  	Why be tired of collecting money? An area which has need for a 	certain kind of work will always provide funds for the activity. 	True, there are different ways of working in an area where such need 	is not felt. However, if a worker wants to collect funds in 	connection with his work and he enjoys doing it, he also learns 	through it. If funds were showered on us from above, we would not 	have known how to use them.      
 If Bhagwanjilibtech_935_footnotegives us work worth Rs. 80 doesn’t it become our duty to pay him an equal amount?
 Are we not at present using the building of the Kelavni Mandal? Why do they want to evict us from there?
 If they did, where would you carry on your work? Why not in the Dhedh or Bhangi colony?
 As for Bhangwanji, he is already used to  working  in  this manner. You seem to feel embarrassed. Come over whenever you wish to. Nothing is definite about me, so you can even come over here. You can accompany me wherever I might proceed from here, in case I am unable to spare any time here.

 DEAR QUAID-E-AZAM,
 Many thanks for yourslibtech_960_footnoteof the 17th instant. I am sorry to have to say that your answers omitting 1, 2 and 6 do not give satisfaction.
 It may be that all my questions do not arise from the view of mere clarification of the Lahore Resolution. But I contend that they are very relevant from the standpoint of a seeker that I am. You cannot expect anyone to agree to or shoulder the burden of the claim contained in the Lahore Resolution without, for instance, answering my questions 15 (a) and 15 (b)libtech_961_footnotelibtech_962_footnotewhich you brush aside as not arising by way of clarification.
 Dr. Ambedkar’s thesis, while it is ably written, has carried no conviction to me. The other book mentioned by you, I am sorry to say, I have not seen.
 Why can you not accept my statement that I aspire to represent all the sections that compose the people of India? Do you not aspire? Should not every Indian? That the aspiration may never be realized is beside the point.
 I am beholden to you, in spite of your opinion about me, for having patience with me. I hope you will never lose it, but will persevere in your effort to convert me. I ask you to take me with my strong views and even prejudices, if I am guilty of any.
 As to your verdict on my policy and programme, we must agree to differ. For, I am wholly unrepentant. My purpose is as a lover of communal unity to place my services at your disposal.
 I hope you do not expect me to accept the Lahore Resolution without understanding its implications. If your letter is the final word, there is little hope. Can we not agree to differ on the question of “two nation” and yet solve the problem on the basis of self-determination? It is this basis that has brought me to you. If the regions holding Muslim majorities have to be separated according to the Lahore
 
 Resolution, the grave step of separation should be specifically placed before and approved by the people in that area.libtech_963_footnote"
539,"September 	19, 1944",SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING,"
     The 	Hindu, 29-9-1944       Yours sincerely,  M. K. GANDHI         BOMBAY, 
  September 	19, 1944  In 	the course 	of his 	speech at 	the prayer 	meeting, Gandhiji said that he 	did not 	know how 	many Muslim brothers and 	sisters were there in 	the audience but 	there was 	at least 	one, namely, Raihanabehn Tyabjee. That was 	enough for 	his present purpose. 	His earnest 	prayer to all 	present was 	that if they 	had the good of the 	country at 	heart and 	wanted India to 	be free and 	independent at 	the earliest 	moment they should 	establish the 	closest bonds 	of friendship 	between Hindus and 	Mussalmans and 	members of 	all other 	communities. That 	was the least 	that every one of 	them was 	expected to do and 	could do. 	Was there anyone among 	them who doubted 	that if they 	could become one 	at heart 	the coming of 	independence would 	be accelerated? 	Ever since 	his return 	to India 	he had been 	proclaiming that truth from house-tops. That did 	not mean that they could 	afford to rest 	in idleness 	and freedom 	would by itself 	drop into 	their lap. If that 	was realized 	many other things would 	follow as a 	matter of 	course.  Referring 	to his 	talks with 	Mr. Jinnah he 	said that he 	considered it 	to be their great 	good fortune that they—two brothers—were having their friendly 	talks. He was not 	at liberty 	to divulge 	the nature 	of their 	talks. But they 	could rest satisfied that 	they were not talking 	without hope. The day he 	felt that there 	was no 	more hope, 	he would 	not hesitate 	to say so. He wanted 	them all to fraternize 	with one another 	on the Id Day and pray that God 	may guide them aright.  Concluding, 	he warned the people against putting faith in speculations in which 	both the foreign and the Indian Press were indulging.  Sometimes 	they found all 	kinds of 	prophecies. God 	was with them. They were 	not being 	led by prophecies, 	but by 	the spirit 	of God. 	The papers published all 	kinds of guesses and 	messages were also sent abroad. It would not benefit the people to 	depend  on these reports. It would, in fact, be wrong to believe in them.  The 	Bombay Chronicle, 20-9-1944

I do not 	remember the pundit mentioned by you. Your question is very 	appropriate. My interpretation of the Mahabharata is that it 	is a penetrating study of man and shows that fruits of violence 	whether used for a good cause or bad are evil. The Pandavas won but 	an empty victory. Bhishma was right in accordance with the social 	usage in vogue in those days. He was true to the salt he ate. We 	would go entirely wrong in estimating the men and women of the 	Mahabharata    
 according to the modern standard, which need not be considered necessarily higher than in the times of the Mahabharata. The story of the epic has to be read in its setting. Then Bhishma would appear to be a lofty soul."

       BOMBAY, 
     BHAISHRI,  September 	21, 1944 
  	I am writing this circular in Gujarati since all those to whom I 	intend to send it know the language. I send with this a list of ten 	additional trustees. At first I thought I would send the names 	merely for your information. As my duty becomes clearer to me, I 	realize that I must function as Chairman without insisting on having 	my own way. A list of members of the Executive Committee is also 	attached.  	I have kept the following considerations in mind in drawing up both 	these lists. We should include those who understand my method of 	work best and who have had some experience of village work or who 	share my point of view regarding village work. I am painfully aware 	that I have not been able to include as many women as I should have 	liked to. This Memorial Fund is in memory of an uneducated woman who 	had been touched by the ideal of service to villages, and it would, 	therefore, be but fitting that the Board consists wholly of women. I 	would then feel that my efforts in this field have been fully 	rewarded. But the time for this has not yet come. Let us all hope 	that such mature and able women will get trained up for this work.  	You may, without any hesitation whatever, reject any names in the 	list which you disapprove of. If you wish, we may elect the 	additional members at a meeting of the trustees. Kindly send me your 	opinion at an early date. List 	of additional  trustees:  Shri 		Mangaldas Pakvasa Smt. 		Ashadevi Aryanayakum Smt. 		Gosibehn Captain Smt. 		Raihana Tyabji Smt.

	LETTER TO M. A. JINNAH","
     September 	22, 1944  DEAR 	QUAID-E-AZAM,  	Your letter of yesterdaylibtech_969_footnote(21st instant) so disturbed me that I thought I would 	postpone my reply till after we had met at the usual time. Though I 	made no advance at our meeting, I think I see some what clearly what 	you are driving at. The more I think about the     
 two-nation theory the more alarming it appears to be. The book recommended by you gives me no help. It contains half-truths and its conclusions or inferences are unwarranted. I am unable to accept the proposition that the Muslims of India are a nation, distinct from the rest of the inhabitants of India. Mere assertion is no proof. The consequences of accepting such a proposition are dangerous in the extreme. Once the principle is admitted there would be no limit to claims for cutting up India into numerous divisions, which would spell India’s ruin. I have, therefore, suggested a way out. Let it  be  a partition as between two brothers, if a division there must be.
 You seem to be averse to a plebiscite. In spite of the admitted importance of the League, there must be clear proof that the people affected desire partition. In my opinion, all the people inhabiting the area ought to express their opinion specifically on this single issue of division. Adult suffrage is the best method, but I would accept any other equivalent.
 You summarily reject the idea of common interest between the two arms. I can be no willing party to a division which does not provide for the simultaneous safeguarding of common interests, such as Defence, Foreign Affairs and the like. There will be no feeling of security by the people of India without a recognition of the nutural and mutual obligations arising out of physical contiguity.
 Your letter shows a wide divergence of opinion and outlook between us. Thus you adhere to the opinion often expressed by you that the August 1942 Resolution is “inimical to the ideals and demands of Muslim India”. There is no proof for this sweeping statement.
 We seem to be moving in a circle. I have made a suggestion. If we are bent on agreeing, as I hope we are, let us call in a third party or parties to guide or even arbitrate between uslibtech_970_footnote.

  September 24, 1944 Whoever 	has given currency to the news about the Sevagram Ashram has not 	served the cause of truth. The only truth about the news 	is that the  disbandment  and  transformation  of   the   Sevagram  	Ashram is under contemplation. No decision has yet been taken. But 	the suggestion that it has anything to do with my supposed 	dissatisfaction with the conduct of the Ashram during my 	incarceration is altogether untrue. On the contrary I have expressed 	my unstinted admiration for the single-minded devotion with which 	they carried on the Ashram under those difficult and anxious 21 	months. If it is ultimately decided to disband the Ashram it would 	be for the purpose of raising the activities of the members to a 	higher level than heretofore.  The 	Bombay Chronicle, 25-9-1944       September 	24, 1944   DEAR QUAID-E-AZAM,  	I have your two letters of September 23libtech_980_footnotelibtech_981_footnotein 	reply to my letters of the 22nd and 23rd.  	With your assistance, I am exploring the possibilities of reaching 	an agreement, so that the claim embodied in the Muslim League 	Resolution of Lahore may be reasonably satisfied. You must, 	therefore, have no apprehensions that the August Resolution will 	stand in the way of our reaching an agreement. That Resolution dealt 	with the question of India as against Britain, and it cannot stand 	in the way of our settlement.  	I proceed on the assumption that India is not to be regarded as two 	or more nations, but as one family consisting of many members     
 of whom the Muslims living in the north-west zones, i.e., Baluchistan, Sind, North-West Frontier Province and that part of the Punjab where they are in absolute majority over all the other elements and in parts of Bengal and Assam where they are in absolute majority, desire to live in separation from the rest of India. Differing from you on the general basis, I can yet recommend to the Congress and the country the acceptance of the claim for separation contained in the Muslim League Resolution of Lahore, 1940, on my basis and on the following terms:
 The areas should be demarcated by a commission, approved by the Congress and the League. The wishes of the inhabitants of the area demarcated should be ascertained through the votes of the adult population of the areas or through some equivalent method.
 If the vote is in favour of separation, it shall be agreed that these areas shall form a separate State as soon as possible after India is free from foreign domination and can, therefore, be constituted into two sovereign independent States.
 There shall be a treaty of separation, which should also provide for the efficient and satisfactory administration of Foreign Affairs, Defence, Internal Communications, Customs, Commerce and the like, which must necessarily continue to be matters of common interest between the contracting parties. The treaty shall also contain terms for safeguarding the rights of minorities in the two States. Immediately on the acceptance of this agreement by the Congress and the League, the two shall decide upon a common course of action for the attainment of the independence of India.
 The League will, however, be free to remain out of any direct action, to which the Congress may resort and in which the League may not be willing to participate.
 If you do not agree to these terms, could you let me know in precise terms what you would have me to accept in terms of  the Lahore Resolution and bind myself to recommend to the Congress? If you could kindly do this, I shall be able to see, apart from the difference in approach, what definite terms I can agree to. In your letter of 23rd September, you refer to “the basis and fundamental principles embodied in the Lahore Resolution” and ask me to accept
 them. Surely, this is unnecessary when, as I feel, I have accepted the concrete consequence that should follow from such acceptance.libtech_982_footnote

       September 	24, 1944  Jinnah 	had refused even to discuss Bapu’s proposal, as he (Bapu) was not 	vested with authority; he represented nobody.

Then he came to the August (1942) 	Resolution. He said it was inimical to Muslims. “But don’t you 	see that it is absolutely a baseless charge? With all the legal 	acumen that is attributed to you, why cannot you see that it deals 	with only India and the British rule? It has nothing to do with the 	Muslims. You can refer the matter to a lawyer of eminence 	impersonally and take his opinion whether there is anything in it     
 which could be considered inimical to the Muslim League or the Muslims.” He said he did not need to do so. “Why should I want another’s opinion when I know it for myself?” I broached the subject that I had fixed up to be at Sevagram on the 2nd October. I would like to leave on the 30th and would be back in four or five days. He said, “Why must we take so long? We had better close up now. I will have everything ready on Tuesday. You will examine the copieslibtech_984_footnotelibtech_985_footnoteand I will do so.” He had the introduction also ready and read it out. I said I had nothing to say against it, but if I had a copy I could examine it. He said I could do so on Tuesday. I said all right. He would not have a third party, nor would he produce his own scheme. He condemned the August Resolution. He suggested in so many words that amends should be made, i.e., it should be retracted.

MY DEAR C. R.,
 If you are satisfied that my letter of yesterdaylibtech_989_footnoteis the last word you should do the following:
  You 	should ask 	Jinnah to 	see you. He 	told me 	he had nothing 	against you, 	etc. If Bhulabhai 	has thoroughly 	understood the position 	he too may see Jinnah. You may both offer to see him together. 
 
 
  I 	attach great 	importance to 	the legal 	opinion on 	Jinnah’s 	interpretation of 	August Resolution. Consider 	the following 	letter to Jinnah: 
 “MY DEAR QUAID-E-AZAM,
 Yesterday’s talklibtech_990_footnoteleads me to inflict this letter on you for which please forgive me.
 I see force in your argument that the paralibtech_991_footnotein my letter of yesterday can be interpreted to touch the League sensitiveness. Please therefore read the following instead: ‘Any member or group from among the Congress or the League members will be free to resort to direct action including C. R. in the course of the campaign of Independence.’ This is however a minor matter. In the context in which the offending paragraph appears, its friendly intention is unmistakable.
 The main purpose of this letter is to ask you to think fifty times before you throw away my offer. It is an earnest effort to meet essential requirements of the Lahore Resolution. I would like you, before you reject it, to let me address the League Council, indeed even the open session of the League.
 I ask you not to take responsibility on your shoulders of  rejecting my offer. You are too technical when you dismiss my proposal for arbitration or guidance on the ground that I have approached you as an individual and not in any  representative capacity. Is it not enough that I have approached you in the spirit of service in the cause of unity?
 I repeat the suggestion I made you during our talk of yesterday that counsel’s opinion should be invited on your interpretation of the August (1942) Resolution of the A. I. C. C. Rajaji for whose integrity and legal ability you have high regard, agrees with me that the August Resolution is in no way inimical to the Muslims. You are wrong in saying that the Congress is a Hindu or communal organization. Will you be inimical to non-Muslims if the League fought single-handed for the Independence of the whole of India whether considered as one India or two or more?”

DEAR QUAID-E-AZAM,
 Yesterday’s talk leads me to inflict this letter on you, which I trust you will not mind.
 Our conversations have come about as a result of your correspondence with Rajaji in July last over his Formula and your consultations with the League Working Committee thereon, and my own letterlibtech_992_footnoteto you suggesting a meeting between you and me.   My proposal of yesterday is an earnest effort to meet the essential requirements of the Lahore Resolution. I would like you, therefore, to think fifty times before throwing away an offer which had been made entirely in the spirit of service in the cause of communal harmony. Do not take, I pray, the responsibility of rejecting the offer. Throw it on your Council. Give me an opportunity of addressing them. If they feel like rejecting it, I would like you to advise the Council to put it before the open session of the League. If you will accept my advice and permit me, I would attend the open session and address it.
 You are too technical when you dismiss my proposal for arbitration or outside guidance over points of difference. If I have approached you as an individual, and not in any representative capacity, it is because we believe that if I reach an agreement with you, it will be of material use in the process of securing a Congress-League settlement and acceptance of it by the country. Is it irrelevant or inadmissible to supplement our efforts to convince each other without help, guidance, advice or even arbitration?

 DEAR QUAID-E-AZAM,
 In view of my letter to you of yesterday, left to myself, I would have  refrained  from  dealing  with  your  letterlibtech_993_footnotebefore  our  meeting today. But I have deferred to Rajaji’s advice to finish the chain of correspondence.
 I confess I am unable to understand your persistent refusal to appreciate the fact that the Formula presented to you by me in my letter of the 24th as well as the Formula presented to you by Rajaji give you virtually what is embodied in the Lahore Resolution, providing at the same time what is absolutely necessary to make the arrangement acceptable to the country. You keep on saying that I should accept certain theses, while I have been contending that the best way for us, who differ in our approach to the problem, is to give body to the demand as it stands in the Resolution and work it out to our mutual satisfaction. It is on this plan that I understand Rajaji’s Formula is to be conceived, and it is on the same plan that I have tried to work it out in the course of and as a result of our talks. I contend that either gives you the substance of the Lahore Resolution. Unfortunately, you reject both. And I cannot accept the Lahore Resolution as you want me to, especially when you seek to introduce into its interpretation theories and claims which I cannot accept and which I cannot ever hope to induce India to accept.
 Your constant references to my not being clothed with representative authority are really irrelevant. I have approached you so that, if you and I can agree upon a common course of action, I may use what influence I possess for its acceptance by the Congress and the country. If you break, it cannot be because I have no representative capacity, or because I have been unwilling to give you satisfaction in regard to the claim embodied in the Lahore Resolution.libtech_994_footnote

        From 	the Gujarati original: S.N. 33078         Blessings 	from  BAPU         BOMBAY 	, 
  September 27, 1944 Gandhiji said he was not addressing them in Hindustani as before, because he wanted his words to go straight to the hearts of the audience, most of whom were  Gujaratis. 	He had particularly the women in mind who were not accustomed to 	Hindustani speech.  Referring 	to the leakage of 	the correspondence 	between him  and 	Quaide-e-Azam and 	its unauthorized 	publication in a 	certain section of 	the Press, 	he observed 	that he 	had warnedlibtech_999_footnotethe Press 	before against 	indulging in 	conjectures, because 	he felt 	that would damage the 	cause. But 	what had 	appeared in 	the Press now 	was more than a mere 	conjecture. It 	seemed that 	they had somehow managed 	to get 	actual copies of 	the correspondence. 	Perhaps it was 	clever on 	their part, but 	that did them 	little credit. Journalism, like every institution, had 	its own code of 	ethics and 	he was 	not there to pass 	judgment. All 	he could 	say was that he himself 	had, perhaps, 	followed a different code of ethics even in the field of journalism.  He 	assured them that the 	leakage had 	not occurred from his 	office, and 	he had 	strong reasons for his 	belief. He had the other day drawn the Quaid-e-Azam’s attention  	to the leakage, but 	the Quaid-e-Azam was 	indifferent. Public men 	had to cultivate that 	indifference, or 	else life would 	become impossible. But it 	was for the public 	not to 	take relish 	in such 	happenings. If 	the public 	strongly disapproved all 	such practices, the Press would not repeat them. It was intolerable that anyone should try to pry into     
 and give publicity to private correspondence without authority.
 He told them that when the talks were over, he would let them know the result. That stage had been reached yesterday, but as copies of the correspondence were not ready, its actual release had to be postponed till today. Authorized copies of the correspondence had now been sent to the Press with a prefatory statement by the Quaid-e-Azam.
 Hitherto he had told them that he was not without hope with regard to the outcome of the talks. He had to confess that the result that he was hoping for had not materialized. But he had no sense of disappointment or despondency. He was  convinced that even out of that breakdown good would result.
 Although Quaid-e-Azam and he had known each other fairly well in public life before, they had never come into such close personal contact. Their conversations were carried out with friendliness and cordiality. He wanted all the communities to cultivate the same spirit of friendliness and cordiality in their relations with one another. They should try to convert one another through it.
 They might ask, “Why was it then that he and the Quaid-e-Azam had failed to convert each other?” His reply was that he had tried his level best to go as far as he could to meet the Quaid-e-Azam’s viewpoint. He had taken incalculable pains to understand him and to make himself understood. But he had failed.
 He had placed before the Quaid-e-Azam Rajaji’s Formula, but that did not commend itself to him. He had thereupon put forth another proposal of his own in its place, but even that had failed to secure Jinnah Saheb’s approval. In the same way, Jinnah Saheb’s proposal had failed to commend itself to him. If either of them had been weak, they would have possibly come to some sort of agreement, but as responsible men they could not afford to be weak. A helmsman had to be firm and unwavering, or else the ship would founder upon the rocks. Each one of them had tried  to convince the other. It was possible that both of them might be in the wrong. But so long as each felt himself to be in the right, he could not let go his hold.
 The news of breakdown, he knew, would cause grief to the friends of India and might give cause for jubilation to their enemies. He drew their attention to the last sentence in hislibtech_1000_footnotestatement in which he had said that it was not the final end of their effort.
 Although they had been unable to appreciate each other’s viewpoint, the public could help them to do so. They should not lose heart. If there was anyone who had reason to feel disappointed it was he. He had knocked at the Quaid-e-Azam’s door. But he had already observed there was no despondency in him. It was not for a votary
 
 Appendix “M. A. Jinnah’s Statement”, 27-9-1944.
 of truth and non-violence to feel despondent if his effort at times failed to yield the result aimed at. Failure should only serve as a spur to further effort. God alone knew what was best for them. It was not for them to question God’s ways. Therefore, instead  of feeling despondent, they should regard the breakdown as a challenge to their faith and as an incentive for greater effort for establishing true unity among the various communities.

567,"September 28, 1944","INTERVIEW TO THE
PRESSlibtech_1007_footnote","
    
 September 28, 1944 It is a matter of deep regret that we two could not reach an agreement. But there is no cause for disappointment. The breakdown
is  only so-called. It is an adjournment  sine die.  Each one of us  must
 now talk to the public and put our viewpoints before them. If we do so dispassionately and if the public cooperate, we may reach a solution of the seemingly insoluble at an early date. My experience of the previous three weeks confirms me in the view that the presence of a third power hinders the solution. A mind enslaved cannot act as if it was free. I need not impute base motives to the rulers to prove what seems to me to be an axiomatic truth. Nevertheless, I am going to continue to work for the solution as I have been during these three weeks. The questions for consideration are simple. Has the Rajaji Formula or mine made a reasonable approach to the Lahore Resolution? If they or either of them is such an approach, all parties, and especially the members of the Muslim League, should ask the Quaid-e-Azam to revise his opinion. If Rajaji and I have stultified the Lahore Resolution we should be educated. The chief thing is for the Press and the public to avoid partisanship and bitterness.
 To a question on his future plans, whether he proposed to concentrate on a Hindu-Muslim settlement or take up political work, seeking imprisonment if necessary, Mahatma Gandhi replied:
I shall act as my inner voice tells me.
 Asked how far the offer he had made had conceded the demand made in the Lahore Resolution of the League, Mahatma Gandhi emphasized that the Rajaji  Formula or the formula that he presented conceded the substance of the League demand. He said:
In my opinion, either formula gives as much as can reasonably
be expected with due regard to the interests of the whole of India.
 In answer to a question whether his offer was to be treated now as withdrawn, he said that so far as he was concerned the offer he had made stood. It was not made in
 
 
 M. Y. Nurie, Dr. M. D. D. Gilder and S. K. Patil were among others present. Gandhiji first read out his statement.
 any bargaining spirit. He said:
 I think it is a just solution of the problem and it is in the spirit of the policy which the Congress has consistently adopted in connection with the communal question, namely, self-determination.
 A number of questions were put on the representative character of the two leaders who conducted the negotiations and why Mahatma Gandhi prolonged the talks when he was apprised of Mr. Jinnah’s views on the first day of the talks. Mahatma Gandhi answered:
I am a man reputed to have inexhaustible patience and I had no
 reason to despair of either being converted by the Quaid-e-Azam or in my turn converting him. Therefore, so long as there was  the slightest possibility, I clung to the hope that we shall pull through to a solution. Haste in such cases is a most dangerous thing. You should, therefore, conclude that yesterday was really the moment when the public should have been taken into confidence. As for myself, I am entirely satisfied that we have not wasted these three weeks. I have no doubt whatsoever that we know now each other better than ever before.
 When you agreed to meet Mr. Jinnah, did you meet him on the basis that he was the sole representative of the Muslims?
I have never admitted that claim, but I have said throughout that
 the Muslim League is by far the most representative Muslim organization. It would have been folly on my part not to recognize this, but I have always been aware that there is outside the League a large body of Muslims which does not see eye to eye with the League and which does not believe in the two nations theory.
 Mahatma Gandhi asserted that the fight for freedom had not been suspended when he approached the Quaid-e-Azam. He said:
My approach to the Quaid-e-Azam was itself a part of the fight
for freedom.
 Asked if there was any possibility of the two leaders meeting again in the near future, Mahatma Gandhi said:
I hope so. It is for the Press and the public to make it possible
 and hasten the date. I assure you that we have not parted as enemies, but as friends.
 If the Rajaji Formula or his own formula had conceded the substance of the Lahore Resolution, then why not agree to the Resolution itself?
Although the Resolution does not say so, if you study the
 
 correspondence, it shows that it is based on the two nations theory and it has been known as the Pakistan Resolution. Further, I  had  to examine the Resolution in view of the interpretation put upon it by the Quaid-e-Azam in his numerous speeches and statements in elucidation of the Resolution. It is indisputable that the Resolution, while it does not enunciate that theory, is based upon that theory. The Quaid-e-Azam has insisted upon that. Therefore, I urge that apart from the two nations theory, if I could accept the principle of division of India in accordance with the demand of the League, he should accept it. But unfortunately it was just there we split.
 Asked about Mr. Jinnah’s views regarding a provisional interim government, he said:
I am not sure that the Quaid-e-Azam puts great weight on the
 interim government. I gave all the explanation of my conception of an interim government without any reservation. It is quite clear in my letterslibtech_1008_footnote. If I did not go any further, it was because I could not and, even if you cross-examine me any further, I would have to say I could not go any further. But if, as you suggest, the Quaid-e-Azam attached greater weight to it, then it was open to him to put it into concrete form. I would have then taxed myself and spared no effort to accept the proposition or to make some other suggestions.
 Mahatma Gandhi was told that those Muslims who did not see eye to eye with the League had no real Muslim backing. He replied:
Therefore,  I  have  said  that   the   League   is   by   far   the most
 representative of Muslim opinion, but I cannot despise the others by simply saying that they have no Muslim backing. What does it matter if they have no more Muslim backing if the opinion represented by a single Muslim, or by a body of Muslims whom you can count on your fingers, is intrinsically sound? The way of approaching a question is not to examine the numerical strength of those behind the opinion, but to examine the soundness of the opinion on merits, or else we will never reach a solution, and if we reach one, it will be a blind solution simply because it is the wish of the largest body. If the largest body goes wrong, it is up to me to say you are wrong and not to submit. The rule of majority does not mean that it should suppress the opinion of even an individual, if it is sound. An individual’s opinion should have greater weight than the opinion of many, if that
 
 opinion is sound on merits. That is my view of real democracy.
 Mahatma Gandhi was asked what he thought of the idea of formation of provinces on linguistic, cultural and communal basis. He replied that since 1920 he was for provinces on a linguistic basis. As for redistribution on a cultural basis, he did not really know what it meant and he was unable to understand how provinces could be reconstituted on communal lines unless there was a suggestion that there should be inter-migration of the various communities to concentrate in particular areas. It seemed to him to be fantastic and impossible. He said:
We are not inhabiting a country full of deserts and wastelands.
 We are a densely populated country and I do not see the slightest chance for such redistribution. In that respect the Lahore Resolution is quite sound—where there is an obvious Muslim majority they should be allowed to constitute a separate State by themselves and that has been fully conceded in the Rajaji Formula or my formula. There is not much distinction between them. That right is conceded without the slightest reservation. But if it means utterly independent sovereignty so that there is to be nothing in common between the two, I hold it is an impossible proposition. That means war to the knife. It is not a proposition that resolves itself into a voluntary or friendly solution.
 Therefore, the Rajaji Formula and my formula have presented certain things to be in common between sovereign States. Therefore, there is no question of one party overbearing the other or the Centre having an overbearing Hindu majority. I think our formula should be critically and sympathetically examined and it would be found that the formula concedes everything that could reasonably be conceded if we consider ourselves to be one family. Children of the same family, dissatisfied with one another by reason of change of religion, if they should separate, then the separation should be within ourselves and not separation in the face of the whole world. When two brothers separate, they do not become enemies of one another in the eyes of the world. The world will still recognize them as brothers.
 A journalist said that some of the Nationalist Muslims felt that the Congress through Mahatma Gandhi meeting Mr. Jinnah had put them in a false position and that they might have to change their attitude towards Indian nationalism.
 Mahatma Gandhi replied that it was an extraordinary suggestion. Nationalist Muslims were nationalists simply because they could not be otherwise. He said:
I am a nationalist, not in order to please anybody, but because I
 cannot be otherwise. And If I approached the Quaid-e-Azam, I approached him in the common interests of myself and Nationalist
 
 Muslims and other Nationalists. Nationalist Muslims, so far as I know, were delighted when I approached the Quaid-e-Azam and  were looking forward to a proper solution in the confidence that I would not sell the interests represented by them.
 Undoubtedly, a Nationalist Muslim represents the nation, but he represents the Muslims also, who are a part of the nation. He would be guilty of disloyalty, if he sacrifices the Muslim interests. But my nationalism has taught me that I would be guilty of disloyalty if I sacrifice the interests of a single Indian.
 Asked if there was any difference between his present attitude towards the Muslim League demand and the stand he took in 1942, Mahatma Gandhi said:
There is very great difference. In 1942, Rajaji had not ‘burst’
 on the scene as he did at the Aga Khan Palace with a concrete proposition. It reflects very great credit on his persistence. He never takes up a standpoint without the fullest consideration and having taken it up, he follows it to the bitterest end. He had abundant faith in my loyalty and he never gave me up as I have never given him up. When he found me in the Aga Khan Palace and presented  the  Formula, I did not take even five minutes and I said ‘Yes’ because I saw it in a concrete shape.
 My mind is narrow. I have not read much literature. I have not seen much of the world. I have concentrated upon certain things in life and beyond that I have no other interest. Therefore, I could not realize the meaning of Rajaji’s stand and I disliked it. But when he came with a concrete formula—I myself a concrete being of flesh and blood—and when he had put something in concrete shape, I felt I could hug it and touch it. Therefore, you see the vast difference between 1942 and today. However, thereby I have not departed from the Congress standpoint in general terms. Congress has accepted self-determination and the Rajaji Formula has also accepted the principle of self-determination and therefore the Formula had become common ground.
 Proceeding, Mahatma Gandhi explained that he accepted the principle of sovereign States, consistent with friendliness. He said:
Friendliness suggests that before the whole world we must act as
 one nation, not united by extraneous circumstances, or united  by  force of British arms, but united by a greater force, that is, our own determined will.

           BOMBAY, 
  September 29,libtech_1010_footnotelibtech_1011_footnote1944  Mr. 	Gandhi told me today why his talks with Mr. Jinnah failed to produce 	a solution of the Hindu-Muslim differences. I 	could not accept the two nations basis. This was Mr. Jinnah’s  	demand. He wants immediate recognition of the North-West Frontier 	Province, Sind, the whole of the Punjab, Bengal and Assam  as 	sovereign and completely independent Pakistan.  He 	wants Mr. Gandhi to agree to this amputation from the rest of India 	without consulting the wishes of the inhabitants by plebiscite. He 	has rejected the Rajagopalachari Formula. I asked Mr. Gandhi what he 	was prepared to recognize as Pakistan and on what basis there could 	be any hope of agreement in future. He was frank and precise. He 	replied: I 	want to make it clear that I believe Mr. Jinnah is sincere, but I  	think he is suffering from hallucination when he imagines that an 	unnatural division of India could bring either happiness or 	prosperity to the people concerned. It was my suggestion that 	provided there was the safeguard of a plebiscite there could he 	sovereignty for the predominantly Muslim areas, but it should be 	accompanied by bonds of alliance between Hindustan and Pakistan. 	There should be common policy and working arrangement on foreign 	affairs, defence, communications and similar matters. This is 	manifestly vital to the welfare of both parts of India.  This 	arrangement, Mr. Gandhi said, could not interfere with the internal 	life of Muslims who would not be subject in any way to Hindu 	domination. Such a division would not create an artificial split 	between people who whatever their religious faiths are descended 	from a common stock and are all Indians. Unfortunately, 	Mr. Jinnah would have none of it and asked me to 	agree to the principle of two nations entirely separate.  I 	asked Mr. Gandhi if he had adopted the attitude because he thought 	he could not ‘sell’ such a division to the country or because he 	thought it wrong in principle. He replied.     
 Because it is fundamentally wrong in principle. If I had thought Mr. Jinnah’s view was right, even though the whole world were against me, I would have accepted it personally and given him my unquestioned allegiance.
 If Mr. Jinnah agreed to your view of division, but insisted there should be no plebiscite or a plebiscite in which only Muslims would vote, would you settle on this basis?
Never. How could I agree in a personal or any other capacity to
 decide the future of millions of people without their having anything to say about their destiny?
 What was your impression of Mr. Jinnah’s attitude on the question of an interim national government which you outlinedlibtech_1012_footnoteto me in July?
 Mr. Jinnah has said that he is deeply interested in independence, but it did not seem to me that he set as great store by it as immediate recognition of the Pakistan he wants. Whereas, you see, my view has been all along that we cannot be free among ourselves until we are free from imperial domination. We have parted as friends. These days have not been wasted. I am convinced that Mr. Jinnah is a good man.  I hope we shall meet again. I am a man of prayer and I shall pray for understanding. In the mean time, it is the duty of the public to digest the situation and bring the pressure of their opinion upon us.

MEETINGlibtech_1013_footnote","
          BOMBAY, 
  Friday, 	September 29, 1944  Addressing 	them at 	the end of 	prayers, Gandhiji said 	that he had 	been seeing large 	number of men and women 	joining in prayers 	every evening and 	contributing to 	the Harijan 	Fund. He wished 	to tell 	them something about Harijans this evening since 	he would 	have no 	opportunity of 	addressing the 	people tomorrow in 	view of 	his decision 	to leave 	for Sevagram 	tomorrow afternoon. For 	years he 	had been working 	for the removal 	of untouchability. 	Wherever he went, 	he emphasized that 	untouchability was a curse which required to be removed, root and branch. It was a     
 tragedy that this curse still persisted in India. Many Harijans had been coming and seeing him. He was ashamed to find that even in a place like Bombay which claimed to do so much for the downtrodden, Harijans found it difficult to find houses to live in.   It was no use merely contributing to the Harijan Fund. The real duty of the people lay in working for the uplift of the Harijans. Gandhiji said:
It is not for you and me to decide who is low or who is high for
 we are all children of God. The Hindu religion would not survive without the eradication of the curse of untouchability.
 Even in the matter of communal unity, concluded Gandhiji, if we treated all as brothers and sisters, the present dark clouds would clear and give place to bright sunshine.

 DETENTION CAMP,
 January 31, 1944
 DEAR COL. BHANDARI,
 As you know, Smt. Kasturba Gandhi has been gradually losing ground. Last night she had very little sleep, and this morning she had a bad collapse. She became very short of breath (respiration 48), the pulse was very feeble in volume and tension and 100 to the minute, and her colour was ashy grey. She recovered after about twenty minutes’ treatment. Now—at midday—she is restless, complains of pain in the left chest and back, is cyanotic and dyspnoeic. The pulse rate is 108, the B.P. is 90/50, respiration
 Under these circumstances we would like to have the help in consultation of Dr. Jivraj Mehta (Yeravda Central Prison) and Dr. B. C. Roy (Calcutta) who have been here in her former illness and in whom she has faith. We might state that the patient’s condition is such that if the help of these doctors is to be of any use it should not be delayed.
 We might also point out that, as she has to be watched all night and day, nursing has become difficult and the patient herself has been constantly asking for Kanu Gandhi and Dr. Dinshaw Mehta.

 LETTER FROM ADDITIONAL SECRETARY, HOME DEPARTMENT, GOVERNMENT OF INDIAlibtech_1027_footnote
 
               FROM  THE ADDITIONAL SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA 	HOME DEPARTMENT  NEW 	DELHI  TO  M. 	K. GANDHI, 	ESQUIRE SIR,  NO. 	III/43-M.S., GOVERNMENT 	OF INDIA, H.D.,  NEW DELHI,  March 	21, 1944 
  In 	reply to 	your letter of 	4th March 	regarding Mr. Butler’s 	reply to a question 	in the House 	of Commons 	on the 	2nd March, 1944, I 	am directed 	to say 	that the Government 	of India 	regret that you should 	feel that they were 	unreasonable or 	obstructive about 	the calling 	in of special 	medical attendants. The 	Government of 	India were always ready 	to allow 	any extra 	medical aid 	or consultation 	which the 	Government doctors 	considered necessary, and 	they do not 	think that 	there was 	any delay in 	summoning outside aid 	when the 	Government doctors 	decided that it 	was needed. 	It was on January 	28 that 	they were first informed that Mrs. Gandhi had 	asked for the services 	of Dr. 	Dinshaw Mehta, and 	it was 	not until January 31 	that they were 	told that Dr. 	Gilder had 	asked for 	consultation with certain 	other doctors. On 	February 1, the 	Bombay Government 	were explicitly 	informed that any 	extra medical 	aid or 	consultation might be 	allowed which the 	Government doctors 	considered necessary or 	useful. If 	Dr. Dinshaw 	Mehta was not called 	in earlier, it 	was due to 	the  view originally 	expressed by both 	Col. Bhandari and Dr. 	Gilder that his 	services could not 	be of any 	use, but 	he was 	summoned as 	soon as 	the Government 	doctors revised that 	opinion. Your letter of 	January 27, 	which did 	not reach the 	Government of 	India until 	February 1, made 	some reference to your 	wife’s wish to see 	an Ayurvedic 	physician, but 	no name 	was mentioned 	and it 	was not until 	February 9 that 	a definite 	requestfor the services of Vaidyaraj Sharma was received. The request was then granted within 24    
 hours and as soon as the Government of India were made aware of the difficulties resulting from his not being accommodated inside the Palace, the  necessary permission was given for him to reside there. In the circumstances, the Government of India feel that they did everything possible to ensure that your wife received all the treatment that you wished during her illness.
  As 	to the question 	of release, 	the Government 	of India 	still feel that the 	course they 	adopted was 	the best and kindest. It 	was reported 	to them 	on January 	25 that 	your son, Devadas Gandhi, 	had asked his mother 	whether she would like to 	be released 	on parole 	and she had replied 	that she would 	not like 	to leave 	the Palace without her 	husband. Government have 	made no use 	of this 	report, since 	it was 	the record 	of a private 	conversation; but it 	confirmed them in 	the view 	expressed above. The 	misunderstanding about 	the statement 	in America 	quite wrongly attributed to 	Sir Girjashanker 	Bajpai has been cleared 	up by answers 	to questions 	in the 	Legislative Assembly 	which you have 	doubtless seen.  The 	arrangements for 	the funeral were 	understood here to be in 	accordance with your 	wishes. The 	Government made 	enquiries on 	the point and were 	informed that 	you had no 	special preference 	between the first 	two alternatives 	mentioned in your letter.  In 	these circumstances, 	the Government 	of India 	do not 	think that 	Mr. Butler’s reply to the parliamentary question was incorrect in substance. 
 I have the honour to be,
 Sir,
 Your most obedient servant,

 Government of India have been unsympathetic in the matter of Mrs. Gandhi’s illness. Miss Slade’s case will be examined in the light of what you say about her.
 I do not think it profitable that we should enter into lengthy argument, and do not propose to answer in detail the points you raise in your letter. But I think it best  to give you a clear statement of my views on the future development of India and the reasons for your present detention.
 The draft declaration of His Majesty’s Government which Sir Stafford Cripps brought to India stated in unmistakable terms the intention of His Majesty’s Government to give India self-government under a constitution of her own devising, arrived at by agreement between the principal elements. I need hardly say that I am in entire accord with that aim, and only seek the best means to implement it without delivering India to confusion and turmoil. Much wisdom and a spirit of goodwill and compromise will be required to arrive at the right solution, but with good leadership, I am sure, a solution can be found.
 Meanwhile there is much work to be done, particularly in the economic field, in preparing India to take her proper place in the modern world. She must be ready to welcome change and progress in many hitherto-unfamiliar directions and to raise the standard of living of her population. Such work is primarily non-political; it may well hasten a political settlement, but cannot await it. It will give rise to many new and absorbing problems demanding the best abilities that India can bring to bear on them. India cannot be expected to tackle these problems in isolation from the rest of the world, or without the aid that Britain can give and the services of an experienced administration. But it is work in which leaders of all parties can co-operate with the certainty that they are helping the country towards the goal of freedom.
 I regret that I must view the present policy of the Congress party as hindering and not forwarding Indian progress to self-government and development. During a war in which the success of the United Nations against the Axis powers is vital both to India and to the world, as you yourself have recognized, the Working Committee of Congress declined to co-operate, ordered Congress Ministries to resign, and decided to take no part in the administration of the country or in the war-effort which India was making to assist the United Nations. At the greatest crisis of all for India, at a time when Japanese invasion was possible, the Congress party decided to pass a resolution calling on the British to leave India, which could not fail to have the most serious effect on our ability to defined the frontiers of India against the Japanese. I am quite clear that India’s problems cannot be solved by an immediate and complete withdrawal of the British.
 I do not accuse you or the Congress party of any wish deliberately to aid the Japanese. But you are much too intelligent a man, Mr. Gandhi, not to have realized that the effect of your resolution must be to hamper the prosecution of the war; and it
 is clear to me that you had lost confidence in our ability to defend India, and were prepared to take advantage of our supposed military straits  to  gain political advantage. I do not see how those responsible for the safety of India could have acted otherwise than they did and could have failed to arrest those who sponsored the resolution. As to general Congress responsibility for the disturbances  which followed, I was, as you know, Commander-in-Chief at the time; my vital lines of communication to the Burma frontier were cut by Congress supporters, in the name of Congress, often using the Congress flag. I cannot, therefore, hold Congress guiltless of what occurred; and I cannot believe that you, with all your acumen and experience, could have been unaware of what was likely to follow from your policy. I do not believe that the Congress party’s action in this matter represented the real feeling of India, nor that the Congress attitude of non-co-operation represents the opinion of anything like a majority of India.
 To sum up, I believe that with general co-operation, we can in the immediate future do much to solve India’s economic problems, and can make steady and substantial progress towards Indian self-government.
 I believe that the greatest contribution that the Congress party can make towards India’s welfare is to abandon the policy of non-co-operation and to join whole-heartedly with the other Indian parties and with the British in helping India forward in economic and political progress—not by any dramatic or spectacular stroke, but by hard, steady work towards the end ahead. I think that the greatest service you could do to India would be to advise unequivocally such co-operation.
 In the mean time, I regard it as my task, in the interests of India, of which I am a sincere friend, to concentrate all my efforts on bringing this war to a victorious conclusion, and to prepare for India’s advancement after the war. In this task, I feel, I can count on very considerable co-operation from the majority of Indians.
 Yours sincerely,
 WAVELL

 LETTER FROM DR. GILDER TO ADDITIONAL SECRETARY, HOME DEPARTMENT, GOVERNMENT OF INDIAlibtech_1029_footnote
        THE 	ADDITIONAL SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT 	OF INDIA 	HOME 	DEPARTMENT  NEW 	DELHI  DETENTION CAMP,  March 	31, 1944 
   SIR,     Your 	letter of the 21st March to Mahatma Gandhi contains the statement:  It 	was on 	January 28 	that they were first 	informed that Mrs. Gandhi had 	asked for 	the services of 	Dr.  Dinshaw Mehta.	If Dr. Dinshaw was not called in  earlier, 	it was due to the view originally expressed by both Col. Bhandari 	and Dr. Gilder that his services would not be of any use, but he was 	summoned as soon as the Government doctors revised that opinion.  Surely 	coupling of my name with that of Col. Bhandari is a mistake! The 
  Government 	doctors in attendance were Col. Bhandari and Col. Shah. As far as I 	am concerned, some time in December last, at one of Col. Advani’s 	evening visits (when he was officiating for Col. Bhandari) Smt. 	Kasturba Gandhi asked him to allow Dr. Dinshaw Mehta to come in and 	Col. Advani was good enough to ask my opinion on the advisabiIity of 	Dr. Dinshaw’s coming. As I had not talked over the matter with my 	colleague, Dr. Sushila Nayyar, nor with the patient or her husband, 	I told Col. Advani, I would give him a reply later. At his visit the 	next morning, I told him my considered opinion that Dr. Dinshaw’s 	presence would be a great help.  When 	the whole of January had passed and permission for Dr. Dinshaw had 	not come, Dr. Nayyar and myself sent a gentle reminder in our letter 	of 31st January. A copy is hereto appended.  I 	might state that though in that letter we had asked for a 	consultation with Dr.  B. 	C. Roy, no notice seems to have been taken of it or of verbal 	reminders.  You 	will permit me 	to draw your attention 	to another 	inaccuracy, viz., about 	the employment of trained 	nurses. No trained nurse ever came inside the camp. Before 	the arrival of Smt. Jayaprakash Narayan and Shri Kanu Gandhi, when nursing was      
 becoming difficult, we were given the services of a woman who had acted as a badli ayahlibtech_1030_footnoteat the mental hospital. She struck work inside of a week and asked the Superintendent for her discharge.

    APPENDIX V  DISCUSSION ON 	UNDERGROUND ACTIVITIESlibtech_1031_footnote    WOMAN WORKER : 	You told us, we should be our own leaders after your arrest. In the 	absence of the Working Committee, everyone of us was to think for 	himself or herself. We acted according to our light. Your recent 	utterances make us feel that we have been let down.  GANDHIJI: 	I have blamed no one. But, when a thing is wrong, I must say so.  W.W. 	Will it not cause a set-back?  G. 	No, we learn from our mistakes. By correcting them we advance.  W.W. 	Some say: ‘If this is your narrow interpretation of non-violence, 	we shall have none of it. Call it violence or by whatever name you 	like, we cannot dislodge the Government without sabotage.’  G. 	It cannot succeed though for some time it may seem to or even 	actually succeed. But I have said that those who do not believe in 	my way can say so openly, and courageously try their own method and 	see if they will succeed better.  W.W 	We admit that public 	opinion has veered round to your view. The public has come to feel, 	whether through enlightenment or fear, that sabotage won’t do. But 	you cannot expect everyone to become a perfect being, which your 	method implies.  G. 	I agree. That is why I launched forth with imperfect men. But 	whether the people develop the required non-violence or not, I 	cannot play fast and loose with my principles.  W.W. 	What is the quickest way to reach our goal?  G. 	The straightest way, though it may appear to be long.  W.W. 	Then you do not visualize independence in the near future?     
 G. I visualize it in the nearest future, if my way is followed.
 W.W. You want us to feel indignant and yet sit quiet.
 G. No, I want you to feel very indignant with yourself. It is no use feeling angry with a snake, the snake will bite. Follow any way that commends itself to you if mine does not, but do not sit still.
 W.W. We have not the courage, we can’t get on if we oppose you.
 G. You must develop that courage.. .libtech_1032_footnoteIt is because of this courage to stand alone that I am supposed to represent India’s urge for freedom.	libtech_1033_footnoteSwaraj is not for the
 weak. If you say, you follow me, when you really do not, you are weak.
 The women worker was nonplussed. Gandhiji noticed her dilemma.
 Reassuringly he proceeded:
 “However, you can say, ‘We do not follow your reasoning, but we yield to your experience.’ You can tell your co-workers, ‘We went there. We were not convinced. But we could not convince him either. Therefore, we will follow him as disciplined soldiers.’ But if this course does not appeal to them, it is equally open to them to say, ‘The Mahatma has told us to follow our own reason, if we have no faith in his way.’ That will be equally honourable—perhaps more. I shall then defend them.”
 Appa Pant, the Rajkumar of Aundh, had been advising and guiding underground workers. He put before Gandhiji his dilemma: “With me truth and non-violence are not a policy but my creed. I know of underground workers who would not willingly hurt a fly. They are patriots to the core. I have to shelter them when they come to me and seek my advice. I want to wean them from secret methods. But, in doing so, I have myself to resort to secrecy. I feel puzzled and perplexed.” Gandhiji replied:
 “Your attitude is unexceptionable. You cannot jump out of a running train, as  it were. No outside agency can give you effective guidance. It must come from within.   If you dive within yourself and search prayerfully for an answer, a stage will come when suddenly your eyes will be opened and you will conceive such a disgust for untruth and secrecy that you will go to the underground workers and tell them that they will find you useless as a guide if they want to go their way. They will then see it in your face and understand, and very likely it will be the beginning of a new chapter in their lives.”

 APPENDIX VI
 DISCUSSION WITH UNDERGROUND WORKERSlibtech_1034_footnote
 As the onslaught of Governmental repression gathered volume and intensity, more and more workers went underground.	Some of these friends wanted to  meet
 Gandhiji soon after his release. He sent them word that they could come at their risk. Several of them accordingly came and saw him at Juhu and later at Panchgani. They included R. R. Diwakar . . . Annada Chowdhury Achyut Patwardhan and Aruna Asaf
 Ali . . .
 Gandhiji’s advice to them was emphatic. He held all secrecy to be sin. “To the extent to which secrecy has crept in, it has hurt our cause. We have not to think in terms of one or two, we have to think in terms of forty crores. Today they feel lifeless. We cannot revive them by resorting to secret methods. Only by adhering to Truth and Non-violence can we bring back lustre to their lustreless eyes.”
 Looking at their immediate surroundings, he said to them, they might feel that if some of them had not gone underground, the movement would have suffered. But this was only apparently so. When you come to bigger issues, “you will find that it is only by eschewing all secrecy and working openly that you can advance. Today
 you may be two, tomorrow you will be twenty, if you come out in open, and so the struggle will go on gathering momentum from day to day.”

 LETTER FROM V. S. SRINIVASA SASTRIlibtech_1035_footnote
 
 
           MY 	DEAR BROTHER,  SVAGATAM, MYLAPORE,  MADRAS,  June 	2, 1944 
  This 	letter I mean only for you and your trusted friends. Mr. T. R. 	Venkatarama Sastri, now on his way to Srinagar, will deliver it in 	person.  I 	must first thank you for your ‘sympathy in abundance’. My 	philosophy is not so stoical but it needs the human touch. You know, 	as only a very few do, how in simple words to get to a man’s 	heart. It takes a big heart to do so.  Don’t 	fear a long political screed from me. I do not see Government 	arresting you as soon as you are well for another term in jail. You 	say in your letter to Jayakar, they will do so. If you have reasons 	to think so, I don’t know them.  Listen 	to my story. It shall be brief. You can fill in the outline.  The 	greatest event to happen in the remaining days of your life will be 	the World Conference of Peace. You must attend it. If they won’t 	let you go as the representative of India, you must go still. To the 	good and true men at the Peace table your name will be sufficient 	credential.  Don’t 	waste your energy on details. Experts will handle them. Concentrate 	on the sovereign issues.   Disarmament 		of all 		nations. I 		would allow the 		International Authority 		to have 		some armed forces. But 		you won’t. Go 		ahead. You 		will have valiant 		support all over 		the world. 		What if you 		fail? You 		will have given your 		evangel to a stricken 		and listening world.  Equality 		of economic 		as well 		as political 		opportunities for all 		peoples of 		this principle the 		implications are 		too many and too intricate 		for a 		single human 		brain. The 		comprehending 		proposition is all you 		can safeguard.  Elimination 		of the 		colour bar 		in the 		British Commonwealth 		and in 		the world 		at large. 		To fail 		under this head is to 		leave a 		wide door for 		future wars. Whether 		India is 		within or 		without the 		Commonwealth, this 		issue is supreme. 		At the 		Peace table 		one is a citizen 		of the world.   No 	doubt it would be a giant’s strength to be armed with the 	Government of      
 India’s authority. Whether they made you the delegation’s leader or not, you would be looked up to as leader. A necessary condition is the end of Section 93 rule and the restoration of popular government. To this end I have been for nearly two years now pleading that:
 political 	prisoners and detenus 	should be released;  general 	elections should be held, 	and the Central 	and local 	legislatures be put 	back in power; and  a 	national government be 	formed at 	the Centre 	of which 	the personnel 	should be 	drawn from elected 	leaders. I wouldn’t 	make a 	fetish of 	parliamentary legislation during the war or complete control of the country’s defence. 
 Tall order, you say. A keen eye will also see in the sketch gaping defects and crudities. There are wise and strong men among us to look after all that.
 The Hindu-Muslim rift is there to puzzle, dishearten and paralyse. I despair at the very thought. You see farther and more clearly than most others. I shall, for mypart, abide by your decision—always short of Pakistan, mind you.
 I am too feeble for active propaganda.
 The means suggested to these mighty ends may be tested only by the standards of Truth and Non-violence. Smaller standards are utterly, utterly out of place— prestige, consistency, or party prospects.
 Don’t miss the wood for the trees. Always and at the very core,
Your loving brother,

                BELOVED BAPU,  APPENDIX VIII  LETTER FROM 	MIRABEHN TO M. 	K. GANDHIlibtech_1036_footnote  SUNDER 	BUN, JUHU,  June 	12, 1944 
  I 	have your letter. I 	had not realized the 	position regarding the 	fund kept in 	my name, 	and that my expenses 	were being drawn. 	I had 	the impression that 	the whole sum 	was being kept 	intact and 	that I 	was receiving food, 	clothing, travelling 	expenses, etc., like some 	others who gave 	their whole time to the 	cause according to 	their individual 	capacity. But this was a 	misunderstanding. So, 	I will 	gladly put 	the matter 	straight at once. 	I cannot 	bear any bargaining 	in such 	matters. I, therefore, 	ask that 	Rs. 20,000 should be 	deducted from 	the total, which should 	cover the expenses 	incurred by the Ashram 	for me during these 20 years. The remainder can be transferred  to 	my name.  I 	had understood that when I had this money, I should be free to do 	constructive national work without let or hindrance, so long as I 	made it clear that the scheme of work was entirely my own and 	without your personal approval. I did not realize that you would 	feel called upon publicly to express disapproval of my work.  You 	have given me 	my freedom with one 	hand and 	taken it 	away with the 	other. To 	give me 	my money and 	freedom, and 	at the same time to 	say that as 	soon as 	   I begin 	to use 	them you 	will publicly disapprove, 	is to sabotage 	anything I may 	try to do. 	You at the 	same time sabotage any 	chance of 	my being able 	to prove 	to you 	that you 	are wrong.  You 	have brought up 	a whole 	lot of 	reports and 	prejudices against 	Sardarji. I have 	avoided discussing these matters with you 	because I 	could see 	that everything I 	said excited 	you. The result 	is that 	you have not understood 	my position. 	You have 	made up 	your mind that I 	am completely under his 	influence. It 	is you who have tried to urge 	me to that 	position, but 	as you 	know, I have 	protested all 	along. You 	said I should 	have to 	join the Communist 	Party. I said 	no. You said as a 	true Hindu 	wife I 	should have to 	follow him 	in everything. 	I said 	my opinion 	was the opposite, 	and that 	my whole 	instinct told me that 	I must 	resist him wherever 	necessary and live 	my own 	life according to 	the ideals 	in which 	I believe, 	by which 	means, he would 	some day 	know that I 	was right. 	If I had 	followed his 	advice, I 	should not 	have undertaken 	my scheme but I knew that I must resist him and I did. My faith in God is my guide.    
 But now you propose to throttle, by the warning of public disapproval, any attempt on my part to put my ideals into practice. My ideals have not changed in the last few days. I am the same person that I was when we used to talk happily together.
 Believing, as I did, that everything is finally settled I started the ball rolling. I have put out enquiries regarding co-workers, land, maps and other details. I have explained the scheme (as my personal idea) to many people. Must I now understand if I go on with my plans you will feel called upon to disapprove. The fact that there will be Rs. 20,000 less does not worry me at all. I can start in a smaller way and make up with donations. But the possibility that you might broadcast public or semi-public disapproval of my work, which statement I should feel obliged equally publicly to answer, means that for decency’s sake I must avoid any such catastrophe, and  therefore cancel all my projects of work. I would, in that case, take the balance of the money after the deduction of Rs. 20,000, invest it somewhere, and go to live in seclusion until time as you revised your ideas.
 Yours ever devoted daughter,

                DEAR GANDHIJI,  APPENDIX IX  LETTER FROM P. 	C. JOSHIlibtech_1037_footnote       BOMBAY,  June 	14, 1944 
  Your 	small chit came as a pleasant surprise that you were so eager to 	know more about us. . . .  I 	am answering your points in a very brief manner. . . .   People 		in people’s 		war means 		all peoples 		the world 		over without exception. 		It, of 		course, includes India’s 		millions and also 		the Negroes 		wherever they be. . . .   This 	war has split the world into two camps. On the one side Fascists are 	fighting  the war for the imperialist domination of the world.       On the other side are the  freedom-loving 	peoples of 	 the world. 	.  .  the 	camp of  freedom 	and democracy. 	. .  fighting 	Fascism is the only path of national liberation from imperialist 	domination for us today. The more we unite our patriotic parties, 	the weaker and more isolated  becomes 	the alien Government and the more irresistible our national and 	other demands, the greater our capacity to save and serve our 	people. The more our patriotic parties engage themselves in those 	tasks which any war-time government should successfully lead, but an 	alien Government cannot, the more speedily we get the united 	intervention of all the peoples of the world behind our national 	demand for national government in the common interest of fighting 	the common enemy.   If 		you desire to examine 		the accounts personally, 		they will 		present themselves 		with all the registers where and when you desire. If you decide to 		appoint a representative, 		he should 		besuch whom we 		also know to 		be an honest 		man and notalready 		prejudiced against us. 		You will not 		find our 		accounts as 		well kept as 		by a commercial firm 		but I 		am sure 		you will 		give us a 		pass. You will 		find some   anonymous 	donors, but I believe that you also accept anonymous donors. But to 	dispel any suspicion that “anonymous” may be code for Government 	cash, I am prepared to give you (not your representative) the names. 	. . .  If 	you have yet any doubts left and in any case, I give you some 	references. . .  . 	Iftikharuddin and his Begum, Shaukat Ansari and Zohra, N. M. Joshi. 	You can ask Dr. and Mrs. Subbaroyan as to what they think is going 	to happen to their property when Mohan and Parvati (their children 	and our comrades) get it, and in fact what they know happens to the 	property of the whole-time workers of the party. . . .    
  I 	know it 	is easy enough to 	make such a 	vile charge but 	very difficult 	to prove it. Firstly, I believe, if you find that we are not paid by the Government, 
 you will easily believe that we are not likely to hand over labour leaders to the police. Secondly, our party, except in Ahmedabad and Jamshedpur, is as much the unquestioned leader of the working class as the great Congress is of the Indian people
 as a whole.       We gave up our strike policy because we considered it anti-national in
 the conditions of today, aiding the Jap aggressors on the one hand and intensifying the economic crisis for our own people on the other. That we successfully prevented the Indian working class from resorting to strikes even in a period of their worsening material conditions is the measure not only of our influence over it but its capacity to understand national interests as its own.
  There 	is no question of our “adopting 	the policy 	of infiltrating 	 the  Congress 	organization”. We have 	been in the 	Congress ever since we 	were born as 	a party. Whether our intent is hostile or not, it is for our fellow Congressmen to 
 judge and for us to prove otherwise through our practice. We are inside the
 Congress on our right, as patriotic sons and daughters of the people who join the common national organization, so that we may be able to fight our hardest and best  in realization of the common goal of national emancipation and no slanders can ever provoke us to give up this stand and forgo the glorious privilege.
  The 	Communist Party decides 	its own policy 	as it understands 	the interests 	of its 	own people and 	of the 	peoples of 	the world. 	As long 	as the Communist 	International was 	there, we 	were dubbed 	as ‘Moscow 	Agents’. It is rather 	surprising to come across the same insinuation even after its dissolution. The Communist 
 Party is one great revolutionary brotherhood. It exists in every country of the world. All have the same ideology and are moved by the common aims of fighting for the liberation of their own and all peoples. I can send you the journals and documents of the Communist Parties of Britain, U.S.A., South Africa, Australia, which have nailed down Amery & Co. as slanderers and provocateurs after August 9 and which have unfalteringly demanded the release of the Congress leaders and settlement with India on the basis of a real national government. . . .

 PASSAGES FROM “THE QUINTESSENCE OF GANDHISM”libtech_1038_footnote
 
 Thou shalt fight for the protection of good men and the destruction of wrong-doers and for the establishment of righteousness.
 The side you take up and the weapons you wield are indeed important but the obligation to fight is perfectly absolute and independent  of  every  other consideration, and the emphasis is all upon this obligation. It may be that you take the wrong side in the conflict. But if you are on the wrong side today, you may turn to the right side tomorrow. But those who sit upon the fence have already qualified for admission into Dante’s Inferno. . . .
 II
 Thou shalt fight for the right, for . . . ‘Truth alone prevails, not untruth.’ . . .  You may not take the wrong side or employ questionable means to attain even a perfectly legitimate end, and still hope to succeed. . . .
 III
 When you are ready to fight for the right, Gandhiji arms you with the all-conquering and never-failing weapon, namely . . . suffering cum forgiveness. . . .
 . . . Mankind must have recourse to love and non-violence, if they will escape from the vicious circle of hatred and violence. Two wrongs can never make one right. Violence in response to violence only provokes more violence and so  on  ad infinitum.
 For a true theist, the Gandhian is the only position he can take up consistently with his theism. If God is there ever present—present in a more real sense than you or I—as Judge and Defender of the right, the theist, imperfect as he is in knowledge as well as in strength, will think it no business of his to judge his adversary or to punish him for what he thinks to be the adversary’s wrong-doing. . . .

 APPENDIX XI
 OPINION GANDHIJI‘S RESPONSIBILITYlibtech_1039_footnote
 Februarylibtech_1040_footnote6, 1944
 We are asked to examine the question whether the authority conferred upon Mahatma Gandhi by the resolution of the A.I.C.C. dated the 8th of August, 1942, to “start a mass struggle on non-violent lines” is still subsisting, apart from the  legality or otherwise of the purpose for which the authority was given.
 The authority conferred by the said resolution must be construed with reference  to the circumstances under which and the purposes for which it was given. It appears from the resolution as a whole that the steps to be taken under such authority were conceived by the framers of the resolution to meet the situation which had then arisen.
 In our opinion, the recitals and the purpose of the said resolution and the circumstances under which the same was passed limit the authority so as to confine it to the immediate circumstances and the purpose which the A. I. C. C. had then in view. The said authority was intended to be exercised for and in the then immediate situation. Before Gandhiji could exercise such authority, he was arrested on the 9th of August, 1942, and was prevented from acting on the resolution by reason of his ceasing to be a free agent. By his being so prevented, the exercise of the authority was rendered impossible and it came to an end.
 The authority conferred upon him was neither permanent nor recurring and there can be no question of its revival by the recent release of Gandhiji in the present situation.

 APPENDIX XII
 STUART GELDER’S CABLE TO “NEWS CHRONICLE”libtech_1041_footnote
 
 Mr. Gandhi is prepared to accept and to advise the Congress to participate in a war-time national government in full control of the civil administration, leaving the Viceroy and the Commander-in-Chief in full control of the British and Indian armies. It would be expected that the establishment of such a government would be accompanied now by a guarantee of Indian independence after the war.
 Mr. Gandhi has also approved the proposals submitted to Mr. Jinnah  by Mr. C. Rajagopalachari, which agree to a solution of the Hindu-Pakistan dispute by a plebiscite and demarcation of the districts where Muslims are in a majority, if the Muslim League will endorse the demand for independence and co-operate with the Congress in the formation of a provisional interim government for the transitional period.
 Despite the fact that he is still far from well and wishes to be relieved as far as possible from being burdened by dealing with political problems in detail for the time being, I talked with Mr. Gandhi for more than three hours in Panchgani this week. If the Muslim League accepts Mr. Rajagopalachari’s proposals and the Government will now discuss the situation with Mr. Gandhi, the deadlock can be solved and a new page opened in Indian history. Mr. Gandhi pointed out that he had no authority to speak in the name of the Congress without consulting the Working Committee, but there is no doubt whatever that his views and the Hindu-Muslim proposals as endorsed by him would be accepted by them without hesitation.
 I asked Mr. Gandhi whether he would start civil disobedience, if the Working Committee were released from jail and the Government felt unable to give India what they wanted. He replied:
 “I have no intention of offering civil disobedience today. I cannot take the country back to 1942. History can never be repeated. Even without the authority of the Congress, if I wanted to do it, I could start civil disobedience today on the strength of my supposed influence with the masses, but I would be doing so merely to embarrass the British Government. This cannot be my object.”
 
 
 But Mr. Gandhi pointed out, the Working Committee could not sit still while the people were suffering. It is his conviction that the food situation cannot beimproved and suffering ameliorated, unless power and responsibility for civil administration are transferred from British to Indian hands.
 I told Mr. Gandhi that, with things as they are, I could not believe that the Government would transfer authority now or concede independence during the war. He replied that there was a difference between what he would ask today and what was asked in 1942. Today India would be satisfied with a national government in full control of the civil administration. This was not the position in 1942.
 Such a government would be formed of people chosen by the elected members of the Central Assembly. This would involve a declaration now of  Indian  independence after the war.
 Such a national government would give the military all railway, port and other communication facilities they required, although these would be under the national government’s control. The ordinance rule would give way to a normal civil administration by the government. The Viceroy would remain and have complete control with the Commander-in-Chief of the British and Indian armies. In other affairs he would be like the King of England guided by responsible Ministers. Popular government would be automatically restored in all provinces, so that both the Provincial and Central governments would be responsible to the people of India.
 The national government would be in the position of offering advice and criticism on military affairs, and the portfolio of Defence would be in the hands of the national government which would be genuinely interested in the defence of the country and would be in the position of being able to give valuable help in shaping policies. Mr. Gandhi realizes that the Allies cannot defeat Japan without carrying on operations on the Indian soil and, therefore, they would continue to do so, but the expenses of these operations should not be borne by India.
 When I asked Mr. Gandhi, if he would advise the Congress to participate in such a government formed under such conditions and with such stipulations, he replied “Yes”. In view of Mr. Gandhi’s uncompromising pacifism, readers will ask what his position would be under such a government. After independence had been assured by the formation of a provisional government and the declaration of Indian independence after the war, he would probably cease to function as adviser to the Congress.
 As a teacher and exponent of non-violence, he would have to stand aside, but he would certainly not offer any resistance to the government or to the Congress party participating in such a government. His co-operation would take the form of abstention from interfering with the even tenor of life in India. He would continue to work in the hope that his influence would always be felt to keep India peace-minded
 and to affect world policy in the direction of real peace and brotherhood among all without distinction of race or colour.
 I am not in a position at present to write an account of all the details of my conversation with Mr. Gandhi. Last week I visited Delhi to give the Viceroy a complete account of my talk with him in Poona. I am now laying before him a complete report of my recent conversation with Mr. Gandhi.
 This week, after Lord Wavell had declined to see him in the immediate future, I asked Mr. Gandhi what he would say to the Viceroy if he met him. He replied:
 “I would tell him that I sought the interview with a view to helping, and not to hindering, the Allied effort. But I can do nothing without seeing the members of the Working Committee, for I believe that my authority under the August resolution ended with my imprisonment. It was not revived by my release.”
 I pointed out that, before the Viceroy would permit a meeting with the  Working Committee, he would want to know how Mr. Gandhi would influence the members. To this, Mr. Gandhi replied that history did not repeat itself. “The whole situation has to be reviewed anew,” he said. “The point, therefore, for me to discuss with the Working Committee is to know how they react to the knowledge I have gained since my release. I have to take up the thread that was broken by the Government in 1942. I was first to negotiate and, on failure, to offer civil resistance,  if I thought it necessary. I want to plead with the Viceroy. I can only do so when I know the Working Committee’s mind.
 “But I tell you that the common talk among us is that, whatever the Viceroy may wish personally, he has no authority in the political sphere. Mr. Churchill does not want a settlement. He wants to crush me, if he has been correctly reported—he has never denied the report. The beauty of it for me, the pity of it for him, is that no one can crush a satyagrahi, for he offers his body as a willing sacrifice, thus making the spirit free.”
 There was deep disappointment, but no bitterness, in Mr. Gandhi’s voice when he expressed this fear.
 Mr. Gandhi feels that, if the British Government has good intentions, there would be no difficulty about an agreement. But there is an uneasy feeling among Indians of both extreme and moderate views that whatever the Viceroy may wish personally, Mr. Churchill does not wish a settlement now. It may be ill-founded, but  it is of vital importance that Indian opinion should be officially reassured on this point.
 It was expressed to me in friendly conversation with Mr. Rajagopalachari which was not intended to be an interview. His view that the Congress should have accepted the Cripps offer and co-operated in the war is well-known, and he has been a sincere and outspoken critic of the policy of the Congress and of Mr. Gandhi, while
 
 remaining a firm advocate of independence. It seemed to me, therefore, that his appealand warning was of such importance and significance that I asked his permission to quote it for publication in the News Chronicle, and he gave his consent.
 He said: “It seems that the British Government is not now interested in a settlement. They have come to feel that power is the only real thing. Ideals have been put aside and so they are content to drift. They are not planning for the future. They do not know what shape things will take after the war, and so they are not thinking of Indo-British relationship. But, if the war ends on this note, relations between India and Britain will be permanently embittered. It would be a miserable ending for the war, so far as Asia is concerned.”
 It is quite possible for the British Government to make a friend of Gandhiji. Those who know him intimately would confirm this opinion of mine. It may not be necessary for the British war effort to go out of the way to befriend him; but for the future of Indo-British relationship, which is not unimportant, such befriending is necessary and the present is the psychological moment for it. A victorious Britain would lose nothing by such a gesture, but gain a great deal of permanent value. His mind today leans towards seeing a national government installed in India before the end of the war and advantage should be taken of this.
 With Mr. Gandhi’s consent, I have discussed my talks with him with some people influential in Indian affairs. They have included staunch supporters of the Congress, some strong critics of its policy and a member of the Viceroy’s Council. Despite their difference in political outlook they all expressed the hope that a meeting between the Viceroy and Mr. Gandhi would be arranged. One of them said to me: “There is no doubt that he is not only ready but anxious to be friendly and they would do well to take his hand now. We are all suffering from a sense of frustration. If    a national government is formed and the Muslims will come in under the proposals for a settlement of differences, it will make a tremendous difference to the Indian war effort.”
 I do not wish to place myself in the position of a political commentator but only a journalist who has discussed the situation fully and intimately with Mr. Gandhi and for what it is worth. I would record my impression that the Government now has a better opportunity than at any time since Sir Stafford Cripps landed in India to put an end to the deadlock and create an India which, instead of being half-hearted or sullenly indifferent, is enthusiastically on the side of Britain. It will not depend entirely on the British Government. The Congress is faced with a great responsibility to make a provisional government work.
 At least it cannot now be argued that there are no new grounds for a resumption  of relations.

 APPENDIX XIV
 LORD MUNSTER’S SPEECHlibtech_1043_footnote
 July 25, 1944
 Mr. Gandhi had advanced the following views: Firstly, Mr. Gandhi said, he would never use the weapon of civil disobedience during the war unless for a very grave reason, such as the thwarting of India’s right to freedom. Secondly, he would be satisfied with a national government during the war with full control of the civil administration, composed of persons chosen by the elected members of  the Legislative Assembly. Thirdly, the Viceroy would be, like the King of England, guided by responsible Ministers. Fourthly, popular government would be automatically restored in all provinces, that is, provinces at the moment under Section 93. Fifthly, while under national government, the Viceroy and the Commander-in-Chief would have complete control of military operations,  there  would be a portfolio of Defence in the hands of the national government, which would  be genuinely interested in the defence of the country and may render great assistance in the shaping of policies. Sixthly, the Allied forces would be allowed to carry on operations on Indian soil, but the expense of such operations would not be borne by Indians. Seventhly, Mr. Gandhi would advise Congress participation in the national government, if formed.
 The procedure followed is a little complicated and a little difficult to
 
 
 understand. A few days after Mr. Gandhi published these seven suggestions through the intermediary of the Press, he gave further explanations to Press correspondents, in which he emphasized that his statements constituted his personal effort to end the deadlock, but that if his suggestions are not acceptable to Mr. Jinnah or the powers that be, he would consider it a most unfortunate incident. In clarification—if indeed it be clarification—of his offer to Mr. Jinnah, he stated that his proposals were wholly different from the Cripps offer which, he insisted, contemplated almost perpetual vivisection of India. Frankly, it is difficult to understand if these statements by Mr. Gandhi have, in point of fact, definitely improved the chances of an inter-communal settlement.
 The main point, so far as His Majesty’s Government are concerned, is that he (Mr. Gandhi) is still clinging to precisely that claim which wrecked the Cripps Mission and put an end to negotiations in April 1942, for he is no more prepared today than he was then, to accept the formation of an interim government with the Viceroy maintaining his existing reserve powers. He demands a so-called ‘interim’ government in full control of the civil administration, with the Viceroy occupying the position of a constitutional monarch as we understand it in this country. Let it not be forgotten that, if an agreement is set up under the present existing constitution, there are still a number of very important questions, not the least of which is the protection of the minorities, to be resolved. All these matters must be settled before the final constitution can be evolved. In this, it will seem that Government have not departed one iota from the pledge they gave some time ago, and which I will repeat now, that the proposals which were taken to India by Sir Stafford Cripps still stand in their entirety.
 Referring, in conclusion, to the question by Lord Strabolgi, who  asked  whether the Viceroy was prepared to allow Mr. Gandhi to see the members of the Working Committee, Lord Munster said: “I would refer Lord Strabolgi to the letter which the Viceroy sent to Mr. Gandhi on June 22 last. He said that another meeting between  himself  and  Mr.  Gandhi  could  only  raise  false  hopes.  He  said   that   Mr. Gandhi had publicly stated that he adhered to the ‘Quit India’ resolution which he (Mr. Gandhi) regarded as innocuous. The Viceroy did see that as soon as Mr. Gandhi had any definite or constructive policy to put up, he would be very glad to consider it   at that time.”

                DRAR MR. GANDHI,  APPENDIX XV  LETTER FROM 	LORD WAVELLlibtech_1044_footnote       NEW DELHI,  August 	15, 1944 
  Thank 	you for your letter of 27th July. Your proposals are:  That 		you should undertake to advise the Working Committee:    that, 		in view 		of changed 		conditions, mass civil disobedience envisaged by 		the resolution 		of August 		1942 cannot be offered, and  that 		full co-operation in 		the war effort 		should be given 		by Congress, 		provided that His 		Majesty’s Government 		(a) declare 		immediate Indian independence, 		and (b) form a 		‘national government’ 		responsible to the 		Central Assembly, 		‘subject to 		the proviso 		that, during the 		pendency of 		the war, 		the military 		operations should 		continue as at present but without involving any financial burden on India.’    His 		Majesty’s Government 		remain most anxious that 		a settlement 		of the Indian 		problem should be 		reached. But 		proposals such as 		those put 		forward by 		you are quite 		unacceptable to 		His Majesty’s 		Government as a 		basis for discussion, 		and you 		must realize this, if 		you have 		read Mr. Amery’s 		statement in the 		House of 		Commons on July 		28 last. 		They are indeed 		very similar 		to the 		proposals made 		by Maulana 		AbulKalam Azad 		to Sir Stafford Cripps 		in April 1942, 		and His Majesty’s     
 Government’s reasons for rejecting them are the same as they were then.
  Without 	recapitulating all these 	reasons in detail, 	I should 	remind you that 	His Majesty’s 	Government at that time made it clear: 
  that 	their offer of 	unqualified freedom after 	the cessation 	of hostilities 	was made 	conditional upon 	the framing of 	a constitution 	agreed by the 	main elements of 	India’s national life 	and the negotiation 	of the 	necessary treaty 	arrangements with 	His Majesty’s Government;  that 	it is impossible 	during the 	period of 	hostilities to 	bring about any 	change in 	the constitution, 	by which 	means alone a “national 	government”, such as 	you suggest, could be made responsible to the Central Assembly. 
 The object of these conditions was to ensure the fulfilment of their duty to safeguard the interests of the racial and religious minorities and of the Depressed Classes, and their treaty obligations to the Indian States.
  It 	was upon 	the above 	conditions that 	His Majesty’s 	Government invited Indian 	leaders to take 	part in an interim 	government which would operate under the 	existing constitution. I 	must make it quite clear that 	until the war is over, 	responsibility for 	defence and 	military operations 	cannot be divided 	from the other 	responsibilities of 	Government, and 	that until hostilities 	cease and the new 	constitution is 	in operation, His 	Majesty’s Government 	and the Governor-General 	must retain their 	responsibility over the 	entire field. So 	far as 	the question 	of India’s 	share of the 	cost of the 	war is concerned, 	this is 	essentially a 	matter for 	settlement between 	His Majesty’s 	Government on the 	one hand and 	the Government of 	India on 	the other, 	and existing 	financial arrangements can 	only be re-opened 	at the 	instance of 	one or 	the other.  It 	is clear, in 	these circumstances, 	that no 	purpose would be 	served by 	discussion on 	the basis which you 	suggest. If, 	however, the 	leaders of 	the Hindus, the 	Muslims and 	the important minorities 	were willing to 	co-operate in 	a transitional 	government established 	and working 	within the present 	constitution, I believe 	good progress 	might be made. 	For such a 	transitional government 	to succeed, 	there must, before it 	is formed, be 	agreement in 	principle between Hindus 	and Muslims 	and all 	important elements as 	to the method by 	which the 	new constitution should 	be framed. 	This agreement 	is a 	matter for 	Indians themselves. Until 	Indian leaders have 	come closer 	together than they are 	now, I 	doubt if 	I myself can 	do anything 	to help. 	Let me 	remind you 	too that minority 	problems are not easy. 	They are real 	and can be 	solved only 	by mutual 	compromise and tolerance.  The 	period, after 	the termination 	of hostilities, 	for which 	the transitional 	government would last, 	would depend on the 	speed with 	which the 	new constitution could 	be framed. 	I see 	no reason 	why preliminary 	work on 	that constitution 	should not begin as soon as the Indian leaders are prepared to co-operate to that end. If they 
 can arrive at a genuine agreement as to the method of framing the constitution, nounnecessary time need be spent after the war in reaching final conclusions and in agreeing on treaty arrangements with His Majesty’s Government. There again, the primary responsibility rests on the Indian leaders.
 Yours sincerely,
 WAVELL

 APPENDIX XVI
 DRAFT LETTER TO THE COMMISSIONER OF POLICE, BOMBAYlibtech_1045_footnote
 For many of us 9th of August, 1942, is a Red Letter Day. Of the resolution of the 8th August we are proud. It is a declaration of India’s hope. Though roughly national, it is international in outlook. Thus it has sanction clause which too the Congress has nothing to be ashamed of. It replaces for its sanction armed force by normal force of self-suffering in the shape of mass civil disobedience. If some Congressmen and others went astray during the days following the 8th of August, 1942, they did so contrary to the resolution. Mahatma Gandhi, the authority  appointed by the A. I. C. C. to enforce the sanction, never got the chance of enforcing it. He says, the authority lapsed with his imprisonment and was not revived by his release. He says further that, even if it has not lapsed, he thinks that under the altered circumstances it would be improper to revive the sanction clause. I confess that none of us has a knowledge of the technique of mass civil  disobedience.  Therefore there is no question of enforcing the sanction. Hence any act my fellow-workers may wish to do on the 9th of August next must not be confused with the sanction clause. This letter would be unnecessary but for the extraordinary powers given to you. Under the ordinance rule, no procession or public meeting can be held without your previous permission. This is an encroachment upon an ordinary civil right. Now on the 9th, as a symbol and token, I propose to organize five parties of five persons each with tricolour flags. They will march, in order to avoid crowds gathering, without notice towards Chowpatty Sands, reach the Lokamanya statue at
 5.30 a.m. and stand for five minutes in silent prayer, then recite the resolution in
 Hindustani and sing the jhandavandanlibtech_1046_footnotesong and disperse. I sincerely hope that you have no objection to this simple ceremony. I shall thank you to let me have your permission.
 
 NOTE: Gandhi is expected to issue a detailed circular of instructions to all Congressmen by the 5th. On the 9th, 25 persons are starting in procession, in batches of five from quarters of Bombay, and converging at 5.30 a.m. (time dictated by Gandhi) at Chowpatty Sands and carry out the day’s programme.

 APPENDIX XVII
 A RESOLUTIONlibtech_1047_footnote
 The Working Committee have given their full and earnest consideration to the proposals made by the British War Cabinet in regard to India and the elucidation thereof by Sir Stafford Cripps. These proposals, which have been made at the very last hour because of the compulsion of events, have to be considered not only in relation to India’s demand for independence, but more especially in the present grave war crisis, with a view to meeting effectively the perils and dangers that confront India and envelop the world.
 The Congress has repeatedly stated, ever since the commencement of the War in September 1939, that the people of India would line themselves with the progressive forces of the world and assume full responsibility to face the new problems and shoulder the new burdens that had arisen, and it asked for the necessary conditions to enable them to do so to be created. An essential condition was the freedom of India, for only the realization of present freedom could light the flame which would illumine millions of hearts and move them to action. At the last meeting of the All-India Congress Committee, after the commencement of the War in the Pacific, it was stated that: “Only a free and independent India can be in a position to undertake the defence of the country on a national basis and be of help in the furtherance of the larger causes that are emerging from the storm of war.”
 The British War Cabinet’s new proposals relate principally to the future upon the cessation of hostilities. The Committee, while recognizing  that self-determination for the people of India is accepted in principle in that uncertain future, regret that this is fettered and circumscribed and certain provisions have been introduced which gravely imperil the development of a free and united nation and the establishment of a democratic State. Even the constitution-making body is so constituted that the people’s right to self-determination is vitiated by the
 
 introduction of non-representative elements. The people of India have as a whole clearly demanded full independence and the Congress has repeatedly declared that no other status except that of independence for the whole of India could be agreed to or could meet the essential requirements of the present situation. The Committee recognize that future independence may be implicit in the proposals but the accompanying provisions and restrictions are such that real freedom may  well  become an illusion. The complete ignoring of the ninety millions of the people of the Indian States and their treatment as commodities at the disposal of their rulers is a negation of both democracy and self-determination. While the representation of an Indian State in the constitution-making body is fixed on a population basis, the people of the States have no voice in choosing those representatives, nor are they to be consulted at any stage, while decisions vitally affecting them are being taken. Such States may in many way become barriers to the growth of Indian freedom, enclaves where foreign authority still prevails and where the possibility of maintaining foreign armed forces has been stated to be a likely contingency, and a perpetual menace to the freedom of the people of the State as well as of the rest of India.
 The acceptance beforehand of the novel principle of non-accession for a province is also a severe blow to the conception of Indian unity and an apple of discord likely to generate growing trouble in the provinces, and which may well lead to further difficulties in the way of the Indian States merging themselves in the Indian Union. The Congress has been wedded to Indian freedom and unity and any break in that unity, especially in the modern world when people’s minds inevitably think in terms of ever larger federations, would be injurious to all concerned and exceedingly painful to contemplate. Nevertheless the Committee cannot think in terms of compelling the people in any territorial unit to remain in an Indian Union against their declared and established will. While recognizing this principle, the Committee feel that every effort should be made to create conditions which would help the different units in developing a common and co-operative national life. The acceptance of the principle inevitably involves that no changes should be made which result in fresh problems being created and compulsion being exercised on other substantial groups within that area. Each territorial unit should have the fullest possible autonomy within the Union, consistently with a strong national State. The proposal now made on the part of the British War Cabinet encourages and will lead to attempts at separation at the very inception of a Union and thus create friction just when the utmost co-operation and goodwill are most needed. This proposal has been presumably made to meet a communal demand, but it will have other consequences also and lead politically reactionary and obscurantist groups among different communities to create trouble and divert public attention from the vital issues before the country.
 Any proposal concerning the future of India must demand attention and scrutiny, but in today’s grave crisis, it is the present that counts, and even proposals for the future are important in so far as they affect the present. The Committee have necessarily attached the greatest importance to this aspect of the question, and on this ultimately depends what advice they should give to those who look to them for guidance. For the present the British War Cabinet’s proposals are vague and altogether incomplete and it would appear that no vital changes in the present structure are contemplated. It has been made clear that the Defence of India will in any event remain under British control. At any time defence is a vital subject; during war time it is all-important and covers almost every sphere of life and administration. To take away defence from the sphere of responsibility at this stage is to reduce that responsibility to a farce and a nullity, and to make it perfectly clear that India is not going to be free in any way and her Government is not going to function as a free and independent government during the pendency of the War. The Committee would repeat that an essential and fundamental prerequisite for the assumption of responsibility by the Indian people in the present is their realization as a fact that they are free and are in charge of maintaining and defending their freedom. What is most wanted is the enthusiastic response of the people which cannot be evoked without the fullest trust in them and the devolution of responsibility on them in the matter of defence. It is only thus that even at this grave eleventh hour it may be possible to galvanize the people of India to rise to the height of the occasion. It is manifest that the present Government of India, as well as its provincial agencies, are lacking in competence, and are incapable of shouldering the burden of  India’s defence. It is only the people of India, through their popular representatives, who may shoulder this burden worthily. But that can only be done by present freedom, and full responsibility being cast upon them.
 The Committee, therefore, are unable to accept the proposals put forward on behalf of the British War Cabinet.

  I 	had been to Lahore in connection with a case and returned today.   Khizr’s 		man had contacted 		me. He 		himself was 		out of town. 		He wishes 		that no 		commitments be 		made with Jinnah 		regarding the Punjab. 		He is not concerned 		with whatever 		else you may do. He 		will oppose 		the partition. 		He is not 		a man 		of daring. 		Glaneylibtech_1049_footnote, Sir Zafrullalibtech_1050_footnote, Sultan Ahmedlibtech_1051_footnote, are on his side. 		He will send a messenger to you 		in a few days.  Chhoturamlibtech_1052_footnoteand his party 		are greatly 		upset.

Your message was conveyed 		to Sir Tek Chand Bakshilibtech_1053_footnoteby telephone 		at Dalhousie. 		He is keeping 		indifferent health, 		otherwise he 		would have come to 		see you. It 		is naturally difficult 		to comprehend 		from your statements how the Rajaji Formula and Akhand Hindustan can be reconciled.  Dr. 		Gopichandlibtech_1054_footnotemet me 		here. They 		will not violate 		discipline; but 		their minds 		are greatly 		perturbed. They are not 		satisfied with 		the written consolation 		you gave 		them at Juhu.  The 		Sikhs who 		were the 		protagonists of 		Azad Punjab have now 		become supporters 		of Akhand 		Hindustan, at least 		for the present. Master 		Tara Singh sent a 		message that he 		would meet me; 		but did not turn up. 		He is anxious to 		meet you. He 		is possibly 		nursing a grievance 		that he 		was not accorded 		a proper 		reception during one of 		his visits 		to Wardha.  I 		had talks with Sant 		Singh and other Nationalist 		Sikhs also. They do 		not mind 		if some 		final settlement is 		arrived at. Jinnah had held several secret negotiations and part of their trend has come             
 to be known: (1) He would start by demanding 50% in the National Government; but would accept 42% in the end. (2) He had discussed five plans for plebiscite, though it is not known what those plans were.
  As 	far as 	possible, I 	am keeping 	quiet about the Rajaji 	Formula. But (my) 	mind remains perturbed. 	Friends press me and in 	most cases 	misunderstandings arise. 	My Congress 	friends hint that I am 	thus staging a 	come-back to 	the Congress. 	Others say 	that I 	am betraying the 	cause of 	Akhand Hindustan on 	your account. Should I 	say something 	explicitly or should 	I maintain silence? 
 According to my humble opinion, (1) Akhand Hindustan is a fundamental principle for me. I am unable to change anything in it. (2)  Whatever  the  Constitution, only the areas having Muslim majority in India should constitute separate units. We cannot reconcile ourselves till the Punjab and Bengal are not partitioned. (3) It does not seem probable that the policy of Hindu-Muslim unity which has been a failure for the (past) 25 years will now succeed. (4) Today, none but the Muslims are honestly welcoming the Rajaji Formula. You are of course powerful. There would be many who, for several reasons, would accept whatever you say. But what is rankling in their hearts would no doubt continue to do so. (5) By supporting the Rajaji Formula you have been able to prove your readiness to arrive at a communal settlement. (6) Jinnah’s ambition of 25 years to determine the future of India in partnership with you is fulfilled. He is now convinced that the British are out to hit at him in the Punjab, and so he is eager to arrive at some settlement. If the settlement arrived at is such that it could be misused or if there is a deadlock, the situation is likely to be worse than it was. I am so disturbed about this thing that I am relieving my burden by expressing myself to you. If, in your opinion, I should publish my viewpoint in the proper form, do kindly let me know. I shall prepare it and send it for your prior approval.

 that there must be someone on the other side with authority holding a representative status with whom I can negotiate and, if possible, come to a settlement of the Hindu-Muslim question, and that for the position you had adopted there was no precedent, and that this raises great difficulties in my way. As you know, I can only speak on behalf of Muslim India and the All-India Muslim League, as the President of the organization which I represent, and as such I am subject to and governed by its constitution, rules and regulations. I think you realize and will admit that the settlement of the Hindu-Muslim question is the foremost and the major hurdle, and unless the representatives of these two nations put their heads together, how is one to make any headway with it?
 Nevertheless, I explained to you the Lahore Resolution of March 1940, and tried to persuade you to accept the basic and fundamental principles embodied in that resolution, but you not only refused to consider it but emphasized your opposition to the basic position indicated in the resolution, and remarked that there was “an ocean between you and me”, and when I asked you what is then the alternative you suggest, you put forward a formula of Mr. Rajagopalachari, approved of by you. We discussed it, and as the various matters were vague and nebulous, and  some  required clarification, I wanted to have a clear idea of what it really meant, and what were its implications, and asked you for explanation and clarification regarding the proposals embodied in that Formula. After some discussion, you requested me to formulate in writing my points that I thought required or called for explanation and clarification, and to communicate with you and that you would reply in writing before our next meeting on Monday, September 11th, at 5.30 p.m. I am, therefore, submitting to you the following points which required clarification:
  With 	regard to the 	preamble: in 	what capacity 	will you 	be a 	consenting party 	if any agreement is reached between you and me?  Clause 	1: With 	regard to “the 	constitution for free 	India” referred to in 	this clause, 	I would 	like to know 	first, what constitution do 	you refer to, 	who will frame it, 	and when 	will it come 	into being? 
 Next, it is stated in the Formula that “the Muslim League endorses the Indian demand for independence.” Does it mean the Congress demand for Independence as formulated in the August Resolution of 1942 by the All-India Congress Committee in Bombay or, if not, what is the significance of this term, for you know the Muslim League has made it clear not only by its resolutions but also by its creed, which is embodied in its constitution, that we stand for the freedom and independence of the whole of this subcontinent, and that applies to Pakistan and Hindustan.
 Next, it is stated that the Muslim League “will co-operate with the Congress in the formulation of a Provisional Interim Government for the transitional period”. I would like to know the basis or the lines on which such a Government is to be set up
 
 or constituted. If you have a complete and definite scheme, please let me have it.
  Clause 	2: Who 	will appoint the 	Commission referred to 	in this clause 	and who 	will give effect to 	their findings? 	What is 	the meaning 	of “absolute 	majority” referred 	to in it? 	Will the 	contemplated plebiscite 	be taken 	district-wise, or, if 	not, on 	what basis? Who 	will determine and 	decide whether such a 	plebiscite should be 	based on 	adult franchise or 	other practicable 	franchise? Who will 	give effect to the 	decision or 	verdict of 	the above 	mentioned plebiscite? Would only 	the districts on 	the border 	which are 	taken out 	from the 	boundaries of 	the present 	provinces by delimitation 	be entitled 	to choose 	to join 	either State or also 	those outside the 	present boundaries 	would have the 	right to 	choose to 	join either State? Clause 3: Who are meant by “all parties” in this clause?  Clause 	4: I would 	like to know 	between whom and through 	what machinery and 	agency will 	the “mutual agreements” 	referred to in this 	clause be 	entered into? 	What is 	meant by 	“safeguarding defence 	and commerce, 	communi-cations and for 	other essential 	purposes”? Safeguarding against whom?  Clause 	6: “These 	terms shall be binding 	only in 	case of 	transfer by 	Britain of 	full power and 	responsibility for 	the Government of 	India.” I 	would like to 	know to 	whom is this power to be transferred, through what machinery and agency, and when? 
 These are some of the important points that occur to me for the moment, which require explanation and clarification, and hope that you will let me have full details with regard to the various points that I have raised, in order that I may be better able to understand and judge your proposals before I can deal with them satisfactorily.
 Yours sincerely,

              DEAR MR. GANDHI,  APPENDIX XX  LETTER FROM M. 	A. JINNAHlibtech_1056_footnote       September 	10, 1944 
  I 	received your 	letter of September 	11 at 5 	p.m. today. I 	note that you 	have approached me 	as an individual, and 	I have 	already expressed my 	views about it. 	Please do 	not take 	it that 	I acquiesce 	in the 	position that you 	have adopted, for 	which there 	is no precedent. 	Nevertheless, I proceeded 	to discuss 	matters with you 	naturally because 	I am anxious 	to convert 	you to my point 	of view, 	if possible. 	I urged 	you that 	the only 	solution of India’s 	problem is to accept 	the division 	of India 	as Pakistan 	and Hindustan, 	as briefly 	laid down in the Lahore 	Resolution of March 	1940, and proceed 	to settle 	the details 	forthwith. You say the 	Lahore Resolution is 	indefinite. You 	never asked 	me for 	any clarification or 	explanation of 	the terms 	of the 	Resolution, but 	you really 	indicated your 	emphatic opposition 	to the 	very basis and 	the fundamental 	principles embodied in 	it. I 	would, therefore, like to 	know in 	what way 	or respect 	the Lahore 	Resolution is 	indefinite. I 	cannot agree that 	Rajaji has 	taken from 	it its 	substance and 	given it 	shape. On 	the contrary, 	he has 	not only put 	it out 	of shape 	but mutilated 	it, as 	I explained 	in my speech 	which I delivered 	at the 	meeting of 	the Council of the All-India Muslim League at Lahore on the 30th of July, 1944.   You 		say the “first 		condition of 		the exercise of the right 		of self- 		determination is 		achieving independence 		by the 		joint action of 		all the parties 		and groups 		composing India. If such 		joint action is 		unfortunately 		impossible, then, too, I 		must fight 		with the assistance 		of such 		elements as 		can be 		brought together”. 		This in 		my opinion 		is, as 		I have 		repeatedly said, 		putting the cart 		before the horse, 		and is 		generally opposed to 		the policy and 		declarations of 		the All-India Muslim 		League, and you 		are only holding on 		firmly to 		the August 		Resolution of 1942. 		In order 		to achieve 		the freedom 		and independence 		of the 		peoples of 		India, it 		is essential, in 		the first 		instance, that there 		should be a Hindu-Muslim 		settlement. Of course, 		I am thankful 		to you 		when you 		say that you 		are pledged to 		use all the influence 		that you have 		with the Congress 		to ratify 		your agreement 		with me, but that is 		not enough 		in my judgement, 		although it 		will be 		a very valuable help to 		me. I 		once more ask 		you, please, to 		let me 		know what is 		your conception of 		the basis 		for the formation 		of a Provisional 		Interim Government. 		No doubt 		it will 		be subject 		to agreement 		between the League 		and the 		Congress, but 		I think 		in fairness 		you should 		at least 		give me 		some rough 		idea of 		the lines of your conception, for you must have thought it out by now, and I would like to     
 know what are your proposals or scheme for the formation of a Provisional Interim Government, which can give me some clear picture to understand it.
  You 	have omitted to 	answer my 	question as 	to who will give effect 	to the 	findings of 	the Commission, 	and also 	it is not 	clear to 	me what you 	mean by 	absolute majority, 	when you say it 	means “a 	clear majority 	over non-Muslim 	elements as in 	Sind, Baluchistan or 	the Frontier 	Province”. You 	have not even 	replied to  my question as to who will decide the form of the 	plebiscite and 	the franchise  	contemplated by 	the Formula.  The 	answer does 	not carry any 	clear idea 	when you say “all parties 	means parties interested”.  You 	say “mutual agreement 	means agreement between contracting parties”, 	who are the contracting 	parties once a 	Provisional Interim 	Government is established 	of your 	conception? Who 	will appoint the 	Central or 	Joint Board of 	Control, which 	will safeguard defence, 	etc., and 	on what 	principle, through 	what machinery and 	agency, and subject to whose control and orders will such a Central or Joint Board be?  You 	say “the power 	is to be transferred 	to the 	nation, that is, 	to the 	Provisional Government”. 	That is all the greater 	reason why I would 	like to know 	full details 	of the Provisional 	Government as 	contemplated by 	you and of  your conception. 
 Yours sincerely,
 JINNAH

              DEAR MR. GANDHI,  APPENDIX XXI  LETTER FROM M. 	A. JINNAHlibtech_1057_footnote       September 	11, 1944 
  I 	received your letter of 	September 14 	at 4.45 p.m. today in 	reply to 	my letter  of 	September 11 	(and not 	of September 13 	as you state, which seems 	to be a mistake) 	and I thank 	you for it.   Please 		let me 		have as 		soon as 		you can your 		promised letter 		indicating in 		what way 		or respect the 		Lahore Resolution is 		“indefinite”.  With 		regard to the provision 		in the Gandhi-Rajaji 		Formula that “the Muslim 		League endorses the 		Indian demand for 		Independence”, I 		asked you 		in my letter dated 		September 10, “does it mean the Congress demand for independence, as formulated in     
 the August 1942 Resolution by the All India Congress Committee in Bombay or, if not, what is the significance of this term?”, to which you replied by your letter of September 11, “The Independence contemplated is of the whole of India as it stands.” Hence I again ask, does it mean on the basis of a United India? I find that you have not clarified the point satisfactorily.
 As regards the next part of the clause, the Formula proceeds to lay down that “the Muslim League will co-operate with the Congress in the formation of the Provisional Interim Government for the transitional period”. I requested you by my letter of September 10 to let me know “the basis or the lines on which such a Government is to be set up or constituted. If you have a complete and definite scheme, please let me have it” to which you replied by your letter of September 11 under reply that “the basis for the formation of the Provisional Interim Government will have to be agreed to between the League and the Congress.” But that is not meeting my request for clarification, or giving me at least the outlines of such a Government. And that is what I have been asking for. I hope that you do appreciate my point when I am requesting you to let me have rough outlines of the proposed Provisional Interim Government according to the Formula, so that I may have some idea. Of course, I can quite understand that such a Provisional Interim Government will represent all the parties and would be of a character that will inspire confidence at the present moment of all the parties. I can quite understand that when the moment arrives, certain things may follow but before we can deal with this Formula in a satisfactory manner, I repeat again that as it is your Formula, you should give me a rough idea of the Provisional Interim Government that you contemplate and of your conception. What I would like to know would be, what will be the powers of such a Provisional Interim Government, how it will be formed, to whom it will be responsible, and what will be  its composition, etc. You, being the sponsor of this Gandhi-Rajaji Formula, should give me some rough idea and picture of it, so that I may understand what this part of the Formula means.
 In your letter of September 14 in reply to my letter of September 11, you inform me that you would have told me if you had any scheme in mind. “I imagine that  if we two can agree it would be for us to consult the other parties”, but that is just the point. Unless I have some outlines or scheme, however rough, from you, what are we to discuss in order to reach any agreement?
 As regards the other matters which you have further explained, I have noted the explanation, and I do not think I need press you further, although some of them are not quite satisfactory.
 Yours sincerely,
 JINNAH

              DEAR MR. GANDHI,  APPENDIX XXII  LETTER FROM M. 	A. JINNAHlibtech_1058_footnote       September 	17, 1944 
  I 	have your letter of 	September 15, 	and I thank 	you for it. I 	note that you 	have for 	the moment shunted the 	Rajaji Formula and 	are applying your mind 	very seriously to 	the Lahore 	Resolution of the 	Muslim League. It 	is my duty to 	explain the 	Lahore Resolution 	to you today 	and persuade 	you to accept 	it, even 	though you are talking 	to me, as 	you have often 	made it 	clear, in 	your individual 	capacity. I have 	successfully converted 	non-Muslim Indians 	in no small 	number and also 	a large body of foreigners, 	and if 	I can convert 	you, exercising as you 	do tremendous 	influence over Hindu 	India, it will 	be no small 	assistance to me, 	although we 	are not proceeding 	on the 	footing that 	you are carrying 	on these 	talks in your 	representative character 	or capacity, 	and my 	difficulties remain until 	you are vested 	with a representative 	status and authority in order to negotiate and reach an agreement with you.  You 	have stated in your letter dated September 11 that the Lahore 	Resolution is “indefinite”. I, therefore, naturally asked you to 	please let me know in what way or respect the Lahore Resolution is 	indefinite, and now I have received your letter of September 15 	under reply.  The 	third paragraph of 	your letter is 	not seeking 	clarification,  but  a 	disquisition and 	expression of 	your views on 	the point, whether the 	Mussalmans are 	a nation. This 	matter can 	hardly be 	discussed by 	means of 	correspondence. There is 	a great 	deal of discussion 	and literature 	on this 	point which is available, 	and it 	is for you 	to judge 	finally, when 	you have 	studied this 	question thoroughly, 	whether the Mussalmans 	and Hindus 	are not two major 	nations in this 	sub-continent. For 	the moment, 	I would 	refer you to 	two publications, 	although there are many 	more—Dr. Ambedkar’s 	book and “M. R. T.’s” Nationalism 	in Conflict 	in India. 	We maintain 	and hold 	that Muslims and 	Hindus are 	two major nations 	by any 	definition or 	test of 	a nation. We are a nation 	of hundred million, and what is more, we are a nation with our 	own distinctive culture 	and civilization, 	language and literature, 	art and architecture, 	names and 	nomenclature, sense of 	value and 	proportion, legal laws 	and moral 	codes, customs 	and calendar, 	history and traditions, 	aptitudes and ambitions; 	in short, 	we have 	our own distinctive 	outlook on life 	and of 	life. By 	all canons 	of international 	law we are a nation. Now I shall reply to your various points:  Yes, the word “Pakistan” is not mentioned in the Resolution and it does not     
 bear the original meaning. The word has now become synonymous with the Lahore Resolution.
 This point does not arise, but still I reply that the question is a mere bogey.  This 	point is 	covered by 	my answer that 	the Mussalmans of 	India are 	a nation. 	As to the 	last part of 	your query, 	it is hardly 	relevant to 	the matter of clarification 	of the Resolution. Surely, 	you know what the word “Muslims” means.  This 	point does not arise by 	way of 	clarification of 	the text of 	the Lahore 	Resolution. No. 	They will form units of Pakistan.  As 	soon as 	the basis 	and the principles 	embodied in the 	Lahore Resolution 	are accepted, the question of demarcation will have to be taken up immediately. In view of my reply to (7), your question (8) has been answered. Does 	not relate 	to clarification. My 	answer to 	(9) covers 	this point.  Does 	not arise 	out of 	the clarification 	of the 	Resolution. Surely, this 	is not 	asking for clarification 	of the 	Resolution. I 	have in 	numerous speeches of 	mine and 	the Muslim 	League in its 	resolutions have pointed 	out that 	this is the 	only solution of 	India’s problem and 	the road to 	achieve freedom and 	independence of 	the peoples 	of India.  	“Muslims 	under the Princes”: 	The Lahore 	Resolution is only 	confined to 	British India. This question does not arise out of clarification of the Resolution.  The 	definition of 	“minorities”: You 	yourself have 	often said minorities 	mean “accepted minorities”.  The 	adequate, effective and mandatory safeguards for minorities referred 	to  in the 	Resolution are 	a matter 	for negotiation 	and settlement 	with the minorities 	in the 	respective States, viz., 	Pakistan and Hindustan.  It 	does give basic 	principles and when they 	are accepted, then 	the details will 	have to be worked 	out by 	the contracting 	parties. (a & b). 	Does not 	arise by 	way of 	clarification; (c) 	The Muslim League is 	the only authoritative 	and representative 	organization of Muslim 	India; (d) No. See answer (C). 
 As regards your final paragraph, before receiving clarifications from me you have already passed your judgment and condemned the Lahore Resolution, when you say, “As I write the letter and imagine the working of the Resolution in practice I see nothing but ruin for the whole of India.” I understand that you have made clear to me that you represent nobody but yourself, and I am trying to persuade you and to convert you that this is the road which will lead us all to the achievement of freedom and
 independence, not only of the two major nations, Hindus and Muslims, but of the rest of the peoples of India, but when you proceed to say that you aspire to represent all the inhabitants of India, I regret I cannot accept that statement of yours. It is quite clear that you represent nobody else but the Hindus, and as long as you do not realize your true position and the realities, it is very difficult for me to argue with you, and it becomes still more difficult to persuade you, and hope to convert you to the realities and the actual conditions prevailing in India today. I am pleading before you in the hope of converting you, as I have done with many others successfully. As I have said before, you are a great man and you exercise enormous influence over the Hindus, particularly the masses, and by accepting the road that I am pointing out to you, you are not prejudicing or harming the interests of the Hindus or of the minorities. On the contrary, Hindus will be the greater gainers. I am convinced that true welfare not only of the Muslim but the rest of India lies in the division of India as proposed by the Lahore Resolution. It is for you to consider whether it is not your policy and programme, in which you have persisted, which has been the principal factor of ‘ruin of the whole of India’ and of misery and degradation of the people to which you refer and which I deplore no less than anyone else. And it is for that very reason I am pleading before you all these days, although you insist that you are having talks with me only in your individual capacity, in the hope that you may yet revise your policy and programme.
 Yours sincerely,
 JINNAH

             DEAR 	MR. GANDHI,  APPENDIX XXIII  LETTER FROM M. 	A. JINNAHlibtech_1059_footnote       September 	21, 1944 
  I 	am in receipt of your letter of September 19, and I have already 	given you my answers to 	all your 	questions relating to 	clarification of 	the Lahore 	Resolution or any 	part of 	it, and I am glad that 	you admit 	when you say it may be 	that “all my 	questions do not 	arise from the view of 	mere clarification 	of the 	Lahore Resolution”, but 	you particularly 	emphasize your points 15 	(a) and 15 (b).  I 	regret to say it has no relation to the context of the Resolution or 	any part thereof. You have brought so many matters into our 	correspondence, which are entirely outside the matter requiring 	clarification, so I have perforce to deal with    
 them. Let me first deal with your letter of September 11.
  You 	say, “My life mission 	has been Hindu-Muslim 	unity, which I want 	for its 	own sake but which is 	not to 	be achieved without the 	foreign ruling power 	being ousted. 	Hence the first 	condition of the 	exercise of 	the right 	of self-determination 	is achieving independence 	by the 	joint action of 	all the parties 	and groups 	composing India. 	If such 	joint action is 	unfortunately impossible, 	then too I 	must fight 	with the 	assistance of 	such elements as 	can be brought together.”  The 	gist of your 	letters up 	to date is 	that you are wedded 	to this 	policy and 	will pursue 	it. In 	your next letter 	of September 	14, while you were good 	enough to 	furnish me 	with the clarification 	of the 	Gandhi-Rajaji Formula, 	you were pleased 	to observe: 	“I have, 	at any 	rate for 	the moment, put 	it out 	of my mind 	and I 	am now 	concentrating on 	the Lahore 	Resolution in the 	hope of finding 	a ground 	for mutual 	agreement.” In your 	letter of September 	15, you say “Independence 	does mean as 	envisaged in 	the A.I.C.C. 	Resolution of 1942.” 	It is, 	therefore, clear that 	you are not prepared to 	revise your 	policy and 	that you 	adhere firmly to 	your policy and 	programme, which you 	have persisted in 	and which culminated in 	your demand, final 	policy, programme and the 	method and 	sanction for 	enforcing it 	by resorting to 	mass civil disobedience 	in terms 	of the 	August 8, 	1942, Resolution, and 	you have made it more 	clear again by stating 	in your 	letter of September 	19 as follows: 	“As to 	your verdict 	on my policy and 	programme, we 	must agree to differ. For, I am whollyunrepentant.” 	You know 	that the August 	1942 Resolution is 	inimical to 	the ideals 	and demands of Muslim India. Then again, in the course of our 	discussion when     I asked you for clarification of the 	Gandhi-Rajaji Formula, you were pleased to say, by your 	letter of 	September 15 	as follows: “For 	the moment I 	have shunted 	the Rajaji 	Formula and 	with your assistance am 	applying my 	mind very seriously to 	the famous 	Lahore Resolution of the 	Muslim League.” We 	discussed it 	in its various 	aspects, as you told 	me you 	were open to 	be persuaded and 	converted to 	our point 	of view. 	I discussed 	the Resolution 	at great 	length with you, and 	explained everything you 	wanted to 	understand, even though 	you have 	emphasized more than once that you 	are having these talks 	with me in your 	personal capacity, and in 	your letter of 	September 15 you 	assured me 	in the following 	words with 	regard to 	the Lahore 	Resolution: “Believe 	me, I 	approach you 	as a seeker, 	though I represent 	nobody but myself,” 	and that 	you were 	open to conviction 	and conversion. 	You had informed 	me by your 	letter of September 	11 as follows: 	“It is 	true that I 	said an 	ocean separated 	you and me 	in outlook. But that had 	no reference to the Lahore Resolution of the League. The League 	Resolution is 	indefinite.” I 	naturally, therefore, 	proceeded in reply 	to ask 	you by my 	letter of 	September 11 	as follows: “You say 	the Lahore Resolution is 	indefinite. You 	never asked me for 	any clarification or 	explanation of 	the terms of 	the Resolution, 	but you really 	indicated your emphatic 	opposition to 	the very basis and 	 the fundamental 	principles embodied in it. I would, therefore, like to know in what 	way or respect the 	Lahore Resolution is 	indefinite,” and 	I sent 	you a 	reminder on 	September 13, to which you replied by your letter of September 15, not confining yourself really 
 
 to matters of clarification, but introducing other extraneous matters, with some of which I had already dealt, in reply to this letter of yours of September 15, by my letter of September 17 and furnished you with all the clarifications, informing you that you had introduced several matters which could hardly be discussed in a satisfactory manner by means of correspondence. I have already given you all the clarifications you require so far as the Lahore Resolution goes and its text is concerned. You again raise further arguments, reasons and grounds and continue to persist in a disquisition on the point, amongst others, whether Muslims of India are a nation, and then you proceed further to say: “Can we not agree to differ on the question of two nations and yet solve the problem on the basis of self-determination?” It seems to me that you are labouring under some misconception of the real meaning of the word “self-determination’. Apart from the inconsistencies and contradictions of  the  various positions that you have adopted in the course of our correspondence, as indicated above, can you not appreciate our point of view that we claim the right of self-determination as a nation and not as a territorial unit, and that we are entitled to exercise our inherent right as a Muslim nation, which is our birth-right? Whereas you are labouring under the wrong idea that “self-determination” means only that of “a territorial unit” which, by the way, is neither demarcated nor defined yet; and there is no Union or Federal Constitution of India in being, functioning as a sovereign Central Government. Ours is a case of division and carving out two independent sovereign States by way of settlement between two major nations, Hindus and Muslims, and not of severance or secession from any existing union, which is non-existent in India. The right of self-determination which we claim postulates that we are a nation, and as such it would be the self-determination of the Mussalmans, and they alone are entitled to exercise that right.
 I hope you will now understand that your question 15(a) does not arise out of the Lahore Resolution or of any part thereof. As to 15(b), again it does not arise as a matter of clarification, for it will be a matter for the constitution-making body chosen by Pakistan to deal with and decide all matters as a sovereign  body representing Pakistan vis-a-vis the constitution-making body of Hindustan or any other party concerned. There cannot be Defence and similar matters of “common concern” when it is accepted that Pakistan and Hindustan will be two separate independent sovereign States. I hope I have now given all satisfactory explanations, over and above the matter of clarification of the Lahore Resolution, in the hope of converting you as an individual “seeker”.
 Yours sincerely,

              DEAR MR. GANDHI,  APPENDIX XXIV  LETTER FROM M. 	A. JINNAHlibtech_1060_footnote       September 	23, 1944 
  I 	am in receipt of your letter of September 22 and thank you for it. I 	am sorry that you think I have summarily rejected the idea of common 	interest between two arms, and now you put it somewhat differently 	from 15(a), when you say there will be no feeling of security by the 	people of India without a recognition of the natural and mutual 	obligations arising out of physical contiguity. My answer, already 	given, is that it will be for the constitution-making body of 	Pakistan and that of Hindustan, or any other party concerned, to 	deal with such matters on the footing of their being two independent 	States.  I 	am really surprised when you say there is no proof of what you 	characterize as   a sweeping 	statement of mine, 	that the August 	1942 Resolution is 	inimical to 	the ideals and demands of Muslim India. The Resolution in its essence is as follows:   Immediate 		grant of Complete Independence [and] setting up immediately of   a 		Federal Central 		Government on the 		basis of 		a united, 		democratic Government of 		India with federated units or Provinces, which means establishing a Hindu Raj.  That 		this National Government 		so set 		up will 		evolve a 		scheme for a Constituent 		Assembly, which will be 		chosen by 		adult franchise, which 		will prepare a 		constitution for 		the Government of 		India, which means that  		the  Constituent 		Assembly chosen will 		be composed 		of an overwhelming 		majority of 		the Hindus, 		nearly 75 		per cent.  To 		enforce this demand of 		the Congress 		the August 		Resolution decides on 		and sanctions 		a resort 		to mass 		civil disobedience at 		your command and 		when ordered 		by you 		as the 		sole Dictator of 		the Congress.   This 	demand is basically and fundamentally opposed to the ideals and 	demands  of Muslim 	India of 	Pakistan, as 	embodied in 	the Lahore 	Resolution, and to 	enforce such 	a demand 	by means 	of resort 	to mass 	civil disobedience is 	inimical to 	the ideals 	and demands of Muslim 	India, and if you succeed in realizing this demand it would be a 	death-blow to 	Muslim India. I 	see from the 	correspondence and 	talks between you 	and me that you are still holding fast to this fateful resolution.  From 	the very first day of our talks, you made it clear to me, and you 	have repeatedly said in the course of our correspondence and talks 	that you have approached me in your individual capacity, and you 	assured me that you were a seeker of light and    
 knowledge and that you seriously and earnestly wanted to understand the Lahore Resolution and were open to conviction and conversion. Therefore, in deference to your wishes I made every effort all these days and in the course of our prolonged talks and correspondence to convert you, but unfortunately it seems I have failed. And now you have made new suggestions and proposals by your letter under reply.
  You 	say, “I 	have, therefore, 	suggested a way 	out. Let 	it be a 	partition as 	between two 	brothers, if 	a division 	there must be”. I 	really do 	not know 	what this means, and 	I would 	like you to 	elaborate this 	proposal and 	give me some 	rough outlines 	of this 	new idea of yours, 	as to how 	and when, the 	division is 	to take place, 	and in what way it is different from the division envisaged by the Lahore Resolution.  You 	say, “Let us 	call in 	a third 	party or parties 	to guide 	or even 	arbitrate between 	us”. May I 	point out 	that you 	have repeatedly made 	clear to me that 	you are 	having these talks as an 	individual seeker? How 	can any question of 	a third 	party or parties 	to guide or arbitrate between us arise? 
 Yours sincerely,

              DEAR MR. GANDHI,  APPENDIX XXV  LETTER FROM M. 	A. JINNAHlibtech_1061_footnote       September 	25, 1944 
  I 	am in receipt of your letter of September 24, and I thank you for 	it. You have already rejected the basic and fundamental principles 	of the Lahore Resolution.  You do not accept that the Mussalmans of India are a nation.  You 		do not accept 		that the 		Mussalmans have 		an inherent right of 		self-determination.  You 		do not 		accept that they alone 		are entitled 		to exercise 		this right of theirs 		for self-determination.  You 		do not 		accept that 		Pakistan is 		composed of 		two zones, 		north-west and 		north-east, comprising 		six Provinces, namely, Sind, 		Baluchistan, North-West Frontier 		Provinces, Punjab, Bengal and 		Assam, subject to 		territorial adjustments 		that may 		be agreed upon, as indicated in the Lahore Resolution. The matter 		of demarcating and 		defining the 		territories can 		be taken 		up after 		the fundamentals 		above mentioned are accepted, and for that purpose, machinery may be set up by agreement.     
 You do not accept the provisions embodied in the Lahore Resolution for safeguarding the minorities. . . .
 . . . I asked you	to give me rough outlines of this new idea of yours as to
 how and when the division is to take place and in what way it is different from the division envisaged in the Lahore Resolution, and now you have been good enough to give me your amplification, in your letter of September 24 under reply. . . .
 The terms clearly indicate that your basis is in vital conflict with and is opposed to the fundamental basis and principles of the Lahore Resolution. Now let me take your main terms:
  	“I 	proceed on the assumption that India is not to be regarded as two or 	more nations, but 	as one 	family consisting of 	many members, of 	whom the 	Muslims living 	in the 	north-west zones, 	i e., 	Baluchistan, Sind, 	North-West Frontier 	Province and that 	part of the Punjab 	where they are in 	absolute majority over 	all the other 	elements and 	in parts of Bengal and Assam where they are in absolute majority, 	desire to live in separation 	from the rest 	of India.” 	If this 	term were accepted and 	given effect to, 	the present 	boundaries of these 	Provinces would be maimed 	and mutilated beyond 	redemption and 	leave us 	only with 	the husk, and 	it is opposed to 	the Lahore Resolution.  That 	even in these mutilated 	areas so defined, the right 	of self-determination 	will not 	be exercised 	by the 	Muslims but 	by the 	inhabitants of 	these areas so 	demarcated. This 	again is 	opposed to 	the fundamentals 	of the 	Lahore Resolution.  That 	if the vote 	is in favour 	of separation, 	they shall be followed 	to “form 	a separate 	State as soon 	as possible 	after India is free 	from foreign domination”, 	whereas we propose 	that we 	should come 	to a complete settlement 	of our own immediately 	and by 	our united 	front and efforts 	do everything 	in our 	power to 	secure the freedom 	and independence 	of the 	peoples of 	India on 	the basis of 	Pakistan and 	Hindustan.  Next 	you say, 	“There shall be a 	treaty of 	separation which 	should also provide 	for the efficient 	and satisfactory 	administration of Foreign 	Affairs, Defence, 	Internal Communications, 	Customs, Commerce, and 	the like, which must 	necessarily continue to 	be matters of 	common interest between 	the contracting 	parties.” If these 	vital matters are 	to be administered 	by some 	central authority, you 	do not 	indicate what 	sort of authority 	or machinery 	will be 	set up 	to administer these 	matters, and 	how and to whom 	again that 	authority will 	be responsible. 	According to the 	Lahore Resolution, 	as I 	have already 	explained to 	you, all these 	matters, which are the 	life-blood of 	any State, 	cannot be delegated 	to any 	central authority or 	government. The 	matter of 	security of 	the two States 	and the natural 	and mutual 	obligations that may 	arise out 	of physical 	contiguity will 	be for 	the constitution-making 	body of 
 Pakistan and that of Hindustan, or [any] other party concerned, to deal with on the footing of their being two independent States. As regards the safeguarding of the rights of minorities, I have already explained that this question of safeguarding the minorities is fully stated in the Lahore Resolution.
 You will, therefore, see that the entire basis of your new proposal is fundamentally opposed to the Lahore Resolution, and as I have already pointed out to you both in the correspondence and in our discussions, it is very difficult for me to entertain counter-proposals and negotiate . . . unless they come from you in your representative capacity. That was the same difficulty with regard to the Gandhi-Rajaji Formula, and I made it clear to you, at the very outset, but the Formula was discussed as you asserted that it had met the Lahore Resolution in substance. But while you were furnishing me with the clarification of this Formula, you shunted it and we confined ourselves to the Lahore Resolution, and hence the question of your representative capacity did not arise regarding this Formula. But now you have, in your letter of September 24, made a new proposal of your own on your own basis, and the same difficulties present themselves to me as before, and it is difficult to deal with it any further unless it comes from you in your representative capacity.
 I cannot agree with you when you finally wind up by saying: “In your letter of 23rd September, you refer to ‘the basic and fundamental principles embodied in the Lahore Resolution’ and ask me to accept them. Surely, this is unnecessary when as I feel I have accepted the concrete consequence that should follow from  such acceptance.” This is obviously far from correct. Why not  then  accept  the fundamentals of the Lahore Resolution and proceed to settle the details?
 Yours sincerely,
 M. A. JINNAH

 APPENDIX XXVI
 LETTER FROM M. A. JINNAHlibtech_1062_footnote
 September 26, 1944
 
 DEAR MR. GANDHI,
 I am in receipt of your  letter of  September  25.  It  is  entirely  incorrect  and  has no foundation in fact, for you to say that our conversations have come about as a result of my correspondence with Rajaji in July last over his Formula. It is equally baseless to say “and your consultations with the League Working Committee thereon”.
 
 It was entirely in response to your letter of July 17, 1944, which I  received while I  was  at Srinagar, with a fervent request on your part to meet you, and you ended that letter by saying, “Do not disappoint me.” In my reply, again from Srinagar, dated July 24, 1944,     I intimated to you that I would be glad to receive you at my house in Bombay on my return, which would probably be about the middle of August. This was long before the meeting of the Working Committee or that of the Council of the All-India Muslim League, and long before I reached Lahore, and when you arrived here and told me that you were approaching me in your individual capacity, I at once made it clear to you and informed you, both in our talks and by my letter, that the position you had taken up had no precedent for it, and further that it was not possible to negotiate and reach an agreement unless both the parties were fully represented. For,  it  is  one-sided business, as it will not be binding upon any organization in any sense whatever, but you would as an individual only recommend it, if any agreement is reached, to the Congress and the country, whereas it would be binding upon me as the President of the Muslim League. I cannot accept this position. I hope you do see the unfairness and the great disadvantage  to me, and it is so simple and elementary for anyone to understand.
 As regards your proposal of yesterday, which you have simplified in your letter of September 24, I have already sent you my reply.
 With regard to your suggestion to be allowed to address the meeting of the Council, and if they feel like rejecting your “offer” the matter should be put before the open session, let me inform you that only a member or delegate is entitled to participate in the deliberations of the meetings of the Council or in the open session respectively. Besides, it is a most extraordinary and unprecedented suggestion to make. However, I thank you for your advice.
 As regards your proposal for arbitration and outside guidance, I have already replied to you, and it is not merely technical but a matter of substance. I fully reciprocate your desire for securing a Congress-League settlement.
 However, I regret I have failed to convince you and convert you, as I was hopeful of doing.
 Yours sincerely,
 M. A. JINNAH

              DEAR MR. GANDHI,  APPENDIX XXVII  LETTER FROM M. 	A. JINNAHlibtech_1063_footnote       September 	26, 1944 
  I 	have received your letter 	of September 	26, and I note 	that you have 	written it with 	Rajaji’s advice. Of 	course, it 	is for you to follow such 	advice as you may choose to do, 	but I am 	only concerned 	for the moment 	with you. I 	note that at 	the last 	moment you 	have resurrected the 	Gandhi Rajaji Formula, 	although it was 	shunted all 	this time and you proceed 	to say 	that this 	Formula gives 	me virtually 	what is embodied 	in the 	Lahore Resolution. You 	further say 	that on the 	same plan you have tried 	to formulate 	your latest 	proposals, as mentioned 	in your 	letter of 	September 24 	and you maintain that 	either gives me the 	substance of 	the Lahore Resolution. In 	your previous 	letter you asserted 	that your Formula 	gives me the 	“essence” of 	the Lahore 	Resolution. I 	see a very close family 	resemblance between the 	two, and 	the substance of 	one or 	the other 	is practically 	the same, 	only it 	is put in 	different language, and 	I have 	already expressed 	my opinion, 	that in 	my judgment they 	neither meet the 	substance nor 	the essence of 	the Lahore 	Resolution. On 	the contrary, both 	are calculated 	to completely 	torpedo the Pakistan 	demand of Muslim 	India. I have 	never asked you to 	accept certain theses nor 	have I introduced 	any theories 	in the 	Lahore Resolution. Theses and theories are matters for scholars to indulge in.  I 	am very 	sorry I have 	to repeat, 	but I 	am compelled 	to do so, 	that I 	cannot agree with 	you that my references 	to your 	not being clothed with 	representative authority 	are really 	irrelevant. On the 	contrary, they 	have an important 	bearing, as I 	have already explained to 	you more 	than once. You again 	repeat that if you 	and I can 	agree upon a 	common course of 	action, you 	may use what influence 	you possess 	for its 	acceptance by 	the Congress 	and the country. 	I have 	already stated from 	the very beginning 	that that is 	not enough, 	for the reasons 	I have already given. 	Your representative 	capacity comes into play when you 	are making 	counter-proposals, and  I 	cannot understand how 	you can say that it 	is irrelevant. No 	responsible organization 	can entertain 	any proposal 	from any individual, 	however great he may 	be, unless it 	is backed up 	with the authority 	of a 	recognized organization, 	and comes 	from its fully 	accredited 	representative. However, I 	need not labour 	this point 	any more, 	as I 	have already 	explained it in our 	previous correspondence.  If 	a break comes, it will be because you have not satisfied me in 	regard to the essence of the claim embodied in the Lahore 	Resolution. It is not a question of your 
 being unwilling, but in fact, it is so. If a break comes it will be most unfortunate. If one does not agree with you or differs from you, you are always right and the other party is always wrong, and the next thing is that many are waiting prepared, in your circle, to pillory me when the word goes, but I must face all threats and consequences, and I can only act according to my judgment and conscience.
      The 	Hindu, 29-9-1944      APPENDIX XXVIII  M. A. JINNAH’S 	STATEMENTlibtech_1064_footnote  Yours 	sincerely,  M. 	A. JINNAH             September 	27, 1944 
  Mr. 	Gandhi from the very commencement of our talks made it clear that he 	had approached me in his individual capacity and that he represented 	no one but himself. However, he assured me that he was really open 	to conviction and conversion to the Muslim League Lahore Resolution 	of March 1940.  Without 	prejudice to 	my objection that 	in order 	to reach any settlement, 	negotiations can 	only be carried 	on properly 	when the other 	side is also 	fully represented 	and vested with authority, in deference to Mr. Gandhi’s wishes I 	agreed to the task of 	persuading and converting 	him to the fundamentals 	of the Lahore Resolution.  I 	have placed 	before him everything 	and every 	aspect of the 	Muslim point of 	view in the course of our 	prolonged talks and correspondence, and we discussed all the 	pros and cons 	generally, and I regret 	to say that 	I have 	failed in my task 	of converting 	Mr. Gandhi.  We 	have, therefore, decided to release to the Press the correspondence 	that has passed between us.  Nevertheless, 	we hope that the public will not feel embittered, and we trust that 	this is not the final end of our effort.  Gandhi 	-Jinnah Talks, p. 40
