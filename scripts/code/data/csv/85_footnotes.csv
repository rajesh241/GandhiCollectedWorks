I have for a long time been thinking over it and I have come to the conclusion that not only have I no locus standi to call such a conference but that such a conference will not do any good. In the first place I doubt very much whether Mr. Jinnah or the Hindu Sabha men will make any response as they can very easily dispose of me by saying that I have got no goods to deliver and I have got no party behind me. Secondly—and this is more important—I fear that in a conference like this where people will be actuated by party feeling and will be afraid of criticism from their own following if they take an independent line, no solid results can be achieved and indeed what I fear is that our differences will come to the surface. It is for this reason that I think that if you and Mr. Jinnah can appoint such a committee and that committee can submit a report, it may pave the way for a larger conference at that stage. I am, therefore, definitely of the opinion that a conference should not be called at this stage."

The questions were, briefly, as follows: (l) Some constructive workers who had indulged in sabotage in 1942 have repented and taken up constructive work. Is it the duty of such workers to volunteer confessions to the police and be ready to accept punishment? Or should they confess only to their friends and acquaintances? (2) Some say they had been carried away into doing what they did and it is enough to regret it in their own hearts and get on with work. Will this not be deceiving you? (3) Some say they had acted in the belief that what they were doing was right and though the futility of it has become clear to them they see no reason for regretting what they did. Can such workers take up constructive work?"
