libtech_1_footnote,1This was the War 	Conference convened by Lord Chelmsford.
libtech_2_footnote,"2The resolution 	read as follows: 	“That this Conference authorizes and 	requests His 	Excellency the 	Viceroy to convey to 	His  Majesty the  King-Emperor  an 	expression of 	India’s dutiful and loyal 	response to his 	gracious message, and  assurance 	of her determination 	to continue 	to do her duty 	to her utmost 	capacity in the 	great crisis through which the 	Empire is passing.”"
libtech_3_footnote,"3Tilak had 	not been invited; but, 	after an interview 	with the Viceroy 	on April 	27, Gandhiji 	wired asking Tilak to 	attend the 	Conference. This 	he declined 	to do as 	Government would not 	rescind the externment 	order issued against 	him. Annie  Besant, too, 	had received no 	invitation, while 	the Ali Brothers were 	still in 	internment."
libtech_4_footnote,"1Some light is thrown on the background to these observations of Gandhiji in Charles Freer Andrews, p. 132. Gandhiji had asked Andrews to join him on his way to the War Conference. “In the train on his way there Andrews read in the English New Statesman an account of the predatory ‘secret treaties’ unearthed by revolutionaries from the Russian Foreign Office; Great Britain was a signatory of these treaties, notwithstanding her public declarations of the disinterestedness of her fight for freedom. Andrews thrust the papers before Gandhi. ‘How can you take part in a war conference while this sort of double-dealing is going on?’ he demanded.” This was another reason why Gandhiji had initially refused to attend the Conference. Lord Chelmsford, however, in the course of an interview, repudiated the report about the treaties as having emanated from interested quarters and expressed his disbelief that the British Cabinet would enter into a treaty to cede Constantinople to Russia. It was on the basis of this clarification that Gandhiji finally agreed to participate in the Conference."

libtech_7_footnote,2Gandhiji received 	the next day the following message from Maffey: “The Viceroy does 	not believe in your ‘fear and trembling’. Nor do I ! His 	Excellency is very glad indeed to hear that you will join the 	Conference. I have written to Sir Claude Hill to inform him that you 	will join the Man Power Committee which meets at 11 a.m.”
libtech_8_footnote,"1To this Gandhiji received the next day the following reply from Maffey: “I now find that in this morning’s rush I did not read the end part of your letter and only dealt with the first question—your speech. If I may deal with that, may I say that I know the Viceroy felt very much touched by your presence, by the simple words you said and the way you said them. I am so glad that you see scope for definite work ahead. It is all wanted and you will not regret it. Standing out for rights is not always the best way of getting them. If you can believe in us, fight for us and don’t be impatient with us. We leave tonight, but if at any time I can be of service let me know.”"

While he 	is always ready 	to recognize 	legitimate difference of 	opinion on 	public matters, he 	cannot conceive 	of two opinions 	on the propriety 	of admitting 	 a  contentious 	political discussion on 	a resolution 	expressing loyalty to 	His Majesty 	the King- 	Emperor. Still 	less can he understand 	that any loyal citizen 	of the 	Empire should at 	this juncture desire to 	attach conditions to 	his offers of 	service. Mr. 	Tilak and 	some of 	his friends 	attach conditions 	which they 	know, and 	everybody knows, 	to  be impossible 	of fulfilment 	by His Excellency’s 	Government.  The 	 offer  of  co- operation 	on such 	terms only differs  from  an 	open refusal to 	co-operate by 	its lack 	 of candour. 	His Excellency 	is convinced 	that on 	reflection you 	wil recognixe that 	these are 	the only views he 	can entertain 	and on 	which he 	is bound ot 	act. His 	Excellency is 	the more convinced 	of this 	in view 	of the 	fact that your own offer of 	your own offer of 	your services 	to the 	Viceroy, to 	which he 	attaches the 	highest value, 	was made uncvonditionally 	and welcomed 	by him 	on that 	express understan- 	ding. He is confident 	that the 	different and, 	as he regards 	it, the lower 	view of the 	responsibilities of 	a citizen of 	the Empire 	which others may 	entertain will not 	induce you to 	modify your 	own observance of 	the pledge, 	which he 	was so 	glad to 	receive from 	you. I am to add that 	if you desire 	to see His Excellency 	again on this 	matter, he will 	be pleased 	to receive 	a visit 	from you.”"

The first subject discussed was reciprocity of treatment between India and the Dominions. This discussion followed on the resolution passed by the Conference last year, accepting the principle of reciprocity and a further resolution passed to that effect . . . in pursuance of which the Conference agreed as follows: (I) It    is the inherent function of the Governments of several communities of the British Commonwealth including India that each should enjoy complete control in the composition of its own population by means of restriction on immigration from any other communitics. (2) British citizens domiciled in any British country including India should be admitted into any other British country for visits for the purposes of pleasure or commerce including temporary residence for the purpose of education. The conditions of such visits should be regulated on the principle of reciprocity as follows: (a) The right of the Government of India is recognized  to enact laws which shall have the effect of subjecting British citizens domiciled in any other British country to the same conditions in visiting India as those imposed on Indians desiring to visit such country. (b) Such right of visit or temporary residence shall, in each individual case, be embodied in the passport or written permit issued by the country of domicile and subject to vise there by an officer appointed by and acting on behalf of the country to be visited. If such a country so desires, such right shall not extend to the visit or temporary residence for labour purpose or to permanent settlement. (3) Indians already permanently domiciled in other British countries should be allowed to bring in their wives and minor children on condition (a) that no more than one wife and her children shall be admitted for each such Indian, and (b) that each individual so admitted shall be certified by the Government of India as being the lawful wife or child of such Indian. The Conference recommends other questions covered by the Memoranda presented to the Conference by the representatives of India.”"

There would, he held, be an infusion of fresh vigour among the present degenerate Rajputs if inter-marriages were frequent among the Rajputs, Bhatias, Lohanas and Patidars. There can conceivably be nothing wrong if inter-marriages among the Modh and Srimali Bania communities were the rule rather than the exception, but-on no account should the existing (sic) fourfold division be broken through. It is desirable to weld together the four main castes comprising twenty crores of Hindus, by neutralizing the centrifugal tendencies at present separating the various sub-castes in any main caste. Mr. Gandhi said, subject to the above modification, the Hon. Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya had promised his whole-hearted support when the Inter-Caste Marriage Bill would be referred to the Select Committee in the Imperial Legislative Council. In conclusion, Mahatma Gandhi pointed out how a wide chasm yawned between the Brahmin and the Dhed and warned the ardent advocates of marriage reform against short cuts to progress.”"
