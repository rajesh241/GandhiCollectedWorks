1,"May 20, 1946",AN ANALYSISlibtech_1_footnote,"
       	After four days of searching examination of the State  Paperlibtech_2_footnoteissued by the Cabinet Mission and the Viceroy on behalf 	of the British Government, my conviction abides that it is the best 	document the British Government could have produced in the 	circumstances. It reflects our weakness, if we would be good enough 	to see it. The Congress and the Muslim League did not, could not 	agree. We would grievously err if at this time we foolishly satisfy 	ourselves that the differences are a British creation. The Mission 	have note come all the way from England to exploit them. They have 	come to devise the easiest and quickest method of ending British 	rule. We must be brave enough to believe their declaration until the 	contrary is proved.  Bravery thrives upon the deceit of the 	deceiver.  	My compliment, however, does not mean that what is best from the 	British standpoint is also best or even good from the Indian. Their 	best may possibly be harmful. My meaning will, I hope, be clear from 	what follows.  	The authors of the document have endeavoured to say fully what they 	mean. They have gathered from their talks the minimum they thought 	would bring the parties together for framing India’s charter of 	freedom. Their one purpose is to end British rule as early as may 	be. They would do so, if they could, by their effort, leave united 	India not torn asunder by internecine quarrel bordering on civil 	war. They would leave in any case. Since in Simla the two parties, 	though the Mission suceeded in bringing them together at the 	Conference table (with what patience and skill they could do so, 	they alone could tell), could not come to an agreement, nothing 	daunted, they decen- ded to the plains of India, and devised a 	worthy document for the purpose of setting up the Constituent 	Assembly which should frame India’s charter of independence, free 	of any British control or influence. It is an appeal and an advice. 	It has no compulsion in it. Thus the Provincial Assemblies may or 	may not elect the delegates. The delegates, having been elected, may 	or may not join the Cons- tituent Assembly. The Assembly having met, 	may lay down a pro- cedure different from the one laid down in the 	Statement. Whatever is       
 binding on any person or party arises out of the necessity of the situation. The separate voting is binding on both the major parties, only because it is necessary for the existence of the Assembly and in no otherwise. At the time of writing. I took up the Statement, reread it clause by clause, and came to the conclusion that there was nothing in it binding in law. Honour and necessity alone are the two binding forces.
 What is binding is that part of it which commits the British Government. Hence, I suppose, the four members of the British mission took the precaution of receiving full approval of the British Government and the two Houses of Parliament. The Mission  are entitled to warm congratulations for the first step in the act of renunciation which the Statement is. Since other steps are necessary for full renunciation, I have called this one a promissory note.
 Though the response to be made by India is to be voluntary the authors have naturally assumed that the Indian parties are well- organized and responsible bodies capable of doing voluntary acts as fully as, if not more fully than, compulsory acts. Therefore, when Lord Pethick-Lawrence said to  a  Press  correspondentlibtech_3_footnote,“If   they  do come together on that basis, it will mean that they will have accepted that basis, but they can still change it, if a majortiy of each party they desire to do so, ” he was right in the sense that those who became delegates, well knowing the contents of the Statement, were expected by the authors to abide by the basis, unless it was duly altered by the major parties. When two or more rival parties meet together, they do so under some understanding. A self-chosen umpire (in the absence of the one chosen by the parties, the authors constitute themselves one) fancies that the parties will come together only if he presents them with a proposal containing a certain minimum, and he makes his proposal, leaving them free to add to, subtract from or altogether change it by joint agreement.
 This is perfect so far. But what about the units? Are the Sikhs, for whom the Punjab is the only home in India, to consider themselves against their will, as part of the section which takes in Sindh, Balu- chistan and the Frontier Province? Or is the Frontier Province also against its will to belong to the Punjab, called “B” in the Statement, or Assam to“C” although it is a predominantly non-Muslim pro- vince? In my opinion, the voluntary character of the Statement
 
 demands that the liberty of the individual unit should be unimpaired. Any member of the sections is free to join it. The freedom to opt out is an additional safeguard. It can never be a substitute for the freedom retained in paragraph 15(5) which reads:
 Provinces should be free to form groups with executives and legisla- tures and each group could determine the Provincial subject to be taken in common.
It is clear that this freedom was taken away by the authors by
 section 19 which“proposes” (does not order) what should be done. It presupposes that the Chairman of the Constituent Assembly at its first meeting will ask the delegates of the Provinces whether they  would accept the group principle and if they do, whether they [would] accept the assignment given to their Province. This freedom inherent in every Province and that given by 15(5) will remain intact. There appears to me to be no other way of avoiding the apparent conflict between the two paragraphs as also charge of  compulsion  which would immediately alter the noble character of the document. I would, therefore, ask all those who are perturbed by the group proposal and the arbitrary assignment, that, if my interpretation is valid there is not the slightest cause for perturbation.
 There are other things in the document which would puzzle any hasty reader who forgets that it is simply an appeal and an advice to the nation showing how to achieve independence in the shortest time possible. The reason is clear. In the new world that is to emerge out of the present chaos, India in bondage will cease to be ‘the brightest jewel’ in the British crown it will become the blackest spot in that crown, so black that it will be fit only for the dustbin. Let me ask the reader to hope and pray with me that the British crown has a better use for Britain and the world. The ‘brightest jewel’ is an arrogation. When the promissory note is fully honoured, the British crown will have a unique jewel as of right flowing from due performance of duty.
 There are other matters outside the Statement which are required to back the promissory note. But I must defer that examination to the next issue of Harijanlibtech_4_footnote.

2,"May 20, 1946",LETTER TO LORD PETHICK-LAWRENCE,"
  
 VALMIKI MANDIR, READING ROAD,
 NEW DELHI,
 May 20, 1946
 DEAR LORD,
 As the matters we discussed yesterday morning and the day before were very important and affected and still affect my attitude and corresponding action, I think it worth-while to reduce a summary to writing. You can correct me if there is a mis-understanding. This may even help you wherever necessary.
 I may add that I have conveyed to the Working Committee of the Congress the purport, to the best of my ability, of our talks.
With this preface I proceed to give the summary.
  You 	were good enough to 	assure me 	that you 	will see 	to it 	that European members of 	Provincial Assemblies, 	neither voted at the 	elections of 	delegates to 	the Consituent 	Assembly nor expected 	to be 	elected by 	the electors of 	non-Muslim delegates.  Election 	of the 	possible 93 	delegates on 	behalf of 	the States 	would be 	determinded by 	the Nawab 	Sahib of 	Bhopal and Pandit 	Jawaharlal Nehru. In 	the absence 	of an agreed 	solution, there should 	be no election 	of delegates 	on behalf 	of the 	States, the 	function of 	looking after the 	interests of 	the Princes 	and their 	people devolving upon 	the Advisory 	Committee referred to in 	clause 20 	of the State 	Paper.  In 	view of 	the fact 	that there is 	no machinery in 	British Baluchistan analogous 	to the Provincial 	Assemblies, it should be 	 treated as 	the special 	concern of the 	Constituent Assembly and 	should be 	included in 	the function 	of the 	Advisory Committee. 	Meanwhile it should 	be the 	duty of 	the Interim 	National Government 	to set up machinery to bring Baluchistan on a par with the other Provinces.  I 	ventured to 	suggest that Paramountcy 	should cease even 	while independence 	is at 	work in fact, though not 	in law, 	till the Constituent 	Assembly has finished 	its labours 	and divised 	a constitution. Sir 	Stafford saw 	danger in 	acting upon 	my suggestion. 	I hold 	the opposite view. 	Acceptance of 	my proposal would 	vivify the 	people of the States as if by a stroke of the pen. And the Interim 
 Government would be a boon to the Princes who, though the creation of the Paramount Power and dependent on it for the continuance of their existance, still chafed under its heavy hand. The immediate end of Paramountcy would test the sincerity of the Princes and the Paramount Power.
 But if this Indian feeling did not find an echo in your hearts, I personally would be satisfied with Sir Stafford’s view that Para- mountcy which had been admittedly use to protect the Princes against their people in the shape suppressing their liberty and  progress,  should for the time continue for the protection and progress of the people. If the people of the States are backward, it is not because they are different in kind from the people of the direct British parts of india but because they have been groaning under a double yoke. I endorsed also the suggestion that Paramountcy should be exercised in consultation with the National Government.
  I have written to you on my difficulty on gouping.libtech_5_footnotelibtech_6_footnoteI need say 	nothing more on 	the subject, 	pending reply to it.  Whilst 	I appreciate 	your and 	Sir Stafford’s 	frankness,  I would 	put on 	record my 	conviction that 	independence would 	in fact 	be a 	farce, if 	the British 	troops are 	in India 	even for peace 	and order 	within, or 	danger from without. 	The condition 	of India 	after  the 	labours of 	the Constituent 	Assembly are over 	will in this 	respect be no 	better than now. If 	the position 	about the 	troops persists, 	“indepen- dence next 	month” is 	either insincere or 	a thoughtless 	cry. Accep- 	tance of 	“Quit India” 	by the 	British is 	unconditional, whether 	the Constituent 	Assembly succeeds or 	fails in 	bringing out 	a constitution. 	A drastic revision of the attitude is a necessity in every case. 
 Finally it can in no way be contended that in the face of the troops, there would be natural behaviour in the Constiuent Assembly.
  As 	to the Interim 	Government, the more 	I think 	and observe, 	the more 	certain is 	my feeling that 	a proper 	National Government 	resposible in fact, 	if not 	in law, 	to the 	elected members of 	the Central 	Legislative Assembly, 	should precede the 	summons of 	the election 	of members 	of the 	Constituent Assembly. 	Only then, and not 	before, can 	a true 	picture of coming 	events be presented. 	The food 	crisis demands immediate 	formation of a 	strong, capable and 	homogeneous National 	Government. Without it, deep and universal corruption cannot end 
 
 without it the psychological effect will not be produced in spite of the landing on India shores of expected grain from outside. Every day’s delay in forming such a Government is agony added to the agony of famished millions of India. There can therefore be no question of party whether the Government is allowed to be formed by  the Congress or the Muslim League. The best and incorrouptible men or women from India are wanted for the purpose. I was therefore glad to find that the Viceroy was already moving in the matter as quickly as possible.libtech_7_footnote

7,"May 21, 1946",MANGO SEED KERNEL,"
  
 A friend has sent me an extract from Current Science showing how mango seed kernel is a fair substitute for cereals and fodder:libtech_12_footnote
 I have known this use from my early youth. But no one seems to have thought of conserving this seed for food. The mango season is upon us and, though much time has been lost, it will be a good thing if every mango seed is saved and the kernel baked and eaten in the place of cereals or given to those who need it. Every ounce of food saved is so much gained.

8,"May 21, 1946",A FAIR HIT,"
  
 A report from New Delhi dated 16th April, published in The Times of India of the 18th says that at a prayer meeting held on Tuesday eveninglibtech_13_footnoteyou said:
  	“The 	machinery and 	even engineers 	were all 	foreign. He 	had no 	enmity with machinery. 	Mills, he said, 	could not remove 	the poverty 	of India, 	but on 	the other 	hand had deprieved 	crores of 	villagers of 	their work 	and practically 	ruined them. Those Indians responsible for 	ruining the 	villages had 	become foreigners and 	as such they should live 	in foreign countries.” 
 How can you reconcile this statement with the gentlemen who form the Board of Trustees of the Kasturba Memorial Fund, the primary aim of which is to improve conditions in villages? Majoriy of these gentlemen are indus- trialists and owners of mills. Can they, who are responsible for ruining the villages, and still continue to ruin them by their mills, be ever capable of sincere help in improving the condition of villagers?
  You 	have so 	often talked and 	written against the 	curse of 	black market. 	How many 	of the trustees 	of the Kasturba 	Memorial Fund can lay 	their hands on 	their hearts and 	say they have not 	dealt in 	the black 	market either as buyers 	or sellers? 
 This is a fair hit. That mill-oweners and such others have joined the Kasturba Trust is a compliment to my ahimsa. Though I express my opinions strongly, there is no sting in them, nothing personal. I have no sense of shame in befriending millowners whose business, I hold, should be stopped, not forcibly but by reason. Education of the public could bring about results which no force can. I must say in favour of the capitalist class trustees that they never interfered with the decision of non-capitalist trutees. Indeed, they have always helped by their knowledge. The combination is good and beneficial to the Trust. Their sincerity cannot be questioned; for, they have faith in their capacity and the modern trend.
 As to black market, I do not know that any of the trustees have black market dealings. But should I discover any, I should think twice before inviting them to leave the Trust. They have not imposed themselves on the Trust.

9,"May 21, 1946",HYPNOTISM OF ENGLISHlibtech_14_footnote,"
    
 The foregoing letterlibtech_15_footnotelibtech_16_footnoteis from a fellow-worker in the cause. He knows what he is writing about. Nor are the facts referred to by him unknown to the Indian public. The question is how to break the spell that the English language exercise over us. It is an essential part of our struggle for swaraj or else we shall have to revise our definition of swaraj. In slavery, the slave has to ape the manners and ways of the master, e. g., dress, language, etc. Gradually he developes a liking for it to the exclusion of every thing else. When the British yoke is lifted and we are independent, this infatuation with the English language will automatically go. In the meantime, let those who have realized the harm that this infatuation has done to the country, make it a point to use Hindustani or their mother-tongue only.
 It is a fact that the editors of English newspapers earn ten times as much as the editiors of newspapers in the Indian languages. The remedy for it also lies in our hands. The market value of English will find its natural level, once the British empire over India goes, for the simple reason that India cannot affod to pay on a lavish scale. India is  a poor country, and so long as the lot of the poorest of the poor remains unameliorated, we have no right to draw fat salaries. The fact, however, is that it rests with the newspaper-reading public to raise or reduce the prestige and price of the Indian languages newspapers. If they will cease to regard English papers as their gospel and transfer their patronage to Indian language newspapers instead, the proprietors will be compelled soon to take note of the change and adjust their policies accordingly. Something like that is happening already. There was a time when Indian languages newspapers had a poor circulation compared to English. Now the scales are reversed. Indian languages newspapers are increasing both in number and circulation.
 But those who are running newpapers in Indian languages also owe a duty in the matter even like the newspaper-reading public. The language of the newspapers in the Indian languages is often poor and the writing appearing in them lack originality. Newspapermen alone can remove these defects.

10,"May 21, 1946","NATURE CURE IN
KANCHANGAONlibtech_17_footnote","
    
 I settled down and started work in Uruli Kanchan in response to the invitation of the inhabitants there in the hope of making it a model nature-cure centre for the villages of India. The people of the village had promised their co-operation. They were to have provided the land and erected buildings on it. But that has not yet materialized. They have given the money. But that is not enough for buying land and buildings on it. Their acitve interest in it is more important than mere monetary aidlibtech_18_footnote.
 According to the reports received from co-workers there, the inhabitants of Kanchangoan have begun to understand and appreciate nature cure. And the workers have developed such self-confidence that they won’t mind if I do not return there before June. They say that the people are co-operating with them so whole-heartedy that they can well afford to wait till I descend from Mahabaleswar and Panchgani at the end of the warm season. All this has filled me with hopelibtech_19_footnote.
 Nature cure consists of two parts. Firstly, to cure diseases by the taking the name of God or Ramanama and secondlyy, to prevent illness by the inculcation of right and hygienic living. The report from the village says that the inhabitants are co-operating with them in keeping the village clean. I hold that where the rules of personal, domestic and public sanitation are strictly observed and due care is taken in the matter of diet and exercise, there should be no occasion for illness or disease. Where there is absolute purity, inner and outer, illness becomes impossible. If the village people could but understand this, they would not need doctors, hakims or vaidyas.
 In Kanchangoan there are hardly any cows. That is unfortunate. There are some she-buffaloes. But all the evidence that has come to me so far shows that buffalo’s milk is no match for cow’s in the health-giving quality. The vaidyas specially recommend cow’s milk for patients. I, therefore, hope that people of Uruli Kanchan will keep
 
 a herd of cows to ensure a supply of fresh clean cow’s milk to all. Milk is an absolutely necessity for health.
 Then, the sooner the buildings are erected the better. In the first place, it is a question as to how long we ought to go on using Shri Datar’s bungalow. Secondly, and that is more importatnt, so long as there is not adequate housing accommodation, proper treatment of patients is not possible. Accommodation for indoor patients is a neccesity. I shall always hope that Kanchangoan will become an ideal village. Nature cure implies an ideal mode of life and that in its turn presupposes ideal living conditions in towns and villages. The name of God is, of course, the hub round which the nature-cure system revolves.

 NEW DELHI,

 In the songlibtech_26_footnotethat had been sung at the prayer gathering Gandhiji stated it was said that since God was known as Redeemer he would redeem us some day.
The orthodox conception of redemption is redemption in the
 
 life to come. What I want to tell you is that redemption in that song is promised us here and now, if we fulfil the necessary conditions. They are firstly, self-purification and, secondly, obedience to the Law. It is vain, it is demoralizing to except that in the life to come to God will vindicate His title as Redeemer by saving us while we continue to carry the load of sin on our heads in this life. A businessman who lies and cheats his simpleminded, ignorant customers cannot hope to be saved.
 It has been said that to one who is good the whole world becomes good. That is true so far as the individual is concerned. But goodness becomes dynamic only when it is practised in the face of evil. If you return good for good only, it is a bargain and carries no merit, but if you return good for evil, it becomes a redeeming force. The evil ceases before it and it goes on gathering volume and momen- tum like a snowball till it becomes irresistible.
 So much for the individuals. How could a slave country like India be redeemed? he next asked. His reply was that a slave country owes the continuation of its slavery to the vices which slavery engenders. The way of self-purification, therefore, is also the way of redemption for a slave country. It was no use putting off hopes for redemption to future state. If they failed to gain redemption here they would probably miss it in the life hereafter too.
Let us therefore turn the searchlight inward and purge ourselves
 of all dross. If we shed our petty quarrels and animosities and forget all communal differences and petty distinctions the foreign troops would find their ocupation gone and nobody would be able to keep us in servitude for a day.

 Discuss fully the whole issue with Kaka and tell me about the proper course of action. I want you somehow to be at ease.
 Krishnachandra is indifferentt about you. Talk to him.You have the capacity to mix with people as sugar with milk.
 I am not writing separately to Kamala. It seems it would be possible for me to reach Wardha only in August. I want Kamala and the children to keep well. I earnestly wish that you should both lead an ideal life and through it have a good influence on the lives of others. Service is limited by one‘s capacity.
 What the outcome here would be, God alone knows. Are you both learning the Urdu script? Both of you should write to me. Even if I am unable to reply I would like to know your minds.

     BHAI 	JAJUJI,  May 	22, 1946 
  	I have all your correspondence. I have read everything about Shri 	Srinivasan. I do not like it. I suggest that Viththaldaslibtech_29_footnoteand Laksh- midaslibtech_30_footnoteshould be consulted. If they do not know Shri 	Srinivasan, they should be fully acquainted with his background and 	if they agree, you may accept the resignation of Bhai Shyamji and 	appoint Shri Srini- vasan for the Bhandar. In 	fact, under our new policy it is not imperative to have an     
 agent. Still, if we find an efficient man who is also devoted to the char- kha, we should accommodate him. It is possible that Harihar Sharma, who is now at Sevagram Ashram, knows Shri Srinivasan and we might inquire from him about the whole story. It may be  necessary  to inquire from Rajaji also. But all this should be regarded as no more than advice. I am agreeable to Shri Srinivasan’s appointment. I think finally the matter will have to be referred to the Trustees.

 May 22, 1946
 Before he begun his speech, Mahatma Gandhiji asked them for an assurance that they would listen to his advice and the gathering gave a unfit reply in the affirmative.
 Col. Habibur Rehman, who was in the same plane as Subhas Bose when it crashed, described to Mahatma Gandhi with tears in his eyes the last moment of Subhas Chandra Bose. Mahatma Gandhiji remarked:
You are a true soldier and you should not shed tears like this.
 Gandhiji congratulated the I. N. A. officers on their valour and said that he had been greatly impressed by the courage shown by Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and the
 I. N. A. For a long time he had been hoping that Netaji was alive and would be amdist them some day but after what Col. Habibur Rehman had said he felt that he was no more. He added:
But he is living among us in his message and the ideal he placed
before the world.
 Other friends have placed before me the dilemma which, I am told, faces many of you too. The Congress creed is, of course, that of winning swaraj through non-violent and peaceful means but there are many men outside, and even within the Congress, who have begun to doubt whether that policy of the Congress has not exhausted its puro- pose and now become effete for that tasks that lie ahead, especially in view of the changed and changing times.
 
 
 You who have served under Subhas Babu, as veteran fighters have proved your mettle on the battlefield. Success and failure are, however, not in our hands, but in God’s hands alone. Netaji told you when bidding good-bye to you that, on your return to India, you must put yourselves under the Congress discipline and act   according to its policy. Your object, as I have been told, was only to free India, never to help the Japanese. You failed in your direct objective, i. e., to defeat the British. But you have the satisfaction that the whole country has been rousded and even the regular forces have been stirred into a new political consciousness and have begun to think in terms of independence. You have achieved a complete unity among  the  Hindus, Muslims, Parsis, Christians, Anglo-Indians and Sikhs in your ranks. That is no mean achievement. What, howevr, you realized under conditions of freedom outside India, you have now to sustain and keep alive under Indian conditions. That will be your real test.
 If you have imbitbed the spirit of non-violence, you will remain free men at heart even here. For instance, no government on earth can make men, who have realized freedom in their heart, salute against their will. If they threaten to kill them they will offer their necs to them, but refuse to submit. The odds are that a soldier’s spirit will revolt against such coldblooded murder. Thus, whether they live or die it will be as free men. They will never be slaves. If you  will become free men at heart, the whole of India will be free. They might imprison you. You will welcome it or you can tell them that you will be a corpse before they can put you in prison. Both alternatives are open to a non-violent soldier and both call for bravery of the highest order. Our task is no less than to reinfuse life into the 400 millions of India. We have to dispel fear from their hearts. On the day they shed all fear, India’s fetters shall fall and she will be free.
 Years ago I said at Nankan Sahiblibtech_32_footnote: “Sikhs have given proof of their martial valour. But the consummation of Guru Govind Singh’s idea will be reached only when they will substitute for their kirpanslibtech_33_footnotethe sword of the spirit or non-violence.” So long as one wants to retain one’s sword, one has not attained complete fearlessness. No power on earth can subjugate you when you are armed with the sword of ahimsa. It ennobles both the victor and the vanquished. Netaji has fired you with a new spirit. That spirit can now be kept alive only
 
 through non-violence.
 Above all, you must never beg or throw yourselves on any- body’s charity. Because you have risked your lives for India’s sake and fought for her on the Imphal plain, you must not expect to be pampered in return. If you do that, you will lose all worth like salt that has lost its savour. You should prefer to earn your bread by the sweat of your brow, but refuse to beg or accept charity. In short, you have to show the same degree of bravery and courage of the non-violent types as you have done in the use of arms hitherto.
 India is a very poor country and we should all work for our living. There is plenty of land available for all. If you want land you will have it. You will clear it and turn it into model farms. You have to overcome the inertia of ages which weighs down our masses. That you will be able to do only by setting an example of industry and hand work. You must be able to weild the bucket and the broom with skill and diligence and not consider the cleaning of latrines as dirty or beneath your dignity. Graduation in this work is more heroic than winning the Victoria Cross.
 Then followed questions and answers.
 Q. How can one who has spent his whole life in fighting take to ahimsa with success? Are not the two incompatible/
 A. I do not agree. Badshah Khan is a Pathan. But today he has become a soldier of non-violence. In his land the sword and the gun are considered essential even for settling private disputes. But he has fully imbibed the principle of non-violence. The whole thing depends upon your attitude of mind. Tolstoy too served in the army. Yet he became the high priest of non-violence in Europe. We have not yet realized fully the power that is non-violence. If the Government had not arrested me in 1942, I would have shown how to fight Japan by non-violence.
 Even at the time of the threatned Japanes invasion, I preached resistance to the enemy through non-violence. The British did not believe me. They thought how could we fight the Japanses non-vio- lently? But I am telling you I have got faith in my ability to fight non- violently.
 Q. Surely, it is no breach of ahimsa to use the sword in self-defence?
 A. No, it is not necessary to use force. You should be prepared even to lay down your lives.
 Even Wavell, Auchinlecklibtech_34_footnotelibtech_35_footnoteor Hitler does not use the sword with- out necessity. But that does not make it ahimsa. It is himsa, whatever its justification.
 Q.  You cannot take the world along with you if you adopt ahimsa. You have  to choose the one or the other.
A. There again I disagree. A reformer has to sail not with the
 current, very often he has to go against it, even though it may cost him his life. You must not be carried off your feet by unthinking, popular applause. The essential part of your message
 to the country is not how to weild the sword but how to cease to be afraid of it.
 Q. What would you have done if Subhas Babu had returned to you victorious?
  I 	would have 	asked him 	to make 	you put away 	your wea- pons 	and stack them 	before me.

MEETINGlibtech_36_footnote","
    
 NEW DELHI,
 May 22, 1946
 Gandhiji apologized for the delay in the printing and distribution of the leafletlibtech_37_footnoteand twitted the Imperial City for its dilatoriness. He twitted too the printers of the leaflet for their ‘greed’ in charging for paper and printing. When he was told that nothing had been charged for printing, he twitted them still for charging the price of paper.libtech_38_footnote
 Gandhiji had been told that he had been coming to the prayer meeting late. That was not so, he explained. Only his watch was slow and he kept time by it. Unpunctuality was not his weakness. Still less could he afford wilfully to be unpunctual at the prayer gathering where they assembled for the solemn purpose of renewing their covenant with God.
If we have to catch a train, we try to reach the station well in time
because the train waits for nobody. That is even more true of God—
 
 the wheel of His Law never stops nor slows down.
 Coming back to the text of the song that had been distributed, he once again explained in detail the inner meaning of the ideal set forth in it. The conception of a country where there were was no suffering and no sorrow, might at first sight strike one as Utopian. Nevertheless, they wanted their country to be such a country and he had even allowed himself to say the other day that the announcement of the Cabinet Mission contained in it the germs of that fulfilmentlibtech_39_footnote.
 The poet in that song, had not only set forth the ideal but also mentioned the conditions for its realization. Those conditions were freedom from illusions and regrets, delusion and desire. Such a country, however, was nowhere to be found on this earth. The poet, therefore, in order to be logical and true, had said that it was within us— it was identifialble with the realm of the spirit within. It connoted swaraj, that is to say, self rule or rule over self. A person who had perfect mastery over self could realize in his person the ideal depicted in the song. As he had remarked on the previous day, to a person who is good, the whole world becomes good. If millions  did that, the Kingdom of God would be realized on earth. But even if all did not, there was no need for the individual to despair. He could make a beginning with himself straight away in the faith that what he did today the rest would do tomorrow.

  	I have your letter. Don’t mind Joshi having left. What led to his 	leaving was, of course, bad. One is bound to have such bitter as 	well as sweet experiences. The work there seems to be progressing 	very well. I hardly get any time to write or dictate letters. The 	work here and the work for Harijan is more than enough for me. But 	“Nobody can harm him whom Rama protects.” A bhajan has been 	printed for dis- tribution. I shall send you a copy of it.  	The path of brahmacharya is as grand as it is difficult. The deeper 	one reflcts over it the more clearly one realizes its grandeur, 	holiness and purity. I realize that the more important thing is to 	know how to attain it. After deep thinking I have come to the 	conclusion that Ramanama is the best thing. But Ramanama must come 	from the heart and not be pronounced merely with the tongue. It 	must, of    
 coures, go hand in hand with incessant service. One must eat only to keep the body going. And the quantitiy of food must moderate. Ramanama is not a substitute for these and other essential conditions. They are, in fact, included in Ramanama. They are even a sign of Ramanama having penetrated one’s heart. It is plain, moreover, that unless all attachment vanishes brahmacharya is impossible. Deduce the rest for this.

 Gandhiji. . . decided that itlibtech_53_footnoteshould be sold at the fixed price of one pice each copy and on no account at a fancy price. Similarly, he said that he would hereafter insist on the printer receiving his due charge for printing and stationery. He did not want to be greedy. It was a subtle snare in which humanitarian workers sometimes fell. If he charged more for the copy of the bhajan than its fixed price, the money would became tainted and would hinder instead of helping the cause of the removal of untouchability. Untouchability could not be eradicated by the expenditure of crores rupees. But it could be eradicated in the twinkling of an eye without spending a penny if there was a true change of heart among the so-called caste Hindus. That would elevate both the Harijans and the Savarna..
Today the Savarnas ride on the backs of the so-called untouc-
 hables. That degrades them both. For it is nature’s law that one cannot degrade another without degrading oneself.
 They should not tempt him, said Gandhiji, by offering fancy prices. If anyone wanted to pay the price for more than one copy of the bhajan leaflet, he or she would have to produce a corresponding number of bona-fide purchasers. Just as the leaflet would not be distributed free so it would not be sold for more than its fixed price. The way to earn merit was to translate into their lives the teaching of that bhajan.
 Commeting next on the bhajan libtech_54_footnoteof the evening “Sabase unchi prem sagai” he said that in that song the poet had sung of the bondage of love or ahimsa. There was no bond higher or stronger than that of love. Under the power of Sudhama’s love Lord Krishna had accepted the former’s gift of broken rice taken out of a dirty rag and had preferred to partake of the simple greens and herbs of Vidura in preference to Duryodhana’s rare and luscious fruit. Again, it was return for Arjuna’s loving devotion that he had forgotten his royalty and had become Arjuna’s charioteer. We are told that
 
 it was the mastery of his art that contributed more to Arjuna’s victory than the might of the latter’s bow. Service of love was the highest service one could render to another. Such service had to be spontaneous. It asked for no consideration or return.
Love becomes a sordid bargain when it asks for return or
 compensation; it degrades. Spontaneous service of love purifies and elevates.

32,"May 24, 1946",DR. MEHTA’S INSTITUTIONlibtech_55_footnote,"
    
 I have received several questions about Dr. Dinshaw Mehta’s institution. Two of them are worth noticing. They are given below:
 In order to make the institutions more scietific, more modern and more useful for the public, is it not desirable that some capable enthusiatic nature- cure man or men should be sent abroad for higher studies in nature cure? Would not such experts on their return evolve a system of nature cure suitable for our country and enable it to become popular and stand on its own feet?
 You want a simple and cheap method of nature cure for our village. Can the methods described by Kuhne, Just and Kneip, etc., serve that purpose? Can these methods be useful and suitable for village work?
The clinic at Poona could not serve the purpose of village nature
 cure in the opinion of the Trustees. Therefore, it was closed down and an experiment in village nature cure started at Uruli Kanchan. There the work is going on satisfactorily, though on a small scale. There is nothing there worth seeing as yet. Even the land has not been bought and no buildings have been built.
 Now let us take the main question. The tendency of looking to the West in order to make progress in whatever we do, should be checked. If we have to go the West to learn nature cure, it cannot be of much use to India. Nature cure is a thing which anyone can practise in the home. The advice of nature-cure experts should not be necessary for all time. It is such a simple thing that everyone can learn it. If we have to go to Europe to learn to recite Ramanama, it simply will not do. Ramanama is the very foundation of nature cure of my concep- tion. Nor should it be necessary to go across the seas in order to learn the use of earth, water, ether, sun and air. This is self-evident. What- ever other knowledge is required in this direction can be had in our
 
 villages. For instance, if herbs are used, they must be village herbs. Ayurveda teachers know all about them. If some Ayurvedic physi- cians are scoundrels, they cannot become good men and servants of the people by going abroad. The knowledge of anatomy and physio- logy has come from the West. It is very useful and necessary for all physicians. But there are plenty of means of learning it in our own country. In short, whatever useful contribution to knowledge has been made by the West, it has reached everywhere and can be learnt every- where. I might add here that the knowledge of anatomy and physio- logy is not essential for learning nature cure.
 The writing of Kuhne, Just and Father Kneip are simple, popular and useful for all. It is our duty to read them. Practically every nature- cure physician knows something about them. Nature cure has not taken to the villages so far. We have not thought deeply and no one has thought of it in terms of the millions. This is just the beginning. No one can say where we shall stand in the end. As in all great and good enterprises, sacrifice and dedication are required to make this successful. Instead of looking up to the West, we should turn the searchlight inwards.

Other 	wrote Ramanama millions 	of times 	minutely on 	a piece 	of paper 	which they afterwards 	cut up into small 	bits and 	swallowed so that they 	could claim that 	Ramanama had 	enered into 	them! Another 	correspondent had asked 	him whether 	he had 	prescribed Ramanama as the sovereign remedy for all ills because 	Rama was God’s anointed 	and was a 	descedent of 	Dasharatha, the 	illustrious King 	of Ayodhya. 	There were 	people who thought 	that he was 	self-deluded and 	was trying to 	delude others by 	adding one 	more to the 	thousands of 	superstitions which 	filled this superstition- 	ridden land. He 	had no 	answer to 	such criticism. He 	only said to 	himself, what did 	it matter 	if truth was abused and fraud practised in its name by others? So 	long as he was sure 	of his 	truth he could 	not help proclaiming it 	fear of 	its being misunderstood 	or abused. Nobody 	in this world possesses absolute truth. This is God’s  	attribute alone. Relative truth is all we know. Therefore, we can 	only follow the truth as we see it. Such pursuit of truth cannot 	lead anyone astray.  He 	reitrated Rama whose name he prescribed as the infallible remedy for 	all ills was neither the historical Rama nor the Rama of those who 	used the name as a charm or black magic. Rama whose name he 	prescribed as a cure-all was God, by taking        
 whose name devotees attained purity and peace, and he claimed that it was the one infallible remedy for all ailments whether mental, spiritual or physical. It was, of course, possible to cure physical ailments by going to doctors and vaidyas. But Ramanama enabled one to become one’s own doctor or vaidya and to find the elixir of healing within oneself. Even when the ailment could not be cured, because physically it was incurable, it enabled one to endure it with equanimity and peace of mind.
A person who has faith in Ramanama would not run from pillar
 to post and dance attendance at the doors of celebrated doctors and viadyas in order to prolong existence anyhow. Nor is Ramanama meant to be taken only when the doctors and vaidyas have failed. It is meant to enable one to do without them altogether. For a believer in Ramanama it is the first as well as the last remedy.

37,"May 25, 1946",SALARY OF M. L. A.S,"
    
   The 		monthly salary of 		an M.L. A. 		is Rs. 200. He 		is a mofussil 		member and, 		as such, 		is entitled 		to a 		daily allowance of 		Rs. 15 		when the 		Assembly is 		in session. Besides 		that, he may 		draw conveyance 		[allowance] of Rs. 		2/8 for any day on which 		he attends the 		meeting of 		the Assembly. Moreover, 		he is entitled 		to ‘travelling 		allowance’ for his 		journey from the 		usual place of 		residence to 		the city 		at the 		rate of 		one and a 		half time first-class 		fare but he 		cannot draw 		‘travelling allowance’ 		and ‘daily 		allowance’ for the 		same day.   (a) 			Should such a 			person as 			a representative 			and servant 			of the 			poor draw the salary?   
  Would 	he be absolved from the wrong if he gave the whole amount 	to the local 	Congress Committee or the 	institution under which 	he is working 	for constructive work? If so, would it not mean that the end justifies the means? 
    He 			will have to 			live in 			the city 			when the Assembly 			is in session 			and has to incur some 			other expenditure 			for discharging his 			duties and 			responsibilitie as 			an M. L. A.   
  In 	the circumstances, may 	he, consistently with his 	ideal, draw the 	daily allowance to 	meet the expenses?  If 	so, and if 	it be not permissible 	to draw 	a part 	of it, 	should he 	draw the whole 	of it and 	give the balance to 	the institution 	under which he is 	working.  In 	that case, may 	he, consistently with 	his ideal, 	spend the balance or 	part thereof 	for his family, 	which will have otherwise 	to depend 	upon the charity of friends to make the two ends meet? 
    (a) 			Should he 			draw the 			conveyance allowance 			(meant for his 			conveyance inside the 			city for attending 			meeting) when the daily 			allowance will 			be more than sufficient 			to cover all his 			expenses including  the 			conveyance?   
 (b) Should he avail of costly conveyance for attending meetings, if he usually travels in tram-cars and buses?
    If 			suh a member travels 			third class on 			principle, what should 			he do 			regarding drawing 			‘mileage allowance’ if 			it is not permissible 			to draw 			at lower 			rate than one and a 			half first-class fares?   
A.   In  my  opinion,  the   salary   and  allowances  drawn   by the
gentlemen of the various Assemblies are out of all proportion to the
 services they render to the country. The scales fixed are  on  the English pattern, not at all compatible with the income of this country—the poorest in the world. Therefore, the answer I suggest is that Ministers should, with the consent of the Assemblies, reduce the whole scale in accordance with requirements and, in the meantime, either the amount taken should be handed to the party to which the member belongs, drawing what the party has fixed or, if that be not possible, drawing what his conscience thinks just for himself and his family and devoting the balance to some items of the constructive programme or some such public activity. The money allowed has to be drawn but nobody is obliged to use it for [him] self except to the extent needed. No question here arises of the  end  justifying  the means.

 Q. The Ramanama bank in Benares and wearing clothes printed with Ramanama is, in my opinion a caricature of Ramanama. Don’t you think that under these circumstances your telling the people to take to Ramanama as a sovereign remedy for all ailments is likely to encourage ignorance and hypocrisy?libtech_65_footnote
A. You are right. There is so much superstition and hypocrisy
 around that one is afraid even to do the right thing. But if one gives way to fear, even truth will have to be suppressed. The golden rule is to act fearlessly upon what one believes to be right. Hypocrisy and untruth will go on in the world. Our doing the right thing will result in their decrease, if anything, never in their increases. The dangr is that when we are surrounded by falsehood on all sides we might be caught in it and begin to deceive ourselves. We should be careful not to make a mistake out of our laziness and ignorance. Constant vigilance under all circumstances is essential. A votary of truth cannot act otherwise. Even an all powerful remedy like Ramanama can become useless for lack of wakefulness and care, and become one more addition to the numberous current superstitons.

THE POORlibtech_66_footnote","
        
 Q. Is it not a  cruel joke to ask the poor villager to live on orange  juice when he cannot afford even ordinary diet? He has to work throughout the day to feed his wife and children. His land and his children mean more to him than life itself. Nature cure is meant for the rich who have plenty of money and time at their disposal.
 If you really wish to serve the villagers through nature cure, you should see that the right type of nature-cure homes are started every-where. At these homes the patients should get free food, clothing and bedding. And, if the patient happens to be a wage-earner, arrangements should be made to support his family.
 You have said nature cure means reorientation of the way of living. Is it not necessary that education in that direction should form a necessary part of nature-cure treatment?
A. The question betrays the correspondent’s ignorance. He has
 not taken the trouble to read carefully what I have written on the subject. Nature cure implies that the treatment should be the cheapest and the simplest possible. The ideal is that such treatment should be carried out in the villages. The villagers should be able to provide the necessary means and equipment. What cannot be had in the villages should be procured. Nature cure does mean a change for the better in one’s outlook on the life itself. It means regulation of one’s life in accordance with the laws of health. It is not a matter of taking medicine free from the hospital or for fees. A man who takes free treatment from the hospital accepts charity. The man who accepts nature cure never begs. Self-help enhances self-respect. He takes steps to cure himself by eliminating poison from the system and takes precautions against falling ill in the future.
 The central feature of nature-cure treatment is Ramanama.libtech_67_footnoteBut it must come from the heart, if it is to be a remedy for all one’s ailmentslibtech_68_footnote.
Orange juice is not an essential part of nature-cure treatment.
 
 Right diet and balanced diet are necessary. Today our villages are as bankrupt as were are ourselves. To produce enough vegetables, fruits and milk in the villages is an essential part of the nature-cure scheme. Time spent on this should not be considered a waste. It is bound to benefit all the villagers and ultimately the whole of India.
 It is true and nature-cure homes of the right type should be opened in the villages and the cities. God willing, this will be done. The individual should rest content by doing his own duty leaving the rest to God.

 May 25, 1946
 I have to answer your letter of 22nd instant which was read to my colleagues. They wanted me to refer at the time of acknowledging your letter to some of the points in it.
  You 	yourself admit 	that your scheme is a 	recommendation. 	There-fore at 	no stage can 	there be 	any compulsion 	read into it. 	The Con-gress 	has never 	taken the power 	nor has it 	any desire 	to compel 	a single 	unit. And I 	know, as 	a matter 	of fact, 	that neither the 	Frontier Province nor 	Assam nor 	the Sikhs of 	the Punjab 	will submit 	to any 	compulsion. They have 	signified their 	intention of not 	joining any 	group whatsoever. All 	I wish 	to say 	is that 	the scheme cannot be 	used for the purpose 	of compelling 	acceptance by any 	unit or 	group. The 	whole beauty of 	it resides in 	its voluntary 	character which should not 	be impaired.libtech_70_footnotelibtech_71_footnoteBut, of course, it will be open to all persons and parties in 	the Constituent 	Assembly to reason 	with any units. 	Naturally the 	decision on 	major communal 	issues will be 	guided by 	the provision 	thereon of 	the Statement.  As 	to the last three lines 	of paragraph 	3 of 	your letter, obviously, 	adequate provisions for 	the protection of 	minorities must 	be part 	of the 	instrument of 	the Constituent 	Assembly. But I 	assume that 	the Constituent 	Assembly will be the 	sole judge of adequacy. 
 
  Willingness 	to conclude 	a treaty 	will always be there. 	But the 	treaty must be 	a voluntary 	act on 	the part 	of Independent 	India. If 	it pre-supposes 	compulsion, there is no Independence.  As 	to the last 	paragraph of 	your letter, I 	can understand 	the post-ponement 	of the 	declaration of 	legal independence 	till after the 	publi-cation of 	the charter 	of independence 	framed by the 	Constituent Assembly. 	But I 	cannot understand the 	paragraph, if 	independence in 	fact does 	not take place 	immediately the 	contemplated interim 	government is established.  Have 	you any objection 	to the 	release to 	the Press 	of our 	corres-pondence. i.e., 	my letter 	of 20th 	May, your reply of 22nd 	May, my 	letter of 	even date and 	your reply thereto?

NEW DELHI,
  May 25, 1946libtech_85_footnote  Gandhiji 	explained the conditions under which alone Ramanama could become an 	effective remedy for the three-fold malady, to which man was 	subject. The first condition was that it should come from the heart. 	What did that mean? People did not mind going to the ends of the 	earth to find a cure for their physical ailments which were much 	less important than the mental or spiritual. Man’s 	physical being is after all perishable. It cannot, by its  	very nature, last for ever. And yet man makes a fetish of it while 	neglecting the immortal spirit within.  A 	man who believed in Ramanama would not make a fetish of the body but 	would regard it only as a means of serving God. And for making it a 	fit instrument for that purpose, Ramanama was the sovereign means.  To 	install Ramanama in the heart required infinite patience. It might 	even take ages. But the effort was worth-while. Even so success 	depended solely on the grace of God.  Ramanama 	could not come 	from the heart 	unless one had cultivated 	the virtues 	of truth, 	honesty and purity 	within and without. 	Every day at the evening 	prayers they repeated 	the shlokas describing 	the man with steadfast 	intellect. Every one of 	them, said 	Gandhiji, could become a 	sthitaprajna—the 	man with steadfast 	intellect—if he kept 	his senses under 	discipline, ate 	and drank and allowed 	himself enjoyment and 	recreation only 	to sustain 	life for service. 	If one 	had no control 	over one’s 	thoughts, if 	one did not mind, 	for instance, 	sleeping in a 	hole of 	a room 	with all doors 	and windows 	shut, and breathing 	foul air or 	drinking dirty water, 	recitation of Ramanama 	was in vain.  That, 	however, did 	not mean that one should 	give up 	reciting Ramanama on 	the ground 	that one had not the 	requisite purity. For, 	recitation of Ramanama 	was also a means for acquiring purity. In 	the case of a man who repeats Ramanama from the heart,  	discipline and self-control will come easy. Observance of the rules 	of health and hygiene will become his second nature. His life will 	run an even course. He will never want to hurt anyone. To suffer in 	order to relieve others’ sufferings will become a part of his 	being and fill him with an ineffable and perennial joy.     
 Let them therefore, said Gandhiji, persevere and ceaselessly repeat Ramanama during all their waking hours. Ultimately, it would remain with them even during their sleep and God’s grace would then fill them with perfect health of body, mind and spirit.

49,"May 26, 1946",VITAL DEFECTS,"
  
 Intrinsically and as legally interpreted, the State Paperlibtech_86_footnoteseems to me to be a brave and frank document. Nevertheless, the official interpretation would appear to be different from the popular. If it is so and prevails it will be a bad omen. During the long course of the history of British rule in India, the official interpretation has held sway. And, it has been enforced. I have not hesitated before now to say that the office of the law-giver, judge and executioner is combined in one person in India. Is not the State Document a departure from the imperialistic tradition? I have answered ‘yes’.
 Be that as it may. Let us try to glance at the shorcomings. The Delegation, after a brief spell in Simla, returned to Delhi on the 14th instant, issued their Statement on the 16th, and yet we are far from the popular government at the Centre. One would have thought that they would have formed the Central Government before issuing the Statement. But they issued the Statement first and then set about the search for the formation of the Interim Government. It is taking a long time coming whilst the millions are starving for want of food and clothing. This is defect No. 1.
 The question of paramountcy is unsolved. It is not enough to say that paramountcy will end with the end of British rule in India. If it persists without check during the interim period, it will leave behind  a difficult legacy for the independent Government. If it cannot be ended with the establishment of the Interim Government, it should be exercised in co-operation with it and purely for the benefit of the people of the States. It is the people who want and are fighting for independence, not the Princes who are sustained by the alien power even when they claim not to be its creation for the suppression of the liberties of the people. The Princes, if they are true to their professions, should welcome this popular use of paramountcy so as to accommodate themselves to the sovereignty of the people envisaged
 
 under the new scheme. This is defect No. 2.
 Troops, it is declared, are to remain during the interim period for the preservation of internal peace and protection against external aggression. If they are kept for such use during the period of grace, their presence will act as a damper on the Constituent Assembly and is more likely than not to be wanted even after the establishment of independence so called. A nation that desires alien troops for  its  safety, internal or external, or has them imposed upon it, can never be described as independent in any sense of the term. It is an effete nation unfit for self-government. The acid test is that it should be able to stand alone, erect and un-bending. During the interim period we must learn to hop unaided, if we are to walk when we are free. We must cease from now to be spoon-fed.
 That these things are not happening as we would wish is to be accounted as our weakness, be the causes whatever they be, not the cussedness of the British Government or their people. Whatever we get, will be our deserts, not a gift from across the seas. The three Ministers have come to do what they have declared. It will be time to blame them when they go back upon the British declarations and devise ways and means of perpetuating the British rule. Though there is ground for fear, there is no sign on the horizon that they have said one thing and meant another.

A correspondent writes:
 During the recent election meetings I was astonished at the number of flags— not to speak of the special uniforms worn by the Congress volunteers for the occasion. In these days of cloth shortage, is not the use of cloth for flags and special uniforms a criminal waste?
Flags and uniforms are in order when they are in their time and
 place. They are easily an abomination when they take the place of bread. Satisfaction of hunger has precedence over everything. Simi- larly, flags and uniforms cannot replace cloth for wear. Hence, if the correspondent is right, Congressmen and others will have to be strictly
 economical in the use of flags and uniforms for demonstrative purposes.

 PEACEFUL S TRIKESlibtech_87_footnote
 Q.	How should a strike be conducted so that hooliganism and violence are avoided?
A. A strike should be spontaneous and not manipulated. If it is
 organized without any compulsion there would be no chance for goondaism and looting. Such a strike would be characterized  by perfect co-operation amongst the strikers. It should be peaceful and there should be no show of force. The strikers should take up some work either singly or in co-operation with one another, in order to earn their bread. The nature of such work should have been thought out beforehand. It goes without saying that in a peaceful, effective and firm strike of this character, there will be no room for rowdyism or looting. I have known of such strikes. I have not presented a Utopian picture.

 WHY DOCTORS?
 Q.	Why do you go to the doctors for examination and diagnosis and not to the vaidyas?
A. The vaidyas do not possess the knowledge of the human
 body as the doctors do. The basis of diagnosis in Ayurveda is the theory of tridoshlibtech_88_footnote. They have not got to the bottom even of that. The doctors are ever carrying on research and making new discoveries. One either goes forward or backward. Nothing remains static in the world. Those who become static, become lifeless. God alone is static, but amazing as it may sound, He is described both as motionless and full of motion.
 Moreover, doctors and vaidyas are my friends. The doctors have clung to me. Onelibtech_89_footnoteof them has become more than my own daughter.
 
 One’s own daughter can leave her father; how can one  who  has chosen to become a daughter? The vaidyas themselves use, though indifferently, the methods of diagnosis used by the doctors or else they advise the patient to go to the doctors for it. The viadyas possess the knowledge of certain drugs which they use effectively.
 But the doctors, vaidyas and hakims all slave for money. They do not take to the profession purely from a spirit of service. That some of them have that spirit does not contradict my statement. Nature cure is the only thing which has come into existence purely from the point of view of selfless service. Today even that has become a means of making money. Thus money has taken the place of God. The doctors examine me, but I depend on none but God. He is the Master of every breath I take. If He wills it, He will keep me up to 125 years. If not, He might carry me off any moment, leaving the medical friends staring as helpless spectators.

 WHO IS RAMA?libtech_91_footnote
 Q. You have often said that when you talk of “Rama” you refer to the Ruler of  the universe and not to Rama, the son of Dasharatha. But we find that your Ramdhun calls on “Sita-Rama”, “Raja-Rama”, and it ends with “Victory to Rama the Lord of Sita”. Who is this Rama if not the son of the king Dasharatha?
A.    I  have answered such questions before. But there is some-
 thing new in this one. It demands a reply. In Ramdhun “Raja- Rama”,“Sita-Rama” are undoubtedly repeated. Is not this ‘Rama’ the same as the son of Dasharatha? Tulsidas has  answered  this question. But let me put down my own view. More potent than Rama is the Name. Hindu Dharma is like a boundless ocean teeming with priceless gems. The deeper you dive into it the more treasures you find. In Hindu religion God is known by various names. Thousands of people doubtless look upon Rama and Krishna as historical figures and literally believe that God came down in person on earth in the form of Rama the son of Dasharatha, and that by worshipping Him one can attain salvation. The same thing holds good about Krishna. History, imagination and truth have got so inextricably mixed up, it is next to impossible to disentangle them. I have accepted all the names and forms attributed to God as symbols denoting one formless omni- present Rama. To me, therefore, Rama described as the Lord of Sita,
 
 name, inscribed in the heart, removes all suffering, mental, moral and physical.

He had been advised by his 	doctors to 	spend two 	months of 	the hot weather 	at some 	hill station to enable 	him to 	build up 	sufficient reserve for 	the rest of 	the year. 	He could 	not do 	so this year for 	reasons they all 	knew. He 	had decided 	to go to Mussoorie 	in preference 	to Panchgani 	or Simla, 	as it was 	nearer. He 	would come 	back when the Congress 	President or the 	Cabinet Mission might 	require him.  Gandhiji 	said that they had been coming to the prayer gatherings daily in 	order to join him in reciting Ramanama or rather in learning how to 	do so. Ramanama could    
 not be taught by word of mouth. But more potent than the spoken word was the silent thought.
 A single right thought can envelop the world. It is never wasted. The very attempt to clothe thought in word or action limits it. What man has ever succeeded in expressing fully thought in word or in action? Then, why not go into perpetual silence, one might ask. In theory that is possible. But it is very difficult to fulfil the conditions by which silent thought can wholly replace action.
 He for one could not claim to have attained the requisite intensity or control over thought. He could not altogether keep out useless or irrelevant thoughts from his mind. It required infinite patience, vigilance and tapashcharyalibtech_93_footnote to attain that state.
 He was not indulging in a figure of speech, he continued, but had meant it literally when on the previous day he had told them that there was no limit to the potency of Ramanama. But in order to experience that, Ramanama had to come from a heart that was absolutely pure. He himself was striving to attain that state. He had envisaged it in the mind but had not fully realized it in practice. When that stage was reached, even the recitation of Ramanama would become unnecessary.
 He hoped they would continue to recite Ramanama in their homes severally and in company during his absence. The secret of collective prayer was that the emanation of silent influence from one to the other could be of help in their spiritual striving.

 The Indian Deputationlibtech_94_footnotelibtech_95_footnotefrom South Africa have made a great stir in India. They propose to approach the U. N. O. with a view to enlisting the latter’s sympathy. But the legislation is going through. The Indian High Commissioner will be withdrawn as he should be. What little aid he can render is nothing compared to the indignity of representing a country whose inhabitants are to be treated as  an inferior race. This new caste is worse than the ancient but dying institution of India which has some redeeming features, even while it is dying. But the new civilized edition has none. It shamelessly proclaims that white civilization requires the erection of legal barriers
 
 in order to protect itself against Asiatics and Africans. The Indians in South Africa are bearing a heavy burden which they are well able to discharge. Satyagraha, the mightiest weapon in the world, was born and bred there. If they make effective use of it, it will be well with the sacred cause they are handling. It is not one of making it easy for a handful, to be permitted to live and trade there if they wear the badge of inferiority called years ago by an Englishman of South Africa “dog’s collar”. The cause is the cause of the honour of India and through her of all the exploited coloured races of the earth, whether they be brown, yellow or black. It is worth all the suffering of which they are capable.

       NEW 	DELHI, 
     DEAR 	SIR STAFFORD,  May 	27, 1946 
  	I got your touching letter yesterday when I was busy writing for 	Harijan. Though I read it as soon as the visitors who had 	dropped in, had gone, I could not before now spare the time to 	write.  	I am returning your letter, as it is marked “very confidential”. 	However I see nothing in it which the world may not see, if it is 	curious.  	I entirely agree with you [on] what the State Paper demands and 	commendslibtech_96_footnotelibtech_97_footnoteto is and yet it like everything coming from the 	British evokes nothing but distrust. And I am sorry to confess that 	what has happened since the publication of the document has somewhat 	shaken my trust which the document by itself commanded and  still 	commands. The interpretations put upon it and the declarations since 	on independence, paramountcy, troops and the proposed disposal of 	the Baluchistan, election, the uncertainty about the European vote 	and above all, the waiting policy and the interminable delay about 	the Interim Government make me wonder whether a satisfactory Interim 	Government will ever be formed and whether the Constituent  Assembly 	will ever meet. Has even the cry of independence in action 	vanished into thin air?    
 But I shall hope against hope and work for the success of the Mission even in spite of itself, though not hiding from them or the public honest doubt. Trust put on is worse than useless. Trust felt is the thing that counts. Anyway, why worry about trust. Trustworthy action will dispel all mistrust or distrust as the sun dispels morning mist.
 This is not to disturb your test. I would have refrained from writing to you, if your letter had not required a fairly full answer.
 I am sending an advance copy of my articlelibtech_98_footnotefor the next issue of Harijan.
Do be well quickly. ‘Be careful for nothing.’
 If you want me to do anything, do not hesitate to send a messenger to me. I leave for Mussoorie tomorrow morning. I had to finish writing for Harijan, before leaving. As I do not want to inflict my writing on you, I am asking Rajkumari to copy this for me. Of course you are at liberty to share this with your colleagues or whom- soever you like.
I am sending a copy of my article to Lord Pethick-Lawrence.

 All Sikhs should realize that the Congress cannot and will not desert those who have stuck to it. They are quite safe with it. But they are not bound to be with the Congress, if they do no wish to. To coquet with one party and then another is bad. They should learn to be staunch and true. Loyalty to the Congress is loyalty to independence. If they do not want it, it is another matter.

  	I have your three letters which are all very good. You are doing the 	Agency worklibtech_108_footnoteefficiently. 	I like what you write about the building. What will it cost? Will it 	be all right if the Kasturba Gandhi Memorial Fund advances the whole 	amount on nominal interest? I see nothing wrong in offering money 	for the building but the parent body cannot make an exception, so I 	feel that problem can perhaps be solved by offering the money as a 	loan. Discuss the matter with the people there and let me know what 	they say. It should not be difficult to clear the debt in ten or 	fifteen years. The period of the loan may be extended so long as the 	interest is being paid and in default of interest-payment, the loan 	will have to be paid up or the custody of the building transferred 	to the Trust. I shall be able to decide further after I have your 	reply. In the meanwhile I am sending your letter and a copy of my 	reply to Bapa.  	Now your second letter. What you write about the Assembly is 	correct, namely that in course of time my views will be appreciated.     
 This is not an opinion I have recently come to; I have been holding it from the beginning. True workers will not enter the Assembly.libtech_109_footnoteKeir Hardy was such a person. He commanded respect in the House of Commons. He said that an honest man could not remain a member of the House. And it is true. Morleylibtech_110_footnotehad to suffer a fall. The situation in South Africa was no different. It deserves to be noted that there was a great scramble for membership and the candidates spent huge sums. But I don’t wish to discuss this matter. After all, what you write in the concluding part of your letter is true. It is good to exercise one’s franchise to contact the mass of voters, to show them the right path and to give for this as much time as one can. For me it is enough that for some years the Agents should stay out and devote their time to their work. Until now you have not even touched the villages.
 Now your third letter.The problem of Bhangis is a complex one. It is all right to say that they should go on a hunger-strike after having done their work or even while doing it but one cannot work on an empty stomach. What I have suggestedlibtech_111_footnoteis that society or say, city- dwellers, should strike against the municipalities—they should go on a hunger-strike also. They can do whatever they want to do. The only condition is that they should do it non-violently. It will have its impact on the municipality as well as on the Bhangis and society will have done its duty. There is also another way. The Bhangis should not strike for accommodation or for wages but they may serve a notice of giving up the occupation. If the Bhangis strike for accommodation or for wages, it may be that in the end the townspeople may themselves take up the scavenging work. I admit that if nobody does anything and the Bhangis do no get justice, then they ought to have the right to strike work. I have explained what the Bhangis, as  city-dwellers,  should do.
 While dictating this I get your fourth letter. It is 8.30 p. m. The wire can go only tomorrow. I think your not being on the Food Board is not going to have any adverse effect.

  From 	a copy of the Gujarati: Pyarelal Papers. Courtesy: Pyarelal       [After 	May 28, 1946]libtech_116_footnoteAn English friend 	posed to Gandhiji, during his stay at Mussoorie, the question whether the very 	frightfulness of the atom bomb would not force non-  violence 	on the world. If all nations were armed with the atom bomb they 	would refrain from using it as it would mean absolute destruction 	for all concerned. Gandhiji was of the opinion that it would not. The 	violent man’s eyes would be lit up with the prospect of the  	much greater amount of destruction and death which he could now 	wreak.  Harijan, 	23-6-1946       [After May 28, 1946]libtech_118_footnote  Your 	khadi, handicrafts and rural economy programme will have a great 	appeal for an agricultural country, as for instance, the Balkans. . 	.But to many of us, as indeed to many of your countrymen, it appears 	as a brake on progress. Most people think planning and 	industrialization on a wide scale to be necessary. How 	does my programme interfere with the progress of India? India 	is mainly rural, consisting of 700,000 villages.  The 	visitor . . . argued that this was unfair to the cities. “What 	about the big cities like Bombay and Calcutta?” he asked.  	On the contrary, the boot is on the other leg. I regard the growth 	of cities as an evil thing, unfortunate for mankind and the world,       
 unfortunate for England and certainly unfortunate for India. The British have exploited India through its cities. The latter have exploited the villages. The blood of the villages is the cement with which the edifice of the cities is built. I want the blood that is today inflating the arteries of the run once again in the blood-vessels of the villages.
 The initial mistake having been made, you do not mean to suggest that all those steps should inexorably be retraced even though it might involve pulling down what has already been built.
 Why not? Once we discover that a mistake has been made, the only course open to us is to recognize our error, retrace our steps and begin anew.
 Somehow, the belief prevails in the modern world that retracing one’s steps in this respect would be incompatible with progress.
 What do you do when a ship loses her course on the sea? She does not continue to follow the wrong course. She at once retraces her course and then starts afresh. How often must Columbus have done that or else he would have remained a derelict all the time.
 Does that mean that you would depopulate the cities and send all the city-folk back to the villages?
I would not do that. All I want is that they should readjust their
 lives so as to cease to sponge upon the poor village folk and make to the latter what reparation is possible even at this late hour by helping to resuscitate their ruined economy.
 What would you do if you were made a dictator of India for one day?
 I would not accept it in the first place, but if I did become a dictator for one day I would spend it in cleaning the stables of the Viceroy’s House that the hovels of the Harijans in Delhi are. It is disgraceful that under the very nose of the Viceroy such poverty and squalor should exist as there is in the Harijan quarters. And why does the Viceroy need such a big house? If I had my way I would turn it into a hospital.
 And he gave the instance of President Kruger whose residence was not even as good as Birlaji’s ‘Hermitage’ in which he was staying.
 “Well, sir, suppose they continue your dictatorship for the second day?” Gandhiji replied amidst laughter:
The second day would be a prolongation of the first.
 They next talked of several other things—the national language of India, the
 place of English, the administrative problems that would face an independent India, the future of Indo-British trade relations. They then came to non-violence.
 “What will be the relations of India with Russia for instance? What if Russia were to attack India?”
Under my dictatorship Russia would find its occupation gone. It
 will not find it profitable to stay on, even if it came. But, of course, it is too rich a dream to be realized in a day.
 The best men in the old generation had their education in England—you for instance. Would you have India, when she becomes independent, send her sons there for study as before?
No, not just now. I would advise her to send them there only
after, say, 40 years.
 It means depriving two generations of the benefits of contact with the West.
 Why two generations? 40 years or even 60 is not too much even in an individual’s life. If there is right living we need not grow old at 60 as unfortunately many do in this country. I repeat that they should go there only after they have reached maturity. Because, it is only when they have learnt to understand the good that is in their own culture that they will be able to truly appreciate and assimilate the best that England or America has to give them. Imagine a boy of seven- teen, like myself, going to England—he will simply be submerged.
 Then we may expect you in England some time, queried the friend. Gandhiji replied amid general laughter:
Oh, yes, you may.

 [After May 28, 1946]libtech_120_footnote“You have brought us to the threshold of independence, Gandhiji,” remarked another privileged friend who had a talk with him on an evening, “and we cannot feel
 too grateful for it. You will, of course, give entire credit for it to ahimsa—that being your pet child. But we feel that we have derived more strength from truth than from your ahimsa.”
You are wrong in  thinking that in  my  partiality for ahimsa I
 
 Gandhji reached Mussoorie on May 28, 1946.
 have given to truth the second place. You are equally wrong  in thinking that the country has derived more strength from truth than from ahimsa. On the contrary, I am firmly convinced that whatever progress the country has made, is due to its adoption of ahimsa as its method of struggle.
 I mean the country has not understood your ahimsa but it has understood truth and that has filled it with strength.
It is just the contrary. There is so much of untruth in the
 country I feel suffocated sometimes. I am convinced, therefore, that it must be the practice of ahimsa alone, however faulty, that has brought us so far.
 Moreover, I have not given truth the second place as you seem to think.
 He continued and described how at a meeting at Genevalibtech_121_footnotehe had flabbergasted everybody by remarking that whereas he used to say that God is Truth, he had since come to hold that Truth is God.
 “Nevertheless, your emphasis is always on ahimsa. You have made propagation of non-violence the mission of your life,” argued the friend.
 There again you are wrong. Ahimsa is not the goal. Truth is the
 goal. But we have no means of realizing truth in human relationships except through the practice of ahimsa. A steadfast pursuit of ahimsa is inevitably bound to truth—not so violence. That is why I swear by ahimsa. Truth came naturally to me. Ahimsa I acquired after a  struggle. But ahimsa being the means we are  naturally  more concerned with it in our everyday life. It is ahimsa, therefore, that our masses have to be educated in. Education in truth follows from it as a natural end.

73,"May 29, 1946",MORE SUGGESTIONS,"
  
 It is a good sign that food shortage is taxing many minds. Suggestions for meeting it come in from all quarters. A friend, who knows what he writes about, sends the following:libtech_122_footnote
  A 	substantial saving 	in cereals 	should be 	possible by 	reducing the 	ration of cereals 	to non-vegetarians to 	the extent that 	it is possible 	to supplement 	equal nutrition value by 	non-vegetarian food. 
  I 	expect that a 	large number of 	men do manual work find 	difficulty in satisfying 	hunger with the reduced rations.	It, 	therefore, follows that to 
 the extent that cereals are reduced to non-vegetarians, animal food, having equal nutrition value, should be substituted and that also for the same cost as that of the cereal reduced.
 There is a large damage to crops by deer, rabbit, boar, pig and pigeon 
 . . . . Non-vegetarians tell me that these can be used for food.	Incidentally,
 destruction on a large scale of these would be reflected in reduced destruction of field crops.
 To 	save food in 	order that it 	will be 	available for 	famine areas under 	the present system of 	ration appeals to 	 very few.	There 	would be a 	 good 
 psychological appeal if the foodgrains saved are collected and guaranteed to be sent to the famine areas.
Whether the authorities act up to the first or not, it is one which
 those honest meat-eaters who draw full vegetarian rations can. They can easily part with a portion of their cereals for the benefit of those in need. Mutual aid is the swiftest way of reaching relief to the needy in such cases.
The second follows from the first.
 The third is contentious. In a country where all life is largely held sacred and even when it is not, habit has made people reluctant to take any life, the suggestion may be difficult of adoption even by non-vegetarians. But a confirmed respecter of all life though I am, I have no difficulty in recommending for acceptance by meat-eaters the suggestion that the correspondent’s wisdom has dictated. I hope to examine an argument in Harijanbandhu advanced against the taking of even noxious life without any connection with food.libtech_123_footnote
 The fourth suggestion, though sound, is not likely to produce any tangible result because of the ruling corruption and the inefficiency and irresponsibility of the Government.

A correspondent writes:
 In the Harijanbandhu of the 5th May you have written that your non- violence contemplates destruction of animals dangerous to mankind, such as leopards, wolves, snakes, scorpions, etc.libtech_125_footnote
 You do not believe in giving food to dogs, etc. Several other people besides the Gujaratis look upon the feeding of dogs as a meritorious act. Such a belief may not be justifiable in times of food shortage like the present. Yet we must remember that these animals can be very useful to man. One can feed them and take work out of them.
 You had put 27 questions to Shri Raichandbhai from Durban. One of these quesions was: “What should a seeker do when a sanke attacks him?” His answer was: “He should not kill the snake and, if it bites, he should let it do so.”libtech_126_footnoteHow  is it that you speak differently now?
I have written a lot on this subject in the past. At that time the
 topic was the killing of rabid dogs. There was much discussion on the subject but all that seems to have been forgotten.
 My non-violence is not merely kindness to all living creatures. The emphasis laid on the sacredness of subhuman life in Jainism is understandable. But that can never mean that one is to be kind to this life in preference to human life. While writing about the sacredness of such life, I take it that the sacredness of human life has been taken for granted. The former has been over-emphasized. And, while putting it into practice, the idea has undergone distortion. For instance, there are many who derive complete satisfaction in feeding ants.  It  would appear that the theory has become a wooden, lifeless dogma. Hypo- crisy and distortion are passing current under the name of religion.
 Ahimsa is the highest ideal. It is meant of the brave, never for the cowardly.To benefit by others’ killing and delude oneself into the belief that one is being very religious and non-violent, is sheer self- deception.
 A so-called votary of non-violence will not stay in a village, which is visited by a leopard every day, will run away and when someone has killed the leopard, will return to take charge of his hearth and home. This is not non-violence. This is a coward’s violence. The
 
 man who has killed the leopard has at least given proof of some bravery. The man who takes advantage of the killing is a coward. He can never expect to know true non-violence.
 In life it is impossible to eschew violence completely. The question arises, where is one to draw the line? The line cannot be the same for everyone. Although essentially the principle is the same, yet every-one applies it is his or her own way. What is one man’s food can be another’s poison. Meat-eating is a sin for me. Yet, for another person, who has always lived on meat and seen anything wrong in it, to give it up simply in order to copy me will be a sin.
 If I wish to be an agriculturist and stay in the jungle, I will have to use the minimum unavoidable violence in order to protect my fields. I will have to kill monkey, birds and insects which eat up my crops. If I do not wish to do so myself, I will have to engage someone to do it for me. There is not much difference between the two. To allow crops to be eaten up by animals in the name of ahimsa while there is a famine in the land is certainly a sin. Evil and good are relative terms. What is good under certain conditions can become an evil or a sin under a different set of conditions.
 Man is not to drown himself in the well of Shastras but he is to dive into their broad ocean and bring out pearls. At every step he has to use discrimination as to what is ahimsa and what is himsa. In this there is no room for shame or cowardice. The poet has said that the road leading up to God is for the brave, never for the cowardly.
 Finally, Raichandbhai’s advice to me was that if I had courage, if I wanted to see God face to face, I should let myself be bitten by a snake instead of killing it. I have never killed a snake before or after receiving that letter. That is no matter of credit for me. My ideal is to be able to play with snakes and scorpions fearlessly. But it is merely a wish so far. Whether and when it will be realized I do not know. Everywhere I have let my people kill both. I could have prevented them if I had wished. But how could I? I did not have the courage to take them up with my own hands and teach my companions a lesson in fearlessness. I am ashmed that I could not do so. But my shame could not benefit them or me.
 If Ramanama favours me I might attain that courage some day. In the meantime. I consider it my duty to act as I have stated above. Religion is a thing to be lived. It is not mere sophistry.

Shri Thakkar Bapa writes:libtech_128_footnote
 It has been decided to carry on sound and extensive Harijan work in the Bhusawal Taluka.	The circumstances are favourable.
What Bapa says is true. By favourable circumstances. Shri
 Thakkar Bapa probably means the establishment of a Congress Ministry. That does not mean that henceforth reforms will be imposed upon the people. There is the least room for the use of force in such things. An evil like untouchability which ha found its way into the very marrow of the people’s bones, and that too in the name of religion, cannot be removed forcibly. But an alien government uses its influence to further suppress the suppressed by force. And when it tries to help them from a motive, pure or selfish, that too is done by the exercise of force. The Congress has not estabilished its position through force. It is a purely demorcatic organization. Therefore, it is hoped that the Congress ministers will educate public measures. This should result in an impetus to reforms like Harijan work in thier provinces and the forces standing in the way of such reforms would automatically disappear. Moreover, intensive work in the limited area of the Bhusawal Taluka is likely to prove very fruitful. We cannot reach the whole of India at one and the same time. Wherever the workers have the requisite ability and influence, the work will proceed at a quicker pace. Sound work in a small area is therefore likely to be copied by others and thus lead to an early success. Let us hope that will be the result of the work which has been strarted in Bhusawal.

 Q. What can one do if in spite of putting in a full day’s labour, one cannot  get enough to eat?
 A. The labourr is worthy of his hire. This law is as old as the hills. All useful labour ought to bring in the same and adequate wages to the labourer. Till that time comes, the least that should be dome is
 
 to see that every labourer gets enough to feed and clothe himelf and his family. A government that does not ensure this much is no government. It is anarchy. Such a state should be resisted peacefully. Looting of grainshops and rowdyism is not the remedy. It leads to needless loss and death. Even if the authorities give in out of fear it does not really help them or the people. It does not remove anarchy and things remain as they were. A look round the world will confirm what is here stated.
 If, in spite of the collections of food grain in the depots, the hungry cannot get it, they can offer peaceful satyagraha.They should not take by force what has not been given to them. They can go on a fast unto death and thus secure relief for themseleves and for others. If they have patience, the method suggested by me is sure of success.

 MUSSOORIE,
 May 29, 1946
 When he saw some dirty looking boys sitting in front of him, Mahatma Gandhi remarked:
To wear torn and dirty clothes is a sure sign of laziness.
 Turning towards the Harijans attending his meeting, Mahatma  Gandhi remarked that he was a Harijan himself, and they had come to see him as he was one of them. Mahatma Gandhi further added that he became a Harijan of his own accord, and if more people became Harijans, there would be so many more of them and the blot on Hinduism would be removed. He had come to the conclusion that caste system was very harmful to Hinduism.
 How could he feel at home amidst the endless saturnalia of fashions that is Mussoorie?
 Gandhiji recalled his previous visit to Mussoorielibtech_134_footnote, which was in connection with the Congress work. This time he had come purely on his own.
As you know I am not even a four-anna member but only a
 humble servant of the Congress like the unnamed crores who are not on its rolls but serve it all the same humble and quietly to the best of their capacity without expectation of name or reward. And why? Because the thirst for freedom has taken possession of their souls. They do not know how it can be won. But they have heard  the Congress is the one organization that has for the last years fighting the good fight that would bring freedom to all without distinction. That is why they are devoted to it. I have come to Mussoorie as one of them,  a humble private individual.
 He did not want anyone to be bothered with taking care of him.
 God alone is my Protector. How can puny man, who is not sure even of his own tomorrow, presume to protect another? I am content to be under God’s care. He may protect or destroy. I know He some- times even destroys to protect.
 He had been told before, and again since his arrival at Mussoorie, of the life of the fashionable rich in Mussoorie. Like other Himalayan hill stations, Mussoorie
 
 was no place for the poor.
 The poor slave for you. They draw your rickshaws. It hurts me, and it ought to hurt you too, that a fellow human being should pull the rickshaw of a healthy and able-bodied person. I say this not to criticize you but to remind you of those whose very existance you are otherwise apt to forget, but who nevertheless are India. It is up to you to think of them and enter into their lives.
 I long for the day when Ramanama would save me from the necessity of having to go to hill station during the summer. Crores cannot go to the hill stations. They are born to live and die on the plains.
 I have not come here for pleasure but only under medical necessity so that I might be able to serve you the more. Give me your blessings and let me have little quiet so that I can attend to my work and commune with the Maker undisturbed.
 Concluding, Mahatma Gandhi advised the local rich men to build dharmashalas for the benefit of the poor and the Harijans as was done in Panchgani hills.

80,"May 29, 1946",FAITH CURE V. RAMANAMA,"
  
Here is fine banter from a friend:libtech_139_footnote
 I have read your “Confession and Cure” in Harijan of 17-3-’46.libtech_140_footnoteI wonder whether this nature cure has any close relation to what is being called faith-
 
 cure. . . . For smallpox. . . no treatment is given but it is considered Divine Play. We do pooja to Goddess Mariamma and it is almost miraculous to see most of the cases come out successful. For stomach pain, even chronic cases, many make vows before the deity at Thirupathi. . . my mother had the same pain and after her visit to Thirupathi she is now free from that disease.
 Will you kindly enlighten me on this and may I ask why people should not have such faith in nature cure also. . .?
The examples that have been quoted are neither nature cure nor
 yet Ramanama which I have included in it. But they do show how nature cures without any treatment in may cases. They  are undoubtedly cases which show the part superstition plays in Indian life. Ramanama which is the centre of nature cure is the enemy of superstition. Unscrupulous men will abuse Ramanama as they will any other thing or system. Mere lip recitation of Ramanama has nothing to do with cure. Faith-cure, if I know it correctly, is blind cure, such as the friend describes and thereby redicules the living name of  the living God. The latter is not figment of one’s imagination. It has to come from the heart. It is conscious belief in God and a knowledge of His Law that make perfect cure possible without any further aid. That law is that perfect mind is responsible for perfect health of the body. A perfect mind comes from a perfect heart not the heart known by a doctor’s stethoscope but the heart which is the seat of God. It is claimed that realization of God in the heart makes it impossible for an impure or idle thought to cross the mind. Disease is impossible where there is purity of thought. Such a state may be difficult to attain. But the first step in the ascent to health is taken with its recognition. The next is taken when the corresponding attempt is made. This radical alteration in one’s life is naturally accompanied by the observance of all other nature’s laws hitherto discovered by man. One cannot play with them and claim to have a pure heart. It can be said with justice that possession of a pure heart should do equally well without Ramanama. Only, I know no other way of attaining purity. And it is the way trodden by the sages of old all over the world. They were men of God not superstitious men or charlatans.
If this is Christian Science, I have no quarrel with it. The way of
 Ramanama is not my discovery. It is probably much older than the Christian era.
 A correspondent questions whether Ramanama avoids banafide surgical operations. Of course, it does not. It cannot restrore a leg that is cut off in an accident. In many cases surgical operations are
 unnecessary. Where they are required they should be performed. But a man of God will not worry if a limb is lost. Recitation of Ramanama is neither an empirical method nor a makeshift.

Thus an army officer to a friends:libtech_141_footnote
 It is not a matter for pity if it is true that in all democratic countries politicians are uninterested in the army. The pity of it is that they are wrongly interested in it. The democracies regard army men as their saviours. They bring wealth and subjugate other countries and sustain authority in times of civil disturbance. What is, therefore, to be wished is that democracy, to be true, should cease to rely upon the army for anything whatsoever.
 What has the army done for India? It is for that army that the writer pleads. I fear that in no sense has it served India’s interest. It has kept millions of inofensive and disarmed people under subjection. It has impoverished them. It is an army of which the sooner the British part is sent away and better employed, the better for both India and England, and the world. The sooner the Indian part is turned away from its destructive purpose and its talent employed for constructive purpose, the better it will be for democracy in India. It will be a poor democracy that depends for its existence on military assistance. Military force interferes with the free growth of the mind. It smothers the soul of man. Thanks to years of foreign domination  brought about by the “highly efficient” army, India, in spite of the efforts of the Mission, might have to pull through a long or short civil war which, I shall hope, will bring to an end all infatuation for armed forces. They are a brutalizing process after you  have  isolated discipline which should be common for any social order. If free India has to sustain the present military expenditure, it will bring no relief to the famishing millions.

MUSSOORIE,

  	I have your letter written from Indore before you left for Bombay. 	As long as you rely on anybody except God, there will be nothing but 	darkness around you. We have not heard of the blind leading the 	blind. It is an error and ignorant attachment to say that a 	particular person guides one. That all of us let ourselves be 	guided, up to a point, by somebody is one thing and to rely upon one 	person in all matters is another. I see this every moment, and more 	clearly in your case. My test has no meaning at all. I do not test 	anybody, nor do I wish to do so. Really speaking I do not know how  	to  test anybody. You can, therefore, stay in Bombay. Kafi Khan can 	guide you best and you can guide him. After all you are brother and 	sister and there would be nothing unusual in your guiding each 	other. Nor is there anything unusual in your trying to help Rashid 	Khan’s widow. If your advice is not accepted in all matters, you 	should not feel offended. However, how can I fully know the position 	in your family and its affairs? I am sure, therefore, that you 	should do what seems best to you. What I have said above concerns 	the members of the same family. But you have looked upon the Ashram 	as your family. You may draw from it whatever consolation you can. 	You need not ask me even for that. You know all the members of that 	family. You may, therefore, take from each, whatever service you can 	easily get from him or her. You need not ask me to help you in that 	matter. You may go to the Ashram whenever you wish to and leave it 	whenever you feel inclined to do so. When you go to the Ashram, 	observe its rules during the time you ramain there. After leaving it 	you may follow whichever you can. The others do the same. There is 	no benefit in carrying with oneself wherever one goes what one finds 	a burden.  	In Borkamata you have created your own family. I did not  know about 	it. Whether to go there or not also rests with you. If I have 	forbidden you, I withdraw my prohibition. If anything happens there 	or somebody does not respect your wishes, do not seek my help. I do 	not even know everybody there.  	You have by now written a good many letters. Since you had lost a 	dear brother, I felt that I should share your sorrow and, 
 therefore, wrote to you despite pressure of other work. You should not take improper advantage of that now. If you need to write to me on some special business, that would be a different matter. Make your way in life truthfully and with ease and do everything with God alone as witness. Give up your attachment to me. To rely on one human being in all one’s affairs is nothing but attachment.

He will cure you 	of your disease and, if He does not wish to do that, He will give 	you peace of mind and your restlessness will disappear. If He alone 	is to be one’s true help, the condition, I believe, is that one 	may seek no other help except what one gets from pure and moderate 	food and the five elements.

 Responsible Ministries in the provinces have naturally meant wholesale releases of political prisoners. These include convicts sentenced for murder, arson, robbery, etc. Correspondents ask how far these releases should be acclaimed by the public as of heroes and martyrs.
 It is one thing to release, for a variety of reasons, persons who were convicted of such crimes. It is wholly another thing to praise the acts as of heroes to be received with every mark of honour. I have no doubt that it is thoughtless and wrong. If I am in need of money for a public purpose and commit robbery I do not cease to be a robber, because the robbery committed by me is for public use. This indiscriminate praise of every crime, so long as it is dignified by the
 
 name of patriotism, is a boomerang bound to return with redoubled force to the nation which will have to pay heavily for it. Independence though it includes the freedom even to commit a crime, may easily prove a curse, if it does not carry a voluntary rigid restraint. The public approbation referred to is wrong education of the people and a harmful preparation for the independence that is  coming  much sooner than many of us expect.

 I have to pay heavily for the caution with which I wrote the other   day   the   paragraph   in   Harijanlibtech_146_footnotelibtech_147_footnotein   regard   to   increase   in ministerial salaries. I have to go through long letter bewailing my caution and arguing with me to revise my view. How can ministers make large increases in their own original fat salaries when the poor chaprasis and clerks get an increase which hardly meet the occasion?  I have reread my note and I claim that the short note includes all that various correspondents desire. But, in order to avoid any misunderstanding, I expand my meaning.
 I have been twitted for no referring to the Karachi Resolution. The lower scale of ministers’ salaries rests on much higher ground than the authority of a resolution. In any event, so far as I am aware, the Congress has never varied that resolution. It is as binding today as it was when it was passed.
 I do not know that the increases in the salaries is justified. But I must not offhand condemn the increase without knowing the case of the ministers. Critics should know that I have no authority over them or anyone else except myself. Nor am I present at all the meetings of the Working Committee. I attend only when required by the President. I can only give my opinion for what it is worth. And, if it to have any weight, it must be well-conceived and based on ascertained facts.
 The question of the hideous inequality between the rich and the poor and the lower services and the higher is a separate subject requiring drastic and well-thought-out method and could not  be merely incidental to the lowering of the salaries of the few ministers
 
 and their secretaries. Both subjects require to be dealt with on merits. The question of salaries could be and should be easily disposed of by the ministers concerned. The other is a much vaster subject requiring a thorough overhauling. I would any day agree that the ministers should tackle the subject in their provinces without delay and that the lower ranks should before everything else have their salaries fully considered and increased wherever necessary.

 IS LYING EVER JUSTIFLABLE?
 Q. What do you say to the following from Bertrand Russell? “I once in the course of a country walk saw a tired fox at the last stages of exhaustion still forcing himself to run. A few minutes afterwards I saw the hunt. They asked me if I had seen the fox, and I said I had. They asked me which way he had gone, and I lied to them. I do not think I should have been a better man if I had told the truth.”
 A. Bertrand Russell is a great writer and philosopher. With all respect to him I must dissent from the view attributed to him. He made the initial mistake of admitting that he had seen the fox. He was not bound to answer the first question. He could even refused to answer the second question unless he deliberately wanted to put the hunt off the track. I have always maintained that nobody is bound always to answer quetions that may be put to him. Truth-telling admits of no exceptions.
 ADDRESSES AND FLORAL TRIBUTES
A correspondent complains:
 In many of the provinces there are Congress ministeries, and the public is proud of the fact. So when any minister visits any place, the local bodies or local institution show their respect by presenting addresses of value. In almost all the cases, these things become the property of the  minister.  This  practice,in  my opinion, is not good. Either this system of receiving addresses must be stopped or the things presented should go, say, to the local Congress Committee. There should be some definite policy regarding the garlanding of the ministers or the Congress leaders. I have seen several cases where these ministers have been honoured with flowers costing not less than 300 to 400 rupees. This is mere waste of money.
 A. The complaint is valid. No public servant receive for his own use addresses of the value or costly floral truibutes. These things have become a nuisance, if they are not much worse. The argument is often trotted out that costly frames and flowers put money into the pockets
 of artisans. The latter are well able to take care of themselves without the aid of ministers and the like. These gentlemen do not travel for pleasure. Theirs are business tours undertaken often for listening to what the poeple have to say. The addresses presented to them need not extol their virtues which are their own reward. They should express accurately local wants and grievances if any. In these times the ministers and their secretaries have a hard task before them. Public adulation instead of being a help will become a hindrance.

Can you get a house in Uruli Kanchan in which you two can live 	yourselves? Would you yourself like that? Or would you prefer to 	stay somewhere near Sevagram?

  	Herewith Kanchan’s postcard. I have sent her a reassuring reply.  	I have told her that you two will be living in a separete house of 	your own. You also should write to her and reassure her.  	You ought not write bitter letters to her. All her illness comes 	from the mind. If she had faith in Ramanama she would not need 	consolation from anybody else. But the difficulty is that for 	Kanchan the only Ramanama is yourself. You have, therefore, no 	choice but to play that part. Even in doing that, however, you will 	need the support of Ramanama.  	I expected a letter from you yesterday, but none arrived. Have you 	received no reply from Mirabehn as yet? I hope that your condition 	is good, and so also your health.

Mahatma 	Gandhi—The Last Phase, Book 	I, Vol. I, p. 63       MUSSOORIE,  May 	31, 1946  Speaking 	after prayers, Mahatma Gandhi expressed regret that yesterday due to 	inclement weather the audience had to be satisfied with Ramdhun 	only. He was also 	sorry that some had to sit or stand on wet grass. It would be good 	if there was a proper ground where everybody could go and pray in 	comfort.  He 	again suggested that Mussoorie should have a place where the poor 	could come and avail themeselves of the benefits of the hill climate 	whenever necessary.  	I myself have become a Harijan by choice. I would love to be in a 	place where Harijan too can come and dwell. A Harijan by birth     
 may repudiate his varna but how can I who have become a Harijan by choice? I have not hesitated to suggest to caste Hindus that today they have all to become atishudras, if the canker of caste feeling is to be eradicated from Hinduism and Hinduism is not to perish from the face of the earth.
 If there were such a place in Mussoorie itself, where  even  Harijan would be welcome, he would rather stay there if ever he came to Mussoorie again. In answer to a similar suggestion at Panchani, the people there were planning to have a place of that type. He was glad to inform the gathering that there was some talk already of a com- mittee of the citizens of Mussoorie being formed for that purpose.
 What, however exercised his mind even more was the impending famine. He reminded his fashionable audience of the coffin at their feast. As a matter of fact the famine was already in the land. Crores were not getting enough to eat. Rich people were perhaps ready to give money, but no one could eat money. There was not enough food in the country. Whatever there was could not be transported quickly to the deficit areas. Such was the bankruptcy of the Government. Then again there were places where people went hungry in spite of the fact that the food was stored on the spot. Then reason was all-round corruption and the greed of our own people. He appealed to those who were well-off and could afford to get somehow whatever they wanted, to spare every grain of foodstuff that they could. If the people co-operated and there was no black marketing and corruption,  possibly there was enough food in the land to enable them to tide over that crisis. There were some who did not agree with him and main- tained that if we did not get food from other countries we could not avoid starvation and death. He was not of that opinion. When other contries sent them supplies it would take time for the supplies to reach India in the first instance and even after they were landed in the ports, would take about six weeks to transport them to the needed areas. The only real remedy was self-help and co-operation among all and disappearance of corruption. He appealed to the well-to-do men and women of Mussoorie to save every grain they could for the famishing people. If all voluntarily restricted themselves absolutely to what was needed for their health, they would be well able to tide over their difficulties.

  	I have your letter. It appears to me that your friend erred in 	undertaking the fast. There is no restriction to fasting undertaken 	to ward off an illnes. It accords with the need of the occasion. 	Then, you mention no reasons. Unless I know and fully comprehend the 	reason I don’t see what remedy I can suggest. For nature-cure 	treatment there is not—nor should there be—any need to run 	around. In nature cure, as I conceive it, Ramanama enjoys the pride 	of place. It is the focal point. But it is something that needs to 	be grasped. It is useless for those to whom it does not appeal. Does 	your friend sleep in the open air? Does he breathe through the nose? 	Does he  take  an  early morning sun-bath? Does he have hip-bath and 	friction-bath? You do know both these baths. Does he have abdominal 	mudpacks at night?

Everything is in confusion. 	Mahabaleshwar is of course out. I am dictating this at Mussoorie. 	Mussoorie is at a higher altitude than Panchgani. The air is pretty 	cold. I have nothing to do in Delhi till the 9th or 10th June. So I 	am staying on here. I came here on the 28th. 
 If some house is available which can be used as a dharmashala I ought to take up residence there and sticu to the place. If no such house has been secured and if the arrangment is to be postponed till my arrival, I should like to stay at Preston because Gulbailibtech_155_footnoteused to live there. But surely it is not for me to make the choice. I would put up at any place which would be convenient and where a party of ten or twelve people could be accommodated. You may take it that whatever is convenient to you will be convenient to me.
 I would naturally want to go to Poona direct from Kalyan. I might be inclined to visit Uruli Kanchan for a day or two if it is convenient. It will be enough if you see me only at Poona. For the present you may regard all this as merely a wish. It is in God’s hands whether or not it will materialize.
 Since Pattanisaheblibtech_156_footnoteis himself staying in the Panchgani Castle the thought of putting up there must be given up. Even otherwise there is always the possibility of members of his family or those of one Prince or another coming to stay. This is another reason why we should give up the idea of Panchgani Castle.

 Your letter to Bapa was passed on to me for perusal. You have advised him to refuse help to Soundaram.libtech_157_footnotelibtech_158_footnoteI don’t like it. You should have been more charitable. This is the first experiment of entrusting responsible jobs to women. You should give all assistance to the venture. I can say nothing if it is beyond your power; but why is it so? How can a devotee of Rajaji do such thing? Rajaji is well known for his charitable disposition; he makes friends of foes and does not forsake friends even when they turn enemies. I know of instancse of both the types. Devotion can never mean that we may not emulate the object of our devotion. Devotion bereft of any attempt at emulation is no devotion at all. Sometimes the views of our seniors do not agree with our own but we do not leave them for that reason. Why should you be unhappy if Kamalabehn has not been appointed an Agent? The office of an Agent is not for prestige but for service. Cannot one serve without being an Agent? Subbulakshmi was never promised anything. I do not like all that is going on. You also admit that Soundaram is a worthy worker and in addition is a doctor. Her husband also is a worker—enlightened and hard-working. On her appointment, as an Agent therefore, she deserves to be congratulated by you. let us see what happens now. Do whatever is possible indepen- dently. The field [of service] is wide enough to accommodate all.

SERVANTS 	OF [INDIA] 	SOCIETY 	POONA  From 	a copy of the Gujarati: Pyarelal Papers. Courtesy: Pyarelal      A 	khadi worker writes:  I 	give below a recent conversation between the manager of a Khadi 	Bhandar and some customers. Should khadi be sold to such persons?  Q.	“is 	this yarn spun by you?”  A.	“No 	I have 	bought eight hanks for 	Rs. 10.”  Q.	To a second customer: “Are you able to spin all this yarn?”  A.	“No. 	This is spun 	by my daughter. 	We shell 	yarn too at 	the rate 	of 12 	annas per hank.”  Q.	To 	a third: “You cannot buy khadi unless you produce the requisite 	quantity of yarn.”  A.	“It 	does not 	matter. So 	long as 	I cannot 	get the yarn, 	I will 	buy uncertified khadi.”  Q.	To 	a fourth: “Why do you buy khadi?”  A.	“Because 	it is easy to procure.”  Q.	To 	a fifth: “You are not a regular wearer of khadi. What will you do 	with what you have bought?”  A.	“Today 	khadi is looked 	upon as being 	in the fashion.”  Q.	To 	a sixth: “You do 	not spin yourself. From 	where then comes this 	yarn?”     
 A.	“A good friend of mine provides me with yarn.”
 Q.	To a seventh: “Why do you always wear either silk or wool khadi?”
 A.	“Because I do not have to give yarn for these.”
 Q.	To an eighth: “You have bought a large quantity of khadi. What will you do with it all?”
 A.	“This will last me two or three years. After that it will be seen whether I can get any or not.”
The above questions and answers are revealing. If the new
 policy in regard to khadi is correct and khadi customers are of the above nature, it proves the necessity for the abolition of the khadi clause from the Congress Constitution. It is worthy of note that the questions and answers concern eight persons. The Charkha Sangh need not cater for the needs of a single one of them. The Spinners’ Association exists only for the poor. Those who wear khadi, do so either for the sake of the poor or for winning swaraj or both. The eight customers mentioned above are concerned with neither. If the Charkha Sangh is to prove the rightness of the ideal for which khadi stands, then its workers must be loyal enough to the new policy and not fear even the clossing down of the sales bhandars. They must have the strength to bear any consequences in order to set  right  the mistakes of the past.
 The above conversation also holds a warning to the managers of the bhandars to be wide awake. They should become experts in the science of khadi and be prepared to teach customers  the  inner meaning of khadi with patience and humility. This may take time but it is worth while. If there is faith in the power of khadi I have no doubt that we shall remain steadfast and thereby inspire others the belief also. But if workers themeselves lack faith then the claim for khadi will fall to the ground.
 I have taken for granted that the conversation has been truly reported.

DEAR LORD,
 I had thought that your kind letter of the 27th ultimo did not require any answer. But I now see that I must write.
 You “look forward” to my return and that of the Congress Working Committee to Delhi before the end of next week. Maulana Saheb was with me yesterday and he told me that it was very difficult to recall the members of the Working Committee  before  the  9th instant as many of them had appointments, he knew, which they could not very well cancel. He is, therefore, calling the meeting for the 9th instant. I wonder if I might also leave here on the morning of the 9th so as to reach Delhi about 10 a. m. This would not permit me to keep appointments before 2 p. m. that day. Will this do or will you want me before the 9th? If you do I would leave here on the 8th morning.
 I hope that you are keeping well and that Sir Stafford  is regaining his lost strength day by day.
The weather here is naturally very cool.
 Yours sincerely,

  	I got your letter. It is good that you wrote, no matter what. In my 	opinion, you have been guilty of a serious lapse from the moral 	point of view. This is the one thing that has disgraced many a 	profession. In theory all professions are supposed to be altruistic, 	i. e., they are to be pursued with a religious attitude. Pecuniary 	consideration has no place in a religious attitude. If one pursues 	any calling in a religious spirit one is sure to earn enough for 	one’s maintenance. But even that is not always necessary. Even  if 	 one cannot earn enough one has to keep up one’s religious 	attitude. Vritti in this connection should be understood to 	mean drishti, i. e., point of view. You swerved from such an 	attitude an succumbed to the temptation of injections, etc. 	Ganeshshastri Joshi, your guru, who initiated you in the Ayurvedic 	system, has himself told me about the guiding principle of Ayurveda, 	viz., that Ramanama forms the basis of the system. And utilization 	of the five elements is symbolic of the permanence of Ramanama. You 	forgot this lesson. I had told you that in [Uruli] Kanchan village, 	you had to forget your knowledge of the Ayurvedic medicines, i. e., 	you were not to make use of them. Your first job was to teach 	Ramanama. Only those who have spontaneous faith in it and are 	inspired by it in all their actions can testify to the wonders of 	Ramanama. For, as I have said, Ramanama is the unfailing remedy for 	all the three kinds of afflictions. Like the arrow of Rama which is 	said to have never missed its target, the name of Rama too never 	fails. All our actions should be inspired by this principle. Lure of 	wealth is also a kind of affliction for which again Ramanama is the 	cure. Having yourself failed to imbibe this, how can you expect to 	treat others by naturopathy? Never mind what has happened; if you 	now want to come to Uruli Kanchan village, use the great 	rejuvenating herb that Ramanama is wherever you are. Give up the 	merest wish of earning wealth through it. Come and see me in Uruli 	Kanchan village 
 when I go there after you have completely rid yourself of your infatuation with wealth and have simplified your way of life. Read this letter again and again.Write to me if you don’t follow any expression. You can show this letter to Ganeshshastri Joshi and do as he says.

  Addressing 	the meeting, Mahatma Gandhi said that it had given him much pleasure 	to come there for prayers.

The 	benefit one derived from community prayers had to be experienced 	rather than described, added Mahatma Gandhi.

Similarly, the benefit 	derived from community prayers was incalculable.  Gandhiji 	reminded them about what he had said on the need for having a place 	for the poor people in Mussoorie. He did not expect them to build 	palatial buildings, but they should be clean and well planned, so 	that even a man like him could come and stay there. He could not 	stand dirty clothes, dirty houses and surroundings and dirty 	lavatories. There was no reason why the poor should have to put up 	with dirt.  Their 	lavatories should be as clean as a bedroom or a library. Defecation 	was not a dirty process. It was a necessary physiological action of 	the body as was eating and they should have proper and clean places 	for it. There 	should not be a trace of dirt or foul smell in it. You might  	think that I am speaking with my tongue in my cheek. The fact is 	that a meticulous sense of cleanliness, not only personal but also 	in regard to one’s surroundings is the alpha and omega of 	corporate life. We in India have made a ritual of cleanliness. But 	we have yet to make good our claim that we possess the sanitary 	instinct. I have seen how we foul the banks of our holy rivers. The 	Ganges water is regarded by us as     
 holy, capable of washing off our sins. The idea is symbolical. Just as water washed the body clean, a devotee prays and hopes for the cleansing of the heart by the water of life. But if we contaminate our holy rivers as we do, how can their water effect inner cleansing?
 He had heard that the living conditions of the labourers in Mussoorie were deplorable. They lived in small, overcrowded, dirty and evilsmelling rooms. No one could afford to overlook that. All life was one. If they cleaned their own homes and neglected their neighbours’ they would have to pay the price in the form of epidemics and the like. In the West they had been able to rid their countries of plague. He himself had witnessed in South Africa how by prompt and energetic action the Johannesburg Municipality was able to arrest the outbreak of plague so effectively that it never came back. But in India it returned again and again —it had become almost endemic.
 The remedy lies in our own hands We must not only observe the rules of health and hygiene in our own persons but we must see that our poor neighbours do so too To neglect to do so is a sin for which we cannot escape the penalty. I do not grudge the rich their riches provided that they do not forget the poor and share their riches with them and provided their riches are not gained at the expense of the impoverishment of others.

 My co-workers from Uruli Kanchan inform me that patients from far distances are coming there for treatment. I have already written  in  Harijan  Sevaklibtech_172_footnotethat  up   till  now   there   is  nowhere   any permanent arrangement for anyone to live and no room  for in- patients. I have just heard that some land has been made available but the work of building huts on its remains. There is no house available in the village either where patients from outside could be taken in and, in any event, it has never been the intention to turn a village into a city. The real aim is for every village to have a nature-cure clinic to adorn it just as it should have a school.
 Readers should bear in mind that my co-workers in Uruli Kanchan are unable to guide patients through correspondence.
 
 Persons who live far away can carry out their own nature-cure treatment. Who cannot recite Ramanama in his own home? It is also possible for everyone to have sitz baths, etc., wherever he is.

  	I am glad that you got the land at last. If all the land has been 	entered in my name, that is not right. There is no objection, 	however, if I have been described as a Trustee. I suppose you can 	easily see the difficulty that you will face if the land has been 	entered in my name and I suddenly die. In case, however, such a 	thing does happen, you may use this letter and end any dispute that 	may arise, telling the people concerned that the land was not my 	private property but was intended for schemes for helping the people 	of Uruli Kanchan to preserve good health and for purposes connected 	with such schemes. After me the Trustees will be Dinshaw Mehta and 	Jehangir Patel or Balkrishna.  	I am returning by registered post the plans received from you. I 	accept the modifications suggested therein. I see no objection to 	all the lavatories being fitted with good septic tanks, if that is 	possible. I suppose you know that if such tanks have not been made 	carefully or if we do not use them properly, they can be a source of 	grave danger. 
 Let Dr. Bhagwat and Bhai Datar meet and discuss this matter further. Balkrishna also knows about both the dangers. I am not happy about the vagueness of my suggestion, but I have not been able myself to come to a definite dicision. I discussed the matter with some friends who have experience in this field, but they also could not help me to come to a decision, so [complicated]libtech_173_footnotelibtech_174_footnoteis the problem. For the present, therefore, abide by the decision of the three  persons I  have mentioned.
 I shall positively have returned there in July. If you have not been able to make much progress by that time, I will take it up when I come there. I shall be in Delhi up to June 15 at any rate. I may [possibly]libtech_175_footnoteremain there even up to the 21st. I shall . . .libtech_176_footnotebe going to Panchgani thereafter. I must return to Sevagram in August. I am, therefore, afraid that I [shall get]libtech_177_footnoteat the most the month of July [in Uruli Kanchan]libtech_178_footnote. My only consolation [is that you people]libtech_179_footnoteare doing excellent work there, so much so that I sometimes fear whether my presence there might not hamper the modest but beautifully progressing work that you are doing. But I dismiss the fear from my mind with the thought that I will do as God prompts me.
 By a fortunate accident both Kanchan and Zohra happen to be there. But they might leave that place any time. The best thing would be that some local woman or women should get trained and start working.
 Carry out the modifications in the plan for the building which you have suggested. Personally I like the change in the doors from three feet to four feet, for narrow doors cannot afterwards be widened. I myself have experienced the advantage of wide doorways, namely, that patients’ beds, etc., are easy to move in and out through them. But the best course would be to follow Dr. Bhagwat’s advice. Every- body has a right to point out to him the advantages and disadvantages of all things but in case of a difference of opinion it is best, in my absence, that his view should be carried out. I cannot from this distance come to any more definite conclusions about the [suggested]libtech_180_footnotemodifications. I understand what you say about the cow.
 
 
 I will reply to whatever questions you ask me about brahmacharya. But you should attach importance only to what your heart spontaneously suggests. Vinoba’s articles are, of course, fine. But for the person who has unquestioning faith in the power of Ramanama there is no other support but that, for when one has faith in its power Ramanama there is no other support but that, for when one has faith in its power Ramanama ceases to be a matter of reason and becomes solely a matter of the heart. I feel every moment that for such a person Rama is the only King of his heart, and he who has Rama as his Lord cannot waste a single moment of his time. And violation of brahmacharya even in thought means for that moment at least the man’s attention had wandered, and that, therefore,  that moment was wasted.
I am not writing separately to Dhiru today. This is to save time.

Mahatma Gandhi expressed pleasure and said they looked very 	smart.  When 	apprised of the working of the Dal in the district the Mahatma asked 	the volunteers: Do 	you want to ask any questions?  A 	volunteer . . . said, “Sir, . . . please tell us when we are 	getting swaraj.” Mahatma Gandhi laughed heartily and replied: There 	is no doubt that we are getting swaraj but when, it is diffi-  	cult to answer. Anyway it would not be much longer, hence we are 	eager to establish swaraj as early as possible and trying to do it.  Another 	volunteer . . . asked, “Do you still hold the same opinion which 	you expressed recently regarding the Cabinet Mission’s 	declaration?” Yes, 	because the Mission’s object is good, its members’ hearts  	are sincere and their is a sincere attempt to evolve a workable 	scheme of Indian independence out of the conflicting interestsand 	party aims. This  I  say  in  spite  of  what   the   Delegation   	said.   I   am  primarily 
 concerned with their main plan. We fail to appreciate the plan because we do not recognize our own weaknesses and failings. We must be bold enough to confess our weaknesses and incompetences.
 Another boy . . . said, “If you think that we are still incompetent for swaraj on account of our shortcomings, then the British people will never give it and we will never have it, they being very clever and diplomatic. What is the remedy in that case?”
I do not say we are quite incompetent for independence but
 whatever I say about our own shortcomings is based on the reading of the mental working and behaviour of a few of our own people.
 There are vast numbers, in fact crores, of our people of whom we know nothing. We don’t know what they may say or do at a particular moment. Freedom is not a matter of gift nor has the Delegation come here to give us freedom.
 It would be too much to expect from them. We have to evolve freedom from amongst ourselves rather out of our own divergences and differences and this is the crux of the matter. They certainly have not come to deceive us this time. This is how I take it.
 What is the meaning of your “Do or Die” slogan of 1942libtech_186_footnotelibtech_187_footnote?
 It was taken out of the context. I had also said that we should work for swaraj and die in the attempt for it.
 The last question was regarding  non-violence.
 Mahatma Gandhi said it was in 1920 that non-violence was deliberately adopted as a method of obtaining swaraj but we could not translate it into practice nor could we stick to it steadfastly. We only have the non-violence of the coward and not of the brave. We have not been non-violent all through. The discussion had finished when one of the volunteers fainted and fell down. . . .
 Mahatma Gandhi remarked: “You have asked too much and let us finish for today”, and left to see the boy.libtech_188_footnote

 MUSSOORIE,
 June 2, 1946
 Gandhiji congratulated the audience on the exemplary behaviour at prayer time and thanked workers for excellent loudspeaker arrangments. He reminded them of the debt the Hindu society owed to the Harijans. A sin committed in the name of religion was doubly bad, he added. The least that they could do for them was to subscribe money for their cause. He also asked them to contribute liberally for building better quarters for the labourers and a Harijan dharmashala. He, however, warned them against an enthusiastic beginning and a poor ending.
 Ramanama is not for the few; it is for all. He who takes His name lays by a rich store for himself, and it is inexhautible. The more you draw upon it, the more it increases. It is infinite. As the Upanishad says, you take infinite out of infinite and infinite remains behind.libtech_190_footnoteIt is the unfailing panacea for all the ills, physical, mental and spiritual to which man is subject. Rama is only one of the numerous names of God. In fact there are as many names of God as there are human beings in the world. You may substitute Krishna for Rama or you can substitute for it any of His countless names and it will make no difference.
 He himself had got the mantra of Ramanama, he said, from his nurse when he was a child.
 I used to be frightened of ghosts and evil spirits in the dark. My nurse told me, “If you repeat Ramanama all the ghosts and evil spirits will vanish.” I accepted her advice with all the unquestioning faith of a child. That cured me of my cowardice.
 If that was the experience of a child, how much more would the grown-ups stand to gain by it if they repeated Ramanama with understanding and faith, he asked.
 But the condition was that it must come from the heart.

 greed? Then there is no charm against it like Ramanama. Supposing you are tempted to amass a big fortune by some easy and dishonest means. If you have faith in Ramanama you will say to yourself, ‘Why should I amass for my wife and children riches which they might squander away? Why not leave them a legacy in the shape of sound character and sound education and training that will enable them to earn their living by honest industry and body labour?’ Ceaseless repetition of Ramanama will dispel your delusion and false attachment and the living realization will dawn on you that you were a fool to hanker after millions for the sake of your dear ones instead of offering them the priceless treasure of His name which frees one from all bondage and wanderings. Filled with the joy of that realization such a person will tell his wife and children, ‘I have not brought for you the treasure I had set out for but something infinitely richer.’‘Where is it, show it to us?’ they will say incredulously.‘It is the Name which is richer than all treasures’ he will reply, ‘because it quenches the thirst for all riches. It is enshrined in my heart.’

A correspondent writes:libtech_192_footnote
 It would be fitting if our constitution were to be drawn up in our national language. But one difficulty will be that few, if any, of the judges of our High and Federal Courts know Hindustani. They will, therefore, have to have an English translation for their use.
 The other question that will arise is whether the members of the  Constituent Assembly will know enough Hindustani to grasp its essentials.
This letter appeals to me. Why should our constitution be in
 English? It should certainly be in an Indian language and, in my opinion, that language can only be Hindustani which crores can easily understand. In addition such an act will electrify the masses. As circumstances are, it is right that the Constituent Assembly should make an English translation of the document  and,  indeed,  there should be translations also in every one of the provincial languages.
The second point raised by the writer is also apt. But since the
 
 members of the Constituent Assembly will be chosen by the present legislative bodies, it will be open to the latter to elect, so far as possible, only those persons who are conversant with Hindustani and thus act on the correspondent’s letter.

126,,"URDU, THE LANGUAGE

  You 	are making strenuous 	efforts to get 	every Indian, 	particularly Hindus 	with whom you naturally 	come most in 	daily contact, 	to learn 	Urdu. Similarly, 	is any 	Mohammedan striving to 	induce Muslims to 	learn Hindi? If 	not, will not 	the result of 	your labours be 	that Urdu will become the 	language of 	both and 	Hindi will remain the 	medium solely for 	Hindus? Will not 	this be 	a disservice 	to Hindi?  The 	Urdu equivalent of the Hindi word is invariably given in brackets  	in the Hindustani Prachar 	publications, but the 	converse is 	not done. Does that 	not signify a desire to 	teach Urdu by force to Hindus?  There 	are any number 	of Persian 	and Arabic 	words used in these 	publications. Do 	you think 	they are understood 	by the 	general run 	of people? 	For example adablibtech_194_footnote, adablibtech_195_footnote, etakadlibtech_196_footnotelibtech_197_footnote.  If 	Hindustani is 	in fact a 	language, why 	in your educational 	readers is there such a difference in terminology in the Urdu and Hindi editions?  My 	fear is 	that the lakhs of 	Southern Indians who 	have so far 	been trying 	to learn 	Hindi will be so scared 	of the 	Urdu script that 	they will learn neither 	and in the end the work 	hitherto done by the 	Hindustani Prachar Sabha 	will be 	completely wiped out. 
 Effort are being made that those who are unacquainted with 
 the Urdu form should learn it and vice versa with those who do not know the Hindi form. It is true that my contacts are more with Hindi- knowing Hindus. But that does not worry me. Hindus are not likely to forget their Hindi. In fact I believe that their Hindi will be enriched by their knowledge of Urdu. The majority of Indians whether Hindus or Mussalmans, generally know best the languages of their provinces
 
 which contain a large number of Sanskrit words. I myself have neither the fear nor the desire that everyone will, as a result of my efforts, learn the Urdu form to the exclusion of Hindi. Desire or no desire, whatever is natural will happen. The attempt to have a wise blending of the two forms for a national tongue is, in my opinion, a good venture in every way.
  I 	have not read all 	the publications of 	the Hindustani Prachar Sabha. It 	is commendable if 	the Urdu 	equivalents of 	some Hindi 	words are given 	in brackets. 	This only means that in 	the opinion of 	the writers 	of the 	books these words are 	not commonly known. That 	the Hindi equivalents 	are not given 	signifies that those 	Urdu works have become 	current coin in Hindi. 	It is a 	pity that a 	learned person 	like the correspondent 	should have such 	suspicions. Suspicion 	is not 	an attribute 	of learning.  This 	does not seem 	to be a 	correct charge. And 	even if 	it were 	true, what 	harm can there be? 	The introduction of 	new words 	into any 	language enriches it. 	The words of 	Latin origin that 	came into 	the English 	language after the 	Norman conquest 	added to 	its virility. Whatever was not 	good or 	unnecessary or forced 	did not 	remain. The 	words given by 	way of 	example by 	the correspondent 	are known 	to all 	Hindi lovers in 	the North 	and have 	taken their rightful 	place in 	Hindi. It 	is true that they are 	new for Southern Indians 	and therefore 	their Sanskrit equivalents should be 	and are given. 	The truth 	is that 	the Hindustani Prachar 	Sabha has neither 	antagonism towards one 	nor partiality towards 	the other. 	Both forms 	are there 	and will 	remain and 	these should not 	present any 	difficulty. But, 	of course, 	if there 	is jealoousy 	and antagonnism 	between the two, 	Hindustani will 	never come into being. And 	such an 	eventuality will 	be a 	bad thing 	for India.  Hindustani 	existed at one 	time. The 	present effort is 	directed to revive 	it through 	a wise 	mixture of 	Hindi and Urdu and let 	it grow thereby. Neither 	Hindi[-lovers] nor 	Urdu-lovers should 	sorrow over this. 	Hindi and Urdu 	are sisters. 	What harm, therefore, if 	they mix 	with each 	other? It 	cannot be 	a matter 	of surprise 	that in 	this transition 	stage there should be 	a difference 	of terminology 	in Hindi 	and Urdu 	books.  My 	experience is 	quite contrary 	to that 	of the 	writer. I 	have not 	known anyone who 	has given up 	learning either script 	because of the insistence on the Urdu script. Nor do I fear that this will ever be 
 so.
 
My appeal to the writer is to divest himself of his prejudices.

If I had the time, I would have given a detailed reply to this 	letter in Harijanbandhu itself. But I have no time for that. 	I am interested in language as such. What I mean is that whatever 	language one may speak or write one’s pronunciation should be 	clear and the grammar perfect. I have not been able to reach this 	ideal in the case of any language. Gujarati being my mother tongue, 	naturally, I have love for it. But everyone knows how imperfect my 	Gujarati is. My grammar is weak, my spelling indifferent. What need 	I say about my Hindi, Urdu and Hindustani? Yet I have allowed myself 	to be the president of the Hindustani Prachar Sabha. I spent years 	running after English and lived for many years in the country of 	Englishmen. The English language is glorious in its own place. It is 	an international language. I am also fond of it. But I am conscious 	that my knowledge of it is also imperfect.  	What could be the reason for such lack of organization? It is 	obvious. Language too has its own place like everything else.  	Language is an adornment in its proper place. It is a vehicle for 	thought; and not vice versa. It is the thought contained in 	it  that adorns the language. Language does not have that power 	independently. Realizing this I run after ideas and drag the 	language behind. If the ideas are clear, grammar, spelling, etc., 	will come round automatically or may be the reader will generously 	put up with the looseness of language.  	At present it is not possible for me to take up this dual 	responsibility. I can be responsible for my ideas. But if I wait. to 	adorn my language, Harijan would suffer. I manage with the 	existing     
 means. If I were to examine [my work] from the point of view of the language I would envy so many journals. Not one issue of Harijan would stand comparison with some other journals. I should be happy if the language of all the issues of Harijan was chaste. This is the reason why I have published the foregoing letter. Writers and translators of Harijanbandhu should read and ponder over it to polish their language with due perseverence and render their versions and translations as perfect as possible. The criticism made by the writer is friendly and the readers should take it in the same spirit and make whatever improvements they can.
 A well-wisher like this correspondent should not rest content with criticizing the work but should from time to time  offer suggestions from which others can learn. The late Sastriar had done it and I had published his article.libtech_201_footnote
 In the end I should like to say that an incorrect translation of a Sanskrit quotation must not go. But sometimes though the original may be quoted the purpose is better served by including a Gujarati rendering at the same time. I could not find time to examine whether it was so in the present caselibtech_202_footnotelibtech_203_footnote.
 The correspondent should be tolerant of the pronunciation of foreign languages. Where the spelling does not correspond to the pronunciation, the translator would follow the spelling and this should be the normal practice. If it were not so the translator would be overburdened. As regards proper names, utter chaos prevails. When they are transliterated either into Gujarati or into any other Indian language the safest way seems to be to conform the pronunciation to the spelling.

 I am glad to learn that the question of improving the living conditions of labourer and building a dharmashala for the poor is engaging the active attention of some of the prominent residents of Mussoorie. But I am sorry to hear that even in a matter which should be common concern there is party feeling. If this news is true the work will never succeed. On one pretext or the other there will be increasing strife but I sincerely hope that the news is quite incorrect. In my opinion the work should be entrusted to a committee composed of influential persons who can command public confidence and are above party strife. Such persons are to be found everywhere and Mussoorie should be no exception to the rule. I hope  such  a committee will soon be appointed and it will bring the good work to fruition.

133,"June 4, 1946",MINDFULNESS THE REMEDY,"
    
 The realization that the mere desire for truth and non-violence is not sufficient to make people non-violent made me think that. . . a way must be taught, which would enable people to rebuild themselves fundmentally. . . .
 External observance like prayers, handicrafts, etc., are not the efficient means for truth and kindness.       Only by inner and well directed effort can a
man rebuild himself.	I have in mind the way of mindfulness, recommended
 by Buddha.	He has gone to the point of saying that this way can bring a man
 to prefection in seven days. . .
 The way of mindfulness consists in being constantly observant, conscious, attentive, watchful, awake, uninterruptedly aware of the mental and emotional content of our consiousness and of its expressions through the body. . .
 You can easily try it out on yourself. Within a week you will be convinced that Buddha has left with us a toll of unparalelled efficacy for rebuilding ourselves truly and permanently. . .
 
 Thus   writes  Mr.   Frydmanlibtech_206_footnotelibtech_207_footnote,  better   known   to   the   public   as Bharatanand. I reproduce it for what it is worth. I have not fallen in love with it because this too has caught on. If it was a seven days’ work, why is it that it has so few witnesses in the world today? In so far as it is an aid, it is in general vogue and takes its place among the other remedies, whether it is called mindfulness vigilance or meditation. It does not take the place of prayer or the  mala,libtech_208_footnotelibtech_209_footnoteor any other outward practice. It is in addition to these outward observances so long as the latter are not for show. Indeed, prayer is purely an inward act. Those who found in Ramanama the talisman knew mindfulness and found by experience that Ramanama was the best of all the remedies adopted for the practice of Truth and Non-violence.

When you read 	the books available on the khadi science you will learn many new 	words, you will learn Gujarati and Hindi technical terms and you 	will also learn how much meaning is contained in khadi.  	Show this letter to Vinoba and Bhansali and listen to what they say 	about khadi and ponder over it. We should voluntarily and strictly 	follow the rules of an institution where we go, whether as guests or 	inmates. That is what discipline means. The term for displine in 	Gujarati and Hindi is shista, which however does not convey 	the full meaning of the English word. Work done without discipline 	even if it is on a massive scale, is washed away. The way the 	planets go round the sun is discipline. If any planet, out of 	mischief, were to start going faster or rush too near to the sun, it 	would not only burn up but would destroy the whole solar system. 	From this you may estimate the value of discipline.  	It is certainly good that the Chimur peoplelibtech_211_footnotehave been released. They deserved to be released.

  [June 4, 1946]libtech_218_footnote  Gandhiji 	spoke of the poor rickshaw-pullers and load-carriers there. They 	should be everyone’s concern. They made life possible for the 	wealthy and yet the latter, while willing to take from them even the 	inhuman service of rickshaw-pulling, did not care to see where and 	how they lived, what they ate and what they earned. He had heard 	that these poor men lived in tiny rooms without adequate light and 	air; they did not want to reveal how many herded together into one 	room lest they should be evicted or fined. They were dirtily clad as 	could be seen from the little crowd of them that had come to attend 	the prayers that evening. But perhaps they had not the wherewithal 	to afford a change of clothes. They might be like the woman in 	Bihar, when he first went there, who, when asked to wash herself and 	her clothes, said to Ba: “How can I bathe when I have not another 	sari to put on?“ It was the benden duty of those to whom God had 	given more than their needs to spend the extra money on those who 	were in want. He had been told that the Congress Goverment was now 	in power and would see to it that labour quarters everywhere were 	rebuilt. If they did so it would be a good thing. It would be no 	more than their bare duty. That would not, however, exonerate 	rickshaw-riders from their duty. Doctros had told him that these 	poor people pulled these vehicles for four years or so and the work 	was so hard they died soon after of lung and heart trouble. How 	could the users be so callous as not to see that rickshaw-pullers 	were properly housed and sufficiently paid and clothed and not 	overworked.  Harijan, 	16-6-1946         	Shri Jivaji Desai has sent me samples of some criticisms of the 	edition in Urdu script of Harijan Sevak from both Hindi and 	Urdu newspapers. They have made fun of its Hindustani. Hindi critics 	opine that the articles are deliberately filled with unneccesary 	Urdu words and Urdu critics complain of the use of Sanskrit words 	which Muslims cannot understand.  I 	am glad of these criticisms. Thus, why should the paper be called 	Harijan Sevak instead 	of Harijan 	Khidmatgar?Why 	Sampadak and 	not ‘Editor’ or Mudir 	and so on? Lovers of 	Urdu believe that     
 Hindustani and Urdu are synonymous. Lovers of Hindi feel the same conversely even when it is written in the Urdu script. Presumably they hope that this criticism will go home and make me give up the Urdu script in sheer despair. But the hope is not likely to be fulfilled. In fact neither Urdu or Hindi is to be termed Hindustani. Though not in vogue today Hindustani is a wise mixture of the two. If newspaper and other critics will exercise a little forbearance they will presently see that it is not difficult to understand what is Hindustani as distiguished from Hindi and Urdu. I admit that those who write for Harijan Sevak are still struggling but they are determined to reach the desired goal. Readers must bear kindly with what may today seem a hotch-potch of the two forms. If God spares my life I hope to prove to the readers of Harijan Sevak that Hindustani can be as sweet as either Urdu or Hindustani can be a sweet as either Urdu or Hindi. The seeming quarrel of today will shortly disappear when it is realized that the two forms are sister and that through their joint effort will come into being a stately language which will serve the crores of India.
 In the interim, I hope, critics will point out what to them may appear as mistakes. Taken in a friendly spirit such criticism will help to improve the languae of Harijan Sevak.

 Maulvi Hamidullah Sahib of Lucknow came to see me in Mussoorie and handed two of his pamphlets. They are an attempt to prove the necessity of making obligatory up to the high school standard a knowlede of both Hindi and Urdu and the Nagari and Persian scripts, whether for boys or girls. The idea appeals forcibly to me. My effort has always been directed to this end. Time was when Maulana Hasrat Mohani and Babu Purushottamdas Tandon were working for the same objective but alas! we did not meet with sucess. Nevertheless, I neither abandoned hope nor effort and the result was the creation of the Hindustani Prachar Sabha. The Maulvi Sahib’s request, therefore, is nothing new for me.
If the U. P. Government is able, with the general consent, to
 
 make the attempt, they will have rendered a great service. I am of the opinion that in all the provinces where Hindi or Urdu is the mother tongue, a knowledge of the other should be made compulsory. I have no doubt that the natural outcome of such a step will be the easy birth of Hindustani, in which the two will blend into one. The present controversy between the two sisters will then cease. Another advantage that will accrue is that tuition up to the high school will be in the national language instead of English.

 I have received your telegram. I can see that you are not at all willing to leave Bombay. It would become a little cooler there during the monsoon but I do not think it can be of much benefit to one in your situation. There are hill-stations like Kasauli, Dharampur, etc., in the mountain ranges of Simla. If you spend two years there, even that
 would help. And those hill-stations provide fairly good facilities. Of course there are many inconveniences and so one has to consider it carefully. But if you are calm and cheerful within, I have nothing to say.
 I shall leave here on the 8th so that I can be ready for the 9th. Let us see what happens. As the reciting of Ramanama is for you, so it is for me and everybody else. That medicine is constantly working, but only those who know it can profit from it.

  His 	remarkslibtech_233_footnotewere 	taken to heart 	by one 	of the 	workers who 	has in charge 	of the 	meeting. On 	Subsequent inquiry 	Gandhiji learnt that the 	information which he 	had received 	was of doubtful 	authenticity. As a 	satyagrahi he 	felt he 	had fallen from grace 	in accepting 	a statement 	made to 	him without 	full scrutiny 	and by 	basing his 	public remarks thereon. 	Making a public 	confession of his 	mistake in 	his address 	after the 	prayers on 	the following 	day, he 	stressed the 	importance of 	speaking only 	when necessary and uttering every word after the most careful thought. A 	satyagrahi cannot afford to be credulous or to be careless in  	his speech. There is a Sanskrit verse saying that not to begin is 	the first sign of wisdom, but once you begin a thing you should do 	it well.  	It would have been best not to have made use of the unsifted 	information. But having done so I should end it well by making the 	admission that on inquiry I found that the accusation could not be       
 supported.
 There is a great piece of sculpture in Japan depicting three monkeys. One of them is shutting his mouth with his hands, the  second is shutting his ears and the third is shutting his eyes. The lesson of the first one is not to speak unless absolutely necessary and then too, to weigh every word before speaking. The message of the second is not hear evil things, of the third not to let one’s eyes wander here, there and everywhere.
 Therefore, when going along the road, one should either contemplate the beauty of nature or else fix [one’s] gaze on the ground before one. He carried about the three gurus with him wherever he went and he advised them all to  bear  their instructions in mind.

  	I shall be glad if Jaisukhlal and you come. If both of you can live 	happily away from me and you get educated and become wise there is 	nothing special to be gained by coming to me. If there has been any 	misunderstanding the fire of time will melt it away provided we let 	it do so. From your doingslibtech_237_footnotelibtech_238_footnotethere 	which you describe it seems that you are spending your time well. By 	goondas you seem to mean the bad boys you have to come across. Your 	way of dealing with them may be said to resemble partly of Draupadi. 	The method worth emulating is that of Sita. Though, of course, both 	have been counted among  the  [five]  satis.libtech_239_footnotelibtech_240_footnoteIt 	 is  worth   thinking   over   why   Draupadi, though she had five 	husbands, was and is regarded as a sati. But I leave that 	question aside. If your answer to the goonda meant nothing more than 	what you did, if your heart was full of anger, then you may be said 	to have replied to the goonda with the violence on your part. If you 	think over the meaning of whipping out the sandal from your       
 foot and throwing it at him or striking him a few times with the sandal in your hand and the goonda becoming cowed down, you will realize what you did. Since you resorted to physical force in a crowded square the other people also would take courage andthe goonda being a coward at heart, would be cowed down and run away. If taking off the sandal was a sign of compassion on your part then I would regard even your hitting the man with it as an act of ahimsa. Ahimsa has its roots in the heart. And its result should be that the other person submits, not to physical force, but to soul-force because he is overwhelmed by the power of compassion behind the physical punishment. I will give you an instance of this from my own life. Miss Schlesinlibtech_241_footnotelibtech_242_footnotein her folly started smoking a cigarette in my presence. I slapped her and threw away the cigarette. For the first time she cried before me and apologized and wrote to me afterwards saying that she would never do such a thing again and that she had recognized my love I have narrated this incident in my autobiography.libtech_243_footnotelibtech_244_footnoteThere have been many other similar incidents in my life. Others also may have similar experience about which we do not know. Did the goonda recognize the love in your heart? Do not be decided whether your action was inspired by violence or non-violence. Ordinarily whipping out sandals is no sign of culture or ahimsa. It is a sign of impulsiveness, that is, of lack of culture. But in your case, the action may have been a sign of ahimsa. Still you alone can testify which is the truth; or, may be God. However, after analysing your action in such detail, I only wish to compliment you. For I do not mind even if your action was violent. It is enough for me that you were not cowed down. I assume that you wish to cultivate ahimsa, and therefore, even if it was an act of violence, you will try and learn ahimsa from it. I, therefore, gladly gave your letter to every-body to read. Akha Bhagatlibtech_245_footnotehas said: “Live as you like but realize Hari anyhow.” Accordingly, if you learn to parctise pure truth and pure ahimsa even while living there I will believe that you have learnt more than what you would have by staying with me and learning them under my guidence.

  	You are now a widow. If you have learnt anything from me, there is 	no difference between a wife and a widow, truly understood, for 	sooner or later everyone has to die. The soul does not die. Marriage 	is not of bodies, and if it is [regarded as such] it is wrong. If 	one could marry a body, why don’t we marry a dead body or, say, a 	stone? A marriage takes place between two souls and the soul never 	dies.  	Moreover, you have your children. You should bring them up with care 	and lead an absolutely chaste life. If you conduct your life with 	restraint you will not feel any loss. In fact you will have gained 	something through the loss.

You yourself 	once wrote to me, didn’t you, that with the Sardar’s help you 	had acquired a house of your own.

  	I have your letter. The handwriting does not look like yours. If it 	is I will say you have improved it a lot.  	I don’t remember anything about any freedom I might have given you 	in regard to your mode of life there. If I did, you should have 	asked me to give it in writing. Human memory has ever been infirm. 	And [mine] has now become quite weak. I do remember, however, that 	whatever I might have said I qualified it with the condition that 	whatever you did should be with the consent of Chimanlal or 	Krishnachandra. That is because I do not have, nor do I want to 	have, any exclusive right. How could I then make any concession 	independently? Whatever I might have said earlier, make a note of 	what I am now writing and conduct yourself accordingly. I only wish 	your good. Now indeed you have realized that your upbringing had not 	been perfect. Whatever might have become aware of things. You cannot 	therefore behave irresponsibly on the strength of your wealth. 	Besides, the money that you have should be regarded as a sacred 	trust and spent accordingly. At the Ashram it  would become you to 	live in poverty as the others do; only then can you be 
 accommodated. You cannot spend your money in such a way that it corrupts others. I cannot tolerate it, nor should the Ashram. You should therefore sit down with Chimanlal and Krishnachandra and organize your life as they advise and make yourself one with the Ashram as sugar dissolves in milk. Only then will you be happy, and make your children happy too. It would not befit you to behave in any other way. Although Ratilal is alive, I am sure you never let yourself forget that you are as good as a widow. If you cannot act in this way, if you are made of an altogether different stuff, you had better leave promptly; go and live where it suits you.
 As I don’t know when I shall be reaching there, I have written at length. I know yours is a difficult task.

  	I have your letter. All your questions are such that you should find 	the answer there itself. For example, the problem of Harihar    
 Sharma. What should I—or could I—do about it from here? I realize it was a mistake on my part to have invited him to the Ashram. Even then I have included in my letterlibtech_260_footnotelibtech_261_footnoteto him all that you wrote. If you approve of this letter, pass it on to him. It was all right that you gave him coffee. Continue to give him some. If, however, we are required to give to all whatever is given to one, it will lead to the breakdown of the Ashram. Why, I should myself disband it. It is our duty to offer things according to a man’s needs. I have often said that the Ashram should be like a hotel. The difference is that the boarders in a hotel can ask for anything they like and on payment they get it. Whatever we would give a person taking into consideration his bodily needs should be in the nature of a medicine. If we give quinine to one man, can everone ask for it? We must not regard quinine and coffee from different angles. We have to offer rice to a South Indian, bread to a Punjabi, fish to a Bengali, beer and beef to an Englishman. It is another thing that we may not give meat and fish even as medicine, generally not even rice. But if we admit such persons then it becomes our dharma to let them have [what they need.] But we may offer all the four things to all four of them at the same time. Now meat and fish are out of the question, but how can we refuse to give wheat, rice, coffee, tea, etc., which we have once given? Think over all this and do as you deem proper.
 As for prayers, everywhere I am sticking to the old order, but if you think it right to have some change at the Ashram you may not make it. For that consult the old collegues like  Chimanlal,  Balvantsinha, etc., or postpone it till I reach there.
 I have written to Champabehnlibtech_262_footnote. I understand what you say about mango seeds, and also about dogs and mice.

  Apologizing 	for the delay in his address at the end of the prayers, Gandhiji 	told the audience how pleased he was that Kanu Gandhi had started 	the prayers without waiting for him. It 	should be the rule that prayers must not be delayed for  	anybody on earth. God’s time never stops. From the very beginning 	wheel of His time has gone ceaselessly on. As a matter of fact there 	is no beginning for Him or His time.  	God is not person. No one knows what His watch is like. No one can 	describe Him as no one has seen Him. He is the Law and the Law- 	giver combined into one. The author of the Vedas, after the 	profoundest search has described Him as neti, neti (not 	this, not this). He moves all and yet no one can move Him. Not a 	blade of grass moves without His will. For Him there is no begnning 	and no end.  	Everything that has a beginning must end. The sun, the moon and the 	earth must all perish one day even though it might be aftter an 	incalculable number of years. God alone is immortal, imperishable. 	How can man find words to describe Him? How can anyone afford to 	miss the time of offering prayers to Him whose watch never stops?    
 Kanu Gandhi knew all that and knew that any waiting for him would hurt. So he had started the prayers on time. Gandhiji had felt ashamed of disturbing the meeting by walking up to the dais when the prayer was going on. If others came late during the prayers he inwardly fretted: why did they not stand at the far end of the gathering instead of walking in and disturbing the meeting? He would have liked to wait outside but he knew that people were waiting for him. They might feel worried over his absence. Therefore, he had dared to walk to the dais and take his seat there though not without trembling. His car had not failed him. But he could not rudely tear himself away from his visitors.
 He wanted them all to learn a lesson from the incident. If they kept the time for the prayers the habit would be reflected in all that they did.
A man who works regularly in a systematic fashion never feels
 overworked or tired. He knows his limits and is able to do in fair time, all that he undertakes. It is not hard work that kills a man, but irregularity or lack of system.

173,"June 8, 1946",DURING MUSSOORIE SOJOURN,"
    
 During the prayer meeting in Mussoorie I suggested that the gay people of the place might well think of the poor among them, and make their living comfortable, clean and hygienic as also enable the poorest of all classes to find an abode where it would be possible for them to receive the benefit of the hill climate. Both the suggestions have been taken up with ethusiasm. An influential committee has been formed to carry out the idea of a dharmashala or musafarkhana. I write this note to suggest that much the most important things would be to have a committee of workers or even one worker who would make it his business to run the guest house in a becomig manner. Seeing that the place will be free of rent it will be no small task to choose the guests who may occupy the premises. Care will have to be taken to exclude those who are at all able to pay a reasonable rent. The visitors must be those who have nothing wherewith to pay. If the place is to be kept absolutely clean, there will have to be rules to be rigidly enforced in the interests of the visitors themselves. And yet the occupants will have to be treated with perfect courtesy. They must never be allowed to feel that poverty is a crime. Every third-class traveller knows that the poor receive rough treatment in the railway carriages and at railway stations. It is a sad commentary that in this
 poor country where according to books poverty carries with  it  a certain dignity, in public places the poor are treated almost with contempt and they are made to pay for receiving it. It is in this unfortunate atmosphere that this guest house is to be built. Let the committee seek out from now an ideal caretaker who will answer the requirements of the office which are undoubtedly onerous. If such a person is found, the project is bound to be a pattern for all such places on hill stations.

 I have discovered honourable members of Assemblies using  most expensive embossed note paper even for private use. So far as I know, office stationery cannot be used for private purposes such as writing to friends or relatives or for letters from members of Assemblies to constituents outside matters of public business. So far as I know, this a universal objection in every part of the world.
 But for this poor country my objection goes deeper. The stationery I refer to is too expensive of us. Englishmen belonging to the most expensive country in the world and who had to flourish on the awe they could inspire in us introduced expensive and massive buildings for offices and bungalows requiring for their upkeep an army of servants and hangers-on. If we copy their style and habits we will be ruined ourselves and carry the country in this ruin. And what was tolerated in the case of the conquerors will not be tolerated in ours. There is, too, paper shortage. I am of opinion, therefore, that all these expensive habits sohuld be given up.Hand-made paper with ordinarily printed letter-heads in Nagari and Urdu should be used.The embossed stationery already printed can easily be cut up and put to better use, and should not be used up under cover of economy. Surely village products cannot be made to wait till the expensive and possible foreign stuff is used up. Popular Governments should signalize their advent by adopting popular measures and inexpensive habits.

  Mahatma 	Gandhi held his last prayer meeting in Mussoorie this evening. He 	told the audience about the work that has been done in connection 	with two points raised by him, namely, erecting a dharmashala for 	the poor and building better quarter for the coolies.  As 	regards the latter, it had beeen decided that the project was too 	big for individual effort and that the U. P. Government should be 	approached. There were plenty of rich people lin Mussoorie; it was 	their duty to see that the coolies had better quarters.  As 	for the dharmashala, a committee had been formed and money 	collected. When the dharmashala would materialize rested with them, 	Gandhiji added. He had suggested that the dharmashala should be such 	that a person like him could stay there without any hesitation. All 	that was required was a clean well-ventilated building. He would 	much rather stay in a place built for the poor. Such a building 	would be an     
 inducement for him to come to Mussoorie again. Someone had taken exception to the word dharmashala. The critic said it meant a place for the Hindus only. That was not his conception. Hindus, Muslims Sikhs, Christians, Parsis, Jews—all should be able to come and stay there provided they were poor. They would have to cook thier own food. And so for Harijans, for him everybody was a Harijan. He had said that a religion which made distinctions of high and low was no religion. He had suggested that all of them should become Harijans voluntarily  and  among  Harijans  too, Bhangis. Lord Shiva was called Bhangilibtech_266_footnotebecause he had the intoxication of the good of the creation. Therefore by becoming Bhangis, they would become servants and lovers of humanity. The service rendered by the Bhangis was the most useful for humanity. So there could be no discrimination against Harijans in the dharmshala that was contemplated. Another friend had written to him that there were already several dharmashalas in Mussoorie, one for Arya Samajists, one for Sikhs and so on. Why add another when even those in existence lay vacant for most of the time because they were meant for one sect or another? The dharmashala of his conception would be open to all without any discrimination of caste, colour or creed. If they were not prepare for that he would advise them to dissolve the committee and return to their respective donors the money that had been collected .
 Friends had warned him against coming to Mussoorie, the seat of fashion and frivolity, Gandhiji contined. He did not grudge the amusement provided it was innocent. If their enjoyment was tainted, they would never be able to build the kind of place that he had suggested and keep it up. As such, they would have no time to think of the poor. The management of such a dharmashala would be even more difficult than building it. They would have to be ever watchful so that it served the purpose for which it was built. Otherwise, he would feel sorry for the money wasted. They had attended the prayers for several days. If they had really come to hear Ramanama in their hearts, they could certainly do what he had asked in the name of Rama and His creation. He also expected them to offer prayers in their own homes regularly, morning and evening. There was no need for them to learn the Sanskrit Shlokas if they did not wish to; Ramdhun was enough. The essence of all prayers was to establish God in their hearts. If they succeeded in doing that, all would be well with them, with the society and the world.

 NO PUBLICITY REQUIREDlibtech_267_footnote
 A Brahmin correspondent asks me to publish the fact that he has become a Harijan and wants to eliminate his name as a caste Hindu from the census too. This is a sequence to my having asked all caste Hindus to look upon themselves as Harijans of the so-called lowest stratum. But what is the point in giving publicity to an inner change? The real proof is for the convert to practise the change in his daily life. He will, therefore, mix freely with Bhangis and take an active part in their life. If possible, he will live with them or get a Bhangi to live with him. He will give his children in marriage to Harijans and on being questioned he will say that he has become a Harijan of his own free will and will register his name either as a Harijan or Bhangi in the census when he has to classify himself. But having done so he will on no account arrogate to himself any of the rights of Harijans as, for example, he will not enter his name as a voter on their list. In other words, he will undertake to fulfil all the duties of a Harijan without seeking any of the rights that pertain to them. So long As separate voting lists are maintained he will cease to be a voter.

 PETROL AND THE BLACK MARKETlibtech_268_footnote
A correspondent writes as follows:
 Owing to lack of time it is not always possible to do all the necessary touring by rail. Workers have, therefore, to travel long dis tances by car. As petrol is rationed and the required quantity is not available recourse is had to the black market. It is either bought through someone or the taxi-driver is commissioned to obtain it from the black market and payment per mile is given to him according to the price paid for the petrol.
 Is it right for workers to use a car under these circumstances?
 It is possible that if they do not, they will have to cut down their touring which will seemingly be harmful to the work. Am I right in believing that there is no alternative?
I am of opinion that the worker who believes in truth should not
 use a car under these conditions. Even if he is not a believer but tries to  render services thoughtfully he  should not do  so. If  he does he
 
 knowingly encourages black marketing and nothing but harm can come of such action. I go further and say that to use a car at all times for services is wrong in itself.

 DECIMAL COINAGE
 It seems that I inadvertently allowed to be printed in the last paragraph   of   Shri   K.   Mashruwala’s   articlelibtech_271_footnotelibtech_272_footnoteon   this   subject   the statement that a second instalment would follow showing how, if at all, decimal coinage without loss to the poor could be promulgated. As a matter of fact I do not think the time has come for a serious consideration of the contemplated reform. I am quite clear that however attractive any scheme of decimal coinage may be, it should not be considered before there is an independent national government. Therefore the publication of any such scheme is wholly premature.There are many more pressing, urgent problems occupying the best minds of the country. Surely the country can easily wait for a more fortunate moment for a proper understanding of a scheme  before legislation on the subject is undertaken. If England has waited for years and is still waiting, why should poor famishing India have a radical reform in courage sprung upon it without the man in the street being instructed in the pros and cons of the subject? It is not a matter which has nothing to be said against it. It will certainly not add one grain of corn to the existing stocks. Whether a rupee is to contain 100 cents or 64 pice is a problem that can await solution for a happier day. Democracy demands patient instruction on it  before  legislation. Hence I intended to erase the announcement of the second article in order to avoid raising a hope I had no desire to satisfy.

 I have been in your midst for several weeks with short breaks. It hurts me that you have not yet learnt to observe perfect silence  without being requested. It is an indication that Ramanama has not gone to your hearts. There is no power greater than God in the world.
 You would expect me to say something. I too wish to tell you something, but just as a cook never puts half-cooked dishes before guests, I too would not place before you things that are still half- cooked. This, however, I may tell you, that you must not give up hope till the last. We must realize that if we achieve nothing ultimately is because of our of own shortcomings. Nobody can prove himself right by pointing to others’ faults. We can improve ourselves by acknowledging our own faults. If I realize that I am crooked, I shall become straight. It will only be false pride if I fency that I am straight and the entire world is crooked. That is why I say that, if we achieve nothing, it will be because we do not deserve it. We have been carrying on this fight through non-violent means, but we could not generate enough power to induce others to play straight with us.
 We—Hindus and Muslims—I must say have been quarrelling amongst ourselves and if we look to the British to unite us it will be a great blot on our civilization. Who is a Hindu? Who is a Muslim? Why this distinction? Let us all pray to God that wisdom may dawn on us so that we may be united. If this happens we shall easily arrive at some settlement with the British. You must remember that this is being said
 
 
 today by the same man who had told you that, so long as the British remained, unity between the two of us would be difficult to achieve. But that was only a proclamation of ours weakness. I fail to see why we have become so mad, why we have become so uncivilized. But let us not despair. Leave it to God. Let destiny take its course. All will be well if God helps us.

181,"June 10, 1946",THE UNKNOWN,"
    
 Some learned men describe Him as Unknowable, some others as Unknown, yet others as ‘Not This’. ‘The Unknown’ is good for the present purpose.
 When yesterday (9th June) I said a few words to the prayer audience, I could say nothing more than that they should pray for and rely upon the strength and the guidance that this big X could give. There were difficulties to be overcome by all parties in the great Indian drama that was being enacted before them. They were all to rely upon the Unknown who had often confounded man’s wisdom and in the twinkling of an eye upset his tin-pot plans. The British party claimed to believe in God, the Unknown. The Muslim League did likewise. They delighted is saying  Allah-o-Akbarlibtech_275_footnotelibtech_276_footnote.  The Congress naturally had no single equivalent cry. Nevertheless, if it sought to represent the whole of India, it represented the millions of believers, no matter to what compartment in the House of God they belonged.
 At the time of writing, in spite of my irrepressible optimism, I am unable to say decisively that at least in political parlance, the thing is safe. All I can say, therefore, is that if, with the best efforts of all the parties, the unsafe happens, I would invite them to join with me in saying that it was as well and that safety lay in unsafety. If we are all children of God, as we are, whether we know it or not, we will take in good part whatever happens and work with zest and confidence for the next step whatever it may be. The only condition for that zest is that each party does its honest best for the good of the whole of India. For that is the stake and no other.

 Expressing his regret for the delay in attending the prayers Gandhiji said:
 Unfortunately owing to Maulana Saheb’s illness the Congress Working Committee meeting which was to be held here was held at his place. On momentous occasions like this it is necessary that as many members as possible should attend the meeting. Maulana Saheb’s presence, he being the President of the Congress, was absolutely essential. In order that we may not be deprived of his advice the meet ing was held at his residence. I could not, in spite of all efforts, disengage myself in time and was ten minutes late. Since the Divine Clock stops for no one’s sake, I am glad that the prayers were begun according to schedule without waiting for me.
 I am sorry that even on the third day I cannot give you any definite news whether the talkslibtech_285_footnoteon the British proposals have broken down or not. All I can say is that the Congress Working Committeelibtech_286_footnoteis striving its utmost to prevent a breakdown.
 As long as there is life there is hope too. It is easy to destroy but to build is a slow and labourious process. Besides, the prestige of the Cabinet Mission is at stake. They cannot afford a breakdown. If the aim of all the three parties, the Congress, the Muslim League and the Mission is the same, viz., the independence of India, the present dialogue should not end in failure. But we must be patient. The independence of 400 millions is no conjurer’s trick. The fact that the Congress Working Committee even at this stage is giving it the most serious consideration shows how anxious it is to avoid a breakdown, if it is humanly possible without sacrificing honour or the interests of India’s dumb millions. If, however, in spite of our efforts to avoid it the talks in the end do break down, we should not despair. Those who have faith in God will leave the result to Him. In the event of a breakdown I shall report it to you without reservation and in the plainest of words.

  	From you, almost straight away, I went to the Working Committee 	which, owing to his illness, was held at Maulana Saheb’s quarters. 	I gave them the gist of our conversation, told them that I gladly 	endorsed your suggestion about the parties meeting to fix up names 	subject to the provison that no party should talk of parity,libtech_290_footnotelibtech_291_footnoteyou 	should invite them simply to submit to you a joint list of the 	Cabinet of the Provisional Interim Government which you would 	approve or, if you did not, you would invite them to submit a 	revised list bearing in mind your amendments, that the list should 	represent a coalition Government composed of persons of proved 	ability and incorruptibility. I suggested too that in the place  of  	parity there should be active enforcement of the long-term provision 	in your joint Statementlibtech_292_footnotelibtech_293_footnotethat 	  in   all   major   communal   issues   there   should   be 	communal voting to decide them. I suggested also that in the event 	of absence of agreement between the parties in spite of all effort, 	you should examine the merits of the respective lists of the two 	parties and accept either the one or the other (not an amalgam) and 	announce the names of the Interim Government but that before that 	final step was taken you should closet yourselves until a joint list 	was prepared. I told the Working Committee that you had seemed to 	endorse my suggestions. I 	told them further that, so far as I knew, it was a point of     
 honour with Congressmen that there could be no joint consultation in which Maulana Saheb was not associated with the talks. You said it was a sore point with Quaid-e-Azam Jinnah and I replied that the soreness was wholly unwarranted and that the Congress could not be expected to sacrifice its faithful servant of twenty-five years’ standing whose self-sacrifice and devotion to the national cause had never been in question. But I told you that your great experience and ability to handle delicate matters would show you the way out of the difficulty.
 Finally, I told the Committee that I drew your attention to the fact that the European vote which was being  talked  of  was unthinkable, in connection with the Constituent Assembly and nothing but a public declaration by the European residents of India or one by you on their behalf could make possible the formation of the Constituent Assembly. I gathered from you that the question was already engaging your attention and that it should be satisfactorily solved.
 Probably you have already moved in the matter of the joint talk. Nevertheless, I thought that I owed it to you and the Working Committee to put on record what I had reported about our talks. If I have in any way misunderstood you, will you please correct me?
 I may say that the Working Committee had its draft letter ready but at my suggestion it postponed consideration of it pending the final result of your effort adumbrated in this letter. The draft letter takes the same view that I placed before you yesterday on parity and the European vote and their election as members of the contemplated Constituent Assembly.
 I close with the hope that your effort will bear the fruit to which all are looking forward.
 Yours sincerely,

The article is headed“Slow Motion”. “Deliberation, wariness, sobriety in an approach to great decisions are proper; but not swither and loquacity or delays due to mere tactical manoeuvring.” All this is a prelude to what I consider an unwarranted attack on the Congress. If you of the Mission and the Viceroy share the view, you should really have no dealings with the Congress, however powerful or representative it may be. Naturally you should be the sole judges of what the Congress has appeared to you to be like.
 
 For my part, as a detached observer, as I hold myself to be, I think that the Congress has not been procrastinating. It has been extraordinarily prompt in its dealings in connection with the work of the high mission which you are shouldering. But my purpose  in writing this letter is to tell you that it will be wrong on my part if I advise the Congress to wait indefinitely until the Viceroy has formed the Interim Government or throws up the sponge in despair. Despair he must, if he expects to bring into being a coalition Government between two incompatibles. The safest, bravest and the straightest course is to invite that party to form a government which, in the Vice- roy’s estimation, inspires greater confidence. Then there is a possi- bility within 24 hours of forming a National Government. If, how- ever, no party inspires confidence such a declaration should be made and the Viceroy should run the Government in the best way he knows. But the Congress Working Committee should not be delayed indefinitely. As for me, I would gladly stay behind if you want me to. But I feel that I shall be a useless adviser. I can only advise out of the fulness of trust. I become paralysed when distrust chokes me.
 I am sorry to send you this letter. But I would be an unworthy friend if I disguised my feelings. You should know me as I am. Hence these tears.libtech_304_footnote

  June 	12, 1946  Gandhiji 	began his after-prayer 	address by introducing 	Khwaja Abdul Majid to the 	audience as an old and dear friend of his. He recalled how during 	the Khilafat days  he had once stayed at Khwaja Saheb’s house. 	Swami Satyadevji was with him. He was 	an orthodox 	Hindu and would not eat 	or drink 	from a Mussalman’s 	hands. Khwaja Saheb 	had employed 	a Brahmin 	to render 	all those 	services to 	him. It 	had affected 	Swamiji   deeply.

 movement and take to khadi and he had stuck to it ever since. There were many such great men in the various communities. This treasure of goodness did not lessen by exercising goodness in all walks of life.
 Referring to the political situation he said he was still not ready to say anything. There was, however, one thing to which he was free to draw their attention. He had called the Cabinet plan good and he still held to his opinion with the interpretation he put upon it.
The Constituent Assembly has to be formed by the elected
 members of the Provincial Legislatures. The Government of India Act of 1935 has given a number of seats in the Legislatures to the Europeans. For instance, in Bengal alone there is a solid block of 25 Europeans. In Assam there are 9. Quite a number of them are multi- millionaires or their representatives. They are foreigners, members of the ruling race. As such they can have no place in the Constituent Assembly as candidates, nor can they as voters return members. The Cabinet plan has said clearly that Indians are to form India’s constitution.
 Lawyer friends had told Gandhiji that if the matter were taken to a law-court the verdict would surely be against the Europeans. But from the papers he had gathered that they intended to exercise the right, which they thought they had.libtech_306_footnoteTill now they had used their vote to uphold the British power and acted as a wedge between the Hindus and the Mussalmans. He appealed to them, therefore, apart from the question of legalities, to abstain from interference. No Congressman would wish to drag them to the law-court. They should recognize the signs of the time and make a voluntary declaration that the newspaper report was wrong and that they had no wish to interfere   in the affairs of Indians which ought to be settled by Indians themselves and that they would not exercise their votes for the selection of candidates for the Constituent Assembly, nor would they stand as candidates. They should no longer impose themselves upon India. Whatever they might have done in the past, they should alleviate communal bitterness, not accentuate it. They should wish India to win her freedom as early as possible. Such a statement would be graceful for the Europeans.
 It was up to the Cabinet Mission and the Viceroy, concluded Gandhiji, to see that this foreign element was not used to affect the elections in any way whatsoever.

193,"June 13, 1946",MUCH IN LITTLE,"
    
 In Mr. Mahadev Desai’s book on the Travancore Temple Entry Proclamation, I find your speeches made in several places in Travancore. You have spoken of the Ishopanishad and said that if the first verse alone survived and all the rest of the Hindu scriptures were destroyed, it would alone save religion from extinction. Perhaps you know that that verse was a turning point in the life of Devendranath Tagore, the Poet’s father. Young Devendranath was in a mood of great depression when his father died leaving the family estate highly encumbered. One day while in this mood a piece of printed paper was wafted by a passing breeze to where he was sitting, he picked it up. It was in Sanskrit which he had not learnt then. He took it to the family pundit who read it out. It was the first verse of the Ishopanishad. “Nectar poured into my soul,” says the Maharshi in his autobiography.
 The phrase about enjoying by renunciation puzzled me for long. One day (or night to be correct) it flashed on me that the phrase but expressed a daily experience. What greater enjoyment is there than renouncing something one values to one— person or cause—which one hods dear.
 The above letter from Shri K. Natarajan was received by me about three months ago. I had hoped to deal with it in these columns much earlier but could not. Nothing, however, is lost, for the subject- matter of the letter is an evergreen. I try to the utmost of my ability to live the meaning that, in my ungrammatical way, I have ascribed to the shloka. Not being a reader of books, I never knew the instance that Shri Natarajan quotes from Maharshi Devendra’s life. It fortifies my belief that the first mantra of Ishopanishad is all that undiluted Hinduism—in other words, for me, religion—can have to give. The recitation of the 18 chapters of the Gita is finished in one week at the morning prayer and so it has gone on now for some years from week to week. The Gita is a commentary on the first verse of the Ishopanishad. And I feel, not without diffidence, that  the interpretation that flashed on Shri Natarajan’s mind reveals but the partial truth. As I understand it, his interpretation is only the well-worn doctrine of self-sacrifice which is undoubtedly a common enough experience. Take only one instance. Many a mother sacrifices all for her children. But the mantra referred to here was not revealed to confirm the truth of that practice, well known even during the remote times when it is said to have been given. To live up to that verse means the new birth enunciated in the New Testament, or Brahmasamarpana (dedication to God) as taught in Hinduism. The verse, therefore, seems to me to mean only one thing. Recognize that everything you fancy
 everything you fancy you have is God’s and from God and take only what you really need for life. In other words, in the language of the Gita it teaches the doctrine of uttermost detachment. Then only is life worth living.

A correspondent writes:
 Supposing that in a Government or private godown foodgrains are being allowed to rot while people are starving because none are available in the market, what are workers to do? Would it be permissible  to  resort  to something in the nature of your Dharasana salt raid in order to save the people? Otherwise, what alternative is there to either looting or dying like dumb cattle, of both of which you disapprove?
A. It should be common cause that looting in itself can never
 do any good. Wherever it is claimed to have done so, the good consisted only in drawing the attention of the authority to a crying want. The way of voluntary fasting that I have suggestedlibtech_307_footnotelibtech_308_footnoteis the most efficient because it is good in itself and good also as an effective demonstration. It is good in itself because the people who voluntarily fast exhibit strength of will which saves them from the pangs  of hunger and wakes up public conscience as also that of the authority, assuming that the latter can have any conscience at all.
 So far as the Dharasana salt raidlibtech_309_footnoteis concerned, apart from the fact that there were, according to my conception of it, several mistakes made, it was a perfect thing of its kind and a heroic struggle in which the sufferings undergone were bravely borne. But the distinction between it and loot should be clearly borne in mind. The Dharasana Salt Works were conceived to be national property.The intention there was not to seize the property by force. The fight was to assert the right of the nation to the possession of all salt yielded by land or sea in India. If the raid had succeeded, that is to say, if the Government had yielded, they would have done so to the nation’s sufferings which the raid and the like involved. And, as a matter of fact, the sum total of the sufferings undergone by the people on a nation-wide scale did result
 
 in what is known as the Irwin-Gandhi Pactlibtech_310_footnotelibtech_311_footnote. Thus it will be seen that between the loot that the correspondent has in  mind  and  the Dharasana raid there is no analogy whatsoever.

I did not share their view because we have known each other for so many years.

 Sudhir told me something of the storm that is brewing within you. I met your good wife the day before.
 I would ask you not to worry. You are handling the most diffi- cult task of your life. As I see it the Mission is playing with fire. If you have courage you will do what I suggested from the very begin- ning. Even when the Parliamentary Delegation camelibtech_320_footnotebefore you   I said then, “You will not be able to have your cake and eat it. You will have to choose between the two—the Muslim League and the Con- gress, both your creations.” Every day you pass here coquetting now with the Congress, now with the League and again with the Congress, wearing yourself away. [This] will not do. Either you swear by what is right or by what the exigencies of British policy may dictate In either case bravery is required. Only stick to the programme. Stick to your dates even though the heavens may fall. Leave by the 16th whether you allow the Congress to form a coalition or the League. If you think that the accumulated British wisdom must know better than these two creations of yours I have nothing to add. But I have fancied that you are not cast in the mould. If so, keep to your passage for the 16th and take your poor wife with you to England and bury yourselves in private life unless the brave British announcement made is fulfilled to the Indian hope.

MEETINGlibtech_322_footnote","
    
 NEW DELHI,
 June 13, 1946
 
 Remarking on the size of the prayer gathering on Thursday evening, which was large than usual, Mahatma Gandhi in the course of his speech asked whether it was due to the fact that he had spoken on a political topic on Wednesday and they had come in the expectation of satisfying their curiosity as regards the political situa- tion. If that was so, it was wrong. The only urge which should prompt people to come to the prayer gathering was the desire to know the Maker and attune themselves with Him.
 On Wednesday, Gandhiji said, he had criticized the conduct of the European Group for wanting to exercise a right which did not legitimately belong to them, but today he proposed to say something in criticism of “our own conduct and behaviour”. He had been telling his audiences what their duty was in this hour. As a firm believer in the utility of community prayer, he had been making them sing Ramdhun in the mass. But were they following it in their daily lives? To repeat Ramanama and to follow the way of Ravana in actual practice was worse than useless. It was sheer hypo- crisy. One might deceive oneself or the world but one could not deceive the Almighty.
Today, in the West people talk of Christ, but it is really Anti
 Christ that rules their lives. Similarly, there are people who talk of Islam but they really follow the way of Satan. It is a deplorable state of affairs.
 We are afraid of people professing religions other than our own. We think that they will crush us, forgetting that no one can crush us if we have made God our refuge. The hymn that has just been sung describes how God has redeemed sinners. How much more, then, would He do for His devotees? But they must be devotees of God in the true sense of the term.
 If people followed the way of God, continued Gandhiji, there would not be the corruption and profiteering that were seen in the world today. As it was, the rich were becoming richer and the poor poorer. Hunger, nakedness and death stared one in the face. These were not the marks of the Kingdom of God but that of Satan, Ravana or Anti-Christ. They could not expect to bring the reign of God on earth by merely repeating His name with the lips. Their conduct must conform to His ways instead of Satan’s.

  June 	14, 1946  Mahatma 	Gandhiji said that he still could not tell them what was taking 	place behind the scenes. But he wanted to say that the Cabinet 	Mission and the Viceroy were working away at it from morning till 	night. They were attempting what could well be considered 	impossible.  	I have often written that true Hindu-Muslim unity cannot be expected 	while the third party is there. The slaves and their master are both 	in an unnatural state. They cannot act and think naturally.  	But suppose a mother sees that her child is dying, still she does 	not give up hope. She keeps on trying the prescriptions of vaidyas 	or hakims till the last moment.  	Similarly the Mission does not wish to give up striving. They are 	trying to bring the Congress and the League togetjer.  They  are 	striving with the Europeans to do the right thing. The Europeans 	have said they are going to exercise their right, which is not 	theirs at all. But if the Congress and the League appealed to them 	they might consider their request. There is no question of going to 	them with the beggar’s bowl. They have no place in the Constituent 	Assembly according to the legal interpretation of the Cabinet 	Mission’s paper.  	To enslave another country is unnatural. Merely by making up a pious 	resolve they will not get off India’s back. The British cannot 	succeed in doing so. Corresponding action is required. They are 	striving and there is no reason for India to doubt their bona 	fides. Their task is difficult. The Congress, the League and the 	British are all labouring under unnatural conditions.  The 	Hindustan Times, 	15-6-1946, and Harijan, 	23-6-1946         	We are afflicted by many superstitions, obsessions and 	halucinations. They are entirely the creation of the mind, but so 	long as they are not exorcized they continue to afflict us. We may 	take for     
 a snake a piece of rope and dislocate our wrist in striking at it. Similarly, we may take a non-poisonous snake for a poisonous one and lose a friend by ignorantly destroying it. Who has not heard stores of people mistaking a respectable citizen for a thief and killing him in a paroxysm of fear? Instances of Harijans being foolishly held responsible for the outbreak of plague in villages and being lynched for it are unfortunately not uncommon. In the same way I would regard it as the height of superstitious ignorance for educated people or students to refuse admission in hostels to Harijans.  In  this connection I would particularly invite the attention of all students and superintendents of hostels to the leaflet issued over the signatures of Shris Parikshitlal Majmudar and Hemantkumar Nilkanth for their careful perusal, reflection and action. In that leaflet they seem to have made an exception in the case of hostels which are specially reserved for certain castes and sub-castes. In my opinion, even in these hostels Harijans ought to be freely admitted if only to prove that those castes or sub-castes have banished untouchability from their minds  for  good.

CONGRESS DONE?libtech_325_footnote","
    
A Harijan from Gujarat writes:
 The elections have made it clear that only two parties count in India today, the Muslim League and the Congress. The elections have also shown that most of the Harijans are with the Congress. The Ambedkarites have won very few seats. What is the place of Congress Harijans in the Congress? Why are not Harijan candidates made to stand for election to the various committees of the Congress? When they do stand, why are caste Hindus allowed to oppose them? Is it right to keep Harijans out on the plea that the caste Hindus are more capable? The Congress has been working for the Harijans for a long time. Why has it not yet succeeded in educating them sufficiently and making them capable?
 There is ignorance and sting in this letter. They are excusable. We should understand the spirit behind it. The very fact that the Congress has won so many Harijan seats shows that it must have
 
 served them to win their confidence. They form an indivisible part of Hindu religion and Hindu society. If this part breaks or leaves the Hindu religion or Hindu society, the latter would perish. What the writer wants to say is that the caste Hindus have not done their duty towards the Harijans to the extent that they should have. If the caste Hindus would become Bhangis of their own free will, the distinction between Harijans and caste Hindus would automatically disappear. There are various divisions amongst the Harijans too. They should all go. All should be of one caste, that is, the Bhangi. A Bhangi is the servant of the whole of humanity, not only of the Hindus. When we become Bhangis of this description all divisions would disappear. Who can be master where all are servants?
 But today it is a mere dream, it is an objective. But no Society can exist on mere dreams or objectives. It must be solid work. The Congress makes no distinction of caste and creed. It must pull up those who are down in the dumps and those who are up in the air must come own. Thus the golden mean would be found. People cannot live in the bowels of the earth or in the sky. They all must live on the fair earth. Equality of all is the Congress pledge. Congress  has  not fulfilled it as yet. The columns of the Harijan show that so long as it is not fulfilled the Harijans would have every cause to complain.
 To the correspondent I would say this. To whom does he owe the ability to write this letter in a good hand? Which organization has done more for the Harijans than the Congress? It is true that the Congress has not done all it should. Much remains. Equally true is the fact that none has done as much as the Congress. Therefore, the Harijans must be patient. There is no doubt that there is a limit to one’s patience. But the limit has not been reached.

A correspondent writes:libtech_327_footnote
 If what the writer says is true, it is indeed, in one sense, a matter of shame for every Hindu. But no sin can be wiped out by mere condemnation by word of mouth. Nor does the guilt of the whole body absolve the individual from his duty. Therefore, in my opinion, the responsibility of working for the reform rests, in the first instance, on the correspondent, secondly on the people of the place where the animal sacrifices are held, then on the Ruler of the State and his people and after them in turn on Karnataka, Madras Presidency and the whole of India. Only if all, in their respective places, take up the work systematically—and systematic work can only succeed if run on the basis of non-violence—can the evil that has been handed down through the ages be wiped out of existence.
 Therefore, it is the correspondent who must  make  the beginning. I have written enough previously as to how the work of reform should be undertaken.

 BHANGI STRIKES
 The same writer, who has asked the question about the propriety of looting,libtech_328_footnoteasks also what the poor sweeper is to do when everything else fails. He indignantly asks:
 Is the Bhangi to continue his service on starvation wages, living in dirt and squalor?
A.    The question is appropriate. I claim that in such cases the
 proper remedy is not a strike but a notice to the public in general and the employing corporation in particular that the Bhangis must give up the sweeping service which consigns those reserved for that service to
 
 a life of starvation and all it means. There is a wide distinction between  a strike and an entire discontinuation (not suspension) of service. A strike is a temporary measure in expectation of relief. Discontinuance is giving up of a particular job because their is no expectation of relief. Proper discontinuance presupposes fair notice on the one hand and prospect of better wages and freedom from squalor and dirt on the other. This will wake up society from its disgraceful slumber resul ting in a proper scavenging of the over-growth that has smothered public conscience. At a stroke the Bhangis will raise scavenging to a fine art and give it the status it should have had long ago.
 UNLAWFUL PEEP BEYOND
 Q.	“Ah, Christ that it were possible For one short hour to see
 The souls we loved, that they might tell us What and where they be.”
 What would you say?
 A. The poet expresses in the above the cry of many  an  anguished heart. Nevertheless the truly detached mind does not care to know the beyond. In other words, it is wrong to have the desire. Therefore, the following from the well-known hymn of Cardinal New- man represents the reality:
 “I do not ask to see the distant scene, One step enough for me.”

           NEW 	DELHI, 
  June 	16, 1946  Mahatma 	Gandhi said that in the 	announcementlibtech_334_footnotelibtech_335_footnotethat he 	had sent 	invitations to 	14 individuals by 	their names to 	help him 	to form 	his Cabinet, 	His Excellency 	the Viceroy 	had stated 	that his attempts 	to bring 	the two major parties 	together having failed 	he had to devise 	some way of removing 	the deadlock.libtech_336_footnoteThe failure 	was nothing 	 to be surprised at.  	What is surprising is that instead of following the democratic 	procedure of inviting the one or the other party to form a national 	government, the Viceroy and the Cabinet Mission have decided to 	impose a government of their choice on the country. The result may 	well be an incompatible and explosive mixture. There are, however, 	two ways of looking at a picture. You can look upon it from the      
 bright side or you can look upon it from the dark.
 Gandhiji has declared that he believes in looking at the bright side and has invited others to do likewise.
Thus regarded, what appear to be blemishes in the Viceregal
statement, would be seen to be really its beauty.
 It might however be, that there was no bright side. Then the Mission would stand exposed. They would lose nothing by trusting. He had suggested to the Working Committee somelibtech_337_footnotetests by which the Statement might be tested.libtech_338_footnoteHe held the view firmly that fulfilment of those conditions was essential for the Congress acceptance. But he could not say whether they would be agreeable to either party. It was, therefore, very difficult to say with certainty what the Congress Working Committee would decide. One thing, however, he could say without hesitation. At no stage had the Congress showed any dilatoriness. It was a democratic organization and could not carry things by an executive fiat like the Viceroy for instance. It could proceed only by consulting and satisfying even the weakest minority whom it claimed to represent.
 You should bear with the Mission too. They have inherited the traditions of Imperialism which they cannot outgrow all at once. And poor India has to suffer. We must not blame them, however, for not throwing it overboard overnight. Let us trust their bona fides Let us not act upon mere suspicion. But let us all join in the prayer that God may bless all the parties with wisdom and cleanness of heart.libtech_339_footnote

 The League being avowedly a Muslim organization could not include any non-Muslim representative in its list; (2) the Congress as a nationalist organization must have the right to include a Congress Muslim in its list; (3) the League could not have any say in the selec-
 
 tion of any names outside those belonging to its quota of  five Muslims. This would mean that, in the event of a vacancy occurring among the seats allotted to the minorities, the Congress alone would have the right to select names to fill up the vacancies as it claimed to represent all sections by right of service; and (4) in action, the Interim Government should be regarded as being responsible to the elected representatives in the Assembly.libtech_342_footnote

211,"June 17, 1946",THE EUROPEAN VOTE,"
    
 No less a person than the President of the European Association has exhibited the lion’s paw.libtech_343_footnotelibtech_344_footnoteThat seems to be the naked truth. That the Europeans will neither vote nor offer themselves for  election should be a certainty, if a Constituent Assembly worthy of the name is at all to be formed. The British power in India has four arms—the official military, the official civil, the unofficial civil and the unofficial military. So when the ruling class speaks of the unofficial European as not being under their control, it is nonsense. The official exists for the unofficial. The former would have no work if the latter did not exist. The British gunboat came in the wake of British commerce.  The whole of India is an occupied country. We have to examine in this light the exploits of the European President. In the intoxication of power he does not seem to have taken the trouble to ascertain whether the State Paper has provided for the legal power for his community to vote or be voted for in the proposed Constituent Assembly. For his and his constituents’ edification I have secured the opinion from the leader of the Bar in Delhi. It will be found in these columns.libtech_345_footnote
 Did the President condescend to inquire of the Mission what his moral and legal position was? Or, did he hold them cheap because he represented the real Imperialism which the Cabinet Mission and the Viceroy representing British Labour were struggling to discard?
 
 It is the straw which shows the way the wind is blowing.
 This unseasonable performance of the European Association is to my mind the greatest disturbing factor to shake the faith in the reality of the Mission work. Has the Mission come before its time? Will the gun-protected Europeans of India silence their guns and stake their fortunes Andrews-like, purely on the goodwill of the masses of India? Or, do they expect in their generation to continue  the imposition of foreign rule on India?
 How can they say they“are not intransigent”? The statement reeks of intransigence. They have a loaded communal franchise, glaringly in Bengal and Assam. What right had they to be in the Assemblies at all? What part have they played in the two Assemblies save to embarrass the people of Bengal and Assam by dividing the communities? This ‘load’ was not imposed upon them. It would have redounded to their honour if they had repudiated it. Instead, they welcomed the ‘white man’s burden’. And even now, at the hour of the dawn, they would graciously contribute to constitution-making! ! ! Not everyone who says ‘I am not intransigent’ is really so; he only is who says nothing but lets his deeds eloquently speak for themselves.
 They have been made to look so foolish in their latest statementlibtech_346_footnoteas to say that they would refrain from voting for themselves but would use their vote for electing their henchmen wearing the Indian skin! They would, if they could, repeat the trick which has enabled them, a handful, to strangle the dumb millions of India. How long will this agony last! Do the Mission propse to bolster up this unholy ambition and yet expect to put to sea the frail barque of their Constituent Assembly? Indians cannot perform the obvious duty of the Mission for them.

 You have to conceal nothing. Tell him he has surpassed himself (which I feel I did) in trusting against himself the Mission’s word and looking at the bright side wherever it was not dark on the face of it.

 Congress is a national organization and it should not give up its national character. In view of that character it must have a right to put forward its claim to suggest names of six Congressmen in the list of fourteen. Amongst the Congressmen there must be one nationalist Muslim and one woman.
 In my opinion no [healthy] precedent can be established so  long as the communal ratio is insisted on in [forming] the Cabinet. If the Congress asks for representation for six of members it has every right to do so. Congressmen will not be joining the Cabinet in their individual capacity.
 In conclusion I can only say that the Congress will lose prestige if it ceases to have a national character.

215,"June 	18, 1946",SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING,"
          NEW 	DELHI, 
  June 	18, 1946  The 	expectant crowd that attended Mahatma Gandhi’s evening prayer 	today was again sorely disappointed when he told them that he had 	nothing decisive to tell them as to the result of the talks Maulana 	Azad had with the Cabinet Mission. A 	  man   of   prayer  must,  however,  know   no  disappointment  	because he knows that the times are in His hands who is the Arch- 	planner and does everything in His  good  time.  A  man  of  prayer, 
 therefore, waits in faith and patience always.
 Making the theme of his after-prayer discourse the song that had been sung at the prayers, he explained how that song gave the allegorical story of the struggle between the elephant king (Gajendra) and the Graha (the alligator).
It is taken from the classical episode of “Gajendra Moksha”
 from the Bhagavata. The original is a piece of rare poetical merit, combining as it does the melodious music of verse with loftiness of the sentiment which it embodies. That is the test of all great pieces of art. I must combine beauty with use. Cattle might be satisfied with filling their bellies with fooder but man likes his food to please the eye as well as provide nourishment.
 In the allegory of Gajendra and Graha the elephant king is seized unawares by the crocodile as he goes to have a drink of water in the river and is dragged down. The more he struggles the deeper he sinks. A stage is, however, reached when despairing of his physical prowess he throws himself on God’s grace entirely and invokes his aid and the Lord of Dwarka comes in the twinkling of an eye and rescues him.
 The moral of the story is that God never fails His devotees in the hour of trial. The condition is that there must be a living faith and the uttermost reliance on Him. The test of faith is that having done our duty we must be prepared to welcome whatever He may send—joy as well as sorrow, good luck as well as bad luck. We will be like King Janaka who, when informed that his capital was ablaze, only remarked that it was no concern of his.libtech_353_footnotelibtech_354_footnoteThe secret of his resignation and equa nimity was that he was ever awake, never remiss in the performance of his duty. Having done his duty, he could leave the rest to God.
 And so a man of prayer will in the first place be spared mishaps by the ever merficul Providence, but if mishaps do come he will not bewail his fate nor lay the blame on God but bear it with an  undistrubed peace of mind and joyous resignation to His will.

          NEW 	DELHI, 
  June 	19, 1946  	If I were appointed dictator for a day in the place of the Vice- 	roy, I would stop all newspapers.  He 	added with a smile and a wink: With 	the exception of Harijan of course.  Incidentally 	he remarked that if he had to rename his weekly he would call it not 	Harijan but 	“Bhangi” i. e., sweeper, that being more in tune with his 	present temper and the need of the hour as he understood it.  Deprecating 	these reportslibtech_356_footnoteas 	irresponsible and mischievous, he reminded the fraternity of the 	Press of Cardinal Newman’s hymn: “Lead Kindly Light”, the 	Gujarati rendering of which was sung at the prayers. Contrary to the 	teaching of that hymn they always hankered after the “distant 	scene”, letting their fertile imagination supply what was beyond 	their ken of knowledge. As an illustration of the infinite harm that 	might result from such irresponsible journalism, he remarked that, 	if the people were to believe what had been appearing in the Press 	about his part in the deliberations of the Working Committee, Hindus 	would be right to execrate him as the enemy of their interests. It 	was further being made to appear, he observed, that his was the only 	intransigent voice in the Working Committee. He wanted them to 	dismiss all that as pure imagination. He appealed to newspapermen to 	put a curb on their pen. Failing that it was up to the public to 	shed their craving for ‘potted’ news and to cease to patronize 	papers that purveyed it or at least cease to be misled by what might 	appear in them.   
 Gandhiji remarked that it was wholly untrue that the delay in arriving at a final decision was due to divisions in the Working Committee. Differences of opinion were inevitable in a living organization. He himself did not know what the final decision of the Working Committee was going to be. It was but natural that there should be more Hindus on the Congress register than Muslims, as the Hindu population preponderated in India. But the Congress could not by any stretch of imagination be called a Hindu organization. Its President Maulana Azad had occupied the Presidential chair for a longer period than any other in the Congress history. He was held in equal respect by all those who claim to be of the Congress. The Congress had constituted itself into a trustee, not of any particular community, but of India as a whole. In an organization like that it always became the duty of the majority to make sacrifices for the minorities and backward sections, not in a spirit of patronizing favour, but in a dignified manner and as a duty.
In the eyes of the Congress, Hindus and Mussalmans, Parsis,
 Christians and Sikhs are all Indians and therfore equally entitled to its care. The Congress has no sanction except that of non-violence. Unlike the Viceroy, who has the entire armed force of the British Empire at his back, the Congress President can rely only on the united and whole-hearted co-operation of all the communities and classes to give effect to India’s will to independence. The Working Committee is, therefore, anxious that we should accept responsibility at the Centre only with the unanimous goodwill of all the communities. That is why they were giving such anxious thought to all the various interests which they claim to represent. They have to adjust conflicting claims and interests and that is a ticklish job. They do not want to make the Interim Government an arena of unseemly quarrels among themselves or with members of the Muslim League.

There were two kinds of curiosity, he remarked—healthy and 	unhealthy. One should always be curious to know one’s duty at 	every step. But the itch for news was a kind of mental dissipation 	debilitating to the mind and spirit, unless it was properly curbed.

 IMITATION
 Q. You have averred that a person who gives  up  eating  meat  in  mere imitation of you cannot be said to be doing the right thing. Are you not wrong in holding this view?
A.  I see nothing wrong in what I said.libtech_361_footnoteIf a person may change
 his practice in imitation, it is equally possible for him to revert to the original practice in imitation.libtech_362_footnoteThe gist of what I said was that nothing should be done without being well weighed and thought out and without deep conviction. Thoughtless imitation is the sport of little minds and may lead a man into a ditch with disastrous results.
 HARIJAN COLLECTIONS
 Q. You collect funds for Harijans wherever you go. According  to  Press  reports, you sometimes receive large sums for that purpose. What is the total amount that you have collected? How is it spent? Are the accounts inspected or audited by anyone? I do not mean to suggest that the funds are being misused, but it ill becomes you to keep the people in the dark about these things.
A. The question hardly calls for a reply. But there must be
 many uninformed people like the correspondent. By itself the question is legitimate. The answer is simple. All Harijan collections made by me are handed over to the Harijan Sevak  Sangh.  Shri Thakkar Bapa is the guardian of the fund. It is spent according to the direction and with the sanction of the Harijan Sevak Sangh. Some of it is spent according to my instructions, but it has to be for the service of the Harijans only. Similarly for other funds, donations are sent to be spent at my discretion. Strict account is kept of every pie and the income and expenditure accounts are duly audited and certified from time to time.libtech_363_footnote
 WHY THIS ANTIPATHY?
 Q. Simple-minded Jains take you for a Jain, and you are not ashamed to be regarded as such. And yet, you seem studiously to shun the very mention of Mahavira in the columns of

  Friday, 	June 21, 1946  	The rule should be that during the prayers everyone should sit with 	closed eyes and think of nothing but God.

I cannot tell you about the Working Committee’s deliberations even 	today. You should forget about it. The only curiosity worth having 	is to know God and have real knowledge.  	You must be all anxious to have news of India’s Jawahar (jewel) 	and of the treatment meted out to him in Kashmir. Some say he has 	been injured, some say he has been insulted and so on. You should 	believe none of these reports A telegram has been received during 	the session of the Working Committee today saying that he is well 	and cheerful. I am not yet in a position to give my estimate of the 	situation arising out of the action taken by Pt. Jawaharlal or the 	Kashmir Government. For that I must meet and hear Pt. Jawaharlal 	first and know the story of the Kashmir Government’s doings.  	Though now a prisoner of the Kashmir Government Panditji is 	certainly under the Congress discipline.

Therefore, his presence in Delhi  is     report. 
 most essential at the present juncture. The Working Committee cannot take the momentous decisions on the problems with which it is faced in his absence, if his presence could be secured. The pillar of the Congress is held up in Kashmir. What can Maulana Azad do? He does not control the army or the reins of the government. He has no authority except being a prime servant of the Congress. The Congress President has, therefore, sent Pandit Nehru a wire through the Kashmir Government to return to Delhi. The Maulana Saheb has also sent a message to the Viceroy to put him in telephonic communication with Panditji and, if permitted by the Kashmir Government, also to make arrangements for his quickest return to Delhi.The Viceroy has already contacted the Resident in Kashmir with instructions to send Panditji to Delhi. His arrival is awaited for taking decisions of far reaching consequences.
 The Working Committee is anxious to come to a decision on the formation of the Interim Cabinet as soon as possible after thoroughly considering all the pros and cons. If the Congress were to help the Viceroy form the proposed Government which is suicidal to its interests what would be the worth of its 60 years’ standing? Short of committing suicide the Congress is offering every possible co- operation in the formation of the Interim Government.
 News has come that the railway strike has been put off for the time being. It is wrong if the railwaymen think that the Congress has stood idly by during the crisis. The Congress has been active behind the scene.
 Referring to the start of the passive resistance struggle of the  Indian community in South Africa, Gandhiji described how some white people there had taken the law into their own hands and were harassing the passive resisters who were fighting for their self respect and the honour of India.
 The Union Government seems to be just watching while the whites commit mischief. It is wrong. It is bad enough to pass an unjust law, but it is worse to let white people take the law into their own hands. They ought to realize that Indians are in no way inferior to them. The latter cannot submit to segregation. The only way open to them to obtain redress is through satyagraha. They are offering it against the offending law by setting up tents in the prohibited areas. Some white men have vowed vengeance against them. They have been daily raiding their tents, and terrorising them. Some women are also among the resisters. But they have bravely told the men that they will
 
 stand by them and share their vicissitudes. It is no small thing in South Africa. The movement is being led, according to the papers, by Dr. Dadoo and Dr. Naicker. It was the duty of the Government to stop this hooliganism of the whites. They can take action against the passive resisters according to law. What is taking place there today is worse than martial law.
 I do not say these things to incite you to anger against the whites of South Africa. If you do that you will be unworthy to take part in the prayers. I want you to go home and pray that God may give strength to our brethren and sisters in South Africa, who are fighting for the honour of India, to face all hardships bravely, secondly that He may show light to the whites so that they may cease to inflict inhuman atrocities and the eyes of the Government there may be opened so that they may treat Indians as fellow human beings. The whites of South Africa too are our brethren, being children of the same God.
 When we have the control of India’s affairs in our own hands such things will become impossible. A free India wedded to truth and non-violence will teach the lesson of peace to the inhabitants of South Africa. But it is for you and the Congress to decide whether a free India will follow the path of peace or the sword. It is bad enough that the small nations of the earth should denude humanity of its precious heritage. It would be awful if a subcontinent of some four hundred millions were to take to gunpower and live dangerously.

  June 	22, 1946  CHI. 	LAKSHMI,  	I have your letter of the 17th. Your dharma has now become clear. 	What is destined cannot be averted. It remains for us to think what 	we must do now. I cannot see very clearly what it should be. And in 	any case for that I should have you with me, which at the moment I 	am not in a position to arrange. Lakshmidasdada is already there. 	The Sardar is also sure to go there. I should like you to place 	yourself in Lakshmidasdada’s care. In my view you should now have 	no need for land. You should regard the Ashram as your place, your 	home. The responsibility for maintaining you and bringing up your 	children and 
 educating them should rest with the Ashram. You should serve by engaging yourself in the Ashram activities as much as you can. Then it will not be for you to bother about the expenses and other things. But for this to happen you ought to observe the Ashram rules. You should merge yourself in the Ashram as sugar dissolves in milk, you act according to Lakshmidasdada’s advice.
 Show this letter to Lakshmidasdada so that he can guide me.

  June 	23, 1946  Mahatma 	Gandhi announced to the 	gathering that 	as a 	disciplined soldier of 	the Congress, 	Pandit Jawaharlal had 	decided to 	return from 	Kashmir immediately in 	obedience to 	the Congress 	President’s instructions, reserving to 	himself the 	freedom to go back 	to Kashmir 	later.libtech_376_footnoteHis 	honour, said 	Mahatmaji was 	the honour of 	the Congress.  He 	was glad 	to tell 	them, Mahatmaji 	continued, that according 	to the 	latest reports 	received from South 	Africa, the 	police there had 	surrounded the camping 	ground of 	the satyagrahis, 	and had given 	notice to the 	white population that 	baiting of 	the passive 	resisterslibtech_377_footnotewould 	not be 	allowed. The passive 	resisters were 	not criminals 	but respectable 	citizens. They were 	fighting for 	the vindication of 	their rights. 	As self-respecting 	people they preferred 	imprisonment to 	segregation in 	ghettos. They would 	resist injustice and 	oppression with their 	last breath.  It 	was open 	to the 	South African Government 	to visit 	them with the penalty 	of law 	or to abrogate 	the Segregation 	Act that 	was contrary 	to the 	dictates of 	humanity. But it 	would be 	a dark 	blot on the 	history of 	the white civilization 	if lynch 	law was allowed 	to have its course 	in South Africa. He hoped that 	the South African 	Government and 	the civilized conscience 	of mankind 	would not 	allow that. 	The whites 	outside South Africa 	should not allow 	themselves to 	be carried away 	by any 	misleading propaganda, 	but should 	exercise a 	restraining influence on 	the South African whites.     
 Repeating the advice he had given yesterday about keeping the eyes closed during the prayers, Gandhiji recommended the practice of giving rest to the eyes by keeping shut at times. It would invigorate the eyesight and help them too to turn the gaze inward. He deprecated the craze for the outward scene which had made the modern man convert night into day.libtech_378_footnote

		MEETING","
    
 NEW DELHI,
 June 23, 1946
 In the Working Committee meeting in the afternoon Bapu put forth his emphatic view that the Congress should keep out of the Interim Government but go into the Constituent Assembly as it was purely an elective body whose representative character was admitted even by the British Government. The Viceroy could not interfere with its working—he could not even sit in it as a matter of right. If the worst came to the worst, it could be turned into a rebel body. In the alternative, he saw
 no possiblity of giving a fight, as the requisite atmosphere of non-violence was not forth-coming. Personally, he could not even think of launching civil disobedience, etc.
 While he was proceeding in this strain, Rajendra Babu read out a telegram which he had received from Assamlibtech_385_footnote.
 . . . On reading the text Bapu exclaimed:
 Even the Constituent Assembly plan now stinks. I am afraid we cannot touch it.

 "
234,"June 	23, 1946",SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING libtech_386_footnote,"
          NEW 	DELHI, 
  June 	23, 1946  In 	his remarks after the prayers, Gandhiji told the gathering that they 	would all be happy to learn that Pandit Jawaharlal—thanks to the 	assistance of the Government—had returned from Kashmir last night 	and that the reports about his having received bayonet wounds and so 	on were unfounded.  He 	was also happy to 	inform them that 16 	passive resisters in 	South Africa had 	been arrested by the 	South African Government. 	A satyagrahi 	breaks laws repugnant to 	his self-respect 	and invites 	the penalty, 	which he faces 	cheerfully. Prison-going is 	not a matter of sorrow to him but of joy. A satyagrahi does not expect preferential   
 treatment in prison, but he does expect humane treatment. At the same time he must be prepared to face the worst. He hoped that the passive resisters in South Africa would prove themselves to be ideal satyagrahis in every respect.
 Referring to his previous statements about the State Paper of May 16, that it was the best document that the Cabinet Mission could produce under the circumstances, if it bore the interpretation he gave it, he said that he adhered to that view so far as that Paper was concerned.
But as an old maxim says, the corruption of the best is the worst.
 A single drop of poison can convert a pot of nectar into a fatal draught.
 He had commended the State document because of its voluntary character. But he had only an hour ago made a discovery which had come to him and the members of the Working Committee as a rude shock. A telegram from Assam had drawn attention to the fact that under Rules of Procedure for the election of  members  to  the Constituent Assembly that had been issued from the Viceroy’s office to the Speakers of the various Provincial Assemblies, no one could stand as a candidate unless he signed a declaration that he would abide by clause 19 of the State Paper of May 16. As they all knew, clause 19 referred, among other things, to grouping.
 It was true that there was no legal sanction behind the document and therefore if anyone signed that declaration and afterwards did not abide by it he did not incur the penalty of law. Nevertheless, the undertaking would be morally binding and its breach would amount to bad faith, and those who were prepared to sacrifice honesty would make sorry architects of India’s future.
 It grieved him to see that the Constituent Assembly was being killed by the underlings of the very people who had given it birth. He exculpated the authors of the State Paper unless he found that they had known that such instructions were issued.
 No one, not even the framers, had any right to interpret the State Paper in their own way, said Gandhiji. It could only be interpreted by a properly constituted court of law. The document had to be interpreted and applied as a whole. He still clung to the hope that it was only an error, and would soon be rectified. Then and then alone would    it be possible to decide whether the Constituent Assembly was worthy of the name. If they participated in it, it would be for the sake of gaining India’s independence. If they decided against it, it would still be in the same cause.

236,"June 24, 1946","INTERVIEW WITH CABINET
DELEGATIONlibtech_388_footnote","
    
 June 24, 1946
 . . . Gandhiji was observing his silence. . . . I read out what he wrote. . . Cripps explained briefly what he had told me the previous day; on the first piece of paper Gandhiji said:
I	understood	from	Sudhir	something	quite	different.	I
 understood that you proposed to scrap the whole plan of Interim Government as it has gone on up to now and consider the situation de novo.
 . . . I had to intervene to explain that Sir Stafford was not really saying anything different. Sir Stafford himself explained at some length that what they meant was that if the Congress accepted the long-term plan of Constitution-making, even if it was unable to accept the short-term plan of an interim coalition Government, then what would remain was the acceptance by both the Congress and the Muslim League, of the Constitution-making plan and, in terms of the commitment made by them, a Government representative of both would be got together—at a suitable date; if the Congress rejected both then Mr. Jinnah could ask them to go ahead with a Government representing those who had accepted the 16th May (Constitution-making) proposal, i. e., only the Muslim League.
 . . . Gandhiji wrote down. . . .
 Then if you say that you will form a Government out of the acceptances it won’t work, as far as I can see. If you are not in a desperate hurry and if you would discuss the thing with me, I would gladly do so after I have opened my lips, i. e., after 8 p. m.libtech_389_footnoteMean- while you should have, if you do not mind, the (Congress) Working Committee[’s] letter of rejection of the proposal contained in the
 
 Viceroy’s letterlibtech_390_footnotelibtech_391_footnoteof 22nd instant. In my opinion that letter puts a new appearance on the Interim Government. The object of the Working Committee so far as I know is to help the Mission, not to hinder it except when its project results in the Working Committee committing suicide. Sudhir’s talk led me to see light through  the prevailing darkness. But is there really light?
 As to the Constituent Assembly, I was quite clear up to yesterday afternoon that the Congress should work the Constituent Assembly to the best of its ability. But the rules I read yesterday have revolutionized   my   mentality.libtech_392_footnoteThere   is  a   serious   flaw.   I   accuse nobody. But a flaw is a flaw. The three parties must not work with three minds and hope for success.
 Sir Stafford Cripps explained that it was the Mission’s intention to rectify the “flaw” as Gandhiji called it. Thereafter Gandhiji wrote:
Then you should not isolate a particular section from the whole.
Why not say ‘under the State Paper as a whole’?
 Sir Stafford Cripps said that clarification could certainly be made.libtech_393_footnoteGandhiji scribbled his last remark:
However, I would gladly discuss this question also with you in
 the evening. I am sorry to cause you all this trouble. I only hope that you perceive my object in all this effort.

The Sardar was irritated. “You raised doubts as regards para 19. They have given a clear assurance on that. What more do you want?” Bapu scribbled in reply:
During our meeting when Cripps said to me  that   if   we  were
 apprehensive about the wording of the instructions issued by the Reforms  Office  they  could  delete   the   reference  to   para   19   and
 
 substitute in its place the words “for the purpose of the declaration of the 16th May”, Lord Pethick-Lawrence immediately intervened and said: “No, that presents difficulty.”
 The Sardar dissented. Bapu asked Sudhir. Sudhir confirmed Bapu’s version but added that his own impression was that they were prepared to concede what Bapu had asked for.

 Their recommendation will remain in their mouths or on the printed paper. We shall have no authority even to order a constable if there is a row in the Constituent Assembly. This is a dangerous situation. There must be the imprimatur of the Parliament and real power in the Central Government before we can make anything of the Constituent Assembly. The imprimatur of the Parliament would clear the way for the Chairman of the Constituent Assembly (by making the issue adjudicable) in case he wants to refer a point of major importance to the Federal Court for decision.
 In the course of the discussion that followed, the Sardar pressed with great vigour his view that the explanation given by the Cabinet Mission in regard to the form issued by the Reforms Office was quite adequate and the Congress could not postpone giving its decision forthwith without damaging its  prestige.  Bapu scribbled.
My mind is in a fog. . . . It centres round the insertion of
 reference to para 19 . . . and the meaning of “scrapping the whole plan” (of the Interim Government).libtech_400_footnote

 You examine all the instructions. There are other things in it which irk me. Now I think the point will also be raised that the State Paper should bear the imprimatur of the Parliament.libtech_402_footnote
 Whatever the Cabinet Mission may say or write it will remain in their mouths or on the printed paper. They have opened  here a Reform Office. Whatever they do and the interpretation they put will be final. The Government office not being in your hands you cannot have control over it. You should consider all this. You should do nothing in haste. I shall be meeting them today or tomorrow after which I shall be able to enlighten you as I shall be better informed. Today’s interview has not produced a good impression on my mind. Because of my silence I could not myself ask questions. So I do not blame these people. I am in a very delicate position.

I shall say I had nothing tangible to prove that there were danger signals.

NEW DELHI,
  June 25, 1946libtech_414_footnote  Gandhiji 	drew attention to the 	demi-official statementlibtech_415_footnotethat had appeared 	in the Press 	that the instructions 	issued for 	the election of 	candidates for 	the Constituent Assembly 	did not bind 	them to anything 	in clause 	19 of the Statement. 	This was clear in the 	declaration quoted in 	the papers. 	He was 	sorry, said 	Gandhiji, that 	he had 	not seen 	it before he made his Sunday’s speech.libtech_416_footnoteHe was 	glad to say 	that his fears on 	that score 	had proved 	groundless. He felt 	he owed 	it to the Delegation 	to own his mistake, 	however bona 	fide it was.  He 	referred to 	the report 	of the 	deliberations of 	the Working 	Committee that had 	appeared in 	the newspapers. It 	was true that the 	Working Committee had 	decided to reject 	the proposals 	put before 	them for the formation 	of a provisional 	government for 	the interim period. But 	they had decided to 	go into the proposed 	Constituent Assembly. 	There were several flaws in 	the proposal 	for the Constituent 	Assembly, he said, 	but the Working 	Committee had reasoned 	that after 	all, it 	would consist of 	the elected 	representatives of the 	people. So, 	after considering every 	aspect of 	the question, they had decided that it should not be rejected.  The 	papers had also reported, proceeded Gandhiji, that the Working 	Committee’s decision had been taken in the teeth of his 	opposition. That was a misleading statement to make. The fact was 	that for the last four or five days his mind had been filled with a 	vague misgiving. He saw darkness where he had seen light before. He 	knew that darkness indicated lack of faith in God. One whose being 	is filled with God, should never experience darkness.  Be 	that as 	it may, said Gandhiji, 	the fact 	remained that he did 	not see the light just 	then. What 	was more, he 	could not 	explain or 	give re 	asons for 	his fear. He 	had, therefore, 	simply placed his 	misgiving before the 	Working Committee and 	told them 	that they should come to 	a decision independently 	of him. 	Those whose function was 	to give 	a lead 	to the 	country could 	not afford to 	be guided by 	another’s unreasoned 	instinct. They could not 	guide the 	destiny of 	the country 	unless they had the 	capacity to 	think for 	themselves and 	convince others by 	reason. The 	members of 	the Working 	Committee, he 	concluded, were the 	servants of 	the nation. They had 	no other sanction 	except the 	willing consent of 	the people 	whom they tried 	to serve. 	The latter 	would remove them whenever they liked. His advice to the people, therefore, was to follow      Vide 		Appendix “Grouping 		Clause Controversy”, 25-6-1946.

249,"June 26, 1946",WHITE MAN’S BURDEN,"
    
 According to Reuter picked Indians, men and women, headed by Dr. Naicker, commenced satyagraha (in South Africa popularly known as passive resistance) on June 14th in respect  of the Segregation Law of the Union Parliament of South Africa. The same agency further reports that neither the Government nor the Municipality had taken any action against the passive resisters but that some ‘whites’ of Durban had taken the execution of the law into their own hands by raiding the camp at night, cutting down tents swiftly and carrying them away.“A band of 100 young white men broke through the cordon of 50 Indian passive resisters, pulled down the tents and dragged them away torn. Some camp stretchers were smashed and blankets and pillows removed. Two women resisters were involved in the melee. They are stated to have been kicked but not injured.
 The papers report that after three days of hooliganism the Borough police had posted themselves near the scene of passive resistance and warned the hooligans against molesting the resisters and terrorizing them into submission. This is heartening news. Let us hope that it can be taken at its full value and that the protection means fullest protection against lawlessness, sporadic or organized. Organized popular lawlessness is known as lynching, so shamelessly frequent in America.
 Before the Segregation Law was passed, white men, known to be respectable, had carried anti-Asiatic agitation to the point of frenzy. Not satisfied with their triumph in having legislation compelling segregation passed probably beyond expectation, the more advanced section among the agitators have become the executioners of their own laws. They do not know that they are thereby defaming the white man’s name! ! !
 My appeal to the white men and women who have regard for laws for which they have voted is that they should create public  opinion against hooliganism and lynch law.
Passive resistance is aimed at removal in a most approved
 manner of bad laws, customs or other evils and is designed to be a complete and effective substitute for forcible methods including hooliganism and lynch law. It is an appeal to the heart of man. Often reason fails. It is dwarfed by self. The theory is that an adequate appeal to the heart never fails. Seeming failure is not of the law of satyagraha but of incompetence of the satyagrahi by whatever cause induced. It may not be possible to give a complete historical instance. The name of Jesus at once comes to the lips. It is an instance of brilliant failure. And he has been acclaimed in the West as Prince of passive resisters. I showed years ago in South Africa that the adjective “passive” was a misnomer, at least as applied to Jesus. He was the most active resister known perhaps to history. His was non-violence par excellence. But I must no longer stray from my main subject. It is the resistance of the Jesus type that the white hooligans are seeking to thwart. Let us hope that our countrymen’s heroic resistance will not only shame the hooligans into silence but prove the precursor of the repeal of the Law that disfigures the statute book of South Africa. In concrete form, what pure suffering, wholly one-sided, does is to stir public opinion against a wrong. Legislators are, after all, representatives of the public. In obedience to it they have enacted a wrong. They have to reverse the process when the same public, awakened to the wrong, demands its removal.
 The real ‘white man’s burden’ is not insolently to dominate coloured or black people under the guise of protection; it is to desist from the hypocrisy which is eating into them. It is time white men learnt to treat every human being as their equal. There is no mystery about whiteness of the skin. It has repeatedly been proved that given equal opportunity a man, be he of any colour or country, is fully equal to any other.
 Therefore, white men throughout the world and especially of India should act upon their fellow men in South Africa and call upon them not to molest Indian resisters who are bravely struggling to preserve the self-respect of Indians in the Union and the honour of their motherland. “Do unto others as you would that they should do unto you.” Or, do they take in vain the name of Him who said this? Have they bani-shed from their hearts the great coloured Asiatic who gave to the world the above message? Do they forget that the greatest of the teachers of mankind were all Asiatics and did not possess a white face? These, if they descended on earth and went to South Africa, would all have to live in the segregated areas and be classed as
 Asiatics and coloured people unfit by law to be equals of whites.
 Is a civilization worth the name which requires for its existence the very doubtful prop of racial legislation and lynch law? The silver lining to the cloud that hangs over the devoted heads of our countrymen   lies   in   the   plucky   action   of   Rev.   Scottlibtech_417_footnotelibtech_418_footnote,   a   white clergyman, and his equally white fellow-workers, who have undertaken to share the sufferings of the Indian resisters.libtech_419_footnote

250,"June 26, 1946",DR. LOHIA’S CHALLENGE,"
    
 It would appear from newspaper reports that Dr. Lohialibtech_420_footnotelibtech_421_footnotewent to Goa at the invitation of Goans and was served with an order to refrain from making speeches. According to Dr. Lohia’s statement, for 188 years now, the people of Goa have been robbed of the right to hold meetings and form organizations. Naturally he defied the order. He has thereby rendered a service to the cause of civil liberty and especially to the Goans. The little Portuguese settlement which merely exists on the sufferance of the British Government can ill afford to ape its bad manners. In free India Goa cannot be allowed to exist as a separate entity in opposition to the laws of the free State. Without a shot being fired, the people of Goa will be able to claim and receive the rights of citizenship of the free State. The present Portuguese Government will no longer be able to rely upon the protection of British arms to isolate and keep under subjection the inhabitants of Goa against their will. I would venture to advise the Portuguese Government of Goa to recognize the signs of the times and come to honourable terms with its inhabitants rather than function on any treaty that might exist between them and the British Government.
 To the inhabitants of Goa I will say that they should shed fear of the Portuguese Government as the people of other parts of India have shed fear of the mighty British Government and assert their fundamental right of civil liberty and all it means. The differences of religion among the inhabitants of Goa should be no bar to common civil life. Religion is for each individual, himself or herself, to live. It
 
 should never become a bone of contention or quarrel between religious sects.

 You say in the statement that, with God’s grace, the scheme will be fulfilled, but I have deliberately scored out these words. There are two reasons: one, that you have not indicated the criterion of  its success. And when you make a positive statement without indicating such a criterion, who can know what you mean by success? And secondly, even if we are entitled to make such a positive statement we should forgo that right. If you have in your mind a criterion of success, you should indicate it in your statement and say as under:

After discussing the courage that you had 	displayed you asked me whether I would call it violence or non- 	violence. I should advise you not to bother about that question.  	If we go on reflecting over the meaning of ahimsa, we shall but act 	non-violently when the occasion arises. We should not mind whether 	other people regarded it as non-violent or not. The effect of such 	action depends not on what others think about it but on what is in 	our minds. We do not know our minds ourselves, but, assuming that we 	do, if the mind says that in abusing or slapping a person we acted 	non-violently, it would be for us a non-violent action. Whether in 	fact it was non-violent God alone can know.

 DEAR FRIEND,
 
 Your letter of 5-6-46 arrived here on the 22nd. Gandhiji is so very over- burdened that he literally does not get time to look at his post. I read out your kind thoughts to him day before yesterday and he has asked me to acknowledge your letter with thanks. You will understand that he is too busy to write himself.
 The three months since the British Cabinet Mission came out have been long and anxious. It is with sorrow that Gandhiji has had to admit— as you may have seen in the press—that his mind is clouded with doubt. Where there was light there is darkness at the moment. Things have not gone as we hoped they would. Circumstances have tipped the balance on, as we think, the wrong side. However, as Gandhiji says, if we have the requisite faith and our own actions are motivated by pure impulses, we must believe that whatever happens is for our ultimate good.
 It was good to hear of Devdas’s valuable work from you. He ought soon to be out here again. Gandhiji is amazingly well. Louis Fischer who sees him after four long and difficult years finds him better than in 1942.

NEW DELHI,
  June 	28, 1946    Gandhiji 	paid tribute to the courage and suffering of the passive resisters 	with- out retaliation in the midst of the hooliganism which was 	daily increasing. He was born in India but was made in South Africa 	of which he knew practically every province. He had passed there 	twenty years of his life at its meridian. He knew the white men of 	South Africa. He loved them as well as his countrymen. He felt 	ashmed, he said, of the hooliganism of some of them. He had the fear 	that this hooliganism had the sympathy of the mass of the white men 	of the Union. Hooliganism would not flourish without such silent 	sympathy. He fondly hoped that as the white men realized the deep 	strength and sincerity of satyagrahis, they would begin to respect 	them and transfer their sympathy to the suffering passive resisters. 	He asked the gathering to offer their heartfelt prayers for God’s 	mercy on the hooligans. He did not want to send money to their 	contrymen. Money could not give them victory. They had money enough. 	But a time might come when it would be their duty in India to offer 	non- violent resistance of the purest type for the sake of their 	brethren. He could not tell how. India was fast becoming the 	storehouse of the honour and dignity of the human race. It would be 	in the fitness of things if it fell to their lot to help the 	struggle of gallant resisters of South Africa. But for that the way 	must be clear before them. He felt that he would know when it was 	clear. Meantime he invoked the sympathy of the Viceroy and the white 	men and women of India to do their portion of duty.  Taking 	stock of his nearly three months’ communion with them (with only 	two breaks) he asked them to preserve and enlarge the most precious 	part of what he was leaving behind,viz., the practice of common 	prayer. He did not mind whether they recited the prayer verse or 	not. What was absolutely necessary was that all the members of their 	families should daily assemble at a convenient time and observe at 	the most five minutes silence with concentration on God within.

266,"June 29, 1946",KHADI MAD libtech_442_footnote,"
    
 The Rajkot Rashtriyashala appeal about the Charkha Jayanti of this year is as followslibtech_443_footnote:
 Narandas Gandhi is khadi-mad. There are two ideas governing my conception of a yarn bank. First, that all yarn in whatever quantity, of whatever quality and from wheresoever it comes should be colleced in one place. From there it should be sent to the weaver in such a condition as will enable him to weave it with the same speed as he weaves mill yarn. For this purpose all yarn has to be doubled and twisted. Yarn that has not been subjected to this process should not really be reckoned as yarn. There will thus be two kinds of yarn, one doubled and twisted and one single. The former will have a higher value. It will, of course, take time to achieve this desideratum. In the meantime, yarn will have to be separated and the  single  thread doubled and twisted and then woven into cloth at the yarn depot or wherever it may be suitable.
 The second thing to remember is that just as gold and silver emerge as coins from a mint, so khadi alone should emerge from a yarn bank. Not until such time as this happens will the defects in hand-spun yarn be removed and the quality of khadi  improved beyond expectation. This work cannot be accomplished by compul- sion. Khadi must be selfless, true and of a scientific mind for the easy, quick and voluntary achievement of this noble end.
 To acheive it is the real goal of the Charkha Sangh. It will not matter if, in working up to this end, all the sales bhandars have to be closed and khadi-wearers reduced to a handful. Even so, there will be no shame attaching to the endeavour. On the other hand, if khadi is sold as a symbol of hypocrisy and untruth it will drag the names of both the Charkha Sangh and the Congress in the mud and khadi will no longer be able either to deliver swaraj or be the mainstay of the poor. Unbelievers will ask: ‘Then why take so much trouble over khadi? Why not let it remain as one of the many occupations of village India, instead of being fad of non-violence?’ Those who are khadi-mad must learn the secret of the science of khadi and be
 
 prepared even to die for it and thereby prove that it is the true symbol of non-violent swaraj.

269,,TALK WITH NORMAN CLIFF libtech_445_footnote,"
    
 June, 29, 1946
 CLIFF: Discussions are now over. Can you talk about them?
 GANDHIJI: Off the record—yes. If you want at any time to give anything to the Press you will, of course, let me see it first.
 CLIFF: Are you feeling happy about the result the developed so far?
 GANDHIJI: I cannot say that I am either happy or unhappy. But I am not satisfied. It is an indifinable feeling and I therefore asked the Congress Working Committee not to be guided by my instinct. While I have no disrust of the four actors (three Cabinet Ministers and the Viceroy) I have a distrust of the way things have gone. It has all been artificial and unnatural. My feeling is not by way of underrating the greatness of their task. I have great regard for their industry in prosecution of the ideal they have set out for. And yet I see that what I said at the very threshold of their career has proved true. I told them they were unaware of the difficulties they would have to sur-mount. They do not even know them now. It is no fault of theirs. They have done a faithful job and yet a bad one. They themselves are not satisfied. They are still probing.They do not know how to handle things. They have been brought up in one school of thought. With the greatest stretch of honesty they cannot think otherwise.
 CLIFF: Can any Englishman then understand?
 GANDHIJI: Yes, for example Andrews who realized that though he had the greatest measure of success he could not quite reach there. His success lay in knowing his limitations. He copied everything Indian in order to become Indian. Curiously enough and yet not curiously he shared his innermost thoughts with me and not Gurudev. Such was his love and reverence for the poet that he remained Gurudev for Andrews throughout. I first met Charlie in South Africa. He was a scholar. I am none. My knowledge of English literature is nil. He was a philosopher—unlike me, a man of action—and yet I took to him as perhaps I have not taken to any Indian. One day he asked for a gift. It was that I should call him Charlie and that I should allow him to call me Mohan. I readily agreed but told him that it would be harder for
 
 me to fulfil my part of the contract as I had always kept a respectable distance from friends! Andrews found in me not only a live Hindu but a live Christian. That was the secrect of his nearness to me. He shared with me his innermost thoughts on religion. And he said that he must at bottom remain a true Christain if he was to be a true Hindu and Muslim.
 The mission, I have said and I repeat, have done their best. But the best falls far short of India’s needs or India’s best. Take the food problem. I claim to know more than anyone about it for I have sunk myself in the masses. But the English do not understand what they should do if the masses that are sinking may live. India is being robbed of millions of pounds by Britain. An economist has  only today written that the Congress ministries want to do things for village India but cannot. India should never remain naked for want of cloth. She grows enough cotton for her requirements. But it is a money crop and therefore exported. And the same in other things too. All is taken from the villages for rich city people and Britain.
 CLIFF: For this very reason, do you not see independence in taking over power at the Centre in the Interim Goverment?
GANDHIJI: It looks nice and sweet put like that. But where is the
 power in the Interim Government as proposed? The dice were so heavily loaded against the Congress that it was impossible for them to come in. If I could form a live Central Government and thereby serve the masses I would seize the opportunity. A pure Muslim League Government would have been better than the so-called coalition they tried to form. I do not know what happened. But things seemed to go from bad to worse. Was it that secret force of the I. C. S. as before working in order to torpedo everything? The Simla Conference broke down last year. The Viceroy ad-mitted that the Congress acted on the square. He took the blame on him-self then.All the minorities were in tune with the Congress. If the League were not willing to shoulder the burden I advised giving it to the Congress. I consider it was sound advice but it was not accepted and hence the mess that we now are in. You should know that the League is today what the Con-gress was at one time. All their leaders are titled men. It has not yet been through the pain and travail that the Congress has been through before it could call itself the people’s representative.
 But even I am still working to make things a success. I cannot today support my instinct with reason. I own my defeat. And yet I
 
 must tell the truth. I may not hide my innermost feeling, if I am to be  a friend and adviser to either or both sides.
 CLIFF: Don’t you feel it is natural that the members of the Mission might find your attitude a little difficult to understand?
GANDHIJI: I have accepted my defeat before them too. I said to
 them,“I struggle to lay bare my whole soul before you.” I am still advising. But I am filled with misgivings. I have to walk with the ut- most caution. For failure now will be a great human tragedy.
 CLIFF: Success or failure of the Constituent Assembly will surely depend on the spirit of those who go into it. Will it not?
GANDHIJI: Yes. But it may be that one or [the] other party or
 none goes into it. I would have you remember that a Mussalman does not become a non-Indian by changing his relgion. It is [a] most fantastic claim. My son became a Muslim for a little time for purely sordid reasonslibtech_446_footnote. Did he lose his nationality? I am perhaps  a  better Mussalman than many a Hindu convert to Islam. This whole idea is wrong au fond. The British, imagining that they can bring the League and [the] Congress together, are attempting the impossible.
 CLIFF: I am surprised that you with your boundless faith in human nature believe that the above is an impossibility. All things are possible with God.
 GANDHIJI: If you think deeply enough, you will see that I am quite consistent. My faith in human nature is quite consistence with my holding that men with diametrically opposite views cannot coa- lesce. I have called Pakistan a sin. Can I cooperate to make sin a success? God cannot belie Himself. Truth canot work for untruth. That all things are possible with God cannot be used to make God break His law.
 I have said and I think rightly that the connotation of Indepen- dence of India as meant by the British, the Muslim League and Congress is different. The Muslim League independence means splitting India first and independence after. The Congress stands for immediate unconditional independence for the whole of India. If the Constituent Assembly is to be worthy of its name, it must be a  sovereign body with the right thing as well as the wrong. It may not be hedged in with conditions.
 CLIFF: But you do recognize and respect the British concern for minorites?
 
 
 GANDHI: I do not admit its claim to do so. It is an unconscious relic, if you like, of Imperialism. You had independence even when you heaped disabilities on Roman Catholics. Which outsider dared to interfere with your independence? What right have the English rulers who have deliberately sown the seeds of discord and brought about these interminable dissensions into our structure now to concern themselves with our difference so called? Not until and unless you discard this ‘white man’s burden’ notion will you be able truly to assist India.
 CLIFF: It is very difficut for us everywhere, e. g., in Egypt.
 GANDHIJI: You will find greater and greater difficulty as time goes on. The British Labour Party has my full sympathy. Of course, if the mind of the English people in general has been changed as Laskilibtech_447_footnoteand others tell us and Britain will be content to be dubbed ‘little England’ and get off the backs of others, it may be different.  Otherwise the Labour Party will throw itself into the arms of Churchill for whose courage and resourfulness I have the utmost admiration.
 I do not want Britain to leave India because of her helplessness. I flatter myself that we have come thus far through even our limited non-violence. I do not look with equanimity to India coming into her own by brute force. If Britain would play her part nobly, the growing hatred may give place to friendship.
 CLIFF: Can there be a furture step in London?
 GANDHIJI: Of course. My only fear is that the imperialistic character of the Labour Government will prevent them from doing right at any cost. They want to please all parties. This is an impossible task. They have to dare to do the right even though they displease some. This cannot be done in the imperialistic way.
 CLIFF: Surely then there is all the more reason for settling things in India for our own no less than for your sakes?
 GANDHIJI: You are right. How to do it in the right way is the question. My fear is that may fail in spite of themselves.
 CLIFF: Cannot a via media be found?
 GANDHIJI: They are struggling. I am struggling.  My  helping  hand is still there in spite of misreading by them of the situation here. But I confess I am just now at sea and darkness surrounds me.
 CLIFF: Your misgivings are not due to a fundamental distrust of Britain doing
 
 
 the right thing?
 GANDHIJI: No. But I have a fundamental distrust of their doing it at any cost.  I said that the statement they issuedlibtech_448_footnotewas the best they were capable of but it was not intrinsically the best. Then at the outset it bore three interpretations. The Congress put one, the  League  another and the authors a third one.That makes it a dangerous document.
 CLIFF: But why not interpret it only as they do? They are the best judges of what they meant.
GANDHIJI: The law rightly does not accept the intention of the
farmer of a law outside what the text bears.
 CLIFF: Could not the document be reworded in order to make the intention
  clear?   GANDHIJI: 	That is impossible. It would mean perpetual changing 
 and 	chopping.  CLIFF: 	Would you submit to legal 	interpretation? GANDHIJI: Yes, 	of course.  CLIFF: 	Would not interpretation 	in spirit be better than in letter? GANDHIJI: All 	these are questions for the court to decide.  CLIFF: 	Am I right in thinking 	that the immediate problem is still the Interim Government and that 	the main obstacle there is the rejectrion of Congress’ right to 	nominate a Nationalist Muslim? GANDHIJI: 	Yes. But the question of a Nationalist Muslim is a side-  	issue now that a far more general right has been conceded to the 	Quaid-e-Azam.libtech_449_footnote  CLIFF: 	Would the issue not be 	sholved if the Congress’ right to nominate anyone were conceded 	but they were asked not to exercise that right? GANDHIJI: 	A right is negatived if it cannot be exercised at the  	cirucial moment. The Congress is reduced to a caste Hindu body 	according to Jinnah’s wholly wrong appraisement of it. Such an 	admission belies all its past history.  CLIFF: 	Isn’t self-denial one 	of your fundamental beliefs?  GANDHIJI: (Roaring with 	laughter) Satan also quotes the scri- pture!!!      (1) 	Until I have received acceptance from those invited to take office 	in the Interim Government, the names in the statements cannot be 	regarded 
 All I want is that what I have said should go deep enough into your soul so that you may be able correctly to interpret me.

270,"June 30, 1946",MARRIAGES BETWEEN HARIJANS AND NON- HARIJANSlibtech_450_footnote,"
    
 A friend from Patidar Ashram, Surat, writes to Shri Narahari Parikh:libtech_451_footnote
 If Harijan girls are to marry caste Hindus it should be on condition that the couple will devote their lives to the service of the Harijans. . . If caste Hindus girls live amongst Harijans as Harijans, Harijan sisters will be able to learn a lot from them.
If an educated Harijan girl marries a caste Hindu, the couple
 ought to devote themselves to the service of  Harijans.  Self-indul- gence can never be the object of such a marriage. That will be im- proper. I can never encourage it. It is possible that a marriage entered into with the best of intentions turns out to be a failure. No one can prevent such mishaps. Even if one Harijan girl marries a caste Hindu with a high character it will do good to both the Hari-jans and caste Hindus. They will set up a good precedent and if the Harijan girl is really worthy, she will spread her fragrance far and wide and encourage others to copy her example. Society will cease to be scared by such marriages. They will see for themselves that there is nothing wrong in them. If children born of such a union turn out to be good, they will further help to remove untouchability. Every reform moves at the proverbial snail’s pace. To be dissatisfied with this slowness of progress betrays ignorance of the way in which reform works.
 It is certainly desirable that caste Hindu girls should select Harijan husbands. I hesitate to say that it is better. That would imply that women are inferior to men. I know that such inferiority complex is there today. For this reason I would agree that at present the marriage of a caste Hindu girl to a Harijan is better than that of a Harijan girl to a caste Hindu. If I had my way I would persuade all caste Hindu girls coming under my influence to select Harijan husbands. That it is most difficult I know from experience. Old prejudices are difficult to shed. One cannot afford to laugh at such
 
 prejudices either. They have to be overcome with patience. And if a girl imagines that her duty ends by marrying a Harijan and falls a prey to the temptation of self-indulgence after marriage, the last state would be worse than the first. The final test of every marriage is how far it develops the spirit of service in the parties.  Every  mixed  marriage will tend in varying degrees to remove the stigma attached to such marriages. Finally there will be only one caste, known by the beautiful name Bhangi, that is to say, the reformer or remover of all dirt. Let us all pray that such a happy day will dawn soon.
 The correspondent must realize that even the best of my wishes cannot come true on the mere expression. I have not succeeded in marrying off a single Harijan girl to a caste Hindu so far after my declaration. I have a caste Hindu girl who at her father’s wish has offered to marry a Harijan lad of her father’s selection. The lad is at present under training at Sevagram. God willing, the marriage will take place after a short time.

271,"June 30, 1946",SELF-RESTRAINT IN MARRIAGElibtech_452_footnote,"
    
 The same correspondentlibtech_453_footnotelibtech_454_footnotefrom the Patidar Ashram, Surat, who put a question to Shri Narahari Parikh, has also asked the following:libtech_455_footnote
 It is deplorable that the correspondent seems to take it for  granted that the main thing in marriage is the satisfaction of the sexual urge. Rightly speaking, the true purpose of marriage should be and is intimate friendship and companionship between man and woman. There is in it no room for sexual satisfaction. That marriage is no marriage which takes place for the satisfaction of the sex desire. That satisfaction is a denial of true friendship. I know of English marriages undertaken for the sake of companionship and mutual service. If a reference to my own married life is not considered irrelevant, I may say that my wife and I tasted the real bliss of married life when we
 
 renounced sexual contact, and that in the heyday of youth. It was then that our companionship blossomed and both of us were enabled to render real service to India and humanity in general. I have written about this in my Experiments with Truth. Indeed this self-denial was born out of our great desire for service.
 Of course, innumerable marriages take place in the  natural course of events and such will continue. The physical side of married life is given pre-eminence in these. Innumerable persons eat in order to satisfy the palate but such indulgence does not therefore become one’s duty. Very few eat to live but they are the ones who really know the law of eating. Similarly, those only really marry who marry in or order to experience the purity and sanctity of the marriage tie and thereby realize the divinity within.
 The correspondent does not seem to be conversant with the full details of the Tendulkar-Indumati marriage. The vow of sexual res- traint was an outcome of mature deliberation. The text was written in Hindustani.libtech_456_footnoteThe papers put in their own English translations of it. The original provided for sexual intercourse if the wife desired progeny. This much is certain that both desired to observe restraint even after marriage. The union was for promotion of joint service. They had known each other for many years. Shri Indumati’s parents gave their consent to this marriage after much testing. Then jail life prolonged the agony. Both parties as well as their elders were keen that the ceremony should take place in Sevagram Ashram, where Shri Indumati had lived for some time and derived solace. I am unaware of their whereabouts today. I have no reason to suspect hypocrisy in the transaction. But even if it is discovered, it would not prove that the vow of brahmacharya in married life is at fault. The fault  lies  in hypocrisy. An English poet has well said, “Hypocrisy is an ode to virtue.”libtech_457_footnotelibtech_458_footnoteWherever there are true coins, counterfeit ones will also be found. Where there is virtue there will be hypocrisy, i. e., vice mas- querading as virtue. How tragic and surprising that a virtuous action should be sought to be stopped because of the fear of hypocrisy!

272,"June 30, 1946",WHY KILL? libtech_459_footnote,"
    
The following suggestion has been received from Aligarh:libtech_460_footnote
 You write: “We have to kill monkeys, birds and animals which ruin the crops, or else keep someone who will kill them for us.” My uncle has been able to keep monkeys off his field by using strong electric light at night. Why cannot this method be given a wider trial?
At first sight the suggestion seems attractive but on deeper
 thought one finds that it won’t work. I might be able to protect my own field in this manner, but what of those round about? It will not be right for me selfishly to save my crops at the cost of others. That will be violence in the name of non-violence. For instance, we will throw a snake or rubbish from our own yard into that of our neighbour without compunction. True ahimsa demands that if we must save the society as well as ourselves from the mischief of mon-keys and the like, we have to kill them. The general rule is that we must avoid violence to the utmost extent possible. Non-violence for the society is necessarily different from that for the individual. One living apart from society may defy all precaution, not so society as such.libtech_461_footnote

Why should anyone  have  wished to take my life is more than I can understand. But there it was. Such things happened in every country. Why not in India too? But the world is made like that. Man is born to live in the midst of dangers and alarms. The whole existence of man is a ceaseless duel between the forces of life and death. Even so, the latest accident strengthens my hope to live up to 125. Ramanama is my only strength  and  refuge. You should join me in reciting His name and install Him in your hearts if you want me to continue to serve you.

275,"July 1, 1946",ATOM BOMB AND AHIMSA,"
    
 It has been suggested by American friends that the atom bomb will bring in ahimsa (non-violence) as nothing else can. It will, if it is meant that its destructive power will so disgust the world that it will turn it away from violence for the time being. This is very like a man
 
 M. 	Pereira and the guard. 
 
 glutting himself with dainties to the point of nausea and turning away from them only to return with redoubled zeal after the  effect  of nausea is well over. Precisely in the same manner will the world return to violence with renewed zeal after the effect of disgust is worn out.
 Often does good come out of evil. But that is God’s, not man’s plan. Man knows that only evil can come out of evil, as good out of good.
 That atomic energy, though harnessed by American scien- tists and army men for destructive purposes, may be utilized by other scientists for humanitarian purposes is undoubtedly within the realm of possibility. But that is not what was meant by my American friends. They were not so simple as to put a question which connoted an obvious truth An incendiary uses fire for his destructive and nefarious purpose, a housewife makes daily use of it in preparing nourishing food for mankind.
 So far as I can see, the atomic bomb has deadened the finest feeling that has sustained mankind for ages. There used to be the so- called laws of war which made it tolerable. Now we know the naked truth. War knows no law except that of might. The atom bomb brought an empty victory to the Allied arms but it resulted for the time being in destroying the soul of Japan. What has happened to the soul of the destroying nation is yet too early to see. Forces of nature act in a mysterious manner. We can but solve the mystery by deduc- ing the unknown result from the known results of similar events. A slaveholder cannot hold a slave without putting himself or his deputy in the cage holding the slave. Let no one run away with the idea that I wish to put in a defence of Japanese misdeeds in pursuance of Japan’s unworthy ambition. The difference was only one of degree. I assume that Japan’s greed was more unworthy. But the greater unworthiness conferred no right on the less unworthy of destroying without mercy men, women and children of Japan in a particular area.
 The moral to be legitimately drawn from the supreme tragedy of the bomb is that it will not be destroyed by counter-bombs even as violence cannot be by counter-violence. Mankind has to get out of violence only through non-violence. Hatred can be overcome only by love. Counter-hatred only increases the surface as well as the depth of hatred. I am aware that I am repeating what I have many times stated before and practised to the best of my ability and capacity. What I first stated was itself nothing new. It was old as the hills. Only I recited
 no copy-book maxim but definitely announced what I believed in every fibre of my being. Sixty years of practice in various walks of life has only enriched the belief which experience of friends had fortified. It is however the central truth by which one can stand alone without flinching. I believe in what Max Muller said years  ago, namely, that truth needed to be repeated as long as there were men who disbelieved it.

If you have any mental weakness some day it 	is bound to come out. Or you will become a hypocrite.  	The Ashram is not intended for comfort. For that you should go to 	some other place.

    	Rajkumari showed me your letter. There is no need to consult any 	other lawyer in Bombay. It is enough that you are there. I remember 	Dr. Gopichand had written to me. But I have forgotten what the 	letter contained. When I go to Sevagram I can look for it. Whatever 	the case, draft a short deed and sent it.  	Nothing much of importance can be done about the  matter today 	because the communal harmony generated during 1919-20 does not 	prevail at present. Hence, our duty today is to protect the property 	and use it in a manner that does not lead to friction. It should 	also be kept clean. Anyhow you have been there from the very 	beginning and you have been the chief worker. Hence, write to me 	whatever thoughts occur to you. I shall no doubt be seeing 	Jawaharlal and others but they will be so busy with other things 	that it may not be possible to exchange views on this matter. If I 	am able to do anything I shall write to you again.  	I appreciated very much your views on the issue that came up during 	the Cabinet Mission’s visit. Similar views were expressed by 	others. I am making use of them all.  Yours 	sincerely,  K. GANDHI     From 	a copy of the Hindi: Pyarelal Papers. Nehru Memorial Museum and 	Library.

 I 	have your letter. You did well in writing to me. I think the  	C.W.C. is seized of the matter. I would say this much that either 	untouchability will be eradicated through a change of heart in the 	caste Hindus or the sin that is being perpetrated in the  name  of 	religion will destroy Hindu society.

Anyone who bears Him in his or her heart has access to a marvellous 	force or energy as effective in its results as, say, electricity, 	but much subtler.  In 	explaining the significance of Ramanama was he propagating a species 	of superstition, he asked. “No” was his reply. Mere repetition 	of Ramanama possessed no mysterious virtue as such. Ramanama was not 	like black magic. It had to be taken with all that it symbolized. 	Rather, it was like a mathematical formula which summed up in brief 	the result of endless research. Mere mechanical repetition of 	Ramanama could not give strength. For that one had to understand and 	live up to the conditions attaching to its recitation. To take God’s 	name one had to live a godly life.  Mathatma 	Gandhi said that the outbreak of communal riots in Ahemedabad had 	pained him deeply 	and he had told 	Mr. Morarji 	Desai, Bombay’s Home Minister, who 	had come 	to see him before 	his departure 	for Ahmedabad, 	that he (Mr. 	Desai) must go to 	meet the 	flames under the 	sole protection 	of God, 	not that 	of the 	police and 	military. If 	need be, he 	must perish 	in the 	flames in 	the attempt 	to quell 	them as 	the late 	Mr. Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi had done.libtech_476_footnote     The 	Following paragraph is translated from Pyarelal’s Gujarati article 	“Three Pure Sacrifices” Harijanbandhu. 
 Two Hindu workers and a Muslim worker set out to quell the riots and died in the effort. I am not unhappy at their death. I do not weep for them. Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi laid down his life similarly in the Kanpur riots. Friends had warned him: “Do not go in to the riot-affected area. The people there have gone mad. They will kill you.” But Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi was not to be daunted. He was confident that his going would stop the riots. He went there and died at the hands of those who had gone mad. I was happy at his death. I do not say all this to excite you. I want to make you understand that if you but learn how to die all will be well. If enough young men like Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi, Vasantraolibtech_477_footnoteand Rajab Alilibtech_478_footnotecame out, riots could be banished for ever.
 Gandhiji also stated that the Congress Ministry in the Province was there to serve all the communities, but the Ministers could not serve them unless they had the willing co-operation of the people.
 In Ahmedabad, went on Gandhiji, the pride of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, where he had rendered yeoman’s service to the Municipality, Hindus and Muslims had always lived together in peace. But of late, they seemed to be dehumanized.
Today Hindus and Muslims have gone mad and are stabbing
 each other. How shameful and tragic it is! If one of the communities gives up the madness the conflict will cease immediately.libtech_479_footnote
 All the deaths in Ahmedabad were not the result of firing. Many were the results of stabbing and the like. It was a shame that they had to call for the help of the police and the military to prevent them from flying at each other’s throats.libtech_480_footnote
 But you must realize that by seeking the help of the police and the army we become their slaves If we want to have true independence, we should stop relying on them and relying solely on God should learn how to die. That is all we have to do. Many people know how to die after killing others but we have to die without killing anyone.
 If one side ceased to retaliate, the riots could not go on. What did it matter if even a few lakhs were killed in the right manner out of the 40 crores of Indians? If they could learn the lesson of dying without killing, India which was celebrated in legend history as Karmabhoomi—the land of duty—would become a virtual Eden, the image of the Kingdom of Heaven on earth.

286,"July 3, 1946",DISTINCTION BETWEEN HINDI AND URDU,"
    
 
 Shri Ram Naresh Tripathi is well known to me. One day he came to see me at Mussoorie. I had feared that he would reproach me for my propagation of Hindustani. But when I talked to him I found the reverse. He told me that if I cherished the hope that Hindustani would emerge from a blending of Hindi and Urdu, Urdu would be of more help. Only I should become as fully aware of the attempts to distort Urdu by giving it a new look as I am of the attempts to distort Hindi. Hindustani would then come of itself. I asked him to give me illustrations to help me understand what he meant. When he tried to think he found some difficulty in doing so. I then asked him to explain in writing. The result was the following letter which he wrote to me:
 Pujya Bapu,
 You had asked me to explain to you the structural difference between Hindi and Urdu. But it seems to me a matter of experience. I cannot clearly define it. I can venture a suggestion though. Get a paragraph from Harijan translated into Hindi and Urdu by two competent writers. You will know the  difference between the structure of the two languages.
 I had told you that da ythat Urdu was more refined than Hindi. I will give you an example. Here is a sentence from a well-known Hindi writer:
 In Urdu          cannot be used. It is either	or	. No good Urdu writer will ever use an incorrect idiom. If he does so he had to be prepared to engage in a stiff battle. There is no movement for refining Hindi. But rather than such a movement being started it would do Hindi much more good if Urdu books and writings were published in the Devanagari script. In this way Hindi would be benefited by the struggles of the Urdu writers and poets over the last several centuries to improve and polish Urdu. This would automatically transform it into Hindustani.
 This letter deserves consideration. I am a lover of languages but  I am not a linguist. My knowledge of Hindi is barely satisfactory. I did not learn Hindi from any books. I did not have the time for that. My son Devdas who, with my encouragement and my blessings, went to Madras to learn Hindi, knows it far better than I do. There are many others also whom I can name. My knowledge of Urdu is even less than my knowledge of Hindi. I have known the Nagari script
 
 from my childhood. I have learnt the Persian script with considerable effort. As I have not had the practice, I am able to read it only with some difficulty. I manage somehow to write it. Thus my knowledge of Urdu is very rudimentary. What I do have is love and an impartial attitude. Therefore, if God wills it and if I get help from scholars of the two languages, my venture will succeed. I published Tripathiji’s letter only with the idea that he and other would help me in this effort.
 Another lover of Hindi also tells me that hardly has there been such work done for Hindi as there has been for Urdu. If only people would not indulge in a tug of war but would realize that the two languages have a common root in the speech of the millions of our villagers and that it is for this that our scholars and poets have to work, we could quickly march forward.

         POONA,  July 	3, 1946  	Do not bow before the Portuguese Government. Remember that 40 crores 	of Indians are behind you.libtech_486_footnote  Q.	Our 	fight against the 	Portuguese imperialism is 	for the present 	to obtain 	civil liberties. Hence, what is the type of satyagraha that we should offer? A. 	You have to resist through civil disobedience every attack on  	civil liberties. But you should define beforehand what the civil 	libert- ies are for which you are fighting. You cannot ask for 	anything to which you have no moral right. Moreover, your movement 	should be strictly non-violent.  Q. 	The Colonial 	Administration of the 	Portuguese Government 	demands previous 	permission for meetings; 	but we 	want the 	right of 	calling meetings 	even without 	serving notice. A. 	You should have every right to call meetings without notice.  	No self-respecting person can tolerate any hindrance to his doing 	what is morally just. We are free men and we want to hold meetings 	peacefully. For this we cannot give any previous notice. Hence you 	should hold meetings without giving any notice.  Q. 	In case we call a meeting 	and address the people and are arrested, and police allow us to go 	away saying we should come back on any fixed day, are we to agree to 	it? Or should we refuse to quit the police premises, or should we 	come out and defy their bans again? A. 	The police who have the right to arrest you also have the     
 right to let you go. Hence you should go out if you are allowed to do so. You should not insist on being kept under arrest. But once you go out you can defy the ban again. In case any day is fixed for your reappearance before the police, you are bound as gentlemen to do so.
 Q.	How should people act when a satyagrahi is arrested?
 A. There should be no demonstration or disturbance of any kind if a satyagrahi is arrested. The people should be peaceful and offer themselves either individually or collectively to be arrested. I am not for hartal and such other things if anyone is arrested. After all you should know that a satyagrahi courts arrest of his own accord, and if the people wish to do anything at all, it should be to follow his example. As for demonstrations, etc., they will come at a later stage.
 Q.	How to defy the pre-censorship of Press?
 A. This is really difficult but there are two solutions which I can offer. The first one is the one followed by me in South Africa. It is to issue handwritten bulletins which volunteers should sell openly. These bulletins should contain defiant news exposing the Government. It is better if the people who write out, sign their full names at the bottom of each bulletin. If many of you join together it won’t be difficult to take out several copies. Let the Government arrest the people con- cerned, others can continue the work. The other way open to you is to get printed matter from outside and distribute it openly.
 Q.	How to defy the ban on organizations?
 A. Start as many organizations as you like and begin working  in their name.
 Q.	How should people react in case the Government takes recourse to shooting, etc.?
A. It is better to die bravely than exist under such repugnant
conditions. Let the people say: ‘All right, shoot us!’
 Q.	How should a satyagrahi keep up his morale when subjected to torture?
 A. The satyagrahi must not wince. He should submit to every form of torture.
 Q. What should be the attitude of a satyagrahi towards the Catholic Church in  Goa when it becomes an active agency of oppression in the hands of the Portuguese rulers?
A.    It is better to leave religion alone. But if it really plays into
 the hands of oppressors, then it is your duty to oppose it in the same way as you would oppose any oppressive regime. But be against it
 only to the extent to which it hinders your cause.
 Now I have answered all your questions, and I want that you should show your courage and should not allow the movement to fizzle out. Even if no one is prepared for sacrifice it is the duty of anyone who feels the wrong to oppose it without waiting for others to follow. [If] you rot in prison, the eyes of the others will be opened some time or other. As for myself I would not have remained for a moment in Goa without breaking such inhuman laws.
 You have all my blessings and I promise you I will exert all my influence to see that the Indian National Congress is interested in Goa and that Goa comes on the map of India. Only show courage; I  admire it.

294,"July 3, 1946",SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING libtech_487_footnote,"
    
 POONA,
 July 3, 1946
 Addressing the prayer gathering today, Gandhiji referred to the situation in Ahmedabad, and stated that the latest report was that the situation was well in hand. Shri Morarji Desai had invited the representatives of Muslims, Hindus and others to a joint conference at Ahmedabad and had told them that he was prepared to withdraw the police and military if they so desired. But the latter, he heard, had unanimously replied that they were not prepared to take the risk. The result was the police and military were there. The authorities had promulgated a curfew order for three days to be enforced day and night. Therefore although as a result, the disturbances had been arrested, the peace that was seen in Ahmedabad today was the peace of the grave.
 It was something, he added, of which no one could be proud. How he wished that both the Hindus and Muslims would combine and dispense with the help of the police and military for purposes of keeping them from mutual fight. The State could not suddenly disband them, but they could certainly reserve them for purposes of regulating the traffic, municipal sanitation and growing more food to combat the famine. He reminded them that so long as they depended upon the help of the police and military for maintaining law and order, real independence must remain a mere idle talk. They daily joined him in prayers. The essence of prayer was reliance on God and utter fearlessness.
 Gandhiji said that he would not say that the situation in South Africa was
 
 deteriorating. But it was certainly becoming graver. The Government repression was becoming worse. That was, however, part of the bargain. A satyagrahi breaks the law and welcomes the penalty.
 Referring to the arrest and conviction of Parsee Sorabjee to three months’ rigorous imprisonment, he described how as a young lad of sixteen he had given proof of unusual courage in the course of the satyagraha movement which  he  conducted in South Africa. A mounted policeman threatened to overrun the passive resisters. Sorabjee held the reins of the horse and told the policeman that he could not frighten the satyagrahis into submission by such tactics.libtech_488_footnoteHe was a worthy son of a worthy father, the late Parsee Rustomjee, both for his bravery and munificence.
 Gandhiji paid a glowing tribute to Rev. Scott of Johannesburg whose  Christian conscience had revolted against the inequality of the segregation law and the ill-treatment to which the passive resisters were being subjected. As a protest against it, Rev. Scott had decided to cast in his lot with the satyagrahis and share with them the indignities to which they were being subjected. It was no small thing for a white man to identify himself with coloured people in South Africa. If the satyagrahis remained free and non-violent till the end, all would be well with them. He had already told the audience their duty in this connection, that is, a heart-felt prayer to God to give strength to the satyagrahis and light to the whites.

I see no difficulty about it and I 	think no Harijan worker will have any objection to it. But the 	painful thing is that custom transgresses the law. Untouchability 	has found refuge more in custom than in law.  	In fact, as far as I know, there is absolutely no basis for untouch- 	ability in law but under the present judicial system, however evil 	it may be, custom acquires the strength of law. Take, for instance, 	the “age  of  consent”libtech_493_footnotelibtech_494_footnote. Now a days the Government has even  stopped enforcing 	it because people no longer abide by it. It means that a law which 	is ahead of public opinion ceases to be observed. Nevertheless a 	Bill has to be brought up. Its implementation will depend largely 	upon the courage of caste Hindus and Harijans. Your law pundits will 	have to be careful of the word ‘Harijan’.

 By the time you will receive this letter it will be the last date of filling in nomination forms for the candidateships for the Constituent Assembly, which has, it is learnt, to be completed by the end of this month. Congress is proposing particular M. L. As and non-M. L. As for the same. It is believed that Scheduled Castes are also to be represented (adequately?). But is there any proposal from you or from Congress to elect adequate or at least some  members from the Mehtar Community who, I am sure, will discharge their duty of citizenship and pick up their legitimate share in the future constituion of Free India?
  Generous 	as you are towards us, may I assure myself 	and my community 	that Mehtar seats in 	the Constituent 	Assembly will not 	escape your notice?  Who 	will be 	the components of 	the Advisory Board? Caste 	Hindus or Minorities 	including (?) the Scheduled Castes?  Will 	the advice 	or proposals 	of the Advisory 	Board be binding 	to the 	Constituent Assembly? 	I think 	they will not. If 	so, what 	sense is 	there in 	appointing such a 	Board, which will be 	nonentity if 	the Constituent 	Assembly were 	not to 	pay heed 	to its 	advice? Is 	it not merely 	for the appeasement 	of the 	weak minorities? 
 You might say you have been [doing] and will do everything for us, but I wish to say ‘let us be with you when everything for us is to be done. Let us be represented democratically.’
 I strongly hope that my questions will be fully  and  satisfactorily answered by you with an obligation of immediate reply to me. I further humbly request you to be good enough to publish your answers in your weekly Harijan.
 Hope to be excused for troubles.
 I have reproduced the foregoing in order to show what havoc dangerous knowledge of English has produced in our society. This is a specimen not of English nor yet of Indian English. It is bookish English which the writer probably half understands. I suggest to him that if he had written to me in the national language Hindustani or in his provincial language, it would not have evoked an unfavourable response from me.
 The writer has paid me a left-handed compliment and that perhaps in order to teach me how to express my love for the Bhangi, otherwise known as Mehtar. The writer is a discontented graduate,
 
 setting no example or a bad example to Bhangis. He has isolated himself from them, though he professes to represent them.
 He will certainly become my teacher if he will be a graduate in the art of being a good Bhangi. I very much fear that he does no scavenging himself; he does not know what scientific scavenging is. If he became an expert in the art, his services would be wanted by all the cities of India. When Bhangis really rise from the slumber of ages, they will successfully sweep the Augean stables everywhere and India will be a pattern of cleanliness and there will be in India no plague and other diseases which are the descendants of filth and dirt.
 In the place where I am living in Bombay, my room and the ad- joining lavatory are fairly clean, but I am in the midst of suffocating dirt. I have had no time to examine the tenements in front of me. They are as crowded and as dirty as the ones in the quarters where I was living in New Delhi. Had my graduate fellow Bhangi been an expert in the art, I would, without doubt, have requisitioned  his  services as my guide and helper.
 As it is, not only have I no use for him, I have to risk his dis- pleasure by telling him that he should not think of the Constituent Assembly or other assemblies. Let those go to them who are wanted there. Instead of getting rid of the wretched caste mentality, he argues that any Harijan is not good enough for the purpose but preference should be given to the Mehtar caste. I suggest to him that it is a harmful method, doing no good to anybody.
 Anyway, he has expected the impossible from me. I am not made for these big institutions. I have never interested myself in the periodical assembly elections. I have not attended Working Committee meetings where they make these selections. What I know  of the present selections is from the newspapers. I have become a Bhangi because I think that that is the vocation of every Hindu, that the hoary institution of untouchability as we know it today in its ugly shape will die a decent death only when the Hindus will be  casteless  by becoming Bhangis from the bottom of their hearts. That cannot be done by aspiring after the membership my correspondent has in view.

302,"July 6, 1946",‘ALL ABOUT BHANDARS’ libtech_500_footnote,"
    
 An article under the above caption appeared in the  Khadi  Patrika of 3rd June. As it is important I give it in full below:
 It is our intention to make rapid changes in the running of our bhandars. In spite of the condition of yarn currency attaching to the sales of khadi, Bombay people have not yet taken to spinning. Most of the yarn given in exchange for cloth is bought. From the 1st of July, we shall give only Rs. 2 worth of khadi for one hank and, as a result, the sales of khadi will go down. One of the main reasons for khadi sales is that mill-cloth is rationed. Many persons who ordinarily wear mill-cloth are almost forced, as it were, to buy khadi. We take a statement from every customer as to whether the yarn given in is self-spun or spun by a member of the family or staff. But we have regretfully to admit that many customers do not appreciate their responsibility in the matter of making accurate statements. This irresponsible attitude is not in the best interests of khadi. Khadi production aims at self-sufficiency of village India. Other provinces will, therefore, now provide less and less cloth to our bhandars. The use of the words ‘sale of khadi’ is really inconsistent with the ideal. In the circumstances it is imperative for us to make timely changes in the running of bhandars. From July 1st we are closing two branches in Matunga and Dadar. For the last three months we have been giving training in Matunga in all the processes of khadi. In Dadar, there was some sale of khadi too, but these activities must now come to an end. In Girgaum, in the Khadi Printing Shop, the A. I. S. A. was running a training centre too. This shop will now be handed back to the trustees of the Khadi Printing Shop who will continue to give instruction in all the processes of khadi as well as arrange for some sales.
 The reduction of work involves dispensing with the services of fifteen workers.
 Ever since the new policy came into vogue, Gandhiji has been saying that the make-up of the bhandars must be changed. In order to fall into line we arranged facilities for teaching and weaving in some places but such outward changes have not connoted the real change. We felt that a change in our mental outlook is what was most needed. Therefore, examination of workers and such other reforms came into force.
 Nevertheless all the changes mentioned above have not enabled us to gain our object. At the time when customers looked upon khadi as being in the fashion, bhandars were purely commercial depots. Today the bhandar desires
 
 to bring about a change in the mentality of the khadi-wearer. It no longer desires to remain a sales depot. It desires to become a centre for imparting knowledge in all the processes of khadi manufacture. It desires to become a centre of attraction for weavers and other craftsmen. To this end we must continue undeterred to bring about the necessary changes and pari passu change the outlook of Bombay khadi-wearers. Then only will bhandars reflect the reality. We expect the customers of Bombay to remain loyal to us in our endeavour.
Readers will note that the success of the purpose, as expressed in the
article, rests on the faith, intelligence and capability of the workers.

AFRICAN STRUGGLElibtech_502_footnote","
    
 BOMBAY,
 July 6, 1946 This meeting of the A.I.C.C., while it is grieved that it  has become imperative for the Indian settlers in South Africa once more
to offer Satyagraha in the land of its birth against a law imposing on
 them a colour bar far more sinister than the one against which they had put up a brave fight between 1907 and 1914, congratulates the handful of satyagrahis on their brave but unequal action against heavy odds.
 This meeting is pleased to find that doctors and such other men and women are at the head of the gallant struggle and that among them are represented Parsis, Christians, Muslims and Hindus. This meeting is also pleased to find that a few white men like the Rev. Scottlibtech_503_footnotehave thrown in their lot with the satyagrahis.
 This meeting condemns the action of some white men in resorting to the barbarous method known as lynch law to terrorize the satyagrahis into submission to the humiliating legislation. It is worthy
 
 of note that a large part of the Indians are born and bred in South Africa, to whom India exists only in their imagination. These colonial- born Indians have adopted European manners and customs and English has become like their mother tongue.
 This meeting notes with great satisfaction that the Indian resis- ters are keeping their struggle free from violence in any shape or form and conducting it with dignity and without rancour and that they are thus suffering not only for their self-respect but for the honour of India, and by their heroic resistance setting a noble example to all the exploited people of the earth.
 This meeting assures the Indian settlers of South Africa  of India’s full support in this unequal struggle and is firmly of opinion that persistence in it is bound to crown their effort with success.
 This meeting appeals to His Excellency the Viceory to use all his endeavours and ensure that of the British Government in aid of this struggle and invites the European residents of India to raise their voice in protest against white hooliganism and the anti-Asiatic and anti-colour legislation of South Africa.

306,"July 6, 1946",SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING,"
    
 BOMBAY,
 July 6, 1946
 
 At the end of the prayer, Gandhiji asked how many Harijans were present in the hall. Not a hand went up. It was a great disappointment for him, Gandhiji said. He had come to live in a Harijan quarter because he had become a Bhangi. But there was not even one Harijan there.
I blame you and not those who are absent.
 The reason for their absence is that the so-called caste Hindus have kept down the so-called untouchables for ages and that too in the name of religion. This hall is meant for the use of Harijans. Non- Harijans can come only by grace. Those who come here should make it a point to bring at least one Harijan each. If they befriend the Harijans, untouchability will disappear in the twinkling of an eye.
 But he was grieved to find that they had not really done so. There were Harijan Barristers and lawyers. Even today, they could not live in the bungalows on Malabar
 Hill. There was a Harijan volunteer girl working in his camp. She was studying in the
 B. A. class. There was nothing in her appearance to distinguish her from other girls. Why should the knowledge that she is a Harijan make her an untouchable to be treated differently from other girls?
 Proceeding, Gandhiji said that he was embarrassed by the care and attention that was being lavished on him by those who were in charge of the management of the camp. Yet he was finding his stay very taxing. There was so much dirt and filth about the place. Dr. Dinshaw had told him that the lavatories were so dirty that he could not use them. There were so many flies about the place that he was anxious that he (Gandhiji) might catch some infection and get killed. He himself was not worried about that. Although the two doctors with him looked after him, he did not depend on anyone except God. The Almighty would take care of his health. But his companions did not have that faith in God.
 He had brought with him a big party, Gandhiji went on. They were there to render personal services and to help him with the editing of his weeklies and his correspondence. He was anxious for them. He himself had been given a good clean lavatory. But all the party could not use it. He had been thinking that if he came here again, he should stay here all by himself. He was occupying the house of the overseer. He had been wondering why those in charge of sanitation, that is, the Municipality and the P. W. D., should put up with this filth. What was the use of his coming and staying there if it could not induce them to make the place healthy and hygienic?
 What was the connection between all this and the prayer, asked Gandhiji. A man who did not observe the rules of external cleanliness could not pray for internal cleanliness. If the object of their attending the prayer was idle curiosity, they had committed a sin by coming. If they had come to join in the prayer, they must pray for inner and outer cleanliness. To say one thing and to do something different would be deception. No one could deceive God, because he was omnipresent and omniscient.

 BOMBAY,
 July 7, 1946
 I have often said that man plans but the success of his plans depends not on him but on the will of Providence which is the  supreme arbiter of our destinies. Unlike you, I am [here] not in my own right but on sufferance. I have been told that some of my previous remakrs about the Cabinet Mission’s proposals have caused a good deal of confusion in the public mind. As a satyagrahi it is always my endeavour to speak the whole truth and nothing but the truth. I never wish to hide anything from you. I hate mental reser-vations. But language is at best an imperfect medium of ex-pression. No man can fully express in words what he feels or thinks. Even seers and prophets of old have suffered under that disability.
 I have not seen what has appeared in the papers about what I am supposed to have said regarding the Cabinet Mission’s proposals. I cannot read all the newspapers myself. I content myself with perusing only what my co-workers and assistants may place before me. I hold that I have lost nothing thereby. Because of what has appeared in the Press, an impression seems to have been created that I said one thing at Delhi and am saying something different now. I did say in one of my speeches at Delhi in regard to the Cabinet Mission’s proposals that I saw darkness where I saw light before.libtech_505_footnotelibtech_506_footnotelibtech_507_footnoteThat darkness has not yet lifted. If possible it has deepened. I could have asked the Working Committee to turn down the proposals  about  the  Constituent Assembly if I could see my way clearly. You know my relations with the members of the Working Committee. Babu Rajendra Prasad might have been a High Court Judge, but he chose instead to act as my interpreter and clerk in Champaran.libtech_508_footnotelibtech_509_footnoteThen there is the Sardar.

 even flaunts it as a compliment. He is a stormy petrel. Once he used to dress and dine in the Western style. But ever since he decided to cast his lot with me my word has been law to him. But even he cannot see eye to eye with me in this matter. They both tell me that whereas on all previous occasions I was able to support my instinct with reason and satisfy their head as well as heart, this time I have failed to do so. I told them in reply that whilst my own heart was filled with misgivings, I could not adduce any reason for it or else I would have asked them to reject the proposals straightway. It was my duty to place my misgivings before them to put them on their guard. But they should examine what I had said in the cold light of reason and accept my view-point only if they were convinced of its correctness. Their decision, which they have arrived at after prolonged deliberations and which is almost unanimous, is before you. The members of the Working Committee are your faithful and tried servants. You should not lightly reject their resolution.
 I am willing to admit that the proposed Constituent Assembly is not the Parliament of the people. It has many defects. But you are all seasoned and veteran fighters. A soldier is never afraid of danger. He revels in it. If there are shortcomings in the proposed Constituent Assembly, it is for you to get them removed. It should be a challenge to combat, not a ground for rejection. I am surprised that Shri Jayaprakash Narayan said yesterdaylibtech_510_footnotelibtech_511_footnotethat it would be dangerous to participate in the proposed Constituent Assembly and therefore they should reject the Working Committee’s resolution. I was not prepared to hear such defeatist language from the lips of a tried fighter like Jayaprakash. One line from a song composed by the late Choudhary Rambhaj Dutt has always made a very deep appeal to me. It means: “We will never be defeated—nay, not even in death.” That is the spirit in which I expect you to approach this resolution. A satyagrahi knows no defeat.
 Nor would I expect a satyagrahi to say that whatever Englishmen do must be bad. The English are not necessarily bad. There are good men and bad men among the English people as  among any other people. We ourselves are not free from defects. The English could not have risen to their present strength if they had not some good in them. They have come and exploited India, because we quarrelled amongst ourselves and allowed ourselves to be exploited.
 
 
 In God’s world unmixed evil never prospers. God rules even where Satan seems to hold sway, because the latter exists only on His suffe- rance. Some people say that satyagraha is of no avail against a person who has no moral sense. I join issue with that. The stoniest heart must melt if we are true and have enough patience. A satyagrahi lays down his life, but never gives up. That is the meaning of the “Do or die” slogan. That slogan does not mean ‘Kill or be killed’. That would be wilful distortion and travesty of its true meaning. The true meaning is that we must do our duty and die in the course of perfor-ming it if necessary.To die without killing is the badge of a satyagrahi. If we had lived up to that ideal we would have won swaraj by now. But our ahimsa was lame. It walked on crutches. Even so it has brought us to our present strength.I know what happened in 1942. You will perhaps say that it was sabotage and underground activity that had brought the country to its present strength. It cannot be denied that sabotage activity was carried on in the name of the Congress during the ’42 struggle but I deny in toto that the strength of the masses is due to that. Whatever strength the masses have is due entirely to ahimsa however imperfect or defective its practice might have been. Our ahimsa was imperfect because we were imperfect, because it was presented to you by an imperfect being like myself. If then, even in the hands of imperfect instruments it could produce such brilliant results, what could it not have achieved in the hands of a perfect satyagrahi?
 In 1942 our people showed great valour. But greater valour will be required of us before our goal is reached. We have done much, but more remains to be done. For that we must have patience and humility and detachment. You should try to understand what happened  in 1942, the inner meaning of that struggle and the  reason  why  it stopped short where it did.
 This is no time for dalliance or ease. I told Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru that he must wear the crown of thorns for the sake of the nation and he has agreed.libtech_512_footnoteThe Constituent Assembly is going to be no bed of roses for you but only a bed of thorns. You may not shirk it.
 That does not mean that everybody should want to go into it. Only those should go there who are especially fitted for the task by virtue of their legal training or special talent. It is not a prize to be
 
 sought as a reward for sacrifices, but a duty to be faced even like mounting the gallows or sacrifice of one’s all at the altar of service.
 There is another reason why you should join the Constituent Assembly. If you asked me whether in the event of your rejecting the proposed Constituent Assembly or the Constituent Assembly failing to materialize, I would advise the people to launch civil disobedience, individual or mass, or undertake a fast myself, my reply is ‘No’. I believe in walking alone. I came alone in this world, I have walked alone in the valley of the shadow of death and I shall quit alone when the time comes. I know I am quite capable of launching satyagraha even if I am all alone. I have done so before. But this is no occasion for a fast or civil disobedience. I regard the Constituent Assembly as the substitute of satyagraha. It is constructive satyagraha.
 The alternative is constructive work which you have never done justice to. If you had, you would have today got the Constituent Assem-bly of Jayaprakash’s dream instead of the present one. But a satyagrahi cannot wait or delay action till perfect conditions are forthcoming. He will act with whatever material is at hand, purge it of dross and convert it into pure gold. Whatever may be the defects in the State Document of May 16th, I have no doubt as to the honesty of those who have framed it. They know they have got to quit. They want to quit in an orderly manner. And to that end  they  have produced the Document they could under the circumstances. I refuse to believe that they came all the way from England to deceive us.
 A polish ladylibtech_513_footnotelibtech_514_footnotehas  sent  me  a   note  just  today  saying  that  all Europeans had received secret instructions to leave India as the British army would no longer be able to give them adequate protection. If it is so, it is a sad reflection on us. We would be unworthy of the name of satyagrahi if even an English child did not feel secure in our midst. Even if we succeed in driving out the Europeans by these tactics, something worse will take their place. Our Quit India Resolutionlibtech_515_footnotelibtech_516_footnotehas no malice about it. It only means that we will no longer be exploited.
 Let us not be cowardly, but approach out task with confidence and courage. Let not the fear of being deceived dismay us. No one can deceive a satyagrahi. Never mind the darkness that fills my mind
 
 
 
 He will turn it into light.libtech_517_footnote
 Continuing, Mahatma Gandhi referred to the draft resolution on the satyagraha movement now being carried on by Indians in South Africa. He said that the Indians  in South Africa were being ill-treated not because they were not whites but because they were considered as coolies. The Indians in South Africa spoke English and many of them were doctors and lawyers. In spite of all this, the South African whites looked upon them as coolies and called them as such. The Indians, of course, were in a minority and yet they were putting up a brave fight. They had no swords or guns but they were determined to resist the anti-Indian laws by soul force, which was the only force available to satyagrahis. Durban owed its present prosperity to the Indians. The South African whites had agreed to give the Indians the vote though not as equals but as inferiors.
 The white civilization in South Africa could not be kept alive by such means. Mahatma Gandhi wondered how a brave man like General Smuts who had praised the Indians of their elementary rights.libtech_518_footnote
 Commenting on the doings of the white hooligans who were said to have beaten to death an Indian, whom they mistook for a satyagrahi, Gandhiji remarked:
 It is a sad event. Nevertheless, I feel happy. A satyagrahi must always be ready to die with a smile on his face without retaliation and without rancour in his heart. Some people have come to have a wrong notion that satyagraha means only jail-going, perhaps facing lathi blows and nothing more Such satyagraha cannot bring independence. To win independence you have to learn the art of dying without killing.
 I venture to submit that a civilization which  needs  such barbarous legislation for its protection is a contradiction in terms. The Indians are fighting for their honour. The land in South Africa does not belong to the whites. Land belongs to one who labours on it. I would not shed a single tear if all the satyagrahis in South Africa are wiped out. Thereby they will not only bring deliverance to themselves but point the way to the Negroes and vindicate the honour of India. I am proud of them and so should you be.
 His object in speaking to them, he continued, was not to move them to tears or to incite them to anger and vituperation against the whiters. Rather they should pray to God to guide the whites aright and grant strength and courage to their brethern to remain steadfast to the end.
The South African struggle may appear to be insignificant
 
 today but it is charged with momentous consequences. Satyagraha is today being tried in the land of its birth. The success of a handful of Indians, mostly descendants of indentured labourers, has excited the jealousy of the whites of South Africa. And they are now subjecting them to unspeakable indignities. They are sought to be segregated into ghettos and further humiliated by being offered an inferior franchise. That all this should happen under the imprimatur of Field Marshal Smuts fills me with shame and humiliation. Our sins have a strange way of coming home to roost. We turned a portion of our- selves into pariahs and today the whites of South Africa are doing the same to our compatriots there. Let us purge ourselves of this curse and bless the heroic struggle of our brethern in South Africa. They do not need our monetary help. But they need all our sympathy and moral support.libtech_519_footnote

 Gandhiji was gloomy about the world situation. He thought that there would be another war in less than ten years’ time.
 As for the atom bomb Gandhiji did not agree with the correspondent’s sugges- tion that its frightfulness would force non-violence on the world. On the contrary Gandhiji’s view was that the “Violent man’s eyes light up with the prospect of much greater amount of destruction and death which he would now wreak.”
 Gandhiji told the correspondent that “there would be no real freedom in India until the untouchables were free”. He, however, pointed out that untouchables suffered from no legal disabilities like the Negroes in the United States and the Indians and other Asiatics in South Africa.

 BOMBAY,
 July 8, 1946
 Speaking at the prayer meeting this evening, Mahatma Gandhi congratulated the audience on their exemplary silence during the prayer.
 Gandhiji drew pointed attention to the insanitation of the chawls around. Dr. Shushila Nayyar and Dr. Dinshaw Mehta had inspected the chawls at his request. They
 
 had reported to him that the filth and dirt that they saw were unbearable. In several places, the drain pipes were choked, with the result that they did not function properly. In other places, the drains overhead were leaking to the discomfort of those living below. There was great scarcity of water. Excepting for two or three hours during the day, the taps were not running. Flush latrines were worse than useless under such conditions. It was a wonder to him how anyone could use such filthy latrines. The arrangement for collection and disposal of refuse were most unsatisfactory. The open refuse tins emitted a foul smell.
 The overcrowding in the chawls was appalling. It was the duty of those in authority to improve the sanitary conditions of the chawls and if the municipality failed in its duty, it was the right of the people to demand redress even by offering satyagraha. The owners of the chawls and the overseers and the managing staff should all do their utmost to rectify the wrong.
 Gandhiji felt ashamed and hurt to find that his residence was being guarded by the police day and night. It was a matter of shame for them also. They should tell the police that he was in their charge and that they would look after him. The Harijans had cause to feel bitter about the caste Hindus and therefore, against him too, thought he had become a Bhangi. If they were angry with him also and vented their anger on him,  he would feel no rancour against them. He had been doing his utmost to explain to the caste Hindus and the Harijans their respective duties. The Harijans, however, could well feel bitter towards him, because with all his efforts, untouchability had not disappeared root and branch.

313,"July 9, 1946",THE REAL DANGER,"
    
 As during the two days of the session of the A. I. C. C. in Bombay I listened to some of the spirited speeches against the Working Committee’s resolution submitted the A. I. C. C. for ratifi- cation, I could not subscribe to the dangers portrayed by the opposi- tion. No confirmed satyagrahi is dismayed by the dangers, seen or unseen, from his opponent’s side. What he must fear, as every army must, is the danger from within.
 Opposition, however eloquent it may be, will defeat its purpose if it is not well informed, balanced and well based and does not promise action and result more attractive than what is opposed. Let the opposition at the late meeting answer.
 My purpose here is merely to point out the danger from within. The first in importance is laziness of mind and body. This comes out of the smug satisfaction that Congressmen having suffered imprison- ment have nothing more to do to win freedom and that a grateful organization should reward their service by giving them first preference in the matter of elections and offices. And so, there is an unseemly and vulgar competition for gaining what are described as prize posts. Here there is a double fallacy. Nothing should be considering a prize in the Congress dictionary and imprisonment is its own reward. It is the preliminary examination of a satyagrahi. Its goal is the slaughter-house even as that of the spotless lamb. Jail-going is, instead, being used as a passport to every office accessible to the Congress. Hence there is every prospect of a satyagrahi’s imprisonment becoming a degrading occupation like that of pro- fessional thieves and robbers. No wonder my friends of the under- ground variety avoid imprisonment as being comparatively a bed of roses. This is a pointer to the pass the Congress is coming to.
 The friends who opposed the resolution on the British Cabinet Delegation’s proposals do not seem to know what they are aiming at. Is independence to be bought at the price of a bloody revolution as was, say, the French, the Soviet or even the English? Then frank and honest work has yet to begin. They have to tread a very dangerous path in openly making the Congress such an institution. My argument has no force if subterranean activity is a doctrine of univer-sal application and is now being employed against the Congress. The very thought repels me. I should hope for the sake of my own sanity that the thought is devoid of any foundation. Then it is clearly their duty to say to the Congressmen that now that there is Congress Raj or Representative Raj, whether of the Congress variety or the Muslim League, they must set about reforming it in detail and not condemn it in toto. Total non-violent non-co-operation has no place in popular Raj, whatever its level may be.
 Who is responsible for the mad orgy in Madura and, coming nearer, in Ahmedabad? It will be folly to attribute everything evil to British machinations.This senseless theory will perpetuate foreign domination, not necessarily British. The British will go in any case. They want to go in an orderly manner as is evident to me from the State Paper or they will go and leave India to her own fate assuming that India has forsaken the path of non-violence with the certain result of a combined intervention of an assortment of armed powers. Let the
 opposition say to the Congressmen what kind of independence they want. Congressmen in general certainly do not know the kind of independence they want. They recite the formula almost parrot-like. Or, their notion of independence is fully expressed in saying that they mean by it Congress Raj. And they won’t be wrong. They have left further thinking to the Working Committee—a most undemocratic way. In true democracy every man and woman is taught to think for himself or herself. How this real revolution can be brought about I do not know except that every reform like charity must begin at home.
 If then the Constituent Assembly fizzles out, it will not be because the British are wicked every time. It will be because we are fools or, shall I say, even wicked? Whether we are fools or wicked or both, I am quite clear that we must look for danger from within, not fear the danger from without. The first corrodes the soul, the second polishes.

315,"July 	9, 1946",LETTER TO G. E. B. ABELL,"
         DEAR 	MR. ABELL,           CAMP BOMBAY,  July 	9, 1946 
  	I quote below from a letter of a Polish ladylibtech_527_footnotewhom I have known for years:     
 There are now about 5,000 Polish evacuees in India. They have been supported first by the Polish and then by the British Government. Now it is reported that they will be taken over by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. About 3,600 of them will soon be joining their families, also soldiers in Britain. About 1,400 have been evacuated, we do not yet know where. There is a tendency on the part of the  Indian Government to evacuate all the Europeans from India in a hurry. Even those of the Poles who are working in different parts of India and require no charity and who are quite useful to the country in their present jobs will be compelled to leave India, much against their will. Among other reasons, the Government representatives give the unwillingness of Indians to have foreigners in their midst. Out of the 5,000 Poles here, only 77 are reported to be ready to return to Poland in her present position of utter slavery and terrorist regime.
You will oblige me if you could kindly inform me whether there
is any truth in the statement of my correspondent.

316,"July 10, 1946",SUCCESS OF THE NEW TEAM,"
  Gandhiji’s 	Correspondence with the Government, 1944-47, p. 	87         	The success of the new teamlibtech_528_footnotedepends as much upon the manner in which it carries 	out the work as upon the manners of the old. If the new team breaks 	with the old, it is bound to fail even like a son who repudiates the 	inheritance left by his father. It is also bound to fail if those 	who have retired do not help their successors in every possible way. 	They were selected by Maulana Saheb not in order to give them 	importance but by reason of their services in their own provinces. A 	servant does not cease to be a servant when he gives place to 	another for the sake of accession of new blood or some other similar 	and cogent reason. It is to be hoped therefore that the old ones 	will give the new ones the full benefit of their experience. The 	most striking change is the retirement of the General Secre-    
 tary who had held the post for an unbroken period of ten years. His help will be required constantly by his successorslibtech_529_footnotewho are new to the office and the new members of the Working Committee. I know they will get all the help they need from Acharya Kripalani. It is a good thing a woman fills for the first time in the history of the Congress the post of General Secretary. Shrimati Mridula Sarabhai was one of the pupils of Acharya Kripalani in the initial stage of the career of the Gujarat Vidyapith. Therefore, she will have full guidance from her acharya in the difficult task to which she is called.
 To those to whom the change may give cause for misgivings, I would say that Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru himself makes a find and stable bridge between the old and the new, assisted as he will be by some of the ablest members of the old team. No one need therefore entertain any fear of a break with the past. A healthy circulation is as necessary for the body politic as for the individual.

           POONA, 
  July 	10, 1946  	I know what is taking place there because in a way I belong to South 	Africa, having passed 20 years of the best part of my life there. It 	was there that satyagraha was born. The West is passing through a 	purgatory today. The vanquished lie prostrate at the feet  of  the 	victors. But those who have won the war have found that they are no 	more victors than those who have lost it. Yet it is not in the World 	War II that the Western civilization will have met its grave. It is 	being dug in South Africa. The white civilization in South Africa 	looks black in contrast with the coloured or the Asiatic 	civilization which is compara- tively white. If our people remain 	steadfast and non-violent till the end, I have not a shadow of doubt 	that their heroic struggle will drive the last nail into the coffin 	of Western civilization which is being found out in its true colours 	in South Africa.      The 	Hindu, 12-7-1946. 
 The whites in South Africa are becoming like brutes. Eastern and Western cultures are pitted against each other. And what a contrast they present! The whites have enacted savage laws to force the Indians to live in ghettos. Field Marshal Smuts is a great philosopher. He calls me his friend. He has nothing to say against Asiatic culture. But he has to take measures to safeguard the white civilization. He told me that he did not look down upon coloured people. The fact that Mrs. Subbaroyan, when she went to England for studies stayed in Field Marshal Smuts’ house supports that statement. But, said the Field Marshal, in spite of the absence of prejudice, he was bound to protect Western culture in South Africa and he hoped that an understanding man that I was, I would appreciate it.
 Gandhiji failed to understand how a culture or civilization worth the name could require legal protection. The Indians were resisting the ghetto law in a civil, i. e., non-violent and therefore civilized, way. They welcomed the penalty for the breach of law which could not be morally defended. But the white hooligans too were breaking their own laws. Theirs was crminal disobedience. It was a matter of pride for India that the children of indentured labourers and traders—many of them descendants  of Harijans—were proving themselves such brave satyagrahis. As against this the whites were resorting to lynch law. He remarked:
After all civil resistance had its birth in Asia. Jesus was an
 Asiatic. If he was reborn and went to South Africa today and lived there, he would have to live in a ghetto.
 He hoped that as in 1914, Field Marshal Smuts would at long last realize that he could not persecute the Indians in South Africa for ever and come to an honourable settlement with them when he had tried them through and through. A committee of white men had been formed in South Africa to express sympathy with identify themselves with the cause of the Indian passive resisters there. There was something of that kind in his time also. But this time it seemed to be on a bigger scale. If this becomes extensive and the hooliganism is stopped and anti-Asiatic laws are repealed, there is hope of a blending of Eastern and Western cultures. Otherwise South Africa may prove to be the grave of Western civilization.

  	I am sorry that I am able only today to deal with your kind letter 	of 5th ultimo about sterilization of lepers. All the major 	principles mentioned in your letter are certainly commendable. 	Steri- lization stands apart. Being a permanent disablement, it 	seems to be a highly deplorable measure. Its total effect on the 	delicate human system is still unknown. Man, in his hurry to secure 	immu-nity from outside, ignores the effect of his action on fellow 	man. I therefore, incline towards Dr. Cochrane’s view that the 	real remedy  lies  in people gaining the right knowledge about 	leprosy and over-coming their hereditary but understandable 	repugnance towards lepers, whose power of infecting their neighbours 	is probably no greater than that of many other infectious cases.

    Giving 	the latest news from South Africa to the prayer gathering, Mahatma 	Gandhi said that men and women from Johannesburg had gone to Durban 	to offer satyagraha. It was good news. Victory was sure if they kept 	up that spirit. 
 Referring next to the meetings of the A. I. S. A. and the Kasturba Trust which he had attended in the afternoon, Gandhiji mentioned that the A. I. S. A. had distributed five crores of rupees on an average of Rs. 25 lakhs per year among the poor spinners and weavers. It had done a lot, but compared to the task before it, its achievement appeared insignificant. It had to clothe the whole of India with khadi as was the case once upon a time. Not only did India produce enough cloth for herself, she was also able to export it. There were no mills in India then. He said:
I might say that every woman had her own mill in the charkha
 and the takli.
 Modern mills were evolved from the charkha. Man was a mixture of divine and devilish forces. The force behind the spinning-wheel was divine, devoid of any trace of exploitation. The foreigner saw the hidden possibilities that were in it and, by the application of steam and electricity, created mills and used them as instruments of exploitation of the simple races of the earth.
 This represented the power of the devil. There were so many cloth-mills in India and yet India went about almost naked. There was scarcity of cloth all over the world. The Prime Minister of the Indonesian Republic Dr. Sultan  Sjahrir, had  informed Pandit Nehru that they had surplus rice which they would gladly send to India to help meet the threat of famine. In return, they wanted no money, but would be glad to have cloth as they were suffering from cloth shortage themselves. They had neithter cloth-mills nor had they taken to the wheel. Pandit Nehru had broached the matter to some mill-owners who gladly gave quantities of cloth for despatch to Java. If out of the 40 crores of India, even 20 crores in her seven lakh villages took to spinning for one or two hours a day, they could not only clothe the population of the villages but even supply cloth for the cities. The conviction had dawned upon him even before he came to India that the revival of hand-spinning alone could restore India to its pristine glory. He had since compared the spinning-wheel to the central sun round which the solar system of village economy revolved. It provided the golden bridge between the rich and the poor.
 To meet the crisis theat faced them, said Gandhiji, he suggested tha the popular Ministries should make a declaration that the villagers must produce their own cloth. They would be supplied with cotton, which they must spin and make into cloth. This would enable them to have cloth almost free of cost as it were.
 The All-India Spinners’ Association is likely to draw up a scheme for the expansion of the khadi industry in the country and place it before the popular Ministries. If the Ministers realize that there is no other way to clothe the naked in India, the scheme will go ahead without any difficulty.
 Today, the city-dwellers complained that they could not get khadi at khadi bhandars, that they were asked to make partial payment in yarn spun by themselves. If they understood the new spirit behind the khadi drive, these complaints would
 disappear. There was nothing to prevent the city-dwellers from producing their own khadi in the same way as the villagers were expected to do.
 As for the Kasturba Trust its work was still more difficult than that of the
 A.I.S.A. They had collected one and a quarter crores of rupees, but the money had to be spent on the welfare of women and children in the villages. Take for instance maternity work in the villages. The village midwives were ignorant and dirty. The village women were more hardy than city women. Still the laws of Nature could not be defied. To teach clean methods to the village midwife was not an easy job. It was a matter of adult education and everyone knew that adult education was a much harder task than the education of the children. He could spend away the one and a quarter crores today by raising one or two big hospitals of the city type. But that would not be rendering real service to women and children in the villages. The money was collected in the name of woman who had become a villager and who died with her heart in the villages. He was not prepared to squander away that money anyhow. He knew that the public were becoming impatient. They felt that the  work  was progresing too slowly. But he wished to tell them not to lose patience. The work was going on slowly but surely. They were moving in unchartered waters. They must proceed with caution.

  Gandhiji 	talked to the audience about the conditions of Indians in Ceylon 	this evening. He had visited Ceylon years ago.libtech_534_footnoteIf Kashmir with its 	snow-clad Himalayas was the diadem of Mother India, then Ceylon was 	the emerald pendent of the necklace round her neck. It was rightly 	described as Ceylon the Golden. Indians had played an important part 	in developing Ceylon. The Ceylonese had got a sort of constitution    
 now. There was nothing wonderful about it. But they felt that the Indians should be turned out of Ceylon. The Indians had gone there as labourers. They worked under the most difficult and unhealthy conditions. They worked for Ceylon and settled down there. It was hard for them to leave that country now, and they wanted  equal  citizenship rights with the Ceylonese.
 The Ceylonese case was that the Indians could not ride two horses at one time. If they were Indians, they should return to India. If not, they should become Ceylo- nese nationals. There were others who were not prepared to have the Indians in ceylon in any circumstances. It was strange. The Indians and Ceylonese were brothers. A narrow strip of water separated India from Ceylon. A strong man could swim across the channel. They were both coloured people. The Ceylonese followed Buddhism and the birth-place of Buddhism was India. How could such a quarrel between Indians and Ceylonese be tolerated? They all wished them to bridge the gulf and become one. The
 A. I. C. C. had passed a resolution appointing a committee of four to go into the matter. It consisted of the Congress President, Shri C. Raja-gopalachari, Shri Ramachandran, and Shri Aryanayakum. The Indian labourers in Ceylon had gone on strike. The Congress had advised them to give it up. They did not wish to embarrass the Ceylonese. They wanted a brotherly settlement.
 What was their duty in the matter? —Gandhiji asked the gathering. They should all pray to God to show light to both. It was their duty to know how their brothers overseas were faring. That is why he had told them all about the Indians in Ceylon. In the end, he asked them to keep up the habit of praying regularly both in the morning and in the evening after he had gone away from Poona.

 There was a discussion about Bhai . . .libtech_535_footnotein the Charkha Sangh meeting. I knew nothing about the matter. I saw the letter. You have needlessly taken the matter to heart. Whatever institution we might be in, our decisions can be changed, they are subject to criticism. Why should we be sensitive about it? No one had anything else in mind beyond what was said. Nothing that was said warranted your tender- ing resignation. The Sangh having expressed its opinion has even left
 
 the decision to you. It shows that there was no question of the trustees going to the court or anything else. You should have forbearance. You are a devotee of khadi and a dedicated worker; how can a sevak be so sensitive? Now that you have the right opportunity to serve khadi, avail yourself of it fully.
 Owing to my bad handwriting I am dictating this. I hope you will have no trouble in following it. If you have any difficulty in replying in Hindustani you may do so in English.

  	In the song that has just been sung,libtech_537_footnotelibtech_538_footnotethe 	world has been aptly described as the valley of sorrow and 	suffering. God alone enables us to brave it all. The poet, however 	has proceeded to call the world an illusion and a dream. Joy or what 	men call happiness may be, or really is, a dream in a fleeting and 	transitory world, where everything is like  a dissolving 	phantasmagoria. But we cannot dismiss the suffer-ing of our fellow 	creatures as unreal and thereby provide a moral alibi for ourselves. 	Even dreams are true while they last and to the sufferer, his 	suffering is a grim reality. Anyway, whether the world be real or 	unreal, we have certain duties in life which must be faced, 	understood and duly performed while we are in this world.  Mahatma 	Gandhi said he was grateful to God for being able to come to 	Panchgani again this year although he was not able to come earlier 	because of his stay in Delhi on account of the Cabinet Mission. This 	annual short stay at the hill station enabled him, he added, to 	store up enough energy for carrying on his heavy work during the 	remaining months. From his experience of the last three years he 	found it beneficial to plan staying about six months on the side of 	Poona from     
 February to August and in Sevagram during the rest of the year.
 He could not leave Sevagram altogether because of his close and fairly long association with various activities there, but he also wanted to devote some time to his newly found nature-cure centre at Uruli Kanchan and had therefore planned to spend some time there.

329,"July 14, 1946",KHADI IN TOWNS,"
    
 Your scheme for making village India self-sufficient in the matter of clothing has hit town lovers of khadi pretty hard. You have gone so far as to say that sales bhandars may close as such and that townsfolk may even revert to the use of mill cloth.
 While there is no quarrel with the new ideology and the consequent basic change in the running of bhandars nor with the introduction of a certain quota of yarn currency for purchasing khadi, I would like you to solve the difficulty of town buyers who must use only khadi.
Let the readers fully understand the so-called new plan for
 khadi. I call it so-called, because what is being done is the logical step, if khadi is to clothe the villagers, as from the very start it was intended to do. Khadi was never meant merely for the townspeople, it was never meant to bleed the villagers as they are being bled so that the townspeople can live. Khadi was from its inception conceived for the sake of reversing the order though never to bleed the townspeople. To reverse the order was to restore the natural relation. Towns there were before the British arrival. Things were bad enough then. Now they are much worse. Towns became cities. The latter, in spite of their Indian millionaires, lived mainly for the British masters. Khadi was to undo the grave mischief. Mill cloth is the symbol of the slavery of village India as khadi is or should be the symbol of its freedom, both economic and political. If it cannot be that, it is meaningless. Therefore, any healthy change undergone in the process of khadi development is to be welcomed.
 The defect in the existing development, good though it ap- peared, was not good enough for the villagers who spun yarn and wove khadi but did not use it themselves. They neither understood nor appreciated the dignity and value that its use carried.
 The fault was not theirs. The workers themselves did not. The town-dwellers had to wear khadi and do the penance. They were
 
 willing to buy penance for a few extra rupees which they could easily spare and be called patriots into the bargain. But how could the Charkha Sangh (called in English All-India Spinners’ Association) belie its faith by ignoring the very foundation of khadi? And so it is employing its resources to making the villagers khadi-clad.  It naturally begins with the spinners and weavers of hand-spun. If the move succeeds, as it is bound to, there will be after a time, ample khadi in the city and town markets. Then the only cloth available in India will be khadi. The A. I. S. A. is diligently working at the consummation. If its researches show that khadi has no such potentiality, it will have no hesitation in declaring its insolvency. Let the reader remember that it is a science which deals with the psychology of forty crores of people in the machine age. Thus considered, it is a tremendous problem, though at the same time fascinating and interesting. The very defeat, if defeat it is to be, will itself be no defeat. Let it be understood that it is not an attempt to go back to the dark ages when the charkha was the symbol of the slavery of the masses. Surely it will be a triumph of human understanding, i. e., of the soul of India, when India makes an effort through  the charkha to break her bonds asunder. The freeman eats the same bread as the slave. The one eats the bread of freedom, the other of slavery.
 But if the city-dwellers and the town-dwellers would learn the glad tidings that the charkha has to give, they will willingly employ their leisure time in carding, spinning, and weaving rather than in gambling on the race course or drinking and idling away their time in their clubs. And their children? Why —they could spin for their parents, for the liberty of India and have education of the type that India wants. I was in Romelibtech_539_footnoteand Mussolini’s officials took pride in showing the graceful manoeuvres of the little children who were being taught all naval tricks. And do the English children do otherwise than learn in their mother tongue what England needs? It is only reserved for India to teach her children the foreigners’ language and through it, such things as the latter need. Who but a foreigner has devised the education code?
 The A. I. S. A. sales depots will be used for a better purpose than before. They will teach the people, who, I hope, will flock to them, all the tricks of spinning and weaving. If they do, they will have all the khadi they need. Where there is a will, there is a way.
 
 Lastly, let the reader know too that nowadays khadi like mill cloth is scarce. Let me not go into the reason why.

330,"July 14, 1946",JEWS AND PALESTINE,"
    
 Hitherto I have refrained practically from saying anything in public regarding the Jew-Arab controversy. I have done so for good reasons. That does not mean any want of interest in the question, but it does mean that I do not consider myself sufficiently equipped with knowledge for the purpose. For the same reason I have tried to evade many world events. Without airing my views on them, I have enough irons in the fire. But four lines of a newspaper column have done the trick and evoked a letter from a friend who has sent me a cutting which I would have missed but for the friend drawing my attention to it. It is true that I did say some such thing in the course of a long conversation with Mr. Louis Fischer on the subject.libtech_540_footnoteI do believe that the Jews have been cruelly wronged by the world. “Ghetto” is, so far as I am aware, the name given to Jewish locations in many parts of Europe. But for their heartless persecution, probably no question of return to Palestine would ever have arisen. The world should have been their home, if only for the sake of their distinguished contri- bution to it.
 But, in my opinion, they have erred grievously in seeking to impose themselves on Palestine with the aid of America and Britain and now with the aid of naked terrorism. Their citizenship of the world should have and would have made them honoured guests of any country. Their thrift, their varied talent, their great industry shoul have made them welcome anywhere. It is a blot on the Christian world that they have been singled out, owing to a wrong reading of the New Testament, for prejudice against them.“If an individual Jew does a wrong, the whole Jewish world is to blame for it.” If an individual Jew like Einstein makes a great discovery or another composes unsurpassable music, the merit goes to the authors and not to the community to which they belong.
No wonder that my   sympathy  goes  out  to   the   Jews  in their
 
 
 unenviably sad plight. But one would have thought adversity would teach them lessons of peace. Why should they depend upon American money or British arms for forcing themselves on an unwelcome land? Why should they resort to terrorism to make good their forcible landing in Palestine? If they were to adopt the matchless weapon of non-violence whose use their best Prophets have taught and which Jesus the Jew who gladly wore the crown of thorns bequeathed to a groaning world, their case would be the world’s, and I have no doubt that among the many things that the Jews have given to the world, this would be the best and the brightest. It is twice blessed. It will make them happy and rich in the true sense of the word and it will be a soothing balm to the aching world.

331,"July 14, 1946",QUESTION BOX,"
    
 Q. Is it possible during prayers, for thousands who assemble at your prayer gatherings, to concentrate their minds on anything whatever?
 A. I can only answer yes. For, if I did not believe in  mass prayer, I should cease to hold public prayers. My experience con- firms my belief. Success depends upon the purity of the leader and the faith of the audience. I know instances in which the audience had faith and the leader was an impostor. Such cases will continue to happen. But truth like the sun shines in the midst of the darkness of untruth. The result in my case will be known probably after my death.
 A wag asks three questions in this matter. One requiring an answer runs: “Is not political education infinitely superior to the religious?” In my opinion, political education is nothing worth, if it is not backed by a sound grounding in religion by which is not meant sectional or sectarian belief. Man without religion is man without  roots. Therefore, religion is the basis on which all life structure has to be erected, if life is to be real.
 THIEVING
 Q. What is the employer to do when an employee of his is addicted to stealing and is not amenable to correction whether it is by way of entreaty or the cane?
A.    It may well be that the others too are addicts though they
may not be found out. Observation would show that we are all thieves,
 the difference being that most of us are tolerant towards ourselves and intolerant towards those that are found out and are not of the ordinary run. What is a man, if he is not a thief, who openly charges as much as he can for the goods he sells? If the reply be that the buyer is a willing dupe, it begs the question. In reality the buyer is helpless rather than willing. The stealing referred to is one of the symptoms of a deep- seated disease of society. It is symptomatic of the eternal strife between the monied few and the many paupers. Therefore, my advice to the employer will be to remove all temptation in the way of the thief, to treat him as if he was his own brother and, when he refuses to yield to any treatment, however humanitarian it may be, to ask him to go his way. Let the employer always ask himself whether he would treat his own brother in the same way at the given stage.

A sister writes:
 For some years I have been trying to help people to understand the danger of spitting everywhere. The filth and the dirt is so bad on account of spitting and cleaning noses everywhere that one does not know where to begin. Even small boys, girls, educated men and women, apart from illiterate folk spit on railway platforms, carriages, trams, outside shops, in corridors outside their houses and everywhere. Our country is getting dirtier and dirtier and diseases are spreading all over. Will not volunteers come forward for spreading the message of cleanliness?
Promiscuous spitting is a bad habit on which I have commented
 often enough. It is all part and parcel of the incredible ignorance that exists in our land among all classes of people in regard to the elem- entary laws of sanitation and hygiene. It is a habit which we must give up, if we would avoid certain diseases. My correspondent’s suggestion is certainly commendable.

333,"July 14, 1946",KASTURBA MEMORIAL TRUST libtech_541_footnote,"
    
 Some people complain that the funds of this Trust are not being spent fast enough and that no one knows how they are being spent. The complaint is baseless on both counts. The thing is that even though the donations to the Trust came largely from the cities, the aim has throughout been for the money to be spent in the villages, and in the interest of village women and children. Therefore, those who do not see the Trust accounts would not know how the money is spent in villages. The critics are all city-dwellers.Villagers neither read the newspapers nor care about how the money is spent. If any work is done in their own village they can see it for themselves. Anything done for the city-dwellers is widely publicised. If a building or a statue is being made, there is a discussion in the papers about how it is being made. Then when it is completed its opening or unveiling ceremony is performed with much fanfare so that people would know that the purpose for which the money was collected had been accomplished. There cannot be any such advertisement of the work which is being done for women in villages. Therefore, for the time being the newspaper readrs will have to be content with just knowing through whom the work is being carried on. When some work has been done in a few thousand out of the seven lakhs of our villages and the women and children of these villages have been prepared everyone will come to know of it. Take just one example. Training is being given to village women as midwives. Nurses are being trained to work in villages. If this information is not enough, what more can one say?
 At the last meeting of the Executive Committee of the Kasturba Trust held recently at Poona, budgets were passed for the holding of training camps in several of the twenty-one provinces. But the women trained in this way have to go to villages. City-dwellers can know about them only if they are paraded in the cities. But this is not intended, nor would it be proper. There is another thing. The work to be undertaken in the villages is of a new kind and has to be taken up from the beginning. Therefore, the progress would perforce be slow as it has been in the case of khadi and other village industries. We paid very little attention to the villages. It is so even today. When city- dwellers turn their attention to the villages, things will be diffe-rent. So
 
 long as this does not happen neither the newspapers will notice the work of organizations of this kind nor city-dwellers will take much interest in it.
 There are occasions when it is not wise to spend the money as soon as it is collected, when wisdom in fact lies in spending it slowly and with care, as it has been in the case of the Kasturba Trust. The donors may be numbered in thousands, but the field in which the money is to be spent is 1900 miles long and the population to be served numbers forty crores. Time was needed to decide how to work and where. Time was also needed to find workers. And now that the workers are found time is being spent on training them. Therefore the donors must have confidence that the Trustees will neither spend money uselessly nor shirk spending from laziness when it is necessary to spend.
 Ever since the committees were constituted, there have been complaints that they have not been constituted from among  the  donors and where donors have been taken on the committees their numbers are too few. The fact is that donors are not always the best judges of how and on what the donations should be spent. Suppose, for instance, a number of persons together donate a sum of ten crore rupees for the construction of a pond. But having done this, what else can they do about it? The money donated must pass into the hands of those who know how to make a pond. Only such people will form a committee and spend the money. Many such instances could be cited. In the first instance the committees formed by  the  trustees  were formed in this manner. Later it was realized that whatever work  women could do, should be got done by them and not by forming committees of them but through them as agents. Only  thus  can  women be trained and the entire organization passed into their hands. In this way the responsibility of the work will rest with them. Efforts towards this end are underway. It was bound to take time and it will still take time. Difficulties are many, but it is hoped that ulti-mately the work will grow and women too will have been prepared  to  shoulder the burden. Only experience will judge of the result.

 I have a letter from Ratnamayibehn. It makes me happy as well as unhappy. Unhappy because the fear which I had and which I had expressed has proved true. And I am happy at the frank admission of weakness. If you even settle down in your present sphere of work and achieve success in it, I shall be satisfied. To have confidence about something which is beyond our attainment is also a fault, it is a sign of pride.

    N.	What 	would you have us do next?  [July 	14, 1946]2 
  G. You should give proof 	of the same courage and bravery  here that you people displayed on 	the battlefield. There was perfect unity in the ranks of the I. N. 	A. Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Parsis; all communities were like blood 	brothers. There was no high or low, no untouchable. Demonstrate that 	unity here. But I am afraid you will not be able to do so.     
 N.	Yes, we cannot, so long as the British power rules over us.
 G. Well, there is a lot that can be done in spite of the British. I have voluntarily become a Bhangi. Who can prevent me from doing so? Shah Nawazlibtech_544_footnotetoday is an Indian first and an Indian last. Nobody can prevent him from doing so. In fact, wherever he goes, he puts up with his Hindu friends. But even so, he realizes that he cannot achieve here what he could outside India. The I. N. A. men on returning to their homes take the complexion from their environment. They shed what they had learnt outside and it is difficult to prevent them from falling into the old rut.
 Again, if you expect India to spend lakhs on you, that is not right. You should be like Garibaldi’slibtech_545_footnotelibtech_546_footnotesoldiers who were promised by their leader only “blood, toil and tears”. They tilled the land and supported themselves when not engaged on the battle-field. No one paid them a salary. You have been trained by the British who spend lavishly. If you expect medals like Victoria Crosses and such prizes as the British can give, you will be disappointed. The starving millions of India cannot afford that. You have to become one with them and serve them. Today the man in the street is terrified of the military. The military man acts like a bully and there can be no appeal against his high-handedness. You have to prove that you are friends and servants of the people, so that they will not be awed by you.
 N.	We befriend the people here as we did outside India.
 G. That is good. But I tell you, your leaders are finding it diffi- cult to control the I. N. A. men in India. There are petty jealousies and rivalries. ‘If A can get something, why not I?’—that is the kind of feeling coming uppermost. It was different abroad. You had a very capable leader in Netaji. In spite of our sharp differences I  have always admired his burning patriotism, courage and resourcefulness.
 N. You have no idea of the deep love and admiration he had for you. What should be our contribution in the next struggle for independence?
G.    The struggle for independence is going  on   today.  It   has
 never stopped. But, if my will prevails, it will be a non-violent struggle. The lesson of the last 25 years of training in non-violence, has gone home to the masses. They have realized that in non-violence they have a weapon which enables a child, a woman or even a decrepit old man
 
 to resist the mightiest government successfully. If your spirit is strong, mere lack of physical strength ceases to be a handicap. Per contra I have seen the Zulus in South Africa with Herculean bodies tremble before a white child. White soldiers could go into the the Zulu kraals and shoot men, women and children sleeping in their beds. There was no resistance in the Zulu and the physical strength could not make up for it.

 Poverty, remarked Gandhiji, had a dignity in our country. The poor man was not ashamed of his poverty. He preferred his hut to the rich man’s palace. He even took pride in it. Though poor in material goods, he was not poor in spirit.  Contentment was his treasure. He might as well say to himself, ‘Since we cannot all become rich and own palaces, let us at least pull down the palaces of the rich and bring them down to our level.’ That could bring no happiness or peace either to themselves or anyone else, and God would certainly be not the friend and helper of the poor of such description. Poverty, in the sense of inequality of material possessions was there in every part of the world. That was perhaps in a certain measure inevitable, for all men are not equal either in their talents or the measure of their needs. Even in America which was fabulously rich and where Mammon had taken the place of God, there were many poor. Poet Malabari had come across some relatives of Shah Alamlibtech_549_footnotebegging in the streets of Rangoon. He had written a beautiful poem about it which had sunk into Gandhiji’s heart. The substance of it was that he alone is rich who has God for his friend and helper. In India there was a particular type of man who delighted in having as few needs as possible. He carried with him only a little flour and a pinch of salt and chillies tied in his napkin. He had a lota and a string to draw water with from the well. He needed nothing else. He walked on foot covering 10-12 miles a day. He made the dough on his napkin, collected a few twigs to make a fire and baked his dough on the embers. It was called bati . He tasted it an found it most delicious. The relish did not lie in the food but in the appetite that honest toil and the contentment

 of the mind gave. Such a man had God as his companion and friend and felt richer than any king or emperor. God was not the friend of those who inwardly coveted others’ riches. Everyone could copy that example and enjoy ineffable peace and happiness himself and radiate it to others. On the other hand if one hankered after riches, one had to resort to exploitation, by whatever name it might be called. Even then the crores could not become millionaires. True happiness lay in contentment and companionship with God only.

 DEAR KHURSHEDBEHN,
 Though you have said your last letter does not need any reply, in my opinion it demands one.
 I see that your ahimsa and mine are poles asunder. I have great regard for Jaiprakash but not for his views. Aruna allows herself to be my daughter. She is a brave woman. But views like hers would take the paupers to future starvation and death. That I commended their names and others to J.’slibtech_550_footnoteattention was not because of their views but in spite of them in the hope that responsibility under J. would show them the error of their ways. But they chose the opposite course. I shall now watch their course. They are all a power.
 I shall hug my darkness, not their light. There is, therefore, hardly any chance of my following them.
I wish you well. May God be your protection and guidance.
 I write this to make my position clear. I love you too well to keep you in the dark about it. How I wish I have misunderstood you. You had made your position clear the other day when you met me for half a minutue. Your letter under reply clinches the matter.
 Of course you are at liberty to show this to our Socialist friends. Love.

 BROTHER SARAT BABU,
 I write this in English so as to cause you less strain and be better understood.
 I had long chats with Bela and Arvind. They feel deeply aggrieved by your treatment of them. It is not, as I could see, so much  a question of money as of ill-treatment. They feel too that Amiya is the evil genius. As often happens among cousins they fight for no reason whatsoever. I wonder if this is such a case. Anyway, both Bela and Arvind are certainly disconcerted. They seem to have discussed the matter with Jawaharlal and Sardar. They appear to have said they can do nothing. I have advised them to put themselves at your disposal without any expectation of favour which they do not want. They say they want justice, they want to be treated as members of the family who have done no wrong to any of the members. They say they have been discredited without cause. This they resent bitterly. The issue is purely moral. This you should be able to fix up without any difficulty. They ought not to be cut off from the family, if they have been. I have given you an idea of what, as I see it, they feel.
I am sending them a copy of this letter.

  	Jayantilal brought me your letter giving me the news of 	Krishnamaiya’s passing away. Later, on inquiring I came across 	Mahavir’s telegram. It had been received by Pyarelal two days ago 	and was lying with him. He assumed that I must have been informed 	and so kept it for filing. Thus I could get the news only last 	evening. I believe that Krishnamaiya has found relief in death. I 	know from the death of Kashi, wife of Jaisukhlal, that cancer is 	painful disease. X-ray [sic], etc., is the right treatment 	for it. Your account also tells me that Mother passed away 	peacefully. We should all,therefore, be but happy about it. She has 	departed after seeing you all well settled. You should all now prove 	yourselves worthy of her name as well as your father’s and also of 	the Ashram’s where you were brought up. Mahavir is properly 	settled, so is Durga. You are study-ing. Once you recover your 	health, you are intelligent enough to be able to take care of 	yourself. Dharmakumar cannot be said to be doing too well. Maitri 	however has grown quite mature. She is the eldest among you. I am 	sure you will all regard her as your mother and conduct yourselves 	accordingly. Krishnamaiya’s advice is right, i. e., you should all 	take care of her and she will look after you all. Thus the whole 	family will be protected.

  [July 	17, 1926]2  LOUIS FISCHER: I 	would go into the Constituent Assembly and use it for a different 	purpose—as a battle-field—and declare it to be a sovereign body. 	What do you say to this? GANDHIJI: 	It is no use declaring somebody else’s creation a  	sovereign body. After all, it is a British creation. A body does not 	become a sovereign body by merely asserting it.To become sovereign, 	you have to behave in a sovereign way. Three tailors of Tooley 	Street in Johannesburg declared that they were a sovereign body. In 	ended in nothing. It was just a farce.  	I do not consider the proposed Constituent Assembly to be non- 	revolutionary. I have said, and I mean it cent per cent, that  the 	proposed Constituent Assembly is an effective substitute for civil 	dis- obedience of the constructive type. Whilst I have the greatest 	admi- ration for the self-denial and spirit of sacrifice of our 	Socialist friends,    
 I have never concealed the sharp difference between their method and mine. They frankly believe in violence and all that is in its bosom. I believe in non-violence through and through.
 L. F. You are a socialist and so are they.
 G. I am, they are not. I was a socialist before many of them were born. I carried conviction to a rabid socialist in Johannesburg, but that is neither here nor there. My claim will live when their socialism is dead.
 L. F. What do you mean by your socialism?
 G. My socialism means ‘even unto this last’. I do not want to rise on the ashes of the blind, the deaf and the dumb. In their socia-lism, probably these have no place. Their one aim is material progress. For instance, America aims at having a car for every citizen. I do not. I want freedom for full expression of my personality. I must be free to build a staircase to Sirius if I want to. That does not mean that I want to do any such thing. Under the other socialism, there is no individual freedom. You own nothing, not even your body.
 L. F. Yes, but there are variations. My socialism in its modified form means that the State does not own everything. It does in Russia. There you certainly do not own your body even. You may be arrested at any time, though you may have committed no crime. They may send you wherever they like.
 Does not, under your socialism, the State own your children and educate them in any way it likes?
G. All States do that. America does it.
 L. F. Then America is not very different from Russia.
 G. But socialism is dictatorship or else arm-chair philosophy. I call myself a communist also.
 L. F. O, don’t. It is terrible for you to call yourself a communist. I want what you want, what Jaiprakash and the socialists want: a free world.But the commu-nists don’t. They want a system which enslaves the body and the mind.
G. Would you say that of Marx?
 L. F. The communists have corrupted the Marxist teaching to  suit  their purpose.
G. What about Lenin?
 L. F. Lenin started it. Stalin has since completed it. When the communists come to you, they want to get into the Congress and control the Congress and use it for their own ends.
 G. So do the socialists. My communism is not very different from socialism. It is a harmonious blending of the two. Communism, as I have understood it, is a natural corollary of socialism.
 L. F. Yes, you are right. There was a time when the two could not be distin- guished. But today socialists are very different from communists.
G. You mean to say, you do not want communism of Stalin’s
 type.    L. 	F. But the Indian 	communists want communism of the Stalin type in India 
  and 	want to use your name for that purpose. G. 	They won’t succeed.  L. 	F. So you will not 	yourself go into the Constituent Assembly, but will support it? G. 	Yes, but it is wrong to say we are going into the Constituent  	Assembly to seize power. Though it is not a sovereign body, it is as 	near it as possible.  L. 	F. Pandit Jawaharlal said 	that if the 	British tried to 	impose a 	treaty in 	terms of the State Paper of May 16, he will tear it up.libtech_568_footnote G. 	Yes, an imposed treaty from outside.  L. 	F. And he said, Congress 	will not go into groupings.  G. Yes, I have said the 	same thing—unless the Federal Court or some other court gives a 	different decision.libtech_569_footnoteAs 	I see it, much can come out of the Constituent Assembly, if the 	British will play the game.  L. 	F. You say and I believe 	they will. But supposing they do not, won’t you then offer your 	form of protest? G. 	Not until the conditions are favourable. But it is wrong to  	speculate about the future, still more so to anticipate failure. If 	we take care of the present, the future will take care of itself.  They 	then passed on to the question of Hindu-Muslim unity. Gandhiji 	startled his visitor by proferring the remark that the Hindu-Muslim 	question, in the final analysis, was an offshoot of the 	untouchability question. When 	Hinduism is perfectly reformed and purged of the last     
 trace of untouchability, there will be no communal problem left.
 L. F. I have heard that though the Congress Harijans have won at the elections against non-Congress Harijans, they were able to do so only with the Hindu votes!
G. What was the joint election for, if not to enable the caste
 Hindus to make a selection from successful candidates at the primary elections? No failed candidate at the primary elections can offer him- self as a candidate at the joint elections. Moreover, it is not correct to say, as has been claimed, that in the majority of cases, the Con- gress Harijans won against the non-Congress candidates with the caste Hindus’ votes. In Madras the non-Congress Harijans were defea-ted almost to a man in the primary elections, wherever they contested them. In the majority of cases the Congress Harijans were returned unopposed.
 L. F. Some of them want separate electorates.
 G. Yes. But we have resisted it. By separate electorates they put themselves outside the pale of Hinduism and perpetuate  the  bar sinister.
 L. F. That is true. But, anyhow, they might say that Hindus have put them outside the pale.
G. But today the Hindus are penitent.
 L. F. Are they adequately penitent?
 G. I am sorry to say not yet. If they were, there would be no untouchability and no communal problem as I have already said.
 L. F. Is there less social contact between the Hindus and Muslims?
 G. No, rather the contrary. But politically there is a bar, thanks to Lord Minto.
 L. F. Your young men are too Indo-centric.
 G. That is only partly true. I won’t say we have become inter- national, but we have taken up forlorn causes, e. g., the cause of the exploited nations, because we are ourselves the chief exploited nation.
 L. F. The growing anti-white feeling here is bad. In the Taj Mahal Hotel they have put up a notice “South Africans not admitted”. I do not like it. Your non- violence should make you more generous.
 G. That won’t be non-violence. Today the white man rules in India. So, if the Taj Mahal has the gumption to put up that notice, it is  a feather in its cap.
 L. F. That is what any nationalist will say. You must say something better.
 G. Then I will be a nationalist for once. They have no right to be here if they do not deal with Indians on terms of equality.
 L. F. No right—yes. But you must give them more than their right. You must invite them.
G. Yes, when I am the Viceroy.
 L. F. You mean the President of the Indian Republic.
 G. No. I will be quite content to be the Viceroy, a constitutional Viceroy, for the time being.The first thing I will do will be to vacate the Viceregal Lodge and give it to the Harijans. I will then invite the South African white visitors to my hut and say to them:You have ground my people to powder. But we won’t copy you. We will give you more than you deserve. We won’t lynch you as you do in South Africa,’ and thus shame them into doing th right.
 L. F. There is so much anti-white feeling today.
 G. Of course, I am opposed to that. It can do no good to any- body.
 L. F. The world is so divided. And there might be another war and that may be between the coloured and the white races.
 G. Europe seems to be heading for another war. It is not suffi- ciently exhausted.
 L. F. Europe is terribly exhausted. But with the atom bomb human beings don’t matter so much. A few scientists are enough. The next war will be carried on by pressing a few buttons. That is why colour war is so dangerous.
 G. Anything is better than cowardice. It is violence double distilled.
 And to illustrate his remark Gandhiji narrated the story of a Negro clergyman with a Herculean frame in South Africa saying ‘pardon me brother’, when insulted by a white man, and sneaking into a coloured man’s compartment.
 That is not non-violence. It is a travesty of Jesus’ teaching. It would have been more manly to retaliate.
 L. F. You are not afraid of what happens to you but what it may mean to others. It takes a great deal of irresponsibility to give vent to your feelings and slap the white man under the circumstances described by you. In India  the  situation  is  different. The white men are not so numerous here.
 G. You are mistaken. Why, one Englishman is killed and a whole village is razed to the ground as a reprisal. What vindictiveness!

356,"July 18, 1946",QUESTION BOX,"
    
 Q. I am a young businessman of 21 years and have 11 dependents. I believe in truth and non-violence but find I cannot strictly follow it in business. What should I do? Abandoning the business means suffering for my relations.
 A. This begs the question. It is difficult but not impossible to conduct strictly honest business.The fact is that the honester a business the more successful it is. Hence the proverb coined by businessmen “Honesty is the best policy”.What the correspondent lacks is appli- cation and an accurate knowledge of honest business methods. What is true is that honesty is incompatible with the amassing of a large fortune. “Verily, verily, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God.” Nor therefore should an honest businessman, however capable he may be, support idlers whether eleven or more or fewer. The eleven depen- dents cannot all be infants or incapables. Honesty makes no impossi- ble demands upon the resources of a businessman. An honest man cannot have dishonest kinsmen. The questioner will find on intros- pection that there is nothing wrong with honest business but that there is something wrong with him. Let him find out what it is that is wrong with him.
 Q. Are the time, place and manner of death predestined by the Almighty for each individual? If so, why worry even if we are ill?
 A. I do not know whether time, place and the manner of death are predestined. All I do know is that ‘not a blade of grass moves but by His will’. This too I know hazily. What is hazy today will be clear tomorrow or the day after by prayerful waiting. Let this however be quite clear. The Almighty is not a person like us. He or It is the greatest living Force or Law in the world. Accordingly He does not act by caprice, nor does that Law admit of any amendment or improvement.His will is fixed and changeless, everything else changes every second. Surely, it does not follow from the doctrine of predesti- nation that we may not ‘worry’ in the care of ourselves even if we are ill. Indifference to illness is a crime greater than that of falling ill. There is no end to the effort to do better today than yesterday. We have to ‘worry’ and find out why we are or have become ill. Health, not ‘illth’, is the law of nature. Let us investigate the law of nature and obey it, if we will not be ill or, if having fallen ill, will be restored.

 My post contains so many letters from persons who want to be in the Constituent Assembly that it frightens me into the suspicion that, if these letters are an indication of the general feeling, the intelligentsia is more anxious about personal aggrandizement than about India’s independence. And if I, though I have no connection with the applications of candidates for elections, receive so many letters, how many must the members of the Working Committee be receiving? These correspondents should know that I take no interest in these elections, I do not attend meetings at which these applications are considered and that I often only know from newspapers who have been elected. It is on rare occasions that my advice is sought as to the choice to be made. But I write this more to draw attention to the disease of which these applications are a sign than to warn my correspondents against building any expectation of my intervention. It is wrong to think communally in such elections, it is wrong to think that anyone is good enough for the Constituent Assembly, it is altogether wrong to think that the election carries any honour with it, it is a post of service if one is fitted for the labours and, lastly, it is wrong to regard the post as one for making a few rupees while the Assembly lasts. The Constituent Assembly should have such members only who know something about constitutions all the world  over, above, all, about the constitution that India’s genius demands. It is debasing to think that true service consists in getting a seat in the Assembly. True service lies outside. The field of service outside is limitless. In the fight for independence, the Assembly, like the one in course of formation, has a place. Nevertheless it is a very small place and that too if we use it wisely and well; certainly not, if there is a scramble for a seat in it. The scramble warrants the fear that it may become a hunting ground for place-seekers. I am free to confess that  a Constituent Assembly is the logical outcome of parliamentary activity. The labour of the late Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das and Pandit Motilal Nehru opened my eyes to the fact that the parliamen- tary programme had a place in the national activity for independence. I strove hard against it. It is certainly inconsistent with pure non-co- operation. But pure non-co-operation never held the field. What came into being also waned. Had there been universal non-co-opera-tion of the non-violent type in the Congress ranks, there would have been no parliamentary programme. Non-violent non-co-operation with evil
 means co-operation with all that is good. There-fore, non-violent non- co-operation with a foreign government necessarily means an indigenous government based on non-violence. Had there been such complete non-co-operation, there would be swaraj today based on non-violence. But this never happened. In the circumstances it would have been vain to struggle against what the nation had been familiar with and from which it could not be completely weaned. The parliamentary step having been taken, it would have been improper to boycott the present effort. But that does not, can never, mean that there should be indecent competition for filling the seats in it. Let us recognize the limitations.

CHARKHA”libtech_570_footnote","
    
 Shri Dhirendra Mazumdar has written a booklet under this title. Though it is only forty small pages it contains everything about the new scheme. It tells us how true swaraj and true revolution lie in the success-ful working of the scheme. But the true revolution will remain only on paper unless the scheme is proved in work. It is, therefore, necessary to show how it may be proved and to act accordingly. Today there is much restlessness in the towns because townsfolk are not able to get khadi at any price. This has happened before. At that time I was able to assure people that khadi would soon be available because then the question was only one of money. Now this is not so. Money alone cannot answer the purpose. True revolution is  not brought about by money. It is a difficult task to change the habits of a lifetime, to overcome laziness, to create rather than destroy. It is easy to acquire ten thousand rupees by looting a train. It is difficult to earn that sum by the sweat of one’s brow. It is a common enough occurrence for someone to earn a lac of rupees in a single day in the share market. But to accumulate a lac of rupees in one day through one’s labour is an impossible task. A beggar has been known to become rich by winning a lottery but no beggar has amassed wealth in a single day through his labour. He can only get his wage in the market. This may be eight annas or even two annas. Producing khadi is one thing, producing mill-cloth another. Swaraj cannot come
 
 through the machine. But if two hundred million people with full understanding produce khadi with their own labour and wear it the face of India will be transformed. It will be another matter if out of the four hundred million people two hundred million cannot take the trouble to produce cloth for themselves. But I can never believe that.

           PANCHGANI, 
  [July 18, 1946]libtech_575_footnote  L. 	F. If the Working 	Committee had reacted to your ‘groping in the dark’ or as you 	have called it your instinct about the long-term proposals, they 	would have rejected them? G.	Yes, 	but I did not let them.  L. 	F. You mean you did not 	insist?  G. More than that. I 	prevented them from following my instinct unless they also felt 	likewise. It is no use conjecturing what would have happened. The 	fact however remains that Dr. Rajendra Prasad asked me: ‘Does your 	instinct go so far that you would prevent us from accepting the 	long-term proposals, whether we understand you or not?’ I said, 	‘No. Follow your reason since my own reason does not support my 	instinct. My instinct rebels against my reason. I have placed my 	misgivings before you as I want to be faithful to you. I myself have 	not followed my instinct unless my reason backed it.’  L. 	F. But you have said that 	you follow your instinct when it speaks to you on occasions as, for 	instance, you did before certain fasts that you undertook.  G. Yes, but even in these 	cases, before the fast began, my reason was able to back my 	instinct. My reason failed my instinct on the long-term proposals.  L. 	F. Them, why did you 	inject your ‘instinct’ into the political situation?  G. Because I was loyal to 	my friends. I wanted to retain my faith in the bona fides of 	the Cabinet Mission. So I told the Cabinet Mission also about my 	misgivings. I said to myself, ‘Supposing they meant ill, they 	would feel ashamed.’    
 L. F. You are strongly constitutionalist now. Is it for fear of the alternative— violence?
 G. No. If India is destined to go through a blood-bath, it will  do so. The thing I would fear is my own cowardice or dishonesty. I have neither. So I say, we must go in and work it out. If they are dishonest, they will be found out. The loss will not be ours but theirs.
 L. F. I think you are afraid of the spirit of violence. It is widespread. I wonder whether it has not captured the mood of the youth and you are aware of it and you fear that mood.
 G. It has not captured the imagination of the country. I admit that it has captured the imagination of a section of the youth.
 L. F. It is a mood that has got to be combated.
 G.  Yes. I am doing it in my own way. It is my implicit faith that   it is a survival which will kill itself in time. It cannot live. It is so contrary to the spirit of India. But what is the use of talking? I believe in an inscrutable Providence which preside over our desti-nies—call it God or by any other name you like. All I contend is that it is not the fear of violence that makes me advise the country to go to the Cons- tituent Assembly. It is repugnant in a non-violent  attitude  not to accept an honourable substitute for civil revolt.
 Harijan, 4-8-1946
 "
362,"July 19, 1946",“SCHEDULED CASTES”,"
    
 A copy of a printed leaflet was thrown into my car on 6th July as I was driving to the A. I. C. C. meeting in Bombay. It was again handed to me by Shri Rajbhoj on the 12th instant. It is addressed to the members of the A. I. C. C. I promised to deal with the questions in these pages. I do so now.
 The questions are such as not to need an answer from the members. I should not wonder if no member has answered them. They betray gross ignorance of Congress history. It is hardly the province of men gathered together for a particular purpose to deal with extraneous matters. But it is the province of newspapers to dispel ignorance. It is doubly mine, being conductor of a weekly and a Harijan by choice.
 Q. What is going to be the place of the untouchables in your swaraj? The Congress has talked a lot about protecting the minorities. Why has the Congress
 failed to produce its blue-print of plan for protecting the minorities? Is this silence not calculated to create want of confidence in the bona fides of the Congress?
A.	The place of untouchables in the swaraj of my conception
 will be the same in every respect as that of the so-called caste Hindus. Such is also the position of the Congress. It has talked less and done more for minorities than any other cosmopolitan body known to me. There is no blue-print necessary when work speaks.
 Q.  Does the Congress regard the untouchables as a minority? Mr. Gandhi in   an article in the Harijan in 1939 admitted that the only real minority in India were the untouchables. Why did Maulana Azad in his last letterlibtech_576_footnoteto the Viceroy say that the Congress was not prepared to recognize the untouchables as a minority?
A.	The Congress should not regard the untouchables as a
 minority for the simple reason that they are not a minority in the sense in which Parsis, Jews, Christians and others can call themselves minorities. Harijans are a minority, if Brahmins, Kashatriyas and Vaishyas are minorities and Shudras are a majority. These are not minorities and majorities in the sense we are used to.We have fortu- nately not come to that pass. When we do, it will be good-bye to any kind of swaraj. The English may go today, they will some day, but if we become savages cutting one another’s throats we will have the freedom that savages have.
 The President of the Bombay Provincial Scheduled Castes Fede- ration should have given the quotation referred to by him from the article in the Harijan of 1939. He has not taken the trouble of giving even the number and page of the Harijan in question. I have no recollection of ever having made the statement attributed to me. What the Maulana Saheb is reported to have said was undoubtedly right, irrespective of what I wrote in 1939 or did not write.
 Q. What is the significance of the statement that the Congress does not regard the untouchables as a minority? Does it mean that the Congress will take away even those political safeguards which have been secured by the untouchables under the present Government of India Act?'
A.	The significance is that untouchables are an integral part of
 Hindus. They are, therefore, better than minorities and worse if they claim to be and become a distinct community. A few educated untou- chables may keep themselves as a class apart but the mass of them must  sink  or   swim  with  the   Hindus   who,  if   they   continue  their
 
 misbehaviour towards Harijans—the so-called untouchables—must become extinct as a separate branch of the human family.
 What ‘political safeguards’ the questioner has in view I do not know. If they refer to ‘separate’ electorates they must go even to the extent they exist today.They are a device of Satan named Imperialism It was never meant for the protection of the untouchables. It was a prop of Imperialism. Every statutory separation has been in furthe- rance of the policy of ‘divide and rule’. It is inherent in the life of Imperialism even if it were to the called by a sweeter name.
 Q. Does the Congress admit or does it not admit that the candidates of the Scheduled Castes who have been elected to the Provincial Legislatures came to the bottom in the primary elections and the candidates put up by the Scheduled Castes Federation came to the top? Does the Congress admit or does it not admit that if in the final election the failed candidates were elected, it was entirely due to the Hindu votes? Can the Congress deny that candidates elected by Hindu votes cannot be regarded as the real representatives of the Scheduled Castes?
A.	I have not the statistics to verify the statement. My impre-
ssion is to the contrary except in some cases.
 Who were the ‘failed’ candidates? They could not offer them- selves for the joint vote. The first four in the primary elections are the successful candidates, i. e., eligible for the joint vote. Surely it is a thing to be proud of, if the last successful candidate in the primary list won because of the caste Hindu vote at the joint election.
 The Congress must deny that the top man of the primary elec- tion who failed to secure enough or any caste Hindu votes was the real representative of the Scheduled Castes. Can Sjt. Gaekwad and others like him, so long as they Hindus, be indifferent to the vote of their fellow Hindus, even though the latter are caste men? They must not cut the branch on which they are sitting. Separation must mean either change or religion or setting up a new religion—confusion added to confusion.
 Q. At the time of the Poona Pact, Mr. Gandhi gave a pledge that the Hindus will not interfere in the election of the Scheduled Castes to the seats reserved for them. Why did the Congress violate the pledge and commit breach of faith?
A.	I gave no such pledge as is imputed to me. The joint vote
 for the sake of which I fasted was interference, if it can be so called. If any other interference is meant, the questioner must explain and quote my writing in support of the contention.
 Q. In the Simla Conference called by Lord Wavell in 1945, the Congress raised no objection to two representatives of the Scheduled Castes being included in
 
 the Executive Council. Why did the Congress reduce the representation of the Scheduled Castes this time to one? Does it not prove that the Congress cannot be trusted to keep its word and that as soon as the Congress obtains the right to decide, it will break all its promises and withdraw all the political safeguards secured by the Scheduled Castes?
A.	I do not understand this charge at all. The Congress, so far
as I know, has committed no breach of faith.
 Q. It has been admitted by all the workers of the Harijan Sevak Sangh and also by Mr. Gandhi that the removal of untouchability has made no headway at all. On the contrary, the tyranny and oppression of the untouchables by the caste Hindus which has been going on for ages, has increased in its rigour and has taken manifold forms. It is necessary to ventilate these grievances on the floor of the legislatures if any redress is to be obtained. No sensible man will deny that this work of ventilating the grievances cannot be done except by the representatives of the Scheduled Castes who are returned through separate electorates. Why does the Congress alone oppose the demand of the Scheduled Castes for separate electorates?
A.	I have made no statement, and I do not know that the
 Harijan Sevak Sangh has, to the effect that the removal of untou- chability has made ‘no headway at all’. What all of us have admitted is that removal, so far as the caste Hindus are concerned, has made no satisfactory headway. That is not a new complaint. It is of long standing. Woe to the reformer who is easily satisfied with the progress of the reform, on which his mind is set. The reform is two-sided. So far as work among the Harijans is concerned, the Sangh has made fair strides. That in itself is no small contribution to the cause of removal of untouchability. The work among the touchables has gone on at a snail’s pace. It is an uphill task. Yet I assert that it is making sure progress, though undoubtedly slow.
 The charge that the tyranny and oppression by caste Hindus have“increased and have become intensified in rigour” is wholly wrong and cannot be sustained. What is true, and it is a healthy sign, is that there is a growing consciousness of the wrong among the Harijans, thanks largely to the efforts and the increase in the number of reformers and their impatience of the wrong. But they dare not be satisfied with the results so far achieved. They have to go much farther than they have done. I am sure that will never be through the legis- latures or legislation, necessary as both are, though to very limited extent. As I have said in a previous issue, it is the hoary custom and not law, that is responsible for the mischief. Custom is any day
 tougher than law. It can be removed only by enlightened public opinion.
 Progress will be totally blocked by separation. It is a night-mare which must be given up, unless the goal of separation is extinction of Hindus including the so-called Scheduled Classes. They can only be misrepresented by separate electorates. How can others who are not interested in Scheduled Classes oppose separation?
 Q. There is no connection between the religion of a community and its demand for separate electorates. Even communities professing one religion have claimed separate electorates. Europeans, Anglo-Indians and Indian Christians profess one common religion. Yet all of them have separate electorates. Nobody has raised any objection to their separate electorates, not even the Congress. Why does the Congress oppose the demand of the Scheduled Castes for separate electorates on the ground of common religion which it does not rely upon in other cases?
A.	This question can only arise in the minds of those who
 support separate electorates as good in themselves. Not so the Congress. The parallel of Anglo-Indians, Europeans and Indian Chris- tians is inapplicable and fatal. That separation is a glaring example of the mischief that separate electorates are, as also of Imperialism gone mad. Arrogance cannot go farther. Europeans have been separated as the ruling race, Anglo-Indians being a cross breed have been kept distinct from Indian Christians.
 Q. There is no social separation between the Hindus and the Sikhs. In one family one member is a Sikh and the other a Hindu. The Hindus and the Sikhs intermarry and interdine. Yet the Sikhs have separate electorates to which the Congress has never raised any objection. The untouchables in the matter of social intercourse are far more separated from the Hindus than all the Sikhs and Muslims. If the Sikhs and Muslims can have separate electorates, why not the untouchables?
A.	The Congress would do away today with these separate
 electorates if it had the power—not the power that the sword gives but that of persuasion. It is perfectly true that more is common between Hindus and Sikhs than between caste Hindus and untouchables. That is a blot upon caste Hindus and Hinduism. But the remedy is not to add evil to evil but to reform Hinduism, so that the demand for separation on the part of untouchables dies a natural death. Meantime Hindus cannot be expected to commit suicide which separation of Harijans from caste Hindus must mean.

OF HARIJAN SEVAK
SANGHlibtech_588_footnote","
    
 PANCHGANI,
 [July 20, 1946]libtech_589_footnote
 Q. The Communist Party has successfully organized sweepers’ unions and helped them to secure their rights through hartals, etc. But the Harijan Sevak Sangh’s activities are confined mostly to welfare work. It cannot therefore successfully compete with the Communists for popularity among the Harijans. Don’t you think that in view of this, the Harijan Sevak Sangh ought to alter its policy and method of work?
A.	We must be guided in our policy by our sense of right, not
 by the lure of winning cheap popularity. If the Harijan Sevak Sangh is convinced that it is working on the right lines, it will keep on to them, regardless of what others might or might not do. Thus we may organize unions or even induce hartals, not from political motives or for such purposes but for bettering the social or economic position of Harijans.
 Q. The feeling is gaining ground among the Harijans that the Congress is showing more solicitude for Muslim demands than for the just rights of the Harijans. What have you to say to it?
A.	The Congress being a political organization is likely to be
 more susceptible to political pressure, which the Muslims are in a far stronger position to exert than the Harijans. If it succumbs to that pressure, it will pay the price for it.The Harijan Sevak Sangh, however, being a non-political organization, should never put expediency before its primary duty towards the Harijans.
 Q. In your recent correspondence with Shri Shyamlal you have said that caste ought to go root and branch if untouchability is to be completely eradicated. Then, why do you not make anti-untouchability work part of a wider crusade against the caste system itself? If you dig out the root, the branches will wither by themselves.
A.	It is one thing for me to hold certain views and quite another
 to make my views acceptable in their entirety to society at large. My mind, I hope, is ever growing, ever moving forward. All may not keep pace with it. I have therefore to exercise utmost patience and be satis- fied with hastening slowly. As you must have seen from my preface to a recent Navajivan publication of my writings on  Varnavyavastha,libtech_590_footnotelibtech_591_footnoteI
 
 am wholly in agreement with you in principle. If I live up to 125 years, I do expect to convert the entire Hindu society to my view.
 Q. Would you advise the so-called savarna Hindus to start, even under the pre-sent circumstances, an agitation in selected places for securing elementary civic and social rights for the Harijans? Would you for this purpose advise the Harijan Sevak Sangh to organize satyagraha against the savarna Hindus if necessary?
A.	I would not advise the Sangh as an organization to offer
 satyagraha against the savarna Hindus, but I would certainly not only advise but expect members of the Sangh in their individual capacity to organize such satyagraha in their respective places. I shall certainly support any such move on their part if it is undertaken in the proper spirit. It is their duty.
 Q. Would you, in the absence of popular government in  the  provinces, advise the Sangh to carry on a vigorous and energetic programme of temple-entry for Harijans?
 A. I could. I understand it is being done even at present but at a rather slow pace. I would certainly like its tempo to be stepped up.
 Q. Can the members of the Sangh refuse to interdine with the untouchables? Have your views on this question undergone any change?
 A. At one time I did say that interdining was not an essential part of the campaign for the removal of untouchability. Personally, I was for it. Today I encourage it. In fact, today I even go further, as a perusal of my recent preface to which I have already referred would show.
 Q. Should not the Harijan Sevak  Sangh  try  to  secure  for  the  Harijans political power by demanding due representation for them on gram panchayats, municipalities and legislatures?
A.	Certainly it ought to. No effort can be too great for it.
 Q.   Should not the Sangh give instructions in the essentials of Hindu religion  in the Harijan hostels and in Harijan gatherings of adults?
 A. It ought to be the primary duty of the Sangh to give to Harijan children and adults a grounding in the essentials of Hindu religion. If they were brought up in ignorance of these, they would not continue to remain in the Hindu fold, and the responsibility for it would rest on those who had failed to give them the necessary instruc- tion.
 Shri Sitaram Shastri of Vinaya Ashram, Guntur, asked whether the Sangh ought not to specially train a body of missionaries to carry on propaganda work
 among the savarna Hindus. He was prepared to start a training centre for that purpose in his Ashram if he were given adequate help.
 Gandhiji however had grave doubts as to the practicability of the suggestion. In fact, the question had actually been raised by Shri Ghanshyamdas Birla several years ago and dropped after full discussion. He would be quite satisfied, if at least the members of the Sangh would fully come up to the ideal.
 Q. Ought not we to set up a precedent for having Harijan representatives in  the Sangh or at least one Harijan member in the Executive Committee of the Sangh?
 In reply he referred to the history of the birth of the Harijan Sevak Sangh at the conclusion of the Poona Pact, which resulted in the modification of the decision of the MacDonald Government on the question of  the  representation  of  the minorities. It was felt that if the rot was to be effectively stopped, Hinduism ought to be completely rid of the curse of untouchability. This called for a real change of heart and repentance for its past sins on the part of Hindu society. It was to that end that the Harijan Sevak Sangh was formed.
I am therefore opposed to both the propositions. I know that
 under the present arrangement some Harijans are included in the Board of the Sangh. But this was a concession to Thakkar Bapa’s weakness. I have described the Harijan Sevak Sangh as an organi- zation of penitent sinners. Its object is to call upon so-called savarna Hindus to do expiation for having harboured untouchability. The inclusion of a Harijan in the Sangh would be mere eye-wash and make-believe, as his would be a mere voice in the wilderness. Before long, he would himself heartily wish to be out of it. I say this from my personal experience of the way in which committees function. I know the Sangh cannot always keep up to the mark. It is of course open to the Sangh to alter its scope and give Harijans a majority in  its Executive Committee or appoint a competent body of representative Harijans to act as a board of advisers and supervisors and keep the Sangh on the alert and on the right track.
 Gandhiji was next asked to give his opinion on the recent work in the Gwalior State to enlist the services of the Sadhu community in the cause of Harijan uplift. Gandhiji replying said he had grave doubts as to the correctness or advisability of the step. It seemed to him to smack of politics. He would welcome the assistance of true sadhus, if it was available. But he confessed he looked in vain in the country for sadhus of his conception. Such sadhus as he saw disappointed him. There might be here and there honourable exceptions and their help would be welcome. But he was frankly sceptical of the possibility of utilizing sadhus as a body for their work. Even  if they tried the experiment, he was afraid they would come to the parting of the ways
 before long.
 Another friend asked whether a portion of the Kasturba Memorial Trust Fund ought not to be earmarked for Harijan sisters. Gandhiji’s reply was that they could have the whole of it if they could show the capacity to utilize it. No special earmarking of a part was therefore necessary.
I am responsible for the policy of conducting Harijan uplift
 work through the agency of the savarna Hindus. They had to do expiation. All of them, I argued to myself, could help with money even if they could not, owing to lack of  necessary  qualifications, render direct service. For instance, they might not be able themselves to do teaching work, but they could engage a competent teacher to give education to Harijan children. That would be one way of doing expiation. They would be able to penetrate Harijan society and help in its progress.
 He knew there were sceptical critics, who questioned whether this kind of work could lead to the eradication of untouchability. He himself was at one time among the doubters. But he had since realized his mistake. He owed a debt of gratitude in this respect to the late Shri Devdhar, at whose activity he had at one time looked askance and which he had even criticized. A year’s experience, however, had cured him of his conceit and taught him humility. He realized that if he confined himself exclusively to doing propaganda among the savarna Hindus with a view to their conversion, he might have to wait till the Greek Kalends and in the meantime the actual uplift work among the Harijans would remain hopelessly bogged. His own experience had since convinced him that if they could only have sufficient workers with the requisite purity and devotion and spirit of sacrifice to work among Harijans, untouchability would become a thing of the past, even if the savarna Hindus were left severely alone. But that would mean that they must first become Harijans at heart and live and labour among the Harijans as Harijans.
But can the members of the Harijan Sevak Sangh truthfully
 claim to have eradicated the last trace of untouchability from their own hearts? Are their professions altogether on a par with their practice?
 A member asked as to what his criterion was in that respect.
Are you married?
 THE MEMBER: I happen to be.
 G. The have you an unmarried daughter? If you have, get for her a Harijan bridegroom, not to satisfy her lust but in a purely religious spirit and I shall send you a wire of congratulations at my expense.
 
 You will now realize why the Harijan sevaks are unable to move the hearts of the savarna Hindus. The reason is that they have not that fire of faith in their hearts, that impatient hunger for service which is the first essential for an effective appeal. Let but a handful of savarna Hindus go forth in that true missionary spirit and they will leaven the entire Hindu mass. But not even a whole army of missionaries so called will produce any effect upon them.
 It needed a Malaviyaji to make such a missionary. He (Gandhiji) could not convert his own sister. And if he could not, how could he blame others. That would show how hard and thorny was that path. It was however open to them, if they felt that they had the necessary qualification, to try the experiment for themselves in their locality.
 The reason for this partial failure, Gandhiji proceeded to explain, was also that the approach of most of the members of the Harijan Sevak Sangh to their mission was not unmixed with political motives. If they really wanted to penetrate the hearts of savarna Hindus, they ought to be filled with a purely religious spirit. Mere dialectics was a poor weapon for this kind of work. As it was, they were too much weighed down by inertia, heedlessness and woodenness of mind.
The other method is more fierce and not altogether free from
danger. It is the method of fasting.
 He himself had before condemned fasting when it seemed to him to be wrong or morally unjustified. But to shirk a fast when there was a clear moral indica-tion was    a dereliction of duty. Such a fast had to be based on unadulterated truth and ahimsa.
 In passing he hinted at the possibility of his having to go through one more fast in his life, possibly even more than one. He warned them however that he had no present thought of any. It was only a vague premonition.

 PANCHGANI,

 The verse from the gatha sung today says: ‘Let me remember Thee by making my heart pure by righteous thought, by performing good and wise deeds and by right speech.’ Unless all these conditions are fulfilled, one cannot expect to come near God.
 Then the poet says: ‘We bow to Thee and thank Thee for all that Thou hast done for us. We will always remain Thy debtors.’ What is this debt towards God and how can one repay it? The answer is, by discharging one’s duty completely. And since no mortal can completely discharge his duty in life, he must for ever remain a debtor to God.

AT PRAYER MEETINGSlibtech_597_footnote","
    
 PANCHGANI,
 [Before July 21, 1946]libtech_598_footnote
 In the song that has been sung today, the devotee says: ‘Keep my heart pure—guide me on the path of truth.Give me true happiness which springs from holding on to truth. Destroy the misery which results from relinquishing truth.’ Believe me when I tell you after 60 years of personal experience that the only real misfortune is  to abandon the path of truth. If you but realize this, your one prayer to God will always be to enable you to put up without flinching with any number of trials and hardships that may fall to your lot in the pursuit of truth. . . .
 The verse from the Zend Avesta describes five kinds of physi- cians, but the fifth is the true physician, who depends on nothing but the name of God for healing. That is just what I have been saying in connection with nature cure. Ramanama is the sovereign remedy. It is an agreeable surprise to me to find an authority for it in the gatha. . .
In the song that has been sung, the poet says that God is hidden
 
 and yet present everywhere. That is true. He knows our innermost
 thoughts better than we ourselves can do. One who depends on God will never be afraid of anybody, not even of the most despotic government on earth or its officers. For he will have as his protector the King of kings from whose eye nothing is hid. . . .
 Just as a tree has many branches but one root, similarly the various religions are the leaves and branches of the same tree. Islam, Christianity, Hinduism and Zoroastrianism are the main branches but as for varieties of religion, they are as numerous as mankind. If you take the name of God in the prayer gathering and forget all about it on going out, it is not prayer but blasphemy. Religion has to be lived every moment of one’s life.
 The girls have sung, ‘With folded hands, O Mazda! I beg of Thee to give me true knowledge and enable me to devote  every moment of my life to the service of Thy creation.’ It is a great prayer. The devotee begs of God to fill him or her with the thirst for service, so that service will become a pleasure and not a task. But what is the meaning of service? Is killing fellow human beings in war, for instance, also service? No. Therefore the devotee says, ‘Whatever I do, whether in order to serve others or myself, let all my deeds be pure and noble. Let them fill me with Thy joy.’ A man who lives up to this prayer would always be filled with His joy.
 Referring to the riots in Ahmedabad he said that the Hindus and Muslims in Ahmedabad had not yet got over their insanity. Islam meant peace, Hindus claimed to follow the path of ahimsa. They both swore by God but in practice they followed Satan. The Muslim stabbed the innocent Hindu and the Hindu stabbed the innocent Muslim.
Of the three workers who were killed in Ahmedabad some days
 ago one was a Muslimlibtech_599_footnotelibtech_600_footnote. It was a Muslim’s dagger that killed him. He was in the company of Hindus. No one even knew that he was a Muslim. One of his companions Vasantrao was well known and commanded the respect of both Hindus and Muslims. While in jail one of his Muslim companions went on a fast.There was an overwhelming majority of Hindus amongst the satyagrahi prisoners. Vasantrao felt that he ought to give his moral support to the Muslim brother and went on a sympathetic fast. His senior companions in jail, tried to dissuade him. ‘Are you wiser than all of us? You know the Muslim friend’s fast is not justified. If it was, we would all have fasted
 
 with him.’ His reply was:‘I do not claim to be wise. I prefer to be a fool. I seek your blessings. If this Muslim friend dies in jail in the midst of all of us Hindus, with what face shall I return to my Muslim friends outside? Therefore, I would far rather die with him, whatever the issue of his fast.’ Neither died in the end, but Vasantrao proved by his action that he was a true Hindu and a true Muslim combined into one.
 Gandhiji concluded by exhorting the audience to cultivate that mentality. He was sure that if they prayed to God to restore to sanity the Hindus and Muslims of Ahmedabad, their prayer would not go unheeded, but leap across space and melt the hearts of the deluded rioters in Ahmedabad.
 Harijan, 28-7-1946
 "
377,"July 21, 1946",INDEPENDENCE,"
    
 Q. You have said in your article in the Harijan of July 15, under the caption “The Real Danger”,libtech_601_footnotethat Congressmen in general certainly do not know the kind of independence they want. Would you kindly give them a broad but com-prehensive picture of the Independent India of your own conception?
A.	I do not know that I have not, from time to time, given my
 idea of Indian independence. Since, however, this question is part of a series, it is better to answer it even at the risk of repetition.
 Independence of India should mean independence of the whole of India, including what is called India of the States and the other foreign powers, French and Portuguese, who are there, I presume, by British sufferance. Independence must mean that of the people of India, not of those who are today ruling over them. The rulers should depend on the will of those who are under their heels. Thus, they have to be servants of the people, ready to do their will.
 Independence must begin at the bottom. Thus, every village will be a republic or panchayat having full powers. It follows, therefore, that every village has to be self-sustained and capable of managing its affairs even to the extent of defending itself against the whole world. It will be trained and prepared to perish in the attempt to defend itself against any onslaught from without. Thus, ultimately, it is the indivi- dual who is the unit. This does not exclude dependence on and willing help from neighbours or from the world. It will be free and voluntary
 
 play of mutual forces. Such a society is necessarily highly cultured in which every man and woman knows what he or she wants and, what is more, knows that no one should want anything that others cannot have with equal labour.
 This society must naturally be based on truth and non-violence which, in my opinion, are not possible without a living belief in God, meaning a self-existent, all-knowing living Force which inheres every other force known to the world and which depends on none and which will live when all other forces may conceivably perish or cease to act. I am unable to account for my life without belief in this all- embracing living Light.
 In this structure composed of innumerable villages, there will be ever-widening, never-ascending circles. Life will not be a pyramid with the apex sustained by the bottom. But it will be an oceanic circle whose centre will be the individual always ready to perish for the village, the latter ready to perish for the circle of villages, till at last the whole becomes one life composed of individuals, never aggressive in their arrogance but ever humble, sharing the majesty of the oceanic circle of which they are integral units.
 Therefore the outermost circumference will not wield power to crush the inner circle but will give strength to all within and derive its own strength from it. I may be taunted with the retort that this is all Utopian and, therefore, not worth a single thought. If Euclid’s point, though incapable of being drawn by human agency, has an imperi- shable value, my picture has its own for mankind to live. Let India live for this true picture, though never realizable in its completeness. We must have a proper picture of what we want, before we can have something approaching it. If there ever is to be a republic of every village in India, then I claim verity for my picture in which the last is equal to the first or, in other words, no one is to be the first and none the last.
 In this picture every religion has its full and equal place. We are all leaves of a majestic tree whose trunk cannot be shaken off its roots which are deep down in the bowels of the earth. The mightiest wind cannot move it.
 In this there is no room for machines that would displace human labour and that would concentrate power in a few hands. Labour has its unique in a cultured human family. Every machine that helps every individual has a place. But I must confess that I have never sat down to think out what that machine can be. I have thought of Singer’s sewing
 machine. But even that is perfunctory. I do not need it to fill in my picture.
 Q.	Do you believe that the proposed Constituent Assembly could be used for the realization of your picture?
A.	The Constituent Assembly has all the possibilities for the
 realization of my picture. Yet I cannot hope for much, not because the State Paper holds no such possibilities but because the document, being wholly of a voluntary nature, requires the common consent of the many parties to it. These have no common goal. Congressmen themselves are not of one mind even on the contents of Indepen- dence.I do not know how many swear by non-violence or the charkha or, believing in decentralization, regard the village as the nucleus. I know on the contrary that many would have India become a first-class military power and wish for India to have a strong centre and build the whole structure round it. In the medley of these conflicts I know that if India is to be leader in clean action based on clean thought, God will confound the wisdom of these big men and will provide the villages with the power to express themselves as they should.
 Q. If the Constituent Assembly fizzles out because of the “danger from within”, as you have remarked in the above-mentioned article, would you advise the Congress to accept the alternative of general country-wide strike and capture of power, either non-violently or with the use of necessary force? What is your  alternative in that eventuality if the above is not approved by you?
A.	I must not contemplate darkness before it stares me in the
 face. And in no case can I be party, irrespective of non-violence, to a universal strike and capture of power. Though, therefore, I do not know what I should do in the case of a breakdown, I know that the actuality will find me ready with an alternative. My sole reliance being on the living Power which we call God, He will put the alternative in my hands when the time has come, not a minute sooner.

           PANCHGANI, 
  July 	21, 1946  Gandhiji 	said that when he came to Panchgani under medical advice in 1944, 	after his release from detention, he found that there was no place 	where the poor and the destitute could put up, in order to take 	advantage of the beautiful climate. And what about the Harijans? He 	had received a long letter from one of them describing their woes.   
 “It is all right so long as his identity is unknown. But the moment it is discovered that he is a Harijan, he suddenly becomes a pariah. He is unwelcome everywhere. All doors are shut against him. The shopkeeper receives his money but sells him the rottenest stuff and cheats him into the bargain by giving him less than the full measure. Should the poor unfortunate object, he is insulted and told to be gone. The landlord won’t have him and asks him to quit. Where is the poor man to go?” It was heart-rending. He felt he could not come and stay in Panchgani unless there was a place where the Harijans would be welcome like all others. It had therefore given him great pleasure that Panchgani was at last going to hare such a place. Sheth Shantilal of Ahmedabad had purchased the ‘Satish Kunj’ property for Rs. 45,000 and had agreed to get it reconditioned and bear the running expenses of the institution for ten years. In the dharma shala which was going to be built, the poor of  all communities including the Harijans would be able to come and stay without any distinction of caste or religion. They would be provided free accommodation but would have to make their own arrangements as regards food, etc. A Trust had been formed to look after the dharmashala, consisting of Sheth Shantilal of Ahmedabad, Sheth Mohanlal, Shri Bachharaj, Dr. Dinshaw Mehta and Gandhiji. He would have liked the dharmashala, said Gandhiji, to be built out of funds provided by the inhabitants of Panchgani itself. But finance was not everything. Although they had not contributed the money, they should give their blessings and co-operation. The institution would fail unless the people took active and genuine interest in it. He suggested that sisters from well-to-do families should visit the sick or the convalescent who might come to the dharmashala for a change of climate, soothe them by singing beautiful hymns and render them whatever service they could or was necessary.
 The sanitary conditions in Panchgani were awful. In a climate like theirs there should never be any epidemics. Yet they had the plague only the year before and had to vacate the bazaar which was indescribably dirty. There was water shortage in spite of a plentiful rainfall. Why could not the rain water be captured and utilized for water supply? In South Africa, where rainfall was scarce and there was a dearth of underground water supply, they had a reservoir in every house for storing rain water. It was the duty of all of them, most of all the Municipality and the Public Health Department to remedy these defects. The Prime Minister Shri Balasaheb Kherlibtech_614_footnotewas there and was prepared to render them whatever help was necessary. If he were the Health Officer or the Chairman of the Panchgani Municipality, said Gandhiji, he would make the place so clean and neat that anybody might be able to lie down and sleep on the hill side in the open without any compunction. Today that was not
 
 
 possible, because of the Municipal insanitation. People spat and made nuisance here, there and everywhere indiscriminately. He spoke from knowledge, he said. Before he came under the Mahatmaic handicap and was free to go into dharmashalas and other places of public utility without attracting crowds, he had occasion to study the conditions prevailing in those places. The insanitation, the filth and the stench of the public latrines and urinals of the railway stations and in the dharmashalas were simply awful. They could make Panchgani into a jewel among hill stations, if only they did their duty.
 He then proceeded to make some concrete suggestions. The first and foremost of course was sanitation and night-soil disposal. Having become a Bhangi himself, he thought of it first. He had done a Bhangi’s job right from South Africa. He knew how to do it without becoming filthy himself. The sight of a Bhangi carrying the night-soil basket on his head made him sick. Scavenging was a fine art. Not only must the cleaning be perfect, but the manner of doing it and the instruments used, must be clean and not revolting to one’s sanitary sense.
 You have only to see the privy I use. It is spotlessly  clean without a trace of smell. That is so because I clean it myself. The municipal Bhangi pours out the contents of the night-soil waggons over a cliff converting a beauty spot into a plague  spot.  If  you become your own Bhangis, not only will you ensure perfect sanitation for yourself, but you will make your surroundings clean and relieve the Bhangis of the weight of oppression which today crushes them. Do not imagine that thereby you would deprive them of their living. Today we have reduced them to the level of the beast. They earn a few coppers but only at the expense of their human dignity. The same Bhangi serves in the municipality as well as in your bungalow, with the result that he can do justice to neither. Look at him as he eats his food, cowering under the shadow of the latrine wall, surrounded by filth. It is enough to break one’s heart. It should not be difficult for you to find a more decent avocation for him to follow.
 The Nawab Saheb of Wai who had seen him earlier in the day had told him that they knew what to do, but that the municipality was too poor and the necessary finances were lacking. He had asked the Nawab Saheb, said Gandhiji, to send him a small note setting forth their handicap. He hoped to be able to show him that what they wanted to do and what needed to be done, need not be held up for lack of funds. After all the various improvements which he had suggested would not require more than ten lakhs of rupees. He wanted to tell the rich folk who frequented Panchgani that    it was up to them to provide that amount. In free and progressive countries, the gentry considered it their special privilege and duty to shoulder the burden of providing municipal amenities and improvements. It was only in India that people looked for every little thing to the Government. They must learn to shed that mendicant habit if
 they aspired to become a free and self-respecting nation.
 Then they should do something to improve the drainage. For that, a suitable scheme would have to be prepared by an engineer. He hoped that the work would be taken up without delay.
 Lastly, he hoped that something would be done  immediately  about  the disposal of the night-soil. The present practice was a sin against man and God and its continuation even for a single day should be a matter of utter shame to them. He was sorry to tell them that Dr. Dinshaw had reported that even after nearly a fortnight, things were as bad as they were on their arrival in Panchgani.
 He hoped that when he came to Panchgani next year, God willing, he would find things different. The gulf that separated the rich and the poor  today  was  appalling. It had to be bridged. The rich must share all their amenities with the poor in the fullest measure. Their joining in the prayer gathering would have gone in vain  if it did not help them to realize and do their duty. Such prayer would be vain repetition which could do no good to them, to him or to anybody.

386,"July 22, 1946",BLOODSHED IN AHMEDABADlibtech_615_footnote,"
    
 Bloodshed had been going on in Ahmedabad for several days now. It is difficult to say who is at fault. The policy of the Govern- ment has been not to let anyone know who has stabbed whom. The Congress Government has adhered to this policy, so we should assume that there is some reason behind it. It could be in the manner of a thief’s mother feigning grief over her son’s doings, because in Ahmedabad everyone must know who is the aggressor or who is more to blame. My job is not to deliberate upon it; it is comparatively easier.
 The best way is for one of the parties to desist. Then alone can true peace be established and the madness come to an end. In my childhood a cousin of mine and I took bhang and laughed and laughed at each other like two mad men. When morning came and we were sober, we were both ashamed of ourselves and could not face each other. That intoxication was comparatively harmless but this is frightful.
 Is it not enough that three young menlibtech_616_footnotehave died in the attempt to stop the holocaust? I spoke about it at the prayer meeting at Poona.libtech_617_footnoteSeveral friends have written to me about the martyrdom. If we
 
 had sense that sacrifice would have quenched the fire. That has not happened. However, that does not mean that the sacrifice was in vain. It only means that many more such sacrifices must be offered before the fire can be quelled. Or both sides must tire themselves out. Some must face police bullets, some go to jail and some hang before the flames are extinguished. This is the wrong way; because the fire thus put out has every possibility of erupting again. It will not reduce the poison, only suppress it, which will then spread in the body politic and cause immense mischief.
 Moreover, if the riots are suppressed with the help of the police and its elder brother the military, it will strengthen the grip of the foreigner and emasculate us still further Poet Iqbal has said: “Reli- gion does not teach us to bear enmity towards each other.” Can there be greater cowardice than to fight amongst ourselves.
 There are ways even of fighting. If we must fight, why should we seek the help of the police and the military? The Government too should clearly say that the military, whilst it is in India, will only be used for the work of sanitation, for cultivating unused land and the like. And the police similarly will be used for catching thieves and dacoits, but never to put down communal riots. Let the people of Ahmedabad be brave enough to say that they will not seek the help of the police and the military, and they will not flee in panic. Rioters are mostly goondas. Even the white-collared  goondas murder by stealth. I am told that nearly all the stabbings have been in the back, none or very few in the chest or the face. Why should one be frightened of such people? One should either die at their hands in the hope that they will in the end give up their madness and goondaism, or if one does not have that much courage one should fight to defend oneself. The question may rightly be asked how can one fight against a person who strikes from behind. It may not be possible to prevent such a person from stabbing people in the back but if the onlookers are not in collusion with him and are brave enough, they can catch hold of the culprit and hand him over to the police or to the community to which he belongs, or bring him before the panch. Only, they may not become judges.

 Harijanbandhu, 28-7-1946"
387,"July 22, 1946",A DHARMASHALA FOR PANCHGANI,"
    
 When I first visited Panchgani after my release from jail, at a prayer meeting I mentioned the absence, in a beautiful place like Panchgani, of facilities for the poor, especially Harijans. In the event, for a person like me it becomes difficult even to stay at Panchgani. As far as I was concerned there were many who would put me up but where could the Harijans go? My host would accommodate  the Harijans accompanying me but what about the rest? How could we put up with such a pitiable state of affairs? I told this to the audience assembled at the prayer meeting.
 This created some stir. However, the result came only after two years. Sheth Shantilal bought a house and handed it on to me for lodging the poor. Such poor include myself and others I recommend. Of course they include poor Harijans and poor persons belonging to other religions who have nowhere to stay. There won’t be any arrangement for their meals. Even poor people do eat at home, so they will have to do their own cooking or make whatever other arrangement is possible. Besides, the poor will have to keep the place given to them clean, deposit their trash in the municipal cans and observe all the rules of sanitation. Free supply to them of water and electricity will be arranged. No one will be allowed to stay for ever. Those who are not suffering from infectious diseases, are not invalid, and do not require looking after will be given free accommodation for a certain specified period. They will not be provided with bedding, etc. This is not to be a home for the crippled. Idlers will have no place here. There are many places in Panchgani and the neighbouring hills for the middle-class people who observe caste distinctions. However, there is none for those who have broken away from the circle of castes or are outside that circle. Here accommodation will be provided to the poor and industrious.
 This activity can be pursued only if some local public worker is available. Shri Bachharaj Tribhovandas Doshi is such a worker. It was through his encouragement, as also of Gadhada’s Sheth Mohanlal Motichand and of his won grandfather Jeshangbhai, that Sheth Shanti- lal bought the above-mentioned house.
 Bhai Bachharaj stays in Panchgani most of the time. He has a flair and also love for this kind of work, so he will keep an eye on it. Sheth Shantilal has undertaken to bear the cost of repairs for ten
 years. Five trustees have already been appointed. I am considering the names of the remaining two. Among the five trustees are the above- mentioned three gentlemen, Dr. Dinshaw and myself. At the moment the building is not fit for residence. It is in need of repairs and the water supply is incomplete. It may be ready for use only in October.
 Thus a beginning has been made. Prime Minister Shri Kher along with two other Ministers Shri Tapase and Shri Patil, were present when this was announced after the prayer meeting in the hall of the Parsi Girls School on Sunday.libtech_618_footnoteWe should pray and wish that the work which has begun so well may really prove beneficial to the poor.

400,"July 24, 1946",STATEMENT TO THE PRESS,"
    
 
PANCHGANI,
 July 24, 1946
 Doctor A. G. Tendulkar, President, Goa Congress Committee is the last one from Goa who has come to me with the latest news from the place.libtech_626_footnotelibtech_627_footnoteHe tells me that there are several parties there, working not necessarily for its inhabitants but for power. Yet at bottom the fight is good. He has produced voluminous papers in support of the statement that confusion reigns supreme in the minds of Goans, correctly described as Gomantakas. This confusion is bad in that the inhabitants of these Portuguese possessions are novices in the art of real politics. Its separate existence, it is clear, can only depend on the goodwill of the mighty British Government and the impotence of its Indian residents. It is therefore most essential for the success  of  the movement that it should be conducted by the Gomantakas on the clearest possible issue, i. e., civil liberty. The larger question of swaraj should await its attainment by the whole of India unless of course the Portuguese Government wisely come to terms with the inhabitants of the settlement through friendly negotiations. It cannot be attained by any direct action of the citizens, whether violent or non-violent. In non-violent action success is assured where every inhabitant is a hero ready to lay down his or her life. It is less to be thought of in Goa than in the more numerous and better seasoned and awakened British India. Therefore the clearest possible issue of civil liberty must be kept steadily in view.
 The second condition of success is that the fight must  be through non-violent and therefore also entirely open means.
 Thirdly, there should be no parties struggling for power and position. Where the goal and the means are common, different parties have no meaning.
 On reading the literature I find two persons called loyalists who have already made lavish declarations saying that nothing is wrong in
 
 Goa and that a false agitation is being carried on by some mischievous persons. Let not the circle of these loyalists grow larger. The best way to avoid this growth is for all parties to become one.

 "
401,"July 25, 1946",QUESTION BOXlibtech_628_footnote,"
    
 
 Q.	I have been repeating Ramanama according to your advice and I am gett- ing better. I must add that the medical treatment for tuberculosis is also being followed. You have said that eating little and eating the right food enables a man to be healthy and promotes longevity. I have observed the rule about eating sparely for the last twenty-five years. Why should I have fallen a prey to tuberculosis? Would you say I should attribute this ill-luck to some evil deed in this life or in the previous one?
 You say a man can live up to 125 years. Then why should God have carried away Mahadevbhai, who was so useful to you? He observed the rule of eating mode- rately and having a balanced diet and he served you as his God. Why did he fall a prey   to high blood-pressure? Why did Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, who is looked upon as an incarnation of God, fall a prey to cancer, as deadly a disease as tuberculosis? Why was he not able to fight it successfully?
A.	I have been expounding the rules of maintaining health as I
 know them. Spare and balanced diet may not be the same for everybody. It can be best worked out by the individual for himself through proper reading and careful thought. But that does not mean that the individual cannot make mistakes or that his or her knowledge is complete. That is why life has been called a laboratory. One should learn from the experience of others and go forward and if he is not successful, he should not blame others or even himself. One should not be too ready to find fault with the rule, but if after careful thought, one comes to the conclusion that a certain rule is wrong, he should be able to tell the right one and declare it.
 So far as your own case is concerned, there may be several causes leading to your illness. Who can say whether you have made the right use of the five ‘powers’ in your own case? So long as I believe in the laws of nature as I know them, I have to say that you must have erred somewhere. As for Mahadev and Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, to feel that even they must have erred somehow is fitter
 
 than to say that the laws are wrong. These rules are not my creation. They are the laws of nature according to experienced men. I believe them and try to live up to my belief. Man is after all an imperfect creature. How can he know the whole truth? That the doctors do not believe in them or, if they do, they do so in a different sense, does not impress me. What I have said does not and should not in any way detract from the greatness of the individuals mentioned.
 Q. In Harijanbandhu of 14-4-’46, you have said, “God is the Law and the Law-giver.” I do not understand it. Laws are made by man and they keep on changing with time. For instance, Draupadi had five husbands and yet she was considered a sati .  A woman who does that today will be considered immoral.
A.	Law here means the law of God. Man interprets that law
 according to his understanding. We can therefore say that with the gaining of more knowledge he finds the previous assumption wrong.libtech_629_footnoteFor instance, the rotation of the earth is a law of nature. We are convinced of its correctness today. Yet before Galileo, astronomers believed differently. As for Draupadi, the Mahabharata  in  my opinion is an allegory and not history. Draupadi means the soul wedded to the five senses.
 Q. God cannot be realized through reason. He has to be understood through faith. Do you believe in rebirth or is it that the Hindu seerslibtech_630_footnotepropounded it in order to enable people to appreciate the significance of good and evil deeds and derive some satisfaction from the belief?
A.	God cannot be realized through the intellect. Intellect can
 lead one to a certain extent and no further. It is a matter of faith and experience derived from that faith. One might rely on the experience of one’s betterslibtech_631_footnoteor else be satisfied with nothing less than personal experience. Full faith does not feel the want of experience. The distinction between good and evil is not meant to act as a consolation. Nor is faith in God meant for that purpose. The seers have held that there is good and evil and there is rebirth. I think this theory of reincarnation is capable of being understood by the intellect.
 Q. The Congress has been fighting the British Government non-violently. When Congressmen come into power, they shoot their own brothers who have gone astray and are causing trouble. Is it right? If the Congressmen in power have not the courage to lay down their lives while attempting to put down the riots non-violently,
 
 does it not show with the exception of a few individuals like Ravishankar Maharaj and Sane Guruji, the non-violence of Congressmen in general is the non-violence of the weak?
A. The question of violence and non-violence raised by you is
 an old question. I have said a lot in this connection. If like many others, non-violence does not appeal to your heart, you should discard it. I shall not find fault with you for that, and, if others do, you should not care. The principle is this: “That which has been propounded by the rishis, practised by the sages and appeals to one’s heart should be followed and put into practice.” The question might arise as to what one is to do when the thing that appeals to one’s heart is contrary to what has been propounded by the rishis and practised by the sages. The answer is, that in such a case the individual can follow his bent at his own risk. Many reforms and new discoveries have been made in this way. Our Shankaracharyas have supported the institution of untouchability but both our head and heart consider it a blot on Hinduism. We do not care if others consider our belief to be wrong.
 Q. From 1920 you have described the British Government’s officials as the arms of Ravana. Congress Governments use these arms. Again, the laws made by the British Government say that it is an offence to beat a prisoner arrested on suspicion or for an alleged offence, in order to extort a confession or to frighten him. During the 1942 revolution, many like me were severely beaten after arrest. Should not the Congress Governments hold an inquiry into the police excesses thus committed?
A.	I have severely criticized the British Government and do so
 still. But that does not mean that all police officials under the British Government must necessarily be devil’s disciples even  when  they come under Congress Governments. No one has questioned Congress Govern-ment’s right to inquire into the police excesses in 1942 or even before. But such rights are not always exercised. We all know that there are times when wisdom lies in not exercising certain rights. The Congress has in general followed the policy of not inquiring into the kind of excesses mentioned by you. You should know that often such offences are difficult to prove. I believe the right of inquiry has been exercised in cases where the offence was beyond doubt. But my advice is let us not sit in judgment on the Congress ministries. The belief that Congress has acted wisely in accepting power should  suffice.

 A correspondent has written to me about the butchery that is going on in Ahmedabad. I give below the relevant portions from his letter.
 I wish to write to you about the means to be employed for putting down riots. About two months ago you wrote an article on Ahimsak Seva Dal—non- violent volunteer corps.libtech_633_footnoteBut looking to the situation in the country, the suggestion will not do. Just as you have taught us how to fight against the British Government non-violently, you should go to some place of riot and show us the way of quelling riots in a non-violent manner by personal example. Supposing you were in Ahmedabad today and went out to quell the riots, any number of volunteers will join you. Two of our Congress workers, Shri Vasantrao and Shri Rajabali, went out in such a quest and fell a prey to the goonda’s knife. They laid down their lives in the pursuit of an ideal and they deserve all praise. But no one else had the courage to follow in their footsteps. They have not the same self-confidence. If they had it, there would be no riots and, even if riots broke out, they would never assume the proportions and the form that the present day riots do. But the fact remains that such a state is merely an imaginary thing today.
 Your guidance and example can inspire many like me with courage and self-confidence. Once you have shown the way, the local workers will be able to follow it whenever occasion demands it. I feel that unless you set an example in action, your writings and utterances will not be of any use to the ordinary people, and even Congressmen, in organizing non-violent protec- tion of society.
 I like the suggestion mentioned above. People followed my advice and took to non-violent resistance against the British Govern- ment because they wanted to offer some sort of resistance. But their non-violence, I must confess, was born of their helplessness. There- fore, it was the weapon of the weak. That is why today we worship Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and his Azad Hind Fauj. We forget that Netaji himself had told his soldiers that on going to India, they must follow the way of non-violence. This I have from the leaders of the I.
 A. But we have lost all sense of discrimination. To restore it, the I. 
 N. A. men will have to live up to the ideal placed before them by Netaji. The work of those who believe in non-violence is very difficult
 
 in this atmosphere which is full of violence. But the path of true non- violence requires much more courage than violence. We have not been able to give proof of such non-violence. We might look upon the action of Shri Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi, Shri Vasantrao and Shri Rajabali as examples of the non-violence of the brave. But when communal feelings run high, we are unable to demonstrate any effect of the sacrifices mentioned above. For that, many like Shri Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi will have to lay down their lives. The fact that no one else in Ahmedabad has followed the example set by Shri  Vasantrao and Shri Rajabali shows that we have not yet developed the spirit of sacrifice to the extent of laying down our lives in non-violent action. The correspondent has rightly said that under these circum- stances, I should act myself whether others join me or not. It will be disgraceful on my part to sit at home and tell others to go and lay down their lives. Such a thing cannot be an indication of non- violence. I have never had the chance to test my non-violence in the face of communal riots. It might be argued that it was my cowardice which prevented me from seeking such a chance. Be that as it may, God willing, the chance will still come to me, and by throwing me in the fire, He will purify me and make the path of non-violence clear. No one should take it to mean that sacrifice of my life will arrest all violence. Several lives like mine will have to be given if the terrible violence that has spread all over, is to stop and non-violence is to reign supreme in its place. The poetlibtech_634_footnotelibtech_635_footnotehas sung:
 “The path of Truth is for the brave, never for the coward.” The path of Truth is the path of non-violence.

  	I had occasion to see your handwriting after many days. I was glad 	all the same for the opportunity. There is a slight deterioration in    
 the handwriting. You should improve it gradually. Your language also is not grammatically correct. You have eaten up the vowel marks. Don’t do it hereafter. If you do not revise what you have written it cannot be considered to have been written. People who formed such a habit have been saved from a great many difficulties. If your pen cannot express what you think, will not the reader misconstrue the meaning? There are so many instances of this having happened.
 The news that Manilal had reached Durban appeared in the newspapers. It was two or three days ago. You need not worry about anyone. Be engrossed in your study. Master your mother tongue by studying it at home. You will certainly master Hindustani. Learn thoroughly carding, sliver-making, spinning and doubling the yarn. And spin with the same thoroughness. Do not cultivate the mind at the expense of the body. One man make real progress only if all the three things develop simultaneously.

  	I got your long letter of 3-7-1946 on the 25th. The wire has not 	come. You have given a lot of news in your letter. In the context of 	a movement of such magnitude it is futile if not difficult to guess 	who are noble and who are not. Water from many sources flows into 	the Ganga and yet the Ganga is pure as ever. A major movement is 	like the stream of the Ganga and is always pure. Under the 	circumstances our dharma is to stay as pure as the Gangotri. Then 	all will be well. If she did not remain pure for all time the Ganga 	would cease to be what she is and turn into a filthy river. We see 	such things happening in our midst.  	Manilal will tell you the rest. The papers here carry a Reuter’s 	cable saying that he has reached there. I am certainly very glad 	that he went there. Without doubt that was his dharma.  	I had told Sorab that no help whatever should be sent from here. 	That is my advice now. I am arranging for a lot of other help and 	you will continue to receive it. It should be a rule with all 	struggles to depend solely on local support. You will remember that 	for my part I    
 had tried to avoid help coming from India. But it did come. Some came from England, too, which I put to good use. One might say that in those times it was even necessary to some extent. My experience, however, is that whenever aid arrived from outside we grew lax. Now I see no need to send even a cowrie from here.

417,"July 27, 1946",CLOTH SHORTAGE,"
         	Shri Manu Subedar who takes interest in khadi and other village 	industries, sent me the following note some time ago. But I delayed 	publication in order that I might make some more effective use of it 	than giving it in Harijan. I could not think of any. Hence 	this publication for the use, not only of all provincial governments 	but also of private individuals or organizations, in however limited 	a field it may be. Here 	is Shri Subedar’s scheme:  One 	bale of cotton should be given to every village collectively. The 	people of the village could spin this yarn. The yarn will be used 	either for doubling or as weft and cloth could be made.  One 	bale would yield approximately 2,400 yards of cloth (or 1,800 	according to count).  If 	charkhas and taklis 	are wanted, they 	should be supplied by the State. (Manufacture should be organized in 	jails.)      Imitation 	of Christ. 
 The cloth, when ready, should be made available to the people of the villages on a per head ration basis.
 If and when it is important to collect grain in those villages where there  is supposed to be a grain surplus in the hands of the farmers, the cloth should be substituted only for grain. In other cases, the people of the village should collect enough to pay for the value of the bale of cotton. In other words, for the price of cotton (which is in the first instance advanced by Government) they would get cloth.
 While cloth shortage would be eased, cotton surplus would also be taken away and it will help the grower of cotton.
 As the village Panch would have to take over the cotton bale and deal with the whole thing, the beginning would be made of:
 village industry, joint 	and collective effort,  participation 	and labour 	contribution by 	the small 	and the big ones, and elimination 	of the middleman. 
 If the experiment were made in the first instance with twenty thousand villages of the Bombay Presidency or even two thousand of them, the results would be seen in the course of the next six weeks.
 Government will have to lock up funds for the cotton at the rate of Rs. 225 per bale. Much of this money will return either in the form of grain or in the form of cash. But it will have incidentally marked the beginning of something which the villages can do for themselves.
 Assistance may have to be given where looms are not available, or where the yarn produced is not capable of being used both as warp and as weft. But these are details in organization which could be attended to by someone at the headquarters of every district.
 On return of price of bale by a village, a fresh bale should be sent to them by Government as an advance.
 I may add that this is a variation upon the one suggested by me. In my opinion, the original is probably better, but I attach greater value to Shri Subedar’s note because he has worked out the figures, suggested a beginning with a bale of cotton and more  specially because he as an economist has thought out his scheme independently of me. It will be easy enough to find flaws in every human scheme. Our business is to remove flaws if we know how or to make a beginning in spite of the flaws which we know but cannot mend. No reform is possible if we wait for perfection.

 Harijan, 4-8-1946"
418,"July 27, 1946",NINTH AUGUST,"
    
 Ninth August, like 6th April, 13th April and 26th January, is a red letter day in the battle of India’s freedom. They are days for universal hartal in terms of satyagraha, i.e., truth and non-violence. But today, considered in terms of satyagraha, hartals are generally taboo and more specially so on the coming 9th of August. They would be fitting if hartals are designed to signalize violence.
 Two powerful voices have spoken: one of the President of the Congress, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and the other of the President of the Socialist Group, Shri Jaiprakash Narayan. It is delicate for me to give my opinion when these two ardent lovers of their country speak in opposition. But as a satyagrahi I must overcome the delicacy.
 Jaiprakash Narayan is a Congressman. It is an open secret that he was offered a seat on the Working Committee by Panditji, naturally under the belief that, whatever views he entertained, he was too honest to be disloyal to the Congress in action. If, now, in spite of knowing the Congress President’s views to the contrary, he adheres to his own opinion given to the contrary, it would appear to be an act  of  disloyalty to the Congress. If, therefore, he has not withdrawn from the false position, I hope, recognizing the aptness of my remarks, he will see the wisdom of retracing his steps.
 The Working Committee, rightly or wrongly, has taken a step. It has been endorsed by the A. I. C. C.libtech_651_footnotelibtech_652_footnoteIt is up to every Congressman to support the Congress going to the Constituent Assembly, by creating the atmosphere suitable for work in that Assembly. This I say even to those who distrust good faith in everything the British do. They may warn the Congress of the dangers they sense. This they were allowed by the President to have the fullest latitude to do at the recent A. I. C.
 C. meeting. Anything in excess of that opposition is surely harmful for the country. I would consider as such the hartal on the 9th August.
 The Congress cannot have the cake and eat it too. It must be left free, it must be helped, to develop freedom through the Constituent Assembly. It will not be a waste of effort to honestly work the Assembly for the purpose. The Congress must not kill the hen before
 
 C. on July 6.
 
 it has laid.
 Then mark the atmosphere in the country. There is senseless disorder as in Ahmedabad and elsewhere. There is a parody of satyagraha in the show staged by Dr. Ambedkar. In satyagraha the cause has to be just and clear as well as the means. The cause is certainly vague, even if the means are non-violent. I doubt the wisdom of the sympathetic paralysis of all business in Bombay and elsewhere, assuming the postal strike to be good on merits. Many would seem to have left off all thinking. They seem to take up any nostrum without caring to examine its merits. To call for hartal in this atmosphere is to invite disorder. No disorder is conducive to the growth of indepen- dence. Considered from every point of view, I hope that 9th August next will see no hartal in India, but a peaceful and dignified, orderly celebration of the day as advised by the President of the Congress.
 PANCHGANI, July 27, 1946
 [PS.] Before the despatch of this to Harijan I saw to my joy the withdrawal by Shri Jaiprakash of his proposal for hartal  on  9th August. I am glad that the spirit of discipline has dictated this with- drawal. I might have cancelled the foregoing but for the important incidental observations in it.

 I believe that Kanchan will not be happy till you set up a house with her. It will be different if she herself gives it up later. Where you should stay is for you to decide. If you two willingly observe physical brahmacharya, i. e., do not touch each other for the satisfaction of physical craving and sleep in separate beds, I will have no objection to your staying in the Ashram. Do not Shakaribehn, Kashi and Gomati live thus? If Kanchan wants only that, the matter is quite simple. I unhesitatingly agree to your working in the office, irrespective of whether or not Kanu is there. I have some work also for you. Both of you will have to be ceaselessly vigilant and strive to banish thoughts of passion from your minds; otherwise you will both burn up. You will be listless all the time, be unhappy and make others unhappy. If you are going to burn with passion inside, you may as well live in a separate house away from the Ashram, gratify the desire for sex pleasure and, after you have tired of it, see what you can do. Show this letter to Kanchan. You may show it to others also. Even if you live away from the Ashram and pursue sexual enjoyment, I will still give you work.
 I must not be pressed to decide about it just now. I must watch and you also will have to consider how you can find time for work, and how much, from your pleasure-seeking. You will feel as if you had been but recently married. I know the plight of newly-married couples.
 I have never thought even in my dreams that you would know- ingly tell a lie. But when you get excited while speaking, you behave like a man out of his senses and your face and words seem like those of a mad man. In a sense all of us are mad. But at such moments you seem to be the maddest of us all. You will not be cured of  this madness unless you decide to speak as little as possible. I think the cause of this madness in you is self-suppression. For all I know it may be something else.
 I understand about Uruli. I will know more if Kanchan explains it to me.
 Show me the exercise book in which you write  Urdu.  You should not get up at night at two o’clock and write. It would be better to write a little whenever you get the time during the day.
 It will save space if for writing the time you use the space to the left of the red line. The exercise-book should be kept as tidy as possible.

  [On or before July 28, 1946]libtech_668_footnote  Q. 	The English people have 	for years oppressed the coloured people in India, Ceylon and South 	Africa. Would their conduct not make an impression on their 	civilization? Can any one nation attain progress or preserve its 	existence through oppression? A.	An 	oppressor must perish in the end. But I wonder if that  	term can be strictly applied to the English people. Surely, they are 	not the worst. I have simply stated the divine law with regard to 	the oppressor. It is attested to by all religions. Irrespective of 	whether the conquest and exploitation by the English of other 	nations can be called oppression in the technical sense, their power 	cannot last for ever. Oppression is sin but submission to oppression 	is no less sin. History teaches us that neither the power of the 	oppressor nor the suffering of the oppressed can last for ever. Both 	must come to an end.  The 	Bombay Chronicle, 	29-7-1946         Q. Whilst the food policy 	was in the hands of the Advisors to  the Provinicial Governors, 	there was no effective method of checking them. Things under the 	responsible Provincial Governments are different. Should it not be a 	matter of conscience with Congress ministers to get their rations 	from common rationing depots and take not a grain more from any 	other source? This will immediately have a far-reaching effect. 	Today all controlling centres for food grains or cloth have public 	dens for thieving and corruption. Equipped with the moral force that 	the ministers will gain by acting as suggested, they will be able to 	fight out the evil with success. A.	This 	question is a consolidation of many letters of com-   
   camp.     
 plaints. I wholly agree with the suggestion made in the question. I fancy that the suggested practice is already being observed, not only by the ministers but all other Government servants. I do not know of any other source save the black market for getting supplies of foodstuffs. Of course, no exhortation can take the place of persons in authority setting a good example. If they took their rations from the same stock as is given to the public, the keepers of stores will soon find that it would not pay to dole out rotten stuff to the public. The practice of the ministers and other high-placed men in England taking their things in common with the public is, I am told, the usual thing, as it should be.

 "
428,"July 28, 1946",KHADI WORKERSlibtech_669_footnote,"
    
 I have two questions about Khadi workers before me. One of these is in connection with village workers. It is their duty to spend their time mainly in spinning and making others spin. The new conception of khadi work includes all the processes from the cultivation of cotton to the preparation of cloth. A worker who does all these intelligently and can mend the spinning-wheel or the spindle, will never have any difficulty in earning his livelihood and teaching others to do so. Along with it, and without letting khadi work suffer, the worker might treat simple ailments and attend to the sanitation of the village. Education has to be imparted through a craft. Therefore I do not consider it apart from khadi work. Those who come for education must wear khadi and get education through khadi.
 The second question is how long should a khadi worker work as a paid worker. In my view he should be self-supporting from the beginning. If that is not possible, he should fix a time limit  for  himself. Five years is the utmost limit in my opinion. A worker who is to become self-supporting at the end of five years, should reduce his allowance progressively from year to year. He cannot expect to  become self-supporting all of a sudden at the end of five years. It is an art which requires careful thought and management. He who really teaches others should certainly become self-supporting himself.

The village people gave up khadi because they were tempted by mill- 	cloth. If there is an opportunity to end that temptation but one 	does not utilize it, then that person would be a fool. How does it 	mean forcing khadi on the village people? If mill-cloth is not 	available and if people do not make their own cloth, then they have 	the right to shiver in the cold and remain naked—nobody can 	deprive them of that.

432,"July 	28, 1946","SPEECH AT MEETING
OF DECCAN PRINCESlibtech_671_footnote","
         POONA,  July 	28, 1946    Gandhiji 	said that it was 	a great 	pleasure to him 	to be able 	to meet 	the Deccan 	Princes. He 	had read 	the papers 	and the note 	prepared for his 	edification by 	the Raja 	Saheb of 	Phaltan. He 	did not wish to 	speak on 	the papers. It 	was a good thing that the 	Princes were seriously 	thinking in terms 	of the whole of India, rather than 	of themselves 	and of 	the protection 	they had all these years 	thought they 	were getting from 	the Paramountcy 	of the British 	Power. Only a few years 	ago the Princes 	felt that they could not 	be safe 	except under the 	Paramountcy of 	the British 	Crown. It seemed 	to have 	dawned on 	most of 	them that that was not 	the correct attitude. 	This was but 	natural, for 	they were after 	all sons 	of  the 	soil. He 	 had said 	  openly   on 	  another    
 occasion that the people of the States were slaves of slaves which the Princes were. They exercised their authority within their own principalities, so long as they were in the good books of the British Government. They were made or unmade at the pleasure of the British Crown. The Princes who had eyes opened to that vital fact were desirous   of India’s independence equally with the people of India. If then they felt that need, they did not want a union of the States but each State had first to form a union with its own people. Their people were the real power on whom they were to depend for their status. It became trusteeship if they became servants of their own people. If they took that attitude, they needed no terms with the Congress or with any other organization. The immediate need was an understanding with their own people.
 He made bold to take up that attitude, though his might be a lonely voice. In his opinion, the Princes, as servants and trustees of their people, were worthy of their hire. It would then (but not before) be time to consider whether they and their people wanted a union among themselves. Such a union would be of a wholly different type from what they had conceived.
 The speaker had a serious suspicion that the present proposallibtech_672_footnotewas a creation of the British Rulers, meaning the Political Agents. No blame need be imputed to them if they advised such a union. They were brought up in no better tradition. They thought that when the British power was not in India, the Princes would fight amongst themselves. That fear was wholly unjustifiable. They honestly believed that before they retired, as they must within perhaps a few months, owing to force of circumstances, they should enable the Princes to consolidate their  power  by organizing them into a union.
 It was his belief that if India was not merely to be independent of British control, but was to enjoy real freedom, which their country, by virtue of its ancient culture and tradition was entitled to, it should grow from the bottom upwards, not be imposed from above. Otherwise, it would be a question of change of masters only. Instead of the English, there might be the Allied Powers or whosoever could impose himself on them. He did not look forward to that time. He looked forward to a time when India would come into her own because of her intrinsic merit. To that consummation the Princes could make a most handsome contribution.
 If the Deccan Princes played their part and set a solid example, they would follow. For that purpose, the speaker repeated, they did not need the suggested union. If, on the other hand, at the back of their minds they had the idea that they would give the so-called responsible Government to the people to the ear and break it to the heart, then the proposed union would be a kind of military combination after the manner of the European Powers. It would be used against the people despite their protestations. That Power would be useless against a first-class military Power. They
 
 
 would be the first to lay down their arms before a venturesome aggressor. The British had taken good care not to give them training that might enable them to resist a Power like themselves by force of arms.
 What applied to the States applied to the whole of India. She would have to serve a long period of tutelage at the feet of the Western nations before she could become a first-class military power. A quarter of a century’s effort that the Congress had spent in teaching the country non-violence would in that event have been utterly wasted. That was not a prospect to which he could look forward with equanimity.
 He had suggested to the Raja Saheb of Aundh that the Princes should, with necessary changes, copy the constitution of Aundh, if they wanted to take their due share in building up of a free India. That constitution was designed for the people. He, the speaker, would have liked it to go much further in such matters as the amount and control of the privy purse, etc. But all that had to come naturally. It could not be
 imposed. The working of that constitution, he added, had made considerable progress—though not all the progress—which the Raja Saheb of Aundh, his Prime
 Minister or he, would have liked.
 After Gandhiji had finished, a discussion followed and questions were asked. “Unless we unite, not a single State would have a survival value,” remarked one of them and asked for Gandhiji’s opinion on that point.
GANDHIJI: I am prepared to join issue on it though mine is
 perhaps a solitary voice. Every village has a survival  value.  Why should not your villages and hence you, the Princes, if you will be part of the people? Aundh, one of the smallest among you, has a greater survival value than many of you. It depends upon you. So far as the people are concerned, they are one with the rest of India already.
 In an articlelibtech_673_footnotelibtech_674_footnotethat I have written for the Harijan, you will see my picture of Independence. In that picture, the unit is the village community. The superstructure of Independence is not to be built on the village unit so that the top weighs down on and crushes the forty crores of people who constitute the base.libtech_675_footnotelibtech_676_footnoteThe power will vest in the unit itself, which will be econo- mically and politically as autonomous as possible. Today power is perched on Mt. Everest.  From there orders are issued and the people have to obey. The almighty British Government comes to the people once or twice in the year when the patel and the talati come to collect revenue.
I have conceived round the village as the centre a series of ever-
 
 widening circles, not one on top of the other, but all on the same plane, so that there is none higher or lower than the other. Mainelibtech_677_footnotehas said that India was a congerie of village republics. The towns were then subservient to the villages. They were emporia for the surplus village products and beautiful manufactures. That is the skeleton of my picture to serve as a pattern for Independent India. There are many faults in the ancient village system. Unless they are eradicated, there will not only be no hope for the untouchables in a free India but for India in the comity of nations.
 “But we shall ask our people to draw up their own constitution. The plan of union that we have drawn up is only intended as a blue-print for their consideration,” explained another.
G.	With the best intention in the world you will not be able to
 do that. You are brought up in a different tradition. Therefore, I suggest you should see Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru about it, if you will really let the people judge. He is the proper person to deal with this question as the President of the States’ People’s Conference. You should not be afraid to go to the States’ People’s Conference with your suggestions. Let the Conference decide finally. Their present policy is sound and not hostile to you, considered as servants and trustees of your people.
 Q.	We are anxious to serve our mother country. But we are so small that we cannot serve unless we merge into a union.
G.	Not in my picture of Independent India. A village unit as
 conceived by me is as strong as the strongest. My imaginary village consists of 1,000 souls. Such a unit can give a good account of itself, if it is well organized on a basis of self-suffi- ciency.  Do  not, therefore, think that unless you have a big union you will not be able to give a good account of yourself. If Princes are all of one mind and the interest of the people is first and themselves last, theirs will be more solid union than the one now proposed.
 Q.	What would you say if the States organized themselves on the basis of village republics first and then formed them into a union?
A.	That would be excellent, but then you will speak a different
language and proceed to work in an altogether different way.
 Q.	But that may take a long time and, unless it is done by people outside
 
 
 first, our people will not take to it.
 A. I have said that the States can make the finest contribution to the building of India’s future Independence, if they set the right example in their own territories. They as individual States being compact, homogenous units can well afford to make experiments in government. As it is, the Princes have taken the lead only in copying the bad points of the British system. They allow themselves to be led by the nose by their Ministers, whose administrative talent consists only in extorting money from their dumb, helpless subjects. By their tradition and training they are unfitted to do the job you have let them do. Therefore, my advice to you is: ‘Make Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru your Chief Minister, if you are in earnest. Let him present you with an outline. He will naturally consult the people.’
 Q. We want to organize ourselves into a union so that our people may have swaraj first without waiting for the labours of the Constituent Assembly to be finished, which may take time.
A.	That is the wrong way of going about the thing. If you are
 solicitous of the welfare of the people and want them to come into their own, give them the fullest liberty straight away. By the time you have done that, the Constituent Assembly will have finished its work. The constitution which it will frame will not be for British India merely, but for the whole of India. That constitution will necessarily provide for a States’ union or unions, if it is desirable. You should assist them instead of anticipating them by forming your own union. Begin with the individual and you will not then go wrong.
 N. C. KELKAR: Are you opposed to the union, because it is suspect in your
  eyes?   G.	I 	began with that. But I do not oppose it on the ground for 
 my 	suspicion. I suspect not you—A, B or C, but the  	circumstances. You do not know the danger and mischief you are 	running into. Hence my advice to you to hasten slowly.  Q.	If 	you stretch your 	argument, would it not 	apply equally to 	the district and 	taluq organizations in the provinces? Why do not you ask for their dissolution? G.	I 	 am  not   asking  you   to   dissolve   anything  that  already  	exists—not that I am enamoured of the machinery of administration 	set up in British India. History tells us, it was devised mainly to 	facilitate revenue collection. You will follow it only at your cost. 	My point just now is: Do not do anything in the shape of unions. 	Leave 
 that work to be done by the Constituent Assembly. As a Sanskrit poet says,    (not to rush into new enterprises is the first mark of wisdom).

Although I did not have much time, I could not put down the book after starting it. It is a very fascinating and instructive work. I thank you. I am returning the book. Your effort is commendable, no doubt about it. What help can I give you? Your work alone will take you to your goal.

EDUCATION MINISTERS’
CONFERENCElibtech_683_footnote","
 POONA,
 July 29, 1946
 He knew clearly enough, said Gandhiji, what was to be done but he did not quite know how it could be done. So far they had their course mapped out for them, but now they had to sail on uncharted waters. He knew their difficulties. It was not easy for those who had been brought up in the old tradition to break away from it at a stroke. If he were in the Ministerial chair, he would issue broad instructions that hereafter all educational activity of the Government should be on basic education lines. Adult education drives had been launched in several provinces. If he had his way, he would conduct them also through a basic craft. In his opinion, cotton spinning and the allied processes were crafts par excellence for this purpose. But he would leave the choice of the craft to the people concerned in each case in the certain belief that in the end that craft alone which had the necessary intrinsic merit would survive. It should be the job of the inspectors and other officers of the Education Department to go among the people and teachers of schools and by persuasion and argument, edu- cate them in the value and utility of the Government’s new educational policy. That was their primary job, not to lord it over them. If they had no faith in it or if they were unwilling loyally to work out the new policy, he would give them the choice to resign. But he did not think that it would be necessary, if the Ministers knew their job and put their shoulder to the wheel. Merely issuing orders would not do the trick.
 What he had said about adult education applied equally to university education.   It must be organically related to the Indian scene. It must therefore be an extension and continuation of the basic education course. That was the central point. If they did not see eye to eye with him on that point, he was afraid they would have little use for his advice. If, on the other hand, they agreed with him that the present university education did not fit them for independence but only enslaved them, they would be as impatient as he was to completely overhaul and scrap that system and remodel it on new lines consonant with the national requirement.
 Today the youth educated in our universities either ran after Government jobs or fell into devious ways and sought outlet for their frustration by fomenting unrest. They were not even ashamed to beg or sponge upon others. Such was their sad plight. The aim of university education should be to turn out true servants of the people who would live and die for the country’s freedom. He was therefore of the opinion that university education should be co-ordinated and brought into line with basic education, by taking in teachers from the Talimi Sangh.
 
 The Ministers had accepted office as people’s representatives. Their writ would not run beyond the four walls of the Council Hall unless they could carry the people with them. What was taking place in Bombay and Ahmedabad today, was an ominous symptom, if it portended that the Congress had lost its hold over the people. Nayee Talim was as yet a tender sapling but it held out big promise. Its growth could not be forced by ministerial ukases, if popular support was lacking. If, therefore, they could not command popular support, his advice to them would be to tender  their resignations. They should not be afraid of anarchy. Theirs was only to do their duty according to their lights and leave the rest to God. People would learn the lesson of true independence even out of that experience.
 Q.	Can basic education be conducted minus the self-support basis?
 A. You can certainly try. But if you ask my advice, I will tell you that in that event, you had better forget basic education alto- gether. Self-sufficiency is not an a priori condition but to me it is the acid test. This does not mean that basic education will be self-suppor- ting from the very start. But taking the entire period of seven years, covered by the basic education plan, income and expenditure must balance. Otherwise, it would mean that even at the end  of their training, the basic education students will not be fitted for life. That is the negation of basic education. Nayee Talim without the self-support basis would, therefore, be like a lifeless body.
 Q. We have accepted the principle of giving education through a basic craft. But the Mussalmans are somehow opposed to the spinning-wheel. Your emphasis on spinning is perhaps all right in cotton tracts. But do you not agree that it is unsuited to areas where the cotton crop is not grown? May not some other craft be substituted for it in such places—agriculture for instance?
A.	This is  a  very old question. Any basic craft to  serve as a
 medium for education must answer the test of universality. As early as 1908 I came to the conclusion that to make India free and to enable her to stand on her own legs, the spinning-wheel had to hum in every home. If England can become an exporter of textiles to India and to the whole world, although she does not grow a pod of cotton, I cannot understand why we cannot introduce cotton spinning in our homes, merely because cotton would have to be obtained from a neighbour- ing province or district. As a matter of fact, there is no part of India where cotton was not at one time grown. Localization of cotton culti- vation in ‘cotton tracts’ is only a recent and anomalous development, forced upon India by cotton manufacturing interests at the expense of the   poor  tax-payer  and  cotton  spinner  of  India.  Even   today  tree
 cotton grows everywhere in India. Such arguments as yours speak ill of our capacity for taking initiative, for our enterprise and resource- fulness. It would kill all manufactures if transportation of raw mate- rials from another place were to be regarded as an insuperable handi- cap.
 Moreover, to enable a person to clothe himself through his own effort, when the alternative is to go naked, is in itself an education. An intelligent pursuit of the various processes related to cotton spinning has, besides, a very high instructional value. In fact, it covers the whole education of man as perhaps no other craft does. We may not today be able to dispel the doubts of the Mussalmans, as they are rooted in a delusion and delusion is a very real thing to its victim, while he is under its spell. But if our own faith is clear and firm, and we can demonstrate the success of our method, the Mussalmans will them- selves come to us and ask to be taught the secret of our success. They do not seem to have realized that the charkha has done more for the poorest Mussalman masses than even the Muslim League or any other Muslim organization. The bulk of the weavers in Bengal are Muslims. Nor should it be forgotten that Dacca owed its world-wide fame for its shabnamslibtech_684_footnoteto the deftness and skill of Muslim women spinners and Muslim weavers.
 The same applied to Maharashtra. The best cure for the delusion is to concentrate on the performance of one’s own duty. Truth alone will endure, all the rest will be swept away before the tide of time. I must, therefore, continue to bear testimony to Truth even if I am forsaken by all. Mine may today be a voice in the wilderness, but it will be heard when all other voices are silenced if it is the voice of Truth.
 AVINASHILINGAM CHETTIAR: To produce efficient teachers for Nayee Talim would take time. What should be done to improve education in the schools in the meantime?
G.	If you realize that the present system of education cannot
 bring India Independence but only serves to deepen her slavery, you will refuse to encourage it, irrespective of whether any other takes its place or not. You will do whatever you can, within the four corners of the principles of Nayee Talim and be satisfied with that.
If people did not want the ministers on those terms, it would be
 
 better for the ministers to resign. They could not possibly be party to serving poison because they could not provide or because the people did not relish life-giving food.
 Q. You say that for Nayee Talim we do not need money but men. But to train men we again need institutions and therefore money. How can we get out of this vicious circle?
A.	The remedy lies in your own hands. Begin with yourself.
 There is a good English proverb: ‘Charity begins at home.’ But if you yourself will sit in an easy chair like a sahib and expect others of the lesser breed to get ready for the job, you will get nowhere. That is not my way. It has been my practice ever since my childhood, to begin with myself and my immediate environment in howso- ever humble a way. Let us in this respect take a leaf out of the book of the British people. A mere handful of them came to and settled in India in the first instance and carved out an empire for themselves which is even more formidable in its cultural than in its political aspect, so much so that, today we are so infatuated with English that we hug it, just as a slave hugs its fetters, even at the cost of the mother tongue. Think of the faith single-minded devotion, sacrifice and perseverance, which must have been at the back of it. It only shows that where there is a will, there is a way. Let us be up and doing with the firm resolve not to give up, come what may, and all the difficulties will melt away.
  What 	is the 	place of 	English in 	this programme? 	Should it be made 	compulsory or 	taught only as 	an optional, second language? 
A.	I must cling to my mother tongue as to my mother’s breast,
 in spite of its shortcomings. It alone can give me the life-giving milk.  I love the English tongue in its own place, but I am its inveterate opponent if it usurps a place which does not belong to it. English is today admittedly the world language. I would therefore accord it a place as a second, optional language, not in the school but in the university course. That can only be for the select few—not for the millions. Today when we have not the means to introduce even free compulsory primary education, how can we make provision for teaching English? Russia has achieved all her scientific progress without English. It is our mental slavery that makes us feel that we cannot do without English. I can never subscribe to that defeatist creed.

 The following news from South Africa will be interest to the readers.
 Rev. Michael Scott who has thrown in his lot with Indians in their struggle there, has written a note under the caption “Not by Might”. It is already published in the dailies. It should make a special appeal to all Europeans. He adds in a personal note:
 The spirit which enshrined you and your movement here will not be extin-guished by the powerful and cunning forces which are now arrayed against it.
An English sister writes from Durban:
 I went along to the camp almost the first day just to give the campers a word of encouragement and was quite impressed by their cheerfulness and general attitude—it was the “real thing” like some of the Indian movements I have seen. Then I went to the court one day too and it seemed as though those on trial (apparently) were really the judges and the officials and the Govern- ment were in the dock. If you have seen the statements by some of the leaders, you will see they give the same impression.
 Rev. Michael Scott is a very good man. He is only about 40 years old and wears “shirts” as do many high Anglicans and is addressed as “Father Scott”. He reminds me somewhat of C. F. Andrews.
 I am glad to know that Manilal is coming back. He will be a help to the leaders here, though, as a matter of fact, the struggle on the Indian side has been on a very high level up to the present. It is that that has drawn a group of Europeans to support the struggle but the number is not very large yet.
As I have said before, the battle will certainly go to our country-
men if they remain truly non-violent. Non-violence knows no defeat.
Another friend writes:
 You have heard of Mrs. Naidoo’slibtech_689_footnotepassing. She met with an accident about three months her death. During all that time the family could not get my number due to some error on the part of the exchange. Mrs. Naidoo wanted to see me but they could not contact me till the day after her death. I loved her. She was a sweet soul, a real friend and had a genius for home-making. There was always a beautiful atmosphere in the Naidoo home and one could drop in at any time, no matter how busy she was and always feel a welcome guest. And what a heroine she was! Think of the anxiety she must have gone through all
 
 the time the children were in India. I do hope that there will be a joint memo- rial to her and Thambi.
Incidentally I must mention that Mrs. Naidoo’s husband was
 one of the first satyagrahis during the days of our struggle there in my time.

PRAKASAM  From 	a copy of the Hindi: Pyarelal Papers. Courtesy: Pyarelal       POONA,  July 	31, 1946  Gandhiji 	explained his approach to Village Industries in the course of a 	thirty minute address. The conception underlying both the Nayee 	Talim and the Village Industries programme, including khaddar, was 	rooted in the same thing, viz., concern for the dignity and status 	of the village unit as against the big cities and of the individual 	against the machine. The concern was further augmented by the fact 	that India lives not in a handful of her big cities but in her 	700,000 villages. The problem was of re-establishment of justice 	between the town and the village. As it was, the balance was heavily 	tipped in favour of the former to the disadvantage of the latter.  	Ours has been described as the machine age, because the  machine 	dominates our economy. Now, what is a machine?—one may ask. In a 	sense, man is the most wonderful machine in creation. It can neither 	be duplicated nor copied.  He 	had, however, used the word not in its wider sense but in the sense 	of an appliance that tended to displace human or animal labour 	instead of supplementing it or merely increasing its efficiency. 	That was the first differentiating characteristic of the machine. 	The second characteristic was that there was no limit to its growth 	or    
 evolution. That could not be said of human labour. There was a limit beyond which its capacity or mechanical efficiency could not go. Out of this circumstance arose the third characteristic of the machine. It seems to be possessed of a will or genius of its own. It was antagonistic to man’s labour. Thus it tended more to displace man, one machine doing the work of a hundred, if not a thousand, who went to swell the army of the unemployed and the underemployed, not because it was desirable but because that was its law. In America it had perhaps reached the extreme limit. He had been opposed  to it, said Gandhiji, not from today, but even before 1908 when he was in South Africa surrounded by machines. Their onward march had not only not impressed him but repelled him.
It then dawned on me that to suppress and exploit the millions,
 the machine was the device par excellence; it had no place in man’s economy if, as social units, all men were to be equal.
 It is my belief that the machine has not added to man’s stature and it won’t serve the world but disrupt it, unless it is put in its proper place. Then, I read Ruskin’s Unto This Last during a train journey to Durbanlibtech_692_footnoteand it gripped me immediately. I saw clearly that if mankind was to progress and to realize the ideal of equality and brotherhood, it must adopt and act on the principle of Unto This Last; it must take along with it even the dumb, the halt and the lame. Did not Yudhish- thira —the Prince of Righteousness, refuse to enter heaven without his faithful dog?
 In the machine age these had no place. Under it the fittest alone survived to the exclusion and at the cost of the weak.
 That is not my picture of Independence in which there is room even for the weakest. That requires that we must utilize all available human labour before we entertain the idea of employing mechanical power.
 It was with that background that he was instrumental in founding the Talimi Sangh and the A. I. V. I. A. The object was to strengthen the Congress which claimed to be essentially the people’s organization. The Congress had created these autonomous institutions. The Congress Ministries could requisition the services of these organizations always and without any compunction. They existed and laboured for the villagers who were the back-bone of the Congress. But the Ministries were under no obligation. If they had no faith in what these organizations stood for, they should plainly say so through the Working Committee. To play with a thing when they had no heart in it would be worse than useless. They should take it up only if
 
 they believed with him that it alone held the key to the economic and political salvation of the country. They should not deceive themselves or others.
The base and foundation of village industries is agriculture.
 Years ago I read a poem in which the peasant is described as the father of the world. If God is the Provider, the cultivator is His hand. What are we going to do to discharge the debt we owe to him? So long we have only lived on the sweat of his brow. We should have begun with the soil but we could not do so. The fault is partly mine.
 There were people, remarked Gandhiji, who said that no basic reform in agri- culture was possible without political power. They dreamt in terms of industriali- zation of agriculture by large-scale application of steam and electricity. He warned them that trading in soil fertility for the sake of quick returns would prove to be a disastrous, short-sighted policy. It would result in virtual depletion of the soil. Good earth called for the sweat of one’s brow to yield the bread of life.
 People might criticize that approach as being slow and unprogressive. It did not hold out promise of dramatic results. Nevertheless, it held the key to the pros- perity of both the soil and inhabitants living on it. Healthy, nourishing food was the alpha and omega of rural economy.
The bulk of a peasant’s family budget goes to feed him and his
 family. All other things come afterwards. Let the tiller of the soil be well fed. Let him have a sufficiency of fresh, pure milk and ghee and oil, fish eggs, and meat if he is a non-vegetarian.What would fine clothes, for instance, avail him if he is ill-nourished and underfed?
 The question of drinking-water supply and other things would come next. A consideration of these questions would naturally involve such issues as the place of plough cattle in the economy of agriculture as against the tractor plough and power irrigation, etc., and thus, bit by bit, the whole picture of rural economy would emerge before them. In this picture cities would take their natural place and not appear as unnatural, congested spots or boils on the body politic as they were today.
We stand today in danger of forgetting the use of our hands. To
 forget how to dig the earth and tend the soil is to forget ourselves. To think that your occupation of the Ministerial chair will be vindicated if you serve the cities only, would be to forget that India really resides in her 700,000 village units. What would it profit a man if he gained the world but lost his soul in the bargain?
 Q. You have called cities boils or abscesses on the body politic. What should be done with these boils?
A.	If you ask a doctor he will tell you what to do with a boil. It
 has to be cured either by lancing or by the application of plasters and
 poultices. Edward Carpenter called civilization a malady which needed a cure. The growth of big cities is only a symptom of that malady. Being a nature-curist I am naturally in favour of nature’s way of cure by general purification of the system. If the hearts of the city-dweller remain rooted in the villages, if they become truly village-minded, all other things will automatically follow and the boil will quickly heal.
 Q.	What practical steps can be taken to protect our village crafts from the invasion of foreign and Indian manufactured goods under the present circumstances?
 A.	I can only speak in broad terms. If you have felt in your
 heart that you have taken office as custodians and representatives of the interests of the masses, everything that you do, your legislation, your executive orders, the instructions that you issue, will breathe concern for the villager. To protect his interests, you do not need the Viceroy’s sanction. Supposing you want to protect the hand-spinner and hand-weaver against the competition of mills and solve the  problem of cloth shortage for the masses, you will put aside red tape and send for the mill-owners and tell them that, unless they want you to go out of office, they must make their production policy conform to the requirement of the masses, whose custodian and representative you are. You will tell them not to send mill cloth to certain areas, which are put under hand production or produce a certain range of yarns and textiles which comes within the handloom weaver’s domain. If you are in earnest, your word will go home and they will willingly give their co-operation as they did recently, when they provided the required textiles for export to Indonesia, in return for Indonesian surplus rice for the relief of the Indian famine. But there must be that inner conviction first, everything else will then be all right.

454,"July 31, 1946",SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING,"
  
 POONA,
 July 31, 1946
 Mahatma Gandhi told the audience in brief how the last three days since his return to Poona from Panchgani had been occupied. First, there was a meeting with the Chiefs of the Deccan States. The Rajas wanted his advice as a friend as to what their duty was. He had told them that they must now shed their autocracy and be guided by the people’s will. Up till now the princes had been ruled by the British and they, in turn, had ruled their people. Now that power was coming into the hands of the
 
 Indian people, it should come into the hands of States’ people too, for they were not different. The Rulers had recognized that they could not exist if they were at perpetual variance with their subjects. A true union with their people was the only way for them to live serve.
 Ministers from various provinces had come here to discuss with the workers of the Hindustani Talimi Sangh and the All-India Village Industries Association as to how best they could forward these two great schemes, which had been brought into being and had so far been sponsored by the Congress. Gandhiji feared the audience were probably ignorant about Nayee Talim. This was not as it should be. After all the Congress Ministers were the elected representatives of the people and, therefore, their servants. They could not force anything down the throats of the people. It was up to the people to study and understand what Nayee Talim was. It was up to them to be orderly and disciplined and eager to learn. Only then could the Ministers take them along with them. Nayee Talim was a grand thing. It would help them and their children to become good citizens. The same applied to khadi and all the other village industries.
 Both these schemes were for village India which was the real India. Really speaking, it was the farmers who fed them and ought, therefore, to be their masters, but things had been the other way round, and townspeople had been sucking the villagers’ blood. It was now time that they became the servants of the villagers. If they realized this, the work of the Congress Ministers would progress and India would become prosperous.
 Gandhiji hoped, as this was his last meeting with them this year, that their daily association with him in prayer had been of benefit to them and they would continue the practice in their homes

Rajas and Maharajas do not frequent it like they do Mussoorie and yet there has been no place where the poor could stay.libtech_694_footnoteNow at last if there is going to be a small haven for them, it would only be a tardy reparation.

    BHAI 	VALLABHBHAI,  August 	1, 1946 
  	I have not been able to answer your letter fully. The main problem 	is about Ambedkar. I see a risk in coming to any sort of    
 understanding with him, for he has told me in so many words that for him there is no distinction between truth and untruth or between violence and non-violence. He follows one single principle, viz., to adopt any means which will serve his purpose. One has to be very careful indeed when dealing with a man who would become a Christian, Muslim or Sikh and then be reconverted according to his convenience. There is much more I could write in the same strain. To my mind it is all a snare. It is a “catch”libtech_700_footnotelibtech_701_footnote. Besides, it is not necessary for him at present to insist on 20 p. c. If India becomes independent in the real sense—the provinces to some extent are— and if the caste Hindus are true to themselves, all will be well. But if the number of fair-minded persons is small and if power passes into the hands of fanatics, there is bound to be injustice, no matter what agreements you make today. You may come to any understanding you like today— but who are the people who beat up Harijans, murder them, prevent them from using public wells, drive them out of schools and refuse them entry into their homes? They are Congressmen. Aren’t they? It is very necessary to have a clear picture of this. I therefore feel that at present we should not insist on an agreement such as you suggest. However, we should stress the capacity of the Congress to do justice. Mine may be a voice in the wilderness. Even so I prefer it that way. Therefore, if we negotiate with Ambedkar out of fear of the League we are likely to lose on both the fronts.
 I will definitely leave here on the 5th and reach Wardha on the 6th. I have already written to you and informed you that I have deliberately decided not to go to Bombay and I adhere  to  that decision. But if you want it to be modified, do tell me be all means— that means I shall have to remain in a railway compartment for a few hours more. You may see me there if necessary but in any case not at the cost of your health. There is nothing we cannot deal with through correspondence. In any case do come to Wardha on the 8th. You may come even a day earlier if you like.
 If postmen are using high-handed methods, I think it will be perfectly proper to raise our voice against it.

  	I have gone through your letter. This is the answer to your ques- 	tionlibtech_707_footnote. This 	thing is meant for villagers, for the villages. Therefore there is 	no place here for a microscope or an x-ray plant. Nor is there any 	place in nature cure for quinine, emetin, penicillin and such other 	drugs. Village sanitation, domestic cleanliness, per-sonal hygiene 	and health care have the first place and also full scope, the 	underlying idea being that this done there can be no disease. And in 	case disease has occurred, Ramanama is the basic remedy besides 	observance of the laws of nature. As long as the practitioner has 	not personally expe- rienced the efficacy of Ramanama, the latter 	treatment cannot be applied universally. Hence, the treatment in the 	form of Ramanama cannot all of a sudden become universal. However, 	the endeavour is to cure disease with the help of whatever energy we 	can churn out of the five elements, viz.,earth, water, ether, fire 	and air. And this is where, I think, nature cure ends. Hence the 	experiment that is being now conducted at Uruli Kanchan is one of 	instructing the villagers in the art of health care and curing those 	who are sick with the help of the five elements. This includes the 	use of herbs locally available in Uruli, whenever the need is felt. 	It also covers restrictions as to diet.  M. K. GANDHI  D. D.

 Your letter of the 29th addressed to Rajkumari reached today. I have come to Uruli for four days leaving Rajkumari and others at Poona. If anyone of them has any business with me, they will come and return in the afternoon in good time. I did not want to have a crowd here.
 Your blood-pressure is very high. I cannot say I am wholly out of danger, but I think my blood-pressure is under control. Every-one does not have [high] blood-pressure for the same reason. [High] blood-pressure is not a disease in itself; it is a symptom of some other disease. It may, for instance, be caused by kidney trouble. A diseased kidney means the whole body becoming poisoned. Kidney trouble is caused by worrying too much or working under tension. In my view whatever the cause, fruit diet is an effective remedy. This should not include starchy fruits such as bananas. Oranges, pomegra-nates, pineapples and grapes are best. One must sleep well. To sleep is to rest. The fruits mentioned above may be taken as they are or their juice. They can be taken in either form. You may take gentle walks. There are also some exercises that one can do lying in bed. You should do such exercises. Along with this, if you enshrine Rama in your heart, I am sure your blood-pressure will be cured. Ramanama means having God in the heart in the form in which we worship Him. This is not superstition. This is scientific deduction. I shall not take you into the rationale thereof. I am writing this because I have known you as a saintly woman for many years which you are. I give no thought to the fact that you are the daughter of a rich father married to a rich man.

  	I could read your letter of 17th July from beginning to end only 	today. I have serious doubts about the resolution concerning yarn. I 	don’t think is right to pass on the yarn to the weavers and oblige 	them to weave it before it has been doubled. The weavers will 	ungrudgingly accept all the yarn you have if you give it to them 	after doubling and twisting it. Only then can you tell the weavers 	not to take mill-yarn as long as such hand-spun yarn is available. I 	have written about it in Harijan.libtech_710_footnote  	Do you have an estimate how many people act on the resolu- tions 	that have been passed and how they do it? If not, you should try to 	find out.  	Your Resolution No. 22 calls upon the Government to examine the 	implements and the raw  material  of  .  .  .libtech_711_footnotewhich  I  find  rather impracticable. This job is 	for those who know the work. It is the constructive workers who can 	do this job. The Government can be asked to provide funds. I feel 	the same way about Resolutions 17, 18 and 21.  	I have an impression that I have written to you regarding 	[Resolution] No. 27. I am of the opinion that Manohar Diwan cannot 	take up anti-leprosy work outside Wardha. He does not have enough 	workers. What you must do is to produce in Karnataka workers like 	Manohar Diwan. You can send them to Wardha to be trained, on the 	condition that all their expenses are met by you.  	One more word of advice in general. Resolution No. 29 could have 	been put in nine or ten lines. It could have been more fully 	explained in a speech. I assume all these Resolutions were in 	Kannada and, when we think in our mother tongue or in the national 	language we do not do so in an orderly way. And then we do not 	attempt to bring precision and brevity to them. When we speak or 	write in English out of very shame we are more careful. This shows 	that our love of our mother tongue is no real, or say, not deep 	enough. It is the     
 duty of every Indian to overcome this failing. I have observed that true love of the mother tongue embraces the national language too.

  August 	1, 1946 The 	25th anniversary of the late Lokamanya’s demiselibtech_714_footnotewhich fell on the 	day Gandhiji 	reached Uruli, evoked poignant memories. Speaking after the evening  prayer, 	he recalled how he had gone to attend the Lokamanya’s funeral on 	receiving the sad news over the telephone. The mammoth funeral 	procession was composed of Mussalmans and Parsis no less than 	Hindus. He himself had got caught in the crush and narrowly escaped 	injury. Those were the days when the atmosphere was not poisoned by 	communal bitterness.      
 Much water has flowed under the bridge since then, but the memory or Lokamanya remains enshrined in the hearts and affection of his countryman as ever before. The lapse of time has only added to his popularity. He is still with us, though he is physically no more. He has given us the mantra that Swaraj is our birthright. That birth right belongs equally to all. Like the Infinite it is inexhaustible. To divide it is not to take it away.
 May be that some questionable things are today being done in the late Lokamanya’s name. That is the way of the world. Even  divinity is not proof against abuse. The evil, however, remains with the evil-doer. It does not detract from the lustre of divinity.
 India was today on the eve of attaining her birthright, Gandhiji went on to say. In his opinion, nature cure was an essential ingredient in the building of swaraj of his conception. The attaining of true swaraj presupposed the triple purification of body, mind and soul.

471,"August 	2, 1946",LETTER TO THE GOVERNOR-GENERAL OF PORTUGUESE INDIA,"
  
      DEAR 	FRIEND,  August 	2, 1946 
  	It was kind of you to write to me in reply to what I had written in 	Harijanlibtech_715_footnotelibtech_716_footnoteabout Goa affairs.libtech_717_footnotelibtech_718_footnotelibtech_719_footnoteI 	suppose you know that I have visited Mozambique, Delagoa and 	Inhambane. I did not notice there any Government for philanthropic 	purposes. Indeed, I was astonished to see the distinction that the 	Government made between Indians and the Portuguese and between the 	Africans and themselves. Nor does the history of the Portuguese 	Settlement in India prove the claim set forth by you. Indeed, what I 	see and know of the condition of things in Goa is hardly edifying. 	That the Indians in Goa have been speechless is proof not of the 	innocence or the philanthropic nature of the     
 Portuguese Government but of the rule of terror. You will forgive me for not subscribing to your statement that there is full liberty in Goa and that the agitation is confined only to a few malcontents.
 Every account, received by me personally and seen in the papers here in this part of India, confirms the contrary view. I suppose the report of the sentence by your Court Martial of eight years on Dr. Braganzalibtech_720_footnotelibtech_721_footnoteand his contemplated exile to a far off Portuguese Settle- ment is by itself a striking corroboration of the fact that civil liberty is a rare article in Goa. Why should a law-abiding citizen like Dr. Braganza be considered so dangerous as to be singled out for exile?
 Though the politics of Dr. Lohia probably differ from mine, he has commanded my admiration for his having gone to Goa and put his finger on its black spot. Inhabitants of Goa can afford to wait for Independence, until much greater India has regained it. But no person or group can thus remain without civil liberty without losing self- respect. He has lighted a torch which the inhabitants of Goa cannot, except at their peril, allow to be extinguished. Both you and the inhabitants of Goa should feel thankful to the Doctor for lighting that torch. Therefore, your description of him as “stranger” would excite laughter if it was not so tragic. Surely the truth is that the Portuguese coming from Portugal are strangers, whether they come as philanth- ropists or as Governors exploiting the so-called weaker races of the earth.
 You have talked of the abolition of caste distinctions What I see has happened is that not only no cast distinction has been abolished but at least one more caste, far more terrible than the system “caste”, has been added by the Portuguese rulers.
 I, therefore, hope that you will revise your views on philanth- ropy, civil liberty and caste distinctions, withdraw all the African police, declare yourself whole-heartedly for civil liberty and if possi- ble even let the inhabitants of Goa frame their own government, and invite from Greater India more experienced Indians to assist the inhabitants and even you in framing such Government.

Very often 	it only 	provided the 	police a 	further opportunity for 	corruption and 	brought no 	relief to the victim. The second way, which was followed by the general run of the       
 village people, was to passively acquiesce in it. This was reprehensible as it was rooted in cowardice. Crime would flourish, while cowardice remained. What was more, by such acquiescence we ourselves became party to the crime. The third way, which Gandhiji commended, was that of pure satyagraha. It required that we should regard even thieves and criminals as our brothers and sisters and crime as a disease of which the latter were the victims and needed to be cured. Instead of bearing ill-will towards a thief or a criminal and trying to get him punished they should try to get under his skin, understand the cause that had led him into crime and try to remedy it. They should, for instance, teach him a vocation and provide him with the means to make an honest living and thereby transform his life. They should realize that a thief or a criminal was not a different being from themselves. Indeed, if they turned the search- light inward and closely looked into their own souls, they would find that the difference between them was only one of degree. The rich, moneyed man, who made his riches by exploitation or other questionable means, was no less guilty of robbery than the thief who picked a pocket or broke into a house and committed theft. Only the former took refuge behind the facade of respectability and escaped the penalty of law. Strictly speaking, remarked Gandhiji, all amassing or hoarding of wealth above and beyond one’s legitimate requirements was theft. There would be no occasion for thefts and therefore, no thieves if there was a wise regulation of riches and absolute social justice prevailed. In the swaraj of his conception, there would be no thieves and no criminals, or else it would be swaraj only in name. The criminal was only an indication of the social malady and since nature cure, as he envisaged it, included the triple cure of body, mind and soul, they must not be satisfied with merely banishing physical illness fro Uruli; their work must include the healing of the mind and soul too, so that there would be perfect social peace in their midst.
 If they followed the nature cure way of dealing with the criminals, which, as he had already explained, was the way of satyagraha, they could not sit still in the face of crime. Only a prefect being could afford to lose himself within himself and withdraw completely from the cares and responsibilities of the world. But who could claim that perfection?
On   the   high   seas   a   sudden   calm   is   always   regarded  by
 experienced pilots and mariners with concern. Absolute calm is not the law of the ocean. It is the same with the ocean of life. More often than not, it portends rough weather. A satyagrahi would therefore neither retaliate nor submit to the criminal, but seek to cure him by curing himself. He will not try to ride two horses at a time, viz., to pretend to follow the law of satyagraha while, at the  same  time, seeking police aid. He must forswear the latter in order to follow the former. If the criminal himself chooses to hand himself over to the police, it would be a different matter. You cannot expect to touch his
 heart and win his confidence if at the same time you are prepared to go to the police and inform against him. That would be gross betrayal of trust. A reformer cannot afford to be an informer.
 And by way of illustration he mentioned several instances of how he had refused to give information to the police about persons who had been guilty of violence and had come and confessed to him. No police officer could compel a satyagrahi to give evidence against a person who had confessed to him. A satyagrahi would never be guilty of a betrayal of trust. He wanted the people of Uruli to adopt the method of satyagraha for dealing with crime and criminals. They should contact the criminals in their homes, win their confidence and trust by loving and selfless service, wean them from evil and unclean habits and help to rehabilitate them by teaching them honest ways of living.

478,"August 3, 1946",STRIKES,"
  
 The statement in the daily press that I had approved of the postal strikelibtech_731_footnoteis not true. One day a postman asked to be allowed to just say ‘Vande Mataram’ to me. Kanu Gandhi brought him to me. The visitor, however, asked for my blessings for the postmen’s strike which had just then commenced. I said to him that if the strike was justified and if they conducted themselves absolutely peacefully, they must succeed.libtech_732_footnotelibtech_733_footnoteThis was no approval of the particular strike. Apart, however, from what I said and apart from the merits of the postmen’s strike, I feel that as an expert in successful strikes of an absolutely peaceful nature, I owe it to the conductor of this strike as to those of all others and to the public to state the conditions of successful strikes.
 Obviously there should be no strike which is not justifiable on merits. No unjust strike should succeed. All public sympathy must be withheld from such strikes.
 The public has no means of judging the merits of a strike, unless it is backed by impartial persons enjoying public confidence. Interested men cannot judge the merits of their own case. Hence, there must be an arbitration accepted by the parties or a judicial adjudi- cation. As a rule, the matter does not come before the public when there is accepted arbitration or adjudication. Cases have, however,
 
 happened when haughty employers have ignored awards or mis- guided employees, conscious of their power to assert themselves, have done likewise and have decided upon forcible extortion.
 Strikes for economic betterment should never have a political end as an ulterior motive. Such a mixture never advances the political end and generally brings trouble upon strikers, even when they do not dislocate public life, as in the case of public utility services such as the postal strike. The Government may suffer some inconvenience but will no come to a stand-still. Rich persons will put up expensive postal services but the vast mass of the poor people will be deprived during such a strike of a convenience of primary importance to which they have become used for generations. Such strikes can only take place when every other legitimate means has been adopted and failed.
 In the present case we have National Provincial Governments. Postmen should consult these Governments before resorting to the extreme step. So far as I am aware Shri Balasaheb Kher, Shri Mangal- das Pakvasalibtech_734_footnoteand Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel have intervened. If their advice has been rejected by the men, they have taken a serious and dangerous step. If all these powerful unions disregard their own Governments and the Working Committee members, they disown the Congress.They have a right to do so if the Congress sells their interest.
 Sympathetic strikes must be taboo until it is conclusively proved that the affected men have exhausted all the legitimate means at their disposal and until the Congress has been proved to have a betrayed or neglected their interest or until the Congress has called for sympa- thetic strikes in order to secure justice from obdurate and unsym- pathetic authorities.
 One hears of strikes all over the country to paralyse the Govern- ment. This paralysis is an extreme political step, open only to a body like the Congress, not even to unions, however powerful they may be. If the Congress is the people’s arm par excellence for the purpose of winn-ing Independence, paralysing action should be retained solely in the hands of the Congress.
 At the present moment, the Congress is engaged in making a success of the proposed Constituent Assembly. There are interminable difficulties in the way. Paralysing strikes must seriously hamper Congress action.
It follows from the foregoing that political strikes must be
 
 treated on their own merits and must never be mixed with or related to economic strikes. Political strikes have a definite place in non-violent action. They are never taken up haphazard. They must be open, never led by goondaism. They are calculated never to lead to violence.
 Therefore, my humble suggestion to all strikers is to make a frank declaration of submission to arbitration or adjudication, to seek the guidance of the Congress and abide by its advice and for all sympathetic strikes to stop whilst the Congress is engaged in making the contemplated Constituent Assembly a success and while Provincial National Government are functioning.

479,"August 3, 1946",THE MEANING OF NATURE CURE libtech_735_footnote,"
  
 Many people wish to come to Uruli Kanchan to learn nature cure. I dissuade them. The institution that is working at Uruli Kan- chan on behalf of the Trust is for the villagers. Its three trustees are Dr. Dinshaw Mehta, Shri Jehangir Patel and myself. Though Dr. Din- shaw Mehta has a lot of experience of nature cure, he has gained this experience in towns. When he was conducting his nature cure home in Poona, though he took in poor patients, he gave them the same treatment as he gave his rich patients. As I conceived nature cure for the villagers, it should confine itself to such remedies as are available in the villages and should do without the aid of electricity and ice. This would be the limit of this treatment.
 Such work can only be for a person like me who has become a villager and whose heart is in the villages even though he be living in a city. So the trustees have entrusted this work to me. I have begun the work but I have no trained personnel. It is another thing that I take help from Dr. Mehta when ever I need it. I have found a good helper in Dr. Bhagawat whose heart is wholly in the villages and who himself lives very simply. Even though he is an allopath, he believes only in nature cure, does not despise manual work and never tires of working. The others are all new to the work though filled with the spirit of service. I too am new to the work. Shri Datar has given his house for our use. He charges no rent, and so the work can go on. But the house
 
 
 has not room enough for new students to be admitted. I myself cannot permanently stay in Uruli Kanchan. If God wills it I hope in future to spend six months in the neighbourhood of Poona and six months in Sevagram. Those who wish to learn nature cure should therefore understand that in the present circumstances it is quite impossible for anyone to be put up here.
 Now a few words as to my conception of nature cure. I have written a little bit about it from time to time in previous issues. But since the idea is growing, I may as well explain the limits of nature cure as carried on in Uruli Kanchan. Diseases, whether in village or in town, are of three kinds: physical, mental and spiritual. And what is true of the individual is true of society.
 The majority of the inhabitants of Uruli Kanchan are business folk. One part is inhabited by Mangs, another by Mahars, and yet another by Kanchans. The name of the village is derived from this last group. There are some Garudis living here too, who are classified as criminal tribes under the law. The Mangs earn their living by making ropes, etc. They were doing well during the war but are now having a lean time and living in penury. The problem that faces the nature cure physicians is how to deal with this malady of the Mangs, which is by no means slight. It is the duty of the businessmen to cure them of this disease. No medicines from any dispensary are going to avail in this case and yet it is as fell a disease as cholera. Some of the tenements of the Mangs are fit only to be burnt. But burning will not provide new dwellings for them. How would they protect themselves from rain and cold? Where would they put their belongings? All these are questions to which the nature cure physician cannot shut his eyes. What is to be done about the Garudis? They do not commit crimes for the love of it. It is a habit ingrained in them for generations and so they are described as criminal.
 It is for the residents of Uruli Kanchan to wean them from this habit. The nature-cure physician cannot neglect this work. Several such questions face the nature cure worker. Nature cure work thus becomes purely work for swaraj and its field also becomes very wide. God willing, it can succeed, provided we, the workers and residents of Uruli Kanchan, follow truth and persevere.

These are Shri Brijlal Nehru’s questions to which I reply as
follows:
  What 	the question 	implies is very 	true. Nevertheless doctors 	flourish. This 	phenomenon should make 	us all think.  My 	experience is 	that a 	correct diagnosis is 	followed by 	a re-medial 	measure answering the 	diagnosis. It 	will be 	wrong to 	blame medi-cal 	books because they 	mention several 	alternative measures. The 	complicated human 	system does not 	lend itself 	to one 	certain remedy. It would be untrue to say that nature cure does not demand 
 
 any diagnosis. As it believes in unity of disease and unity of cure, diagnosis adopted in nature cure is much simpler. Unity of disease and unity of cure is a good generalization. No nature cure  man  blindly applies earth poultices in all cases.
  It 	is highly unfair to 	say that in 	their practice doctors 	make no 	use of 	their knowledge of 	physiology  and 	 anatomy  No comparison 	can be 	set up 	between doctors and 	vaids for 	they employ wholly 	dissimilar methods of 	diagnosis. I 	am utterly 	ignorant of the 	value of 	the tridosha theory.  I 	am unable 	to subscribe 	to the 	condemnation of 	the State 	for not providing 	institutions for 	research. I 	have always blamed the 	vaids’ 	apathy in 	the matter 	of real 	research. The 	top ones are 	busy making money. The 	others are 	too ignorant to 	do so or are easily 	satisfied with 	what they find in the 	orthodox Ayurvedic 	books. I 	am sorry for 	this view. I 	come to 	it, in 	spite of 	my great regard for 	the Ayurvedic 	system and the Yunani 	which are suited 	to the soil.  I 	do not think 	that constant examination by 	medical friends 	of my body 	gives them undue or any 	prominence. They 	do not 	stand in 	need of 	any. They were all 	flourishing before 	I appeared 	on the 	scene. Nor 	does it 	tend to 	put into 	the background 	the other 	systems of 	medicine. I 	have friends among vaids 	and hakims. 	But they do 	not need 	elaborate or 	frequent diagnosis. 	I submit 	my body 	to the diagnosis 	which is 	unfortunately advertised 	but I 	do not 	submit it 	to the 	treatment by 	drugs. The 	treatment is 	principally confined to 	the use of the five agencies of nature, diet changes and massage. 
 My love of nature cure and of indigenous systems does not blind me to the advance that Western medicine has made in spite of the fact that I have stigmatized it as black magic. I have used the harsh term and I do not withdraw it, because of the fact that it has countenanced vivisection and all the awfulness it means and because it will stop at no practice, however bad it may be, if it prolongs the life of the body and because it ignores the immortal soul which resides in the body. I cling to nature cure in spite of its great limitations and in spite of the lazy pretensions of nature-curists. Above all, in nature cure, everybody can be his or her own doctor, not so in the various systems of medicine.

  	My idea of developing nature cure in Uruli Kanchan and the villages 	of India is fast expanding. It means teaching the hygiene of the 	body, mind and soul of the individual and  society.Thus  the workers 	in Uruli Kanchan have, besides cleaning the streets of the village, 	and attending to their bodily ailments through the judicious use of 	earth, sum ether, light and water, to attend to the pauperism of the 	criminal tribes called the Garudis—described in law as one of the 	criminal tribes of Indialibtech_737_footnote—and the rapacity of Pathans  in  exacting interest , 	[which] are all social diseases demanding treatment by a real nature 	cure man. That, ordinarily these things are not regarded as diseases 	in the nature cure books does not worry me. I, and if you like, we, 	as trustees for nature cure in the villages and cities of India 	cannot be satisfied with less. And, therefore we cannot be content 	if we    
 periodically reduce obesity and deal with other ailments, knowing that the same patients will suffer from the same diseases and return annually for treatment. The workers in Uruli Kanchan have been doing some such work as I have described above but not metho- dically. Now they must not be satisfied unless they become efficient workers and train similar workers who will be able to replace them. For this work, we do not need a long course. Our aim should not be to replace surgeons or physicians of modern type or hakims. Our work is conceived in a different key. It requires original training. We have to produce original books. It needs concentration of work in Uruli Kanchan. Before a visible picture, considered in this light emer-ges, and you are able to assimilate it, we may not be able to do much in Sinhagad.

 BROTHERS AND SISTERS,
 You have given me a second purse for which I thank you. Still there is some deficit. I have been told that it will be made up in two or three months.
 I consider the money you have given the very minimum. The great work which is to be done here calls for your full co-operation. That work is the developing of the body, mind and soul of Uruli. For this, the co-operation of every caste, of the old and young, of children and women is needed. Only when we forget caste differences will our threefold afflictions subside. If Uruli Kanchan accomplished  this  work, we have some hope for the seven lakh villages of India.

490,"August 6, 1946",A KHADI LOVER’S COMPLAINT libtech_740_footnote,"
  
A Gujarati khadi lover living in South India writes as follows:
 In the Khadi Bhandar here, it is hard to get cotton, spindles, charkhas and their accessories. I have up till now been carrying on with my own cotton. The slivers from cotton bought here were not at all good. I discovered it was of poor quality after I had bought it. I found hand-carding (tunai) of it difficult and could not get anyone here to teach me either.
 I have just given my full quota of self-spun and self-carded yarn for 1946  to be woven into cloth. At first one could procure coupons for self-spun yarn and buy a certain amount of khadi with it. The yarn given in is to be woven into saris and dhotis. How are we to buy cloth for our other requirements of underwear, sheets, towels, etc.? I went to the Bhandar recently and they demanded the same number of hanks as the amount of rupees the cloth was
 worth. In addition I was told I had to be a member of the Bhandar. I spend 2 to
 it also to this work. But, in spite of all my labour, I shall never be able to produce enough yarn for my requirements. What am I to do? The fact that I am unacquainted with the language is another difficulty. It would be easier if all the rules regarding khadi were written up in Hindustani. Moreover, it seems impossible to get anything done without outside influence. Is one to call it one’s misfortune or part our nature? One needs some backing even to buy a spindle, to say nothing about a charkha. If the Charkha Sangh people themselves do not realize what difficulties one has to face in the matter of buying even small requirements to whom can one turn for help?
 I spoke about this to a well-known Gujarati friend here. He got enraged. ‘Gandhiji has constituted himself Viceroy. Why then should he listen to anyone? He does whatever comes into his head. Let him do so. We shall get khadi from wherever we can and what is more, we shall encourage uncertified khadi. As for Pyarelalji he only puts up to Gandhiji what he chooses and throws the rest into the waste-paper basket.’
The above angry criticism about my post does not need  any
 comment, beyond saying that every worth-while letter is put up before me and that if I were to be acquainted with or read every letter that comes, the whole of my time would be spent on the post and I would be rendered useless for my real work. But what has been said about khadi demands consideration. That Sales Bhandars may disappear under the new scheme only means that they should be converted into
 
 schools for teaching all the processes of khadi. Therefore, cotton, charkhas, spindles and all other accessories of spinning, carding and ginning should certainly be available there. Above all, the khadi worker should be polite and obliging at all times. If he is not, it will mean the end of khadi and it will be a tragedy if khadi workers themselves were to be the cause of its death.
 The criticism in the letter under reference can only be appli- cable to one or two Bhandars. This note is, therefore, only meant for those to whom it does apply. All such should early set their house in order.
 Khadi-wearers who spin regularly and give in their self-spun yarn for being woven into cloth should be, as they are, entitled to purchase against cash the amount of khadi which, according to the
 A.I.S.A. rules, their above-mentioned yarn permits them to buy.

  [August 6, 1946]libtech_742_footnote  	If I ask you how many of you spin, I am afraid very few hands will  	go  up.libtech_743_footnoteYou 	 have  just  heard   the   Ashram   inmates   giving   an account of 	the day’s spinning at the end of the prayer. The reason is that 	spinning has become a part and parcel of the Ashram prayer. The 	conception of spinning as sacrifice has been linked with the idea of 	God, the reason being that we believe that in the charkha and what 	it stands for, lies the only hope of salvation of the poor.  He 	had come to 	realize that it 	was difficult to 	earn one’s livelihood 	through the charkha, 	but the villagers 	could easily 	spin for their own 	clothes. Because they 	had not 	realized the self-help 	principle in 	the matter of clothing, 	they  showed 	 a deplorable lack of it in other things too. It stultified even agriculture, so that they        
 suffered destitution in the midst of plenty.
 We have plenty of fertile land where we can grow fruits, vegetables and other food-stuffs. But we do not make full use of our opportunity. Instead of eating fresh, whole foods, we eat them denatured. We grow cereals and eat them after converting them practi- cally into dust. God has given us everything we need and He has endowed us with intellect and the use of two hands. We could raise our food, grow cotton and prepare our own clothes, rear cattle and supply milk to our children. Yet we go hungry and naked. Our children are ill-fed and undernourished. Could there be anything more tragic?
 He compared the cities with the villages. The villages could subsist by themselves in regard to all the necessaries of life. Not so the cities. They could neither grow their own food, nor produce cotton for cloth, nor keep cattle without the help and co-operation of the villages. And yet he knew of no village in India which was today self-sufficient. Sevagram should have been such a village. But it was still far from it. Our villagers were lazy and lethargic and killed time by gambling, etc. If they tried to leave the wheel and concentrate on land exclusively, he warned them, they would soon find that it was not practicable. On the contrary, resuscitation of the wheel would help to revitalize agriculture by making them shed their inertia and apathy.
 Referring to the unthinking admiration of the visitors who had literally laid siege to his hut the whole day, he describe how it had driven him to desperation almost. He was sick of it. It could do not good either to him or to them. True admiration consisted in carrying out the wishes of the person one admired, not merely staring at him and thus wasting his time and one’s own.libtech_744_footnote
Unless there is an atmospheric calamity or some drasticaction by
 Government, my programme is to stay for six months here from August to January and later six months in Uruli Kanchan, Panchgani, Poona and near about.
 Referring to the discontinuance in regular spinning by the Ashramites in the Mahadevbhai Desai Cottage, Mahatma Gandhi said:
When once begun it should have continued even in the absence
 of Durgabehn Desai. I have decided to spend 30 to 45 minutes daily in spinning in Mahadev’s cottage.
 He made a feeling reference to Mr. Mahadev Desai’s association with him in the Aga Khan Palace in 1942.
 
 Mahatma Gandhi made a passing reference to the Constituent Assembly which he said might take some time.

 I have written before regarding the ruination of men and money through horse racing but a very strongly-worded letter from a friend who says that gambling on the race course is not a lesser evil than the drink habit, constrains me to write again on this subject. The writer further says:
 Special trains are run for the races and are full of people who wear Gandhi caps, call themselves Congressmen and go there only to waste their money. Where does this money come from? We now have popular Ministries, but they too are silent and put up with the evil.
Although, in my opinion gambling at races is not as great an
 evil as drinking of alcohol, one ought not really to draw comparisons. Less bad does not make gambling a good thing. I do not know all the intricacies of horse racing. All I can say is that if it is within the competence of the present Government to put an end to the evil; it should certainly do so.

496,"July 28,  1946",QUESTION BOX,"
  
 THE CENTRAL POINT MISSED
 The following questions have been given by a British military officer who read with great interest the article in the Harijan of July 28,  1946  on  ‘Independence’libtech_749_footnote.  The  officer  is  a  military  engineer, widely travelled in America and Europe, and has seen with his own eyes the horrors of the war in Germany.
 Q. 1. In this ideal State (there is no doubt that it is ideal) how can one be sure that outside aggression can be avoided? If the State has no modern army with modern weapons which are the product of the machine age, an invading army with modern weapons could over-run the country and subject and inhabitants to slavery.
 The questioner, who claims to have read and reread my 
 article carefully and says he has liked it and is a military man, has evidently missed the central point of my article, viz., that however small a nation or even a group may be, it is able, even as the  individual, provided that it has one mind as also the will and the grit, to defend its honour and self-respect against a whole world in arms. Therein consists the matchless strength and beauty of the unarmed. That is non-violent defence which neither knows nor accepts defeat at any stage. Therefore, a nation or a group which has made non- violence its final policy, cannot be subjected to slavery even by the atom bomb.
 WHY IN WANT OF FOOD?
 Q. 2. India at the present time cannot grow enough food for  its population. To buy food from abroad, India must sell other goods to pay for it, and in order to sell such goods, India must produce at competitive prices which, in my opinion, cannot be done without modern machines. How can
 this be done, unless the machine replaces manual labour?
 A. The statement in the first sentence of the question is wholly wrong. I hold, in spite of opinions expressed to the contrary, that India is able at the present moment to grow enough food. I have previously stated the condition for growing enough food, viz., that the Government at the head should be National and a Government that knows its business and is capable of dealing sternly with all profi- teering, black-marketing and, worst of all, laziness of mind and body.
 The second part of the question really falls to the ground if my answer to the first is correct. But for the sake of dismissing the plea on behalf of modern machines as against human labour of which there is plenty in a land like India, I would say that if all the able-bodied millions work with one mind and with zeal, they could com-pete on their own terms with any nation, however well-equipped it may be with modern machines. The questioner should not forget that modern machines have up till now gone side by side with the exploitation of the machineless nations, dubbed weak. I use the parti-ciple ‘dubbed’ because they will refuse to be weak immediately they realize the fact that they are even at the present moment stronger than the nations equipped with the most modern weapons and machinery.
 SWARAJ THROUGH SPINNING
A Congressman writes:
 Q. You will perhaps agree that in spite of considerable publicity, spinning and weaving have not yet found favour with the public to the extent to which they should have done. I think if every Congress Committee—at least those of the big cities—starts a sort of coaching-class for the public for this purpose, it can do immense good. Many people—particularly the poor— do not take to spinning because they do not know spinning and weaving, what type of wheels are more convenient to use and give greater output, how these are properly operated, how best they should dispose of or utilize the yarn thus produced, etc. If once or twice a week, some such classes are undertaken after proper publicity and people are instructed in this technique by practical demonstrations, things should improve much. At least the experiment is worth a trial by the Congress. Even if regular classes are not held but a group or groups of experts of this technique undertake a tour and give demonstrations and instruction to the public for some days in each city, it can serve the purpose to a considerable extent.
 Questions like the above often come to me from Congressmen. Since this is exhaustive, I reproduce it as it is. The signature is
 undecipherable. Therefore, I am unable to say to which province the questioner belongs. Surely it would have been appropriate if the writer had been good enough to frame his letter in Hindustani. The vast mass of Congressmen who are not on the Congress register but who are more Congressmen than the registered ones, do not know English and those who do, careless for spinning than for being on  the  Congress register for reasons they know and which I need not specify. There is, however, a great deal in what the writer says. If all Congress offices became institutions for teaching the art of spinning from the anterior and posterior processes right up to the manufacture of khadi,  I am quite clear that the face of the villages would be changed and swaraj would be ushered in through the effort of the masses. I have shown in these columns how it will be ushered in. These lines are written to emphasize the point made by the correspondent.

 "
497,"August 8, 1946",RAMANAMA AGAIN,"
  
 A friend sends me a letter received by him for an answer. The letter is long. I have only copied here the relevant part:
 India is in his blood but why should he cause resentment among his countrymen who are not of his religious faith by holding  daily  prayer meetings and chanting Ramanama (meaning the name of Rama, the Hindu God)? He should realize that India is full of manifold faiths and most of the conservatives are apt to mistake him (and this is one of the pleas of the Muslim League) if he openly goes on talking in the name of the Hindu gods. One of his pet terms is the establishment of Rama-Rajya (the rule of Rama). What would a devout Muslim feel about this?
I must repeat for the thousandth time that Ramanama is one of
 the many names for God. The same prayer meetings have recitations from the Koran and the Zend Avesta. Devout Muslims, for the very reason that they are devout, have never objected to the chant of Ramanama. Ramanama is not an idle chant. It is conceived as a mode of addressing the all-pervasive God known to me, as to millions of Hindus, by the familiar name of Ramanama. ‘Nama’ at the end of Rama is the most significant part. It means the ‘nama’ without the Rama of history. Be that as it may, why should an open profession by me of my faith offend anybody, much less the Muslim League? No
 one is obliged to join these meetings and having joined is not obliged to take part in the chant. All that the visitors are expected to do is not to mar the harmony of the meeting and to tolerate the proceedings even when they are not in sympathy with any part.
 As to the use of the phrase ‘Rama-Rajya’, why should it offend after my having defined its meaning many times? It is a convenient and expressive phrase, the meaning of which no alternative can so fully express to millions. When I visit the Frontier Province or address predominantly Muslim audiences I would express my meaning to them by calling it Khudai Raj, while to a Christian audience I would describe it as the Kingdom of God on earth. Any other mode would, for me, be self-suppression and hypocrisy.

 "
498,"August 8, 1946",IS GOD A PERSON OR A PRINCIPLE? libtech_750_footnote,"
  
A friend from Baroda, who writes in English, says:
 You ask us to pray to God to give light to the whites in South Africa and strength and courage to the Indians there to remain steadfast to the end. A prayer of this nature can only be addressed to a person. If God is an all-perva- ding and all-powerful force, what is the point of praying to Him? He goes on with His work whatever happens.
 I have written on this topic before. However, if one keeps on saying the same thing again and again in different words some new words or phrases used are likely to help someone or other to understand the matter better. In my view, whether called Rama, Rahman, Ormuzd God or Krishna, He is that Supreme Power that man is ever trying to find a name for. Man, though imperfect, strives after perfection and in so doing is caught up in the tides of thought. Then like a baby learning to toddle, he now stumbles, now stands up. Thus if we say that a reasoning man is only a few months’ old child, we shall not in the least be exaggerating, judging by the immensity of cosmic time; we shall be stating a simple truth. Man can express himself only by means of language. But there can be no such medium as language for the Power that is God. Man however can describe this
 
 Infinite Power only with his imperfect means. If one has grasped this there is nothing left further to ask. Then it would be right to pray to Him in the language of man, for one can comprehend Him somewhat by yfitting Him into one’s own mould. One ought always to remember, while dwelling on Him, that one is but a drop, the tiniest of creatures of the ocean that is God. One may experience Him by being in Him, but one can never describe Him. As Madame Blavatsky puts it, man, in praying, worships the Great Power residing within. Only he who knows this may pray. He who does not, need not pray. God will not be offended by it, but I can say from experience that that man will be the loser by not praying. So it is immaterial if some worship God as a Person and some others as Great Power. Both are right, each in his own way. Nobody knows what is intrinsically right and nobody is likely ever to know. The ideal, to be an ideal, must forever remain out of reach. All the other forces are static, while God is the Life Force, immanent and at the same time transcendent.

Gujarati, however, he knows well. He understands Marathi. He has an 	elemen-tary knowledge of indigenous medicine. His wife is a nice 	lady full of the spirit  of service.

 APPENDIX I
 CONGRESS WORKING COMMITTEE’S RESOLUTION libtech_756_footnote
 
May 24, 1946
 The Working Committee have given careful consideration to the Statement dated May 16, 1946, issued by the Delegation of the British Cabinet and the Viceroy on behalf of the British Government, as well as the correspondence relating to it that has passed between the Congress President and the members of the Delegation. They have examined it with every desire to find a way for a peaceful and co-operative transfer of power and the establishment of a free and independent India. Such an India must necessarily have a strong central authority capable of representing the nation with power and dignity in the counsels of the world. In considering the Statement, the Working Committee have kept in view the picture of the future, in so far as this was available to them from the proposals made for the formation of a Provisional Government and the clarification given by members of the Delegation. This picture  is still incomplete and vague. It is only on the basis of the full picture that they can judge and come to a decision as to how far this is in conformity with the objectives they aim at. These objectives are : independence for India, a strong, though limited, central authority, full autonomy for the provinces, the establishment of a democratic structure in the centre and in the units, the guarantee of the fundamental rights of each individual so that he may have full and equal opportunities of growth, and further that each community should have opportunity to live the life of its choice within the larger framework.
 The Committee regret to find a divergence between these objectives and the various proposals that have been made on behalf of the British Government, and, in particular, there is no vital change envisaged during the interim period when the Provisional Government will function, in spite of the assurance given in Paragraph 23 of the Statement. If the independence of India is aimed at, then the functioning of the Provisional Government must approximate closely in fact, even though not in law, to that independence and all obstructions and hindrances to it should be removed. The continued presence of a foreign army of occupation is a negation of independence.
 The  Statement  issued  by  the  Cabinet Delegation and  the  Viceroy  con- tains certain recommendations and suggests a procedure for the building up of a Constituent Assembly, which is sovereign in so far as the framing of the Constitu- tion is concerned. The Committee do not agree with some of these recommendations.
 
 
 In their view it will be open to the Constituent Assembly itself at any stage to make changes and variations, with the proviso that in regard to certain major communal matters a majority decision of both the major communities will be necessary.
 The procedure for the election of the Constituent Assembly is based on representation in the ratio of one to a million, but the application of this principle appears to have been overlooked in the case of European members of Assemblies, particularly in Assam and Bengal. Therefore, the Committee expect that this  oversight will be corrected.
 The Constituent Assembly is meant to be a fully elected body, chosen by the elected members of the Provincial Legislatures. In Baluchistan there is no elected assembly or any other kind of chamber which might elect a representative for the Constituent Assembly. It would be improper for any kind of nominated individual to speak for the whole province of Baluchistan, which he really does not represent in any way.
 In Coorg the Legislative Council contains some nominated members as well as Europeans elected from a special constituency of less than a hundred electors. Only  the elected members from the general constituencies should participate in  the election.
 The Statement of the Cabinet Delegation affirms the basic principle of provincial autonomy and residuary powers vesting in the Provinces. It is further said that Provinces should be free to form groups. Subsequently, however, it is recommended that provincial representatives will divide up into sections which “shall proceed to settle the Provincial Constitutions for the Provinces in each section and shall also decide whether any Group Constitution shall be set up for those Provinces”. There is a marked discrepancy in these two separate provisions, and it would appear that a measure of compulsion is introduced which clearly infringes the basic principle of provincial autonomy. In order to retain the recommendatory character of the Statement, and in order to make the clauses consistent with each other, the Committee read paragraph 15 to mean that, in the first instance, the respective provinces will make their choice whether or not to belong to the section in which they are placed. Thus the Constituent Assembly must be considered as a sovereign body with final authority for the purpose of drawing up a constitution and giving effect to it.
 The provisions in the Statement in regard to the Indian States are vague and much has been left for future decision.  The Working Committee  would, however, like  to make it clear that the Constituent Assembly cannot be formed of entirely disparate elements, and the manner of appointing State representatives for the Constituent Assembly must approximate, in so far as is possible, to the method adopted in the Provinces. The Committee are gravely concerned to learn that even at present moment some State govern-ments are attempting to crush the spirit of their people with the help of armed forces. These recent developments in the States are of great significance in the present and for the future of India as they indicate that their is no
 real change of policy on the part of some of the State governments and of those who exercise Paramountcy.
 A Provisional National Government must have a new basis and must be a precursor of the full independence that will emerge from the Constituent Assembly. It must function in recognition of the fact, though changes in law need not be made at this stage. The Governor-General may continue as the head of the Government during  the interim period, but the Government should function as a cabinet responsible to the Central Legislature. The status, powers and composition of the Provisional Government should be fully defined in order to enable the Committee to come to a decision. Major communal issues shall be decided in the manner referred to above in order to remove any possible fear or suspicion from the minds of a minority.
 The Working Committee consider that the connected problems involved in the establishment of a Provisional Government and a Constituent Assembly should be viewed together so that they may appear as parts of the same picture, and there may be co-ordination between the two, as well as an acceptance of the independence that is now recognized as India’s right and due. It is only with the conviction that they are engaged in building up a free, great and independent India, that the Working Committee can approach this task and invite the co-operation of all the people of India. In the absence of a full picture, the Committee are unable to give a final opinion at this stage.

But I hope very much they will be back on that day or as soon as possible after it, or else we shall have a further delay.
 With regard to yourself I do not see why you should trouble to remain in Delhi

 MY DEAR GANDHIJI,
 Thank you for sharing with me and Stafford your prayerful thoughts. I too have a strong feeling, where I am dependent on forces outside myself, that I must be content to accept the will of the Divinity that you call X; and that sometimes in Bjornsen’s words may be “uber unserer kraft” (beyond our power). But where a decision of my own enters in I have a grave responsibility to all those who will be affected by it, to make it aright.
 Did I ever tell you the following story illustrating the profound human belief in the rightness of things lying behind injustice? A parson said to a farmer who was worried about something, “Put your trust in Providence, my man.” “No,” said the farmer, “I have no trust in Providence. He lost me my pig 2 years ago. He let my home be burnt last year. He took away my wife last summer. No, I refuse to trust in Providence. But I will tell you what. There is a power above Him who will pull him  up if he goes too far⁄”

  I 	told Mr. Gandhi 	that I 	had asked him to 	come to 	see me 	because there 	appeared to 	be a deadlock 	over the last stage 	of the 	Cabinet Mission’s 	work, the 	formation of 	an Interim Government. It 	would be 	very great pity if 	after all 	the hard and 	successful work of 	the Mission 	there was a 	breakdown at 	this point; and 	we must avoid 	it in the 	interests of India. 
 The deadlock seemed likely to occur over the issue of parity between the Congress and the Muslim League in the Interim Government. It was quite clear that this Government must be a coalition of the two main parties; and the trouble threa- tened to arise because Mr. Jinnah would not commit the Muslim League to partici- pation in the Interim Government unless he had parity with Congress, and it seemed that Congress would not come in on these terms. I said parity between the Congress and the Muslim League, in view of the respective number of voters whom they represented, was obviously illogical; but what we were concerned with was an ex- pedient, which would not form a precedent, to get over the difficult interim period.  I  said that if both parties were determined to work for the common good of India in the interim period, parity had no real meaning; and that if one party was out to dominate the Government and order everything to its own advantage then obviously the Government would do no good. I said that I was personally convinced that Mr. Jinnah, if he came into the Government, would work for good administration and not merely politically; and that I was sure that the same would be true of the Congress.
  I 	stressed the 	need for 	good administration 	in the 	forthcoming period, 	both to 	tide India over her 	present difficulties, the 	threatened famine and 	the railway strike, 	and also to lay the foundations of India’s future prosperity and 	independence. I said that 	I thought 	it was 	the opportunity for 	the Congress to 	make a 	generous gesture and 	to agree 	to Mr. 	Jinnah’s condition, 	even if 	they thought 	it illogical 	and unreasonable, 	and that I 	hoped they would be 	able to 	do so. The alternative 	to obtaining 	a stable 	Government in 	this interim 	period was likely 	to be chaos 	and disorder, and might ruin the last opportunity for a really united India.  I 	suggested that perhaps the best way out of this difficulty would be 	for me  to see Jinnah and 	Nehru together and 	to endeavour to 	arrive at 	an agreed composition 	for the Interim 	Government with them.  Mr. 	Gandhi said that he 	was thoroughly anxious 	for a settlement, 	and that 	he agreed that a coalition was necessary. What was required was a homogeneous team 
 
 which would work together. It should not lean too much upon the Viceroy, who was, he said, only a bird of passage, but to work together as a team by themselves. I said that this was undoubtedly the ideal but that it was the first step which was necessary and that a mediator between the two parties would undoubtedly be essential.
 Mr. Gandhi then went off into a rather long digression about the poverty of India and the necessity for more food and cloth; but at the end of it came back to my suggestion and agreed that the best thing would be for me to see the leaders of the Congress and the Muslim League together; and that since he realized the difficulty of Azad meeting Jinnah, the meeting should be between Jinnah and Nehru; he would advise me to pin them down to make a Government and not to allow them to leave the room until they had done so; that parity was of no account, nor whether the members belonged to the Congress or the league or anyone, provided they were the best men available. He said I should be prepared to go out of the room and leave them to themselves if necessary.
  He 	then turned on 	to the matter of 	the Europeans’ vote and 	said that it 	was a most 	important issue, and that 	the Europeans 	should make a declaration 	if they 	did not 	intend to 	vote. I 	said that it 	was a 	matter which must be 	left to 	the commonsense 	 of the Europeans.  The 	conversation lasted for 	about forty minutes and 	Mr. Gandhi was 	quite friendly 	throughout. It is always 	difficult to fathom 	how his mind 	is working, 	but he 	gave the impression that 	he would 	advise the 	Congress to 	come to 	terms and not to 	allow a 	breakdown on 	the parity issue.

 APPENDIX V
 RESOLUTION OF MUSLIM LEAGUE COUNCILlibtech_760_footnote
 June 6, 1946
 This meeting of the Council of the All-India Muslim League, after having carefully considered the Statement issued by the Cabinet Mission and the Viceroy on May 16 and other relevant statements and documents officially issued in connection therewith, and after having examined the proposals set forth in the said Statement in all their bearings and implications, places on record the following views for the guidance of the National and direction to the Working Committee :
  That 	the references 	made, and the conclusions 	recorded, in paragraphs 	6, 7, 	8, 9, 10 and 11 of the Statement, 	concerning the 	Muslim demand for the 	establishment of 	a full sovereign Pakistan 	as the only 	solution of the Indian 
 
 constitutional problem, are unwarranted, unjustified, and unconvincing, and should not therefore have found place in a State document, issued on behalf and with the authority of the British Government. These paragraphs are couched in such language and contain such mutilations of the established facts, that the Cabinet Mission have clearly been prompted to include them in their Statement solely with the object of appeasing the Hindus, in utter disregard of Muslim sentiments. Furthermore, the contents of the aforesaid paragraphs are in conflict and inconsistent with the admissions made by the Mission themselves in paragraphs 5 and 12 of their Statement, which are to the following effect: First, the Mission “were greatly impressed by the very genuine and acute anxiety of the Muslims lest they should find themselves subjected to a perpetual Hindu majority rule.” Second, “this feeling has become so strong and widespread amongst the Muslims that it cannot be allayed by mere paper safeguards.”Third, “if there is to be internal peace in India, it must be secured by measures which will assure to the Muslims a control in all matters vital to their culture, religion, economic or other interests.” Fourth, “very real Muslim apprehensions exist that their culture and political and social life might become submerged in a purely unitary India, in which the Hindus, with their greatly superior numbers, must be the dominating element.” In order that there may be no manner of doubt in any quarter, the Council of the All-India Muslim League reiterates that the attainment of the goal of a complete sovereign Pakistan still remains the unalterable objective of the Muslims in India, for the achievement of which they will, if neces- sary, employ every means in their power and consider no sacrifice or suffering too great.
  That 	notwithstanding the 	affront offered to 	Muslim by 	the choice 	of injudicious 	words in 	the preamble 	to the 	Statement of 	the Cabinet 	Mission, the Muslim 	League, having regard to 	the grave 	issues involved, and 	prompted by 	its earnest 	desire for a peaceful 	solution, if 	possible, of 	the Indian constitutional 	 probem, and 	inasmuch as 	the basis 	and the foundation 	of Pakistan 	are inherent 	in the 	Mission’s plan by 	virtue of 	the compulsory 	grouping of the 	six Muslim provinces, in 	Sections B 	and C, 	is willing to 	co-operate with 	the constitution-making 	machinery proposed 	in the 	scheme outlined by 	the Mission, 	in the 	hope that it 	would ultimately 	result in 	the establishment 	of complete 	sovereign Pakistan, and 	in the 	consummation of 	the goal of 	independence for 	the major nations, 	Muslims and Hindus, 	and all the 	other people inhabiting 	the vast sub-continent. 
 It is for these reasonss that the Muslim League is accepting the scheme, and will secession of Provinces or Groups from the Union which have been provided in the Mission’s plan by implication.
 The ultimate attitude of the Muslim League will depend on the final outcome of the labours of the constitution-making body, and on the final shape of the constitutions which may emerge from the deliberations of that body jointly and
 separately in its three sections. The Mulim League also reserves the right to modify and revise the policy and attitude set forth in this resolution at any time during the progress of deliberations of the constitution-making body, or the Constituent Assembly, or thereafter if the course of events so require, bearing in mind the fundamental principles and ideals herebefore adumbrated to which the Muslim League   is irrevocably committed.
  That 	with regard to the 	arrangement for 	the proposed Interim 	Government at 	the Centre, 	this Council 	authorizes its President 	to negotiate 	with the Viceroy 	and to take such decisions and actions as he deems fit and proper.

 INTERVIEW WITH LORD PETHICK-LAWRENCElibtech_761_footnote
 7.30 p.m., June 12, 1946
 Gandhi came in and I said it was a pleasure to see him again after so long an interval and the Viceroy had asked me to thank him for his helpful talk the other daylibtech_762_footnoteand I wanted to thank him for the help he had been giving in the last few days.  I knew  he would agree with me as to the importance of not having a break now.
 He said that was of course true but there were certain things that were wrong that must be straightened out. He then went in some detail into the question of the European vote in Bengal and elsewhere. I said we had promised when he was here before to discuss this with the Europeans and had scrupulously carried out this promise. But we could not amend the Statement and he himself had advised us not to  do so.  He said that though it was not expressly stated in the Statement it was implied by the references to adult suffrage, population, weightage, etc., that the tiny handful of Europeans should not have the voting power that they claimed and that, further, Europeans by virtue of the fact that they were aliens should not interefere with such a purely Indian question as the future constitution of India. (He did not if I remember right refer specifically to the sentence in paragraph 3). I said that I understood the Europeans were issuing some public statement. He interrupted me and I gathered he knew all about the statement. He said it did not alter the facts and that the Europeans ought to have the good sense not to intervene. I said that they were in a very difficult
 
 position. I understood him to say that he appreciated this but it did not alter his strong feelings in the matter.
 Turning to the Interim Government, I said that I was sorry it had not been possible to have the three-party interview which had been envisaged but that I understood the Viceroy had had a very full and interesting talk with Nehru. He said he was sure the plan he had supported provided a golden bridge with which to span the chasm. He then developed an attack on Jinnah alleging that Jinnah had said that he would use his position in the Interim Government to “water the seeds of Pakistan”. When I suggested that if Jinnah came into the Interim Government he would work for the good of India, and that I found it difficult to credit him with the statement attri- buted to him, Gandhi said he would have the quotation looked up and send it to me.
 I then stressed the fearful consequences of not reaching [an] agreement with which he seemed fully to concur. After some small talk in which I made reference to my desire to finish my work for Indian independence and to get back home, he took his departure. He had stayed about 40 minutes.

 INTERVIEW WITH LORD PETHICK-LAWRENCElibtech_763_footnote
 1.30 p.m., June 16, 1946
 Gandhi came to see me today at Willingdon Crescent. I described the documentlibtech_764_footnoteto him stressing that the Viceroy had selected men that he thought would make a good team and would do good administrative work. I told him what the allocation between parties was, what would happen if one individual fell out, what would happen if the proposal were not accepted, and the need for the scheme of May 16th to go forward.
 I said I understood that Congress had passed a resolution which in terms would prevent them from accepting this scheme but that, if it seemed good to him, I hoped  he would not allow this decision to prevent them from accepting.  I believed he knew  that I had only one desire—to promote the independence, prosperity and friendship of India and as he had the same idea I asked him to help to get the scheme through.
 He then took the document and read it. The first thing that caught his eye was the alpabetical order of the names which caused him to smile and I think approve. He wanted to be quite clear as to what would happen if an individual fell out and I said that  if he were a Congressman Congress would be consulted. In response to enquiry I said
 
 
 I could not commit the Viceroy to accepting the advice of Congress in selecting an alternative name but I thought it likely that if after discussion with Congress they strongly urged a certain name he would probably accept it. He noted that there was no woman on the list, and I said that personally I regretted that it had not been found possible to secure a suitable name.
 He said that he realised it was not now possible to alter a comma in the Statement.
 He said that he would examine it carefully, but of course there was not time to do so now as it was nearly 2 o’clock. He then left.

 LORD WAVELL’S STATEMENTlibtech_765_footnote
 NEW  DELHI,
 June 16, 1946
  His 	Excellency the 	Viceroy, in 	consultation with 	the members of 	the Cabinet 	Mission, has 	for some time been 	exploring the 	possibilities of 	forming a 	coalition Government 	drawn from the two major 	parties and certain 	of the minorities. 	The discussions 	have revealed the 	difficulties which exist 	for the two major 	parties in arriving at any agreed basis for the formation of such a Government.  The 	Viceroy and 	the Cabinet Mission 	appreciate these difficulties and 	the efforts which the 	two parties have made to 	meet them. They consider, 	however, that no 	useful purpose can 	be served 	by further 	prolonging these discusions. It 	is indeed urgently 	necessary that a strong 	and representative 	interim Government should be 	set up to conduct the very heavy and important business that has to be carried through.  The 	Viceroy is 	therefore issuing 	invitations to the 	following to 	serve as 	members of 	the Interim 	Government on the 	basis that the constitution-making 	will proceed 	in accordance with the Statement of May 16 : 
 Sardar Baldev Singh Sir N. P. Engineer Mr. Jagjivan Ram
 Pandit Jawaharlal  Nehru Mr. M. A. Jinnah Nawabzada Liaquat Ali Khan Mr. H.. K. Mahtab
 Dr. John Matthai
 
 Nawab Mohammed Ismail Khan Khwaja Sir Nazimuddin
 Sardar Abdur Rab Nishtar Mr. C. Rajagopalachari Dr. Rajendra Prasad Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel
 It any of those invited is unable for personal reasons to accept, the Viceroy will, after consultation, invite some other person in his place.
  The 	Viceroy will arrange the 	distribution of 	portfolios in 	consultation with 	the leaders 	of the two major parties.  The 	above composition 	of the 	Interim Government 	is in no way 	to be 	taken as 	a precedent 	for the solution 	of any 	other communal question. 	It is 	an expedient put 	forward to 	solve the 	present difficulty 	only, and 	to obtain 	the best 	available coalition Government.  The 	Viceroy and the Cabinet 	Mission believe 	that Indians of 	all communities 	desire to arrive 	at a speedy 	settlement of this 	matter so that 	the process 	of constitution-making 	can go 	forward and 	that the 	Government of 	India may 	be carried 	on as efficiently 	as possible 	in the meantime.  They 	therefore hope that all 	parties, especially the 	two major parties, will 	accept this 	proposal so 	as to overcome the 	present obstacles, and 	will co-operate for 	the successful 	carrying on 	of the interim 	Government. Should 	this proposal 	be accepted the Viceroy will aim at inaugurating the new Government about 26th June.  In 	the event 	of the 	two major parties or 	either of 	them proving 	unwilling to join 	in the 	setting up 	of a coalition 	Government on the 	above lines, 	it is the 	intention of 	the Viceroy 	to proceed 	with the formation 	of an interim 	Government which 	will be as representative 	as possible 	of those 	willing to 	accept the 	Statement of 	May 16.  The 	Viceroy is 	also directing 	the Governors 	of the 	Provinces to 	summon the 	Provincial Legislative 	Assemblies forthwith to 	proceed with the elections 	necessary for 	 the setting up 	of the constitution-making 	machinery as put forward 	in   the 	Statement of 	May 16.

 INTERVIEW WITH SIR STAFFORD CRIPPSlibtech_766_footnote
 
[June 20, 1946]libtech_767_footnote
 I saw Gandhi at 1.10 p. m. and stayed with him till 2.40 p. m. He started by saying that I should address my arguments to the Maulana. I told him I had done so and the Maulana had suggested I should see him (Gandhi). To this he replied “he has done a disservice to both of us”.
 I made as strong an appeal to him as was possible on both the points, repeating all the arguments I had put to the Maulana.
 On Engineer, which I dealt with first, he said he had no personal objection against him, indeed he had heard favourable accounts of the honourable way in which he had conducted the I. N. A. prosecutions. His objection was first that Congress had not been consulted on his name and second that as he was in an official post he would merely be another vote for the Viceroy.
 I explained to him why Congress could not be consulted under the procedure we had adopted and I strongly stressed that his other fear was quite groundless as that was not the spirit in which the Viceroy was entering upon this task. He admitted that he had no reason to suspect it but maintained his objection “in principle” arising from his long experience of former Government and in South Africa. I pointed out the conditions of this Government would be quite different and one amongst 14 was not a basis for objection to “officials”. I also pointed out that Engineer was not an official though he happened to hold an official post and that any way as he had accepted we were not able to make any alteration as it would be a wrong and impossible way of dealing with an individual. With this he agreed.
 We then went on to the other point and he reiterated that he had  always  said this was the wrong way for forming a Government, that it should be left to one party or the other and not be a coalition forced on the two parties by the British. He did not regard a breakdown on this as final since it might lead to a better arrangement.
 It  was  quite  clear  that he  could  not  be  influenced  from  his  point   of  view and therefore, after a final appeal to him to at least let this method be tried, I left him.

 APPENDIX X
 INTERVIEW WITH CABINET DELEGATION libtech_768_footnote
 
8 p. m. June 24, 1946
  Mr. 	Gandhi raised the 	matter of 	the instructions 	issued by Governors 	for the 	elections to 	the Constituent 	Assembly. He produced 	to the 	Delegation a 	telegram which he 	had received 	from Assam and said 	that this, read with the 	instructions as 	he had 	first understood them, 	made him think 	that members of the 	Constituent Assembly 	were being required to 	accept the 	Delegation’s 	interpretation of their 	Statement of the 	16th May because of 	the words 	in it which 	said that a 	candidate agreed to 	serve as 	a member 	of the 	Constituent Assembly for 	the purposes of 	paragraph 19 	of the Statement 	of 16th 	May. Mr. Gandhi 	explained that he had 	taken legal opinion which 	did not support 	his anxieties 	and said 	that he had 	seen the 	Press Communique put 	out by 	the Government of 	India. If 	he had seen this 	Communique originally he 	would not 	have been troubled 	to the 	same extent that 	he had 	been. In 	addition to 	the legal 	difficulty, however, he 	felt a 	moral difficulty about 	this matter. 
 The Secretary  of  State  and  Sir  S.  Cripps  pointed  out  that the  telegram from Assam was based on a complete misunderstanding of what members of the Constituent  Assembly  were  required  to  undertake.  Mr.  Gandhi  was  shown the form of  undertaking  required  by  the  Bengal  regulations  and  agreed  that  it contained no obligation of the kind he feared. The Secretary of State emphasised that by signing the undertaking a member of the Constituent Assembly was not accepting anything in addition to what was in the Statement of 16th May already.
 The Viceroy said that it was clear that grouping was an  essential  part  of the Delegation’s proposals. Sir S. Cripps  pointed  out  that  what  was  essential  was the forming of the constituent  Assembly  in  sections  for  the  purpose  of framing the constitution. Mr. Gandhi said that he felt that the regulations should have referred to the Statement of May 16th as a whole and not specifically to paragraph 19 was the only one which referred to the setting up of the Constituent Assembly. There were other parts of the Statement as a whole to which members of the Constituent Assembly could not be expected to give concurrence, for example, the paragraphs rejecting a sovereign Pakistan. Mr. Gandhi said that at the Press Conference Lord Pethick-Lawrence had interpreted the Statement to mean that the Constituent Assembly must meet in sections. He (Mr. Gandhi) had dissented from this view and his interpretation of the document was upheld by eminent lawyers. It
 was clear that the Delegation were the law-givers and could not interpret their own law. It must be the Federal Court which would interpret the meaning of the Statement. His trouble was that by signing the declaration required by the electoral rules a member of the Constituent Assembly might be bound morally to accept the Delegation’s interpertation. Sir S. Cripps said that any doubt on the point might be solved by the fact that the person who sent the telegram from Assam was under a misapprehension as to what members of the Constituent Assembly were in fact asked to sign. Mr. Ganghi had agreed that the form of declaration was innocuous morally and his lawyers had agreed with the interpretation of it which Sir Stafford himself had expressed to Mr. Gandhi earlier. The First Lord said that what mattered was what a person signed. Mr. Gandhi agreed that whatever views a man might have about sections or groups he could sign the form of declaration in the Bengal regulations.
  Mr. 	Gandhi said he 	wanted to 	make his 	position about 	the Constituent 	Assembly clear. His 	view was 	that the 	Europeans had 	no vote 	and could 	not stand 	as candidates. He 	would like 	to ask 	the Delegation whether 	they had made any further 	progress or 	did they 	ask Congress 	to rely 	on whatever 	local assistance they could get 	 if the Europeans 	say that 	they want to assert 	their right. Sir S. 	Cripps and 	the Viceroy said 	there was 	nothing more 	to be said 	about the 	Europeans since 	the statements 	issued by 	the European repressentatives.  Mr. 	Gandhi said there was one very delicate matter which he would like 	to raise. Mr. 	Sudhir Ghosh had 	reported to 	him his conversation 	with Sir S. 	Cripps on 	this subject and 	he felt that he 	would like to 	clear his 	mind. What he 	wanted to 	know was whether, 	if the 	whole thing was 	scrapped, would the 	undertakings to 	Mr. Jinnah 	also be 	scrapped, would the 	undertakings to 	Mr. Jinnah also be 	scrapped, or 	would the 	whole Statement be 	scrapped, or 	what would 	happen. It would 	not be 	a satisfactory 	thing from 	his point of 	view if 	this were the case. 	If the 	Government of 	India is 	appointed personally 	by the 	Viceroy he 	will be 	responsible only 	to the 	British Government. 	It would 	not be 	satisfactory to 	Mr. Gandhi 	nor did he 	think it 	would satisfy 	the Congress 	or, for 	that matter, 	the Muslim League. He 	thought the 	Delegation owed 	it to the 	Congress, the 	Muslim League and 	the public to 	tell them 	what they proposed 	to do. 	If the 	Delegation said 	that they could tell 	him nothing he 	would take that answer, 	but if they 	had anything 	to say to him so that 	he could 	advise the 	Working Committee with 	full knowledge, he would 	be obliged. 
 The Indian people would have to work this Constituent Assembly which had no statutory existence. It would be a difficult thing to do as the Delegation had created the Statement which had no legal existence. There were bound  to  be differences of opinion as to what it meant. The Congress, the Muslim League and the British Government used the same terms to mean differennt things. For example, the Congress independence meant independence now. To the Delegation it meant
 independence when “this Charter is passed”, but it would only become a Charter if the people went for it and the British Government afterwards legalized the Charter. Suppose that there were a change of Secretary of State or a change of Government and that the intention of the British Government changed. The Secrtary of State here
 interrupted Mr. Gandhi to say that he would like to answer that point at once. It was not the practice of British Government to repudiate definite pledges given by their predecessors to third parties. They were not capable of doing that but if it were assumed that they were then the answer was that no statute would be any protection because a new statute could be passed altering the old one. He thought that this suggestion of a statutory basis for the Constituent Assembly would add nothing to the dignity or security of the Indian people. It would make the Constituent Body a creature of a British statute and if legislation were introduced attempts might be made to alter or amend the Statement. He thought that Mr. Gandhi would have been the first person to object if the Delegation had said that the Constituent Assembly could only be set up by an Act of the British Parliament. Sir S. Cripps said that apart from these considerations the lack of rigidity in basing a Constituent Assembly  on  the Statement and not on an enactment was very desirable. The origin of a Constituent Assembly should be the popular will and not the act of another State’s Legislature. This gave the Assembly the right constitutional status. It did not give it legal status. Mr. Gandhi said that the Delegation did contemplate a statute after the Constituent Assembly had met. Sir S. Cripps said this was not for the purpose of enacting the new Constitution but of removing the existing legislation. The First Lord said that there was no question as he understood it of any legislation except to cancel the existing constitution and the British Government had said that they would enact this legislation at the proper time provided two factors were satisfied. First, adequate provision for the protection of minorities as to the necessity of which there was no controversy at all and both major parties had said that they intended to make such provision, and secondly, reasonably formal engagements to be entered into between the united Kingdom and India covering matters arising out of the transfer of power. This would deal with formal matters such as the arrangements in regard to the Services.
  Sardar 	Patel said he understood 	that the 	Europeans would 	not put up 	candidates but 	he would 	like to know 	whether it 	was contemplated 	that they should 	vote. The First Lord said 	that the Secretary of State had fulfilled his undertaking to do what 	he could 	to arrange 	this matter. No European 	would now vote 	for a European 	to sit 	in the 	Constitution-making Body. 	That was the major 	point. Sardar Patel said 	that voting was 	very important. Sir 	S. Cripps 	said that the position 	on the 	Statement  of 	16th May 	was that members of 	the Legislatures 	were entitled to vote 	and therefore 	Europeans were 	entitled to 	vote. The 	document clearly did 	not intend that no 	one other than 	Indians should be 	members of 	the Constituent 	Assembly so 	that that 
 question was on a different footing. Whether the Europeans exercised their vote was legally a matter for them. The First Lord said that the Europeans had gone a very long way from the position which obtained when the Congress complained about this matter. He thought that the original complaint had had justification but 75 per cent  of it had been met.

 LETTER FROM LORD WAVELL TO ABUL KALAM AZADlibtech_769_footnote
 
June 22, 1946
 I understand from Press reports that there is strong feeling in Congress circles that the party should insist on their right to include a Muslim of their choice among the representatives of the Congress in the Interim Government.
 For reasons of which you are already aware it is not possible for the Cabinet Mission or myself to accept this request, but I would draw your attention to paragraph 5 of the Statement of the 16th June which reads as follows :
 “The above composition of the Interim Government is in no way to be taken as a precedent for the solution of any other communal question. It is an expedient put forward to solve the present difficulty only, and to obtain the best available coalition Government.”
 In the light of this assurance that no precedent is established we appeal to the Congress not to press their demand, but to take part in the strong Interim Government which the country so urgently needs.

 GROUPING CLAUSE CONTROVERSYlibtech_770_footnote
 It has been reported in the Press that the text of a Bengal Government communique requires every delegate to the Constituent Assembly to sign a declaration accepting Clause 19 of the Cabinet Delegation’s Statement of May  16.  This  allegation is without any foundation. The A. P. I. has been authorized to state that according to the instructions actually issued a candidate for  election  to  the Constituent Assembly from any province is required to declare that he has not been proposed for candidature to represent any other province and that he is willing to serve as a representative of the province for the purpose of paragraph 19 of the
 
 Cabinet Delegation’s Statement.
 The plain purpose of paragraph 19 is the framing of a new Constitution for India and this has been made further clear in the actual form of a declaration prescribed for the purpose by the Governor of Bengal which is as follows :
 “I hereby agree to this nomination and declare that I am willing to serve in the Constituent Assembly as a representative of the General or Muslim part of the Bengal Legislative Assembly for the purpose of framing a new Constitution for India. I further declare that I have not been proposed as a representative of any part of the Legislative Assembly of any other province in India in the said Constituent Assembly.”
 The other reference to paragraph 19 of the Statement in the instructions issued by the Bengal Governor is with regard to reporting the result of the election.
 This reads as follows : “The returning officer shall report the result of the election to the Governor who shall cause the names of the candidates declared elected,   to be published in the Calcutta Gazette on July 15, 1946 or as soon as may be thereafter; and the persons whose names are so published shall be representative of Bengal for the purposes of paragraph 19 of the above-mentioned Statement.”

Recently Government has passed Asiatic Land Tenure and Indian Representation Act 1946 which deprives my fellow countrymen and myself of certain basic elementary human rights. In protest to this unjust and inhuman law I have occupied land which Act debars me from.   I am not challenging Durban City Council’s ownership of land nor am I engendering hostility to any section of community. ”
