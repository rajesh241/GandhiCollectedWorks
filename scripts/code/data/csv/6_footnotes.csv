Gandhiji's letter to 	him dated November 17 (vide 	“Letter to Dadabhai 	Naoroji”, 17-11-1906) shows that, during the Deputation's stay in 	England, Mr. Naoroji sent all papers received from South Africa to 	Gandhiji who returned them offering comment and explanation and 	sometimes suggesting courses of action. It is thus very likely that 	Gandhiji drafted the letter because of his ready familiarity with 	the South African situation."

libtech_22_footnote,"1Several members 	spoke. Sir Henry Cotton, the Chairman of the meeting, said that, 	under this Ordinance, British Indians were placed under the 	surveillance of the police in a manner which could not be 	differentiated from the treatment given in England to prisoners who 	were released from jail. Mr. Ally appealed in the name of 	Christianity and humanity for the support of British Members of 	Parliament in freeing Indians from a degrading law. Sir Charles 	Dilke said that it was notorious that there was a great jealousy of 	Indians because they made such admirable shopkeepers and medical 	men. Mr. Joseph Walton, Mr. Harold Cox and Mr. Higham supported a 	proposal to sign a memorial to the Prime Minister regarding the 	status of British Indians in the Transvaal. Sir Henry Cotton summed 	up the feelings of the meeting by saying that the question had 	become one of Imperial importance and had thus been taken out of the 	realm of party politics. A resolution supporting the objectives of 	the Deputation was then unanimously adopted."

libtech_230_footnote,"1The Cape Argus, commenting on the situation created by the suspension of the Transvaal Asiatic Law Amendment Ordinance, said: “We would have the local Governments everywhere take counsel with the leaders of the Indian community. It should be put to these men that they cannot expect white colonists to stand by and see the very texture of the community quickly transformed by an Indian influx; and that some regulations should be arrived at by which undue hardship on the men who are here could be avoided. It is by some such compromise only that we can avoid conflict, good for neither Briton nor Indian.” Commenting on this in its English editorial columns, Indian Opinion (5-1-1907) described it as “A Wise Suggestion” and argued that “British Indians in South Africa have [always] accepted the principle of restriction of Indian immigration along non-racial lines’’."
