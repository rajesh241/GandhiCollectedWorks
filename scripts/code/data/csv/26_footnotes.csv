libtech_466_footnote,"4Commenting that the Government’s charge on Sunderlal, student leader of Central Provinces, was not for violence but purely spreading disaffection, Gandhiji had written in Young India that “it may be stated to be the creed of the non-co- operator to give voice to the popular disaffection towards the Government and to spread it. Disaffection is the very essence of non-co-operation.” Vide “Repression in the G.P”, 25-5-1921."

libtech_556_footnote,"1While reproducing 	the letter 	in Young 	India, 6-3-1924, 	Gandhiji added the 	following note: “The 	Superintendent, in 	reply to 	the foregoing, 	came to 	my cell and 	said that he harboured no 	anger against Mr. Jeramdas. Whatever he (Mr. Jeramdas) did 	was done openly, but 	he was 	bound to 	take some notice of 	the breach 	of regulations. 	He could 	not punish 	me for 	instigation. I 	had not left 	the boundary 	of my yard 	to talk 	to the satyagrahis 	and therefore 	he could 	not punish 	me. Owing 	to Mr. Jeramdas’s 	talk to 	the satyagrahis, 	an ugly 	situation was 	prevented.” About 	this episode, Jairamdas 	Doulatram says: “As 	a result 	of Gandhiji’s 	intervention through me, 	the Mulshi Peta 	prisoners respounded and 	carried out 	the task imposed on 	them. The 	authorities had 	intended to 	give them the 	punishment of 	whipping in 	case they persisted 	in their 	refusal. . 	. . This would have led 	to other developments 	and, I believe, 	might have led to Gandhiji’s 	intervention in 	a much more active 	manner, leading to other 	consequences.”"

On September 13, according to Mahadev Desai, Mahomed Ali “asked Devdas if Bapu had anything to say to him, and the ‘wireless’ message he jocularly referred to in his speech was then given to him.” This is however worded differently from the message which Mahomed Ali quoted in his speech, in support of the resolution advocating Council-entry, at the special Congress session in Bombay on September 12, over which he presided. According to a report in The Hindu, 17-9-1923, the gist of the message from Gandhiji, which Mahomed Ali interpreted to mean as permitting a change in the non-co-operation programme of the Congress, was as follows: “I do not want you to stick to my programme. I am for the entire programme. But, if looking at the state of the country, you think that one or two items of the boycott programme should be discarded or modified or added to, then in the name of love of country, I command you to give up those parts of my programme of alter them accordingly.” There is, however, no evidence that this message was actually sent by Gandhiji.
