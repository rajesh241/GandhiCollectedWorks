       December 	3, 1927  	You seem to be dividing all the good things with poor Utkallibtech_1_footnotelibtech_2_footnote. I flattered myself with the assumption that my 	arrival here is one of the good things, for I was going to devote 	all the twenty days to seeing the skeletons of Orissa; but as you, 	the Andhras, are the gatekeepers of Orissa on this side, you have 	intercepted my march. But I am glad you have anticipated me also. 	After entering Andhra Desh, I have been doing my business with you 	and I know God will reward all those unknown people who have been 	co-operating with me who am a self- appointed representative of 	Daridranarayana. And here, too,  you have been doing the same 	thing. Last night, several sister came and presented me with a 	purse. But let me tell you this is not after all my tour in Andhra. 	I am not going to let you alone so easily as this, nor will 	Deshabhakta Konda Venkatappayya let me alone, because I have toured 	in some parts of Ganjam. I am under promise to tour Andhra during 	the early part of next year, and let me hope what you are doing is 	only a foretaste of what you are going to do next year.  	You have faith in true non-co-operation. There is  the  great drink 	evil, eating into the vitals of the labouring population. I would 	like you to non-co-operate with that evil without a single thought 	and  I make a sporting proposal, viz., that those who give up drink 	habit should divide their savings with me on behalf of 	Daridranarayan. Then I see that many of you are making 	chimneys of your mouths by the vicious smoke habit. You, who smoke, 	do not know what a filthy habit it is. I saw that many of the 	people, when I made the appeal, threw away their cigars and 	cigarettes. The elderly people  by indulging in this vicious habit 	do not know what a legacy they are leaving to their children. You 	know, as I know, that many children steal money in order to satisfy 	their curiosity to somke. I ask you therefore to non-co-operate with 	the smoke habit, and again divide you savings with me.  	So also must Hindus non-co-operate with the devil of un- 	touchability. I give you my assurance that devil is keeping us from 	God, and it is a barrier created for our own destruction.      
 Mahatmaji then proceeded to answer some questions handed to  him  by someone in the audience. The first question was: “What are the means now to be adopted by young men for the uplift of the Mother country?” Mahatmaji said:
There are many things that I can suggest, but there is one thing
 which is the easiest for them to do and that is khadi work. They can set apart a certain sum every month or every year to be devoted for khadi work. If they have the time, they can devote it to organizing khadi work in their own district. If they cannot do so or if they have given what is best in them. If they cannot do so or if they have not confidence enough to be able to do organizing work, they can give half an hour a day to spinning and their yarn to  the  All-India Spinners’ Association and become a member.
 The second question dealt with the educational and other qualifications required for a public worker. Mahatmaji said:
So far as educational qualifications are concerned, besides
 knowing the provincial vernacular, they must know also the Rashtrabhashalibtech_3_footnote—Hindi. But the other qualifications are even far more important. They must be strictly honest and their private character must be pure. Men whose eyes are not straight and whose heart is full of animal passion are not fit for doing political work. And in my opinion, unless he believes in truth and non-violence at any cost, he has no business to be a politician.
 Answering the third question, Mahatmaji said :
 Whilst all our leaders are conceiving and cooking all kinds of schemes, we, the rank and file, cannot do better than achieving the message of khadi to its fullest extent. It is not a small thing for you and me to take part in an effort to save sixty crores of rupees. You and I cannot pack the Councils, Assembly and Municipalities. Even if we would, we could not have all the qualifications. But every one of us is born with the qualification for khadi. It requires not much training except the training of the heart. By doing khadi work you will find that the power is descending upon you.

2,,ESSAY ON KHADI,"
  
 Readers will recall that essays in English were invited on the subject of khadi, in view of the prize announced by Shri Revashanker Jagjivanlibtech_4_footnotelibtech_5_footnote.    Accordingly,   the   essay    written    jointly    by    Professor Puntambekar and Shri Varadachari was awarded the prize. As this is well worth study, it has been translated [into Gujarati] for  the Jamnadas Bhagwandas Memorial Series. Shri Chhaganlal Joshi of the Satyagraha Ashram has done the translation and it has now been published. It is priced at Re. 1. The total number of pages is 260. The translation runs into 215 pages, the rest being appendices. All the apppendices are useful. The last appendix gives a short history of khadi in Gujarat; in other words, it shows where khadi was formerly produced in Gujarat and how that priceless industry came to be ruined. The language used in the translation is  simple.  Gujarati  readers will have no difficulty in understanding it. Those who wish to understand well the secret underlying the activity of spinning must positively go through this book.

 SISTERS,
 You have presented two purses for the khadi work. I acknowledge your present with gratitude. You must not think that I consider some of you as Oriyas and some as Telugus. You should feel that all are Indians. Some say that they belong to Andhra and some say that they belong to Orissa. Let all of you belong to India. Let all of you share each other’s misery and happiness. Only thus can you become like Sita. Sita did not consider herself a citizen of Ayodhya. She always considered hereself as belonging to the whole of India. I am really glad that you have written this welcome address in the national language, that is, Hindi. Let all of you give up foreign saris. Let all of you use only khadi. There is no necessity for a woman to wear beautiful saris and ornaments. The only thing a woman needs is purity. Let all of you wear khadi. Let all of you be pure and truthful.
 
 You should not consider anyone as untouchable. In India, that is, Bharatvarsha, it is a great sin to consider anyone as an untouchable. For heaven’s sake do not commit that sin. Love those who are poor, diseased and hungry. Let all of you prove that you love them by spinning yarn on the charkha for at least half an hour every day. I appeal to those who have not contributed anything towards this Khadi Fund to contribute money or ornaments.

4,"December 4, 1927","SPEECH AT STUDENTS’ MEETING, BERHAMPUR","
  
 December 4, 1927
 PROFESSORS, STUDENTS AND BROTHERS,
 Our programme in this meeting will be unlike the programmes followed in other meetings. In our Satyagraha Ashram, for many years now, at 4.15 a.m. in the morning and at 7 p.m. in the evening, we hold congregational prayers. When the Ashramites go to other places this schedule is observed even there. Knowing that it is difficult to hold prayers at 7 p.m. in the evening regularly [during tours], we have ruled that prayer must be held at night before going to bed.
 On Friday, December 2, it was very late in the night when we entered into Ganjam district. I forgot to pray before going to bed due to heavy work. When I woke up in the dawn, I trembled in fear. I could see that I had committed a great mistake before the Lord. So we decided that anyone forgetting to offer prayers must do some kind of penance. We also decided that wherever we were, we must remember the name of Rama at least once in the evening. I was scheduled to come to this meeting at 7 p.m. and we were supposed to  pray together; but while coming the motor car from Chhatrapur I found that it was already 7 p.m. So I prayed by myself in the motor-car; but when we have decided on collective prayer, I beg you to pray here and now. Those students and others who have faith in prayer, let them pray with closed eyes. After the prayer, I will try to explain its utility. Those who are unwilling to pray, I request them to sit quietly.libtech_7_footnote
 
 As food is necessary for the body, prayer is necessary for the soul. A man may be able to do without food for a number of days,— as MacSwiney did for over 70 days—but believing in God,  man cannot, should not, live a moment without prayer. You will say that we see lots of people living without prayer. I dare say they do, but it is the existence of the brute which, for man, is worse than death. I have not the shadow of a doubt that the strife and quarrels with which our atmosphere is so full today are due to the absence of the spirit of true prayer. You will demur to the statement, I know, and contend that millions of Hindus, Mussalmans and Christians do offer their prayers. It is because I had thought you would raise this objection that I used the words ‘true prayers’. The fact is we have been offering  our  prayers with the lips but hardly ever with our hearts, and it is to escape,  if possible, the hypocrisy of the lip-prayer, that we in the Ashram repeat every evening the last verses of the second chapter of the Bhagavad Gita. The condition of the ‘Equable in Spirit’ that is described in those verses, if we contemplate them daily, is bound slowly to turn our hearts towards God. If you students would base your education on the true foundation of a pure character and pure heart there is nothing so helpful as to offer your prayers every day truly and religiously.

Sushila is right when she says that in the realm of art there can be 	no distinction between indigenous and foreign, but her statement 	calls for some reflection. Lovers of art take a superficial view of 	art and use it as a cover for many weaknesses. We should, therefore, 	examine what we mean by art. Not everything which appeals to the eye 	is art. What is accepted as art by many expert may not be art. I 	have read conflicting opinions about many paintings and statues    
 expressed by art-critics who have become famous in the world. We should, therefore, think what art means. The book What Is Art? libtech_9_footnotehas been translated [into Gujarati]. Sushila should read it. If you cannot get it there, Please write to me.

 [On or before December 6, 1927]
 I am pining for a day when all this unhealthy competition between sister languages of India will have ceased. Why should we not love all of them equally, as a brother holding a number of sisters in the same affection? The result of the wretched competition has been that we forget our vernaculars and are jealous of others, and fondly believe that English would take the place of the common language of India, and even of the vernaculars. Indeed a suggestion had come to me to address the meeting here in English. Well, I take this as disaffection towards the daughter language of the motherland, and an unhealthy affection for a foreign tongue. Not that I hate English, but I love Hindi more. That is why I am beseeching the lettered classes of India to make Hindi their common language. It is through Hindi that we can get into touch with and promote the growth of  the  other vernaculrs of the provinces. If our intellects and hearts had not been atrophied owing to our having to learn through a foreign medium, there would be no reason why we should not all be knowing five or six vernaculars. And my remarks regarding the competition  betw-  een languages apply also to our narrow provincialism. It is that provi-
 
 ncialism that has prevented the full growth of nationalism in us. The golden rule for the promotion of nationalism is that the stronger should help and sacrifice for the weaker as much as is possible. And now you will understand the rationale of khadi, which is intended to promote a healthy nationalism, and which embraces within its fold the poor and the downtrodden.

 I got your letter. I look forward to a letter from you on the due dates; if, however, I don’t get one, I understand. Your name is always on my lips. When it becomes necessary to say anything unpleasant like a note out of tune, even then it will, in fact, be perfectly in tune since it will be the truth and truth is always in tune. Do not, therefore, omit to tell me what you think I must be told. I did not receive the letters which you mention. Letters addressed to me do not generally get lost, but these ones at any rate did not reach me. I am sure many errors remain in My Experiments with Truth. I exercise great care but, when memory betrays me, to whom shall I complain about the misfortune? Please to not omit to draw my attention to any fact, whether important or unimportant.

10,,DISTORTION OF TRUTH,"
  
 A correspondent has been endeavouring with the help of the head master of a high school to introduce the teaching of the Gita among its boys. But at a recent meeting convened to organize Gita readings a bank manager got up and disturbed the even tenor of the proceedings by saying that students had not the adhikara, ‘qualification’, for studying the Gita; it was not a play-thing to be placed before students. The correspondent sends me a  long  and argued letter about the incident and sends in support of his contention some apt saying from Ramakrishna Paramahamsa from which I cull the following :
 Boys and youths should be encouraged to seek God. They are like unpecked fruits, being totally untainted by worldly desires. Once such desires have entered their minds, it is very difficult to make them tread the path to salvation.
 Why do I love young men so much? Because they are masters of the whole (16 annas) of their minds which get divided and sub-divided as they grow up. One half of the mind of a married man goes to his wife. When a child is born it takes away one-fourth (four annas), and the remaining one-fourth (four annas) is scattered over parents, wordly honours, dress, etc. Therefore a young mind can easily know God. It is very difficult for old people to do so.
 The parrot cannot be taught to sing if the membrane of its throat becomes hardened with age. It must be taught while it is young. Similarly, in old age it  is difficult for the mind to be fixed on God. It can be easily done so in youth.
 If a seer of adulterated milk contains a chhatank (sixteenth part of a seer) of water, it can be thickened into kshira (condensed milk) with very little labour and consumption of fuel. But should there be three paos (quarter seer) of water in a seer, the milk cannot be easily thickened and a large consumption of fuel will be required. A young mind, being but slightly adulterated with worldly desires, can be easily turned towards God; this cannot be done with the minds of old people which are highly adulterated with such desires.
 The tender bamboo can be easily bent, but the full-grown bamboo breaks when an attempt is made to bend it. It is easy to bend young hearts towards God, but the heart of the old escapes the hold when so drawn.
 The human mind is like a package of mustard seed. As it is very difficult to gather the seeds that escape out of a torn package and are scattered in all directions, so when the human mind runs in diverse directions and is occupied with many worldly things, it is not a very easy task to collect and concentrate
 it. The mind of a youth, not running in diverse directions, can be easily fixed on anything; but the mind of an old man being totally occupied with worldly things, it is very hard for him to draw it away from them and fix it on God.
I have heard of adhikara in connection with the Vedas, but I
 never knew that the Gita required the qualifications that the bank manager had in mind. It would have been better if he had stated the nature of the qualifications he required. The Gita clearly states that it is meant for all but scoffers. If Hindu students may not read the Gita they may not read any religious works at all. Indeed the original conception in Hinduism is that the student life is the life of a brahmachari who should begin it with a knowledge of religion coupled with practice so that he may digest what he learns and weave religious conduct into his life. The student of old began to live his religion before he knew what it was, and this conduct was followed by due enlightenment, so that he might know the reason for the conduct prescribed for him.
 Adhikara then there certainly was. But it was the adhikara of right conduct known as the five yamas or cardinal restraints—ahimsa (innocence), satya (truth), asteya (non-stealing), aparigraha (non- possession), and brahmacharya (celibacy). These were the rules that had to be observed by anybody who wished to study religion. He may not go to religious books for proving the necessity of these fundamentals of religion.
 But today the word adhikara like many such potent words has suffered distortion, and a dissolute man, simply because he is called Brahmin, has adhikara to read and expound Shastras to us, whereas a man, if he is labelled an untouchable because of his birth in  a  particular state, no matter how virtuous he may be, may not read them.
 But the author of the Mahabharata of which the Gita is a part wrote his great work for the purpose of meeting this insane objection, and made it accessible to all irrespective of the so-called caste, provided, I presume, that he complied with the observances I have described: I add the qualifying expression “I presume” for, at the time of writing, I do not recall the observance of the yamas as a condition precedent to a person studying the Mahabharata. Experience however shows that the purity of heart and the devotional frame of mind are necessary for a proper understanding of religious books.
 The printing age has broken down all barriers and scoffers read
 religious books with the same freedom (if not greater) that the religiously-minded have. But we are here discussing the propriety of students reading the Gita as per of religious instruction and devotional exercise. Here I cannot imagine any class of persons more amenable to the restraints and thus more fitted  than  students  for  such instruction. Unfortunately, it is to be admitted that neither the students nor the instructors in the majority of cases think anything of the real adhikara of the five restraints.

11,,GOD’S TEMPLE,"
  
 
 Here in Ceylon where I am writing for Young India amid surroundings where Nature has bountifully poured her richest treasures, I recall a letter written by a poetically inclined friend from similar scenes. I share with the reader a paragraph from that letter.
 A lovely morning! Cool and cloudy, with a drowsy sun whose rays are as soft velvet. It is a strangely quiet morning—there is a hush upon it, as of prayer. And the mists are like incense, and the trees worshippers in a trance, and the birds and insects pilgrims come to chant bhajans. Oh! how I wish one could learn true abandonment from Nature! We seem to have forgotten our birthright to worship where and when and how we please. We build temples and mosques and churches to keep our worship safe from prying eyes and away from outside influences, but we forget that walls have eyes and ears, and the roofs might be swarming with ghosts—who know!
 Good Gracious, I shall find myself preaching next! How foolish, on a lovely morning like this? A little child in the garden adjoining is singing as unconsciously and joyously as a bird. I feel inclined to go and take the dust of its little feet. And since I cannot pour out my heart in sound as simply as that little one, my only refuge is in silence!
Churches, mosques and temples, which cover so much hypocrisy
 and humbug and shut the poorest out of them, seem but a mockery of God and His worship, when one sees the eternally renewed temple of worship under the vast blue canopy inviting every one of us to real worship, instead of abusing His name by quarrelling in the name of religion.

 I am having such a hectic time that I have no leisure at all. Your letter has come to me here at an obscure place. Now you must leave Pattani Saheb’s bungalow, and that without intimating him. You must inform him only after you have left. Isn’t that what we decided in Bombay? If you must stay in Panchgani you must take whatever other accommodation you can get. My advice is that you should only go to Almora or some place that side. If Taramati refuses to go along, she must be left at Bombay. As for Dilip, now he can be taken even without her.
 The fact that you got temperature again suggests that you are still in a delicate state of health.

Why should you fear? A man who is innocent of crime need not fear. 	And remember that there would be no one to frighten you if you 	refused to be afraid. After all the policemen are our kith and kin. 	When they come to intimidate you, ask them what they want to achieve 	thereby. If they take you to jail do not resist them. If they abuse 	you don’t abuse you don’t abuse them but laugh away. If they 	belabour you, don’t return blow for blow, but go and report the 	matter to the nearest representative of the people. I would warn you 
 against going to law for after all we do not want the police to be punished but to repent. But if you feel that you must go to law you may. Do not in any case be cowed down.

 BOLGARH,
    MY 	DEAR C.R.,  December 	10, 1927 
  	You will be surprised to know that at least I have three days of 	quiet in a beautiful little village. Before that the Ganjam 	programme was worse if possible even than the Ceylon programme, 	though it yielded twenty thousand. Then a doctor came to take my 	blood- pressure. Niranjan Babu has made the same arrangements for 	examination of blood-pressure that you had. And when the doctor read 	190, he got frightened and the whole of the programme has been 	rearranged. Hence the rest. Personally I am inclined to disbelieve 	the doctor’s reading. However, even if it was wrong reading, it 	has done good. A new doctor who has come today from Cuttack has read 	anything between 155 and 165. His own reading is between 155 and  	160. Mahadev and Pyarelal read 165. The diastolic is 90-100. If 	these readings are correct, the blood-pressure is the same as 	before, and there is nothing to worry. However I am not writing this 	to tell you about the blood-pressure. Enough for you to now that I 	am all right.  	I am dictating this in order to send you the enclosed. If you can 	send someone to inspect the village and find out whether we can take 	up the proposition, please do so. In any case correspond with the 	writer Mr. G. Subramaniam yourself. I am sending him a postcard 	telling him that he may expect to hear from you.  	I send you also Dr. Joseph’s letter. His suggestion commends 	itself to me. I think we must do some wor in Nagercoil, and unless 	you have anything to the contrary, please enter into correspondence 	with him telling him that his suggestion is acceptable and that it 	will be put before the Council of the Associationlibtech_17_footnoteand you will let him know at an early date. Meanwhile 	you may send the sample of yarn he wants. We ought to be able to 	take up the yarn, and if there are local weavers, we may be able to 	get it woven there. Please write to Dr. Joseph early. I have told 	him that his suggestion commends itself to me and that I have 	forwarded his letter to you for consideration.  	I hope you have fixed up the quarters in Madras. Satis Babu was with 	me for a day. He will be in Madras and stay with us. You should

       December 10, 1927 Fear is more deadly 	than disease, such as cholera, smallpox or malaria. Disease wastes 	only the body, while fear destroys the soul; and men of fear cannot 	understand God.

Give up drink, gambling and 	prostitution, so that you can be pure enough to attain God.

  	I have your letterlibtech_19_footnotefor 	which I thank you. You may translate the book Self-restraint v. 	Self-indulgence. As to the terms, I leave them to you. 	Whatever is given will be devoted to public use.  	What you say about the women of the West is only partly true and 	true also perhaps to an extent for the women of India. But these are 	society women and very few. So far as the vast majority of women are 	concerned, they are too engrossed in their own occupations even to 	think of animal passions. It is reserved for man to become 	aggressive when animal passion forces him. What you say about 	passivity is unfortunately too true all the world over, and I do not 	know that the majority of women will ever be able to overcome that 	passivity. Perhaps the very construction of their bodies prevents 	the development of active resistance except under certain 	well-defined circumstances which are created by special culture. And 	it is because woman is passive that I have contended that it is man 	who is the more to blame than woman. And even the society woman of 	the West does not go beyond subtle attraction and blandishments. I 	have not known many cases of violence done by women to men. She has 	a remarkable capacity for controlling herself and pining away rather 	than be aggressive even under raging passion within her breast.  Your 	sincerely,  M.

So far as the question of child welfare is concerned, it is quite 	true to say that in the sense Lord Lytton means I have not 	interested myself in the problem, but in a sense, which I consider 	higher and which takes in not a few thousand children but millions 	of children, I am continually occupied in attending to their 	welfare.

And if I 	succeed, I know that the child welfare of the type known to you and 	Lord Lytton is assured.  	With reference to the printed sheet by you, it is difficult to reply 	to it because the writer has seen the same thing from a different 	angle of vision.

  	I had your long letter. It is not possible to prevent or regulate by 	pressure of public opinion the emigration of people in distress from 	one place to another, and it would be wrong to prevent it  by 	legislation. But wise ameliorative legislation in Ceylon can 	certainly 
 do a great deal to check evils inseparable from the immigration of poor labourers no matter to what race they belong. You should create a public opinion in Ceylon which would demand from the employers of labour a humane treatment, payment of adequate wages and construction of sanitary and commodious dwellings. Instead of regarding Indian labourers as foreigners, you should treat them as your own. After all the labourers go to Ceylon because they are wanted.

  	I have your letter. I do not consider the embracing of Christianity 	as in any way essential for salvation. I do not believe in the 	exclusive divinity of Jesus Christ. I do not consider that the lives 	of all Roman Catholic bishops are above suspicion. In my opinion, it 	is taking a low view of marriage to think that it involves 	indulgence in animal passion at the instance of either partner. 	Marriage has far nobler uses. I am not aware that religion enjoins 	upon one partner the obligation to indulge at the instance of 	another. On the contrary, physical union is not permitted till both 	are equally desirous.  Yours 	sincerely,  From 	a microfilm: S.N. 12645       BOLGARH (ORISSA),  December 	11, 1927  MY 	DEAR SRI PRAKASA,  	You must forgive me for not replying to your letter for such a long 	time, but I have been worked beyond my strength and have had no time 	left for dealing with voluminous correspondence. It is only 
 because I am having enforced rest at an unknown and out-of-the-way village in Utkal, that I am able to deal with the arrears, and in the natural course I have come upon your letter. Here is the receipt sent to me with your letter from the Ashram.
 The Aaj people should not complain. Complimentary copies have been sent only to well-known English papers. Even well-known friends have not been supplied with copies simply because after all Young India and Navajivan are at present very poor concerns. They do not command the circulation of 1920 and 1921, and yet the rigid rule of remaining self-supporting in spite of the handicaps in the shape of not taking advertisements, etc., is observed, and whenever there is anything left over from the running of these papers, the whole of it goes for public cause. Should Aaj then expect a free copy, it would be simply taking so much out of poor people’s pockets. If, in spite of this explanation, you or the workers at the Aaj office expect a free copy, tell me and I shall ask Swami Anand to send one. Of course I know that Aaj is a leading paper on your side as is Basumati for instance in Calcutta. But so far as I am aware, no vernacular paper has had the English copy.
 Do please take me in your confidence either by letter or by coming to me. I would love to share your burdens. Do regard me therefore as a friend who would treasure your  confidence and endeavour to lighten your burdens. I am at Sabarmati in January. I am sorry I shall have to go to Kathiawr for a few days during that month.libtech_21_footnoteBut if you will be there for the whole of the   month you can go with me to Kathiawar also and see that weird country.
 Do take up the charkha regularly and once you have obtained mastery over it, you will not want to give it up, and it will be a faithful companion speaking to you only at your behest. But you will find all the joy in the handling of it only if you will connect it and through it yourself with the meanest of our people. And why should there be any shame in carrying on the takli, if there is no shame in identifying with the poorest. I suppose you do know that the shepherds in Almora and in many other parts of India carry their taklis, spinning wool wherever they go.

 BOLGARH, ORISSA,
 December 11, 1927 When the mind is disturbed by impure thoughts, instead  of trying to drive them out one should occupy it in some work, that is,
engage it in purposeful thoughts. Or one may engross it in Raman-
 ama, engage it in reading or in some bodily labour which requires mental attention too. Never let the eyes follow their inclination. If they fall on a woman, withdraw them immediately. It is scarcely necessary for anyone to look straight at a man’s or woman’s face. This is the reason why brahmacharis, and others too, are enjoined to walk with their eyes lowered. If we are sitting, we should keep steady in one direction. This is an external remedy, but a most valuable one. You may undertake a fast if and when you find one necessary.
 It is not necessary for you to go to Satavalekarji. He will certai- nly teach you some asanas. If you wish to go to him to learn them, you may certainly do so. I know him very well. He is a fine man.
 You should not be afraid even if you get involuntary discharges during a fast. Vaids say that, even when impure desires are absent, such discharges occur because of pressure in the bowels. But, instead of believing that, it helps us more to believe that they occur because  of impure desires. We are not always conscious of such desires. I had an involuntary discharge in sleep twice during the last two weeks. I cannot recall any dream. I never practised masturbation. One cause of these discharge is of course my physical weakness, but I also know that there are impure desires deep down in me. I am able to keep out such thoughts during waking hours. But what is present in the body like some hidden posion, always makes its way, even forcibly sometimes. I feel unhappy about this, but am not nervously afraid. I am always vigilant. I can suppress the enemy but have not been able to expel him altogether. If I am truthful, I shall succeed in doing that too. The enemy will not be able to endure the power of truth. If you are in the same condition as I am, learn from my experience. In its essence, desire for sex-pleasure is equally impure, whether its object is one’s wife or some other woman. Its results differ. At the moment, we are thinking of the enemy in his essential nature.  Understand, therefore, that so far as one’s wife is concerned you are not likely to find anyone as lustful as I was. That is why I have described my
 pitiable condition to you and tried to give you courage. If Ba is as a mother to me now, this is the result of long struggle and God’s grace. The legacy of that unclean life, however, afflicts me. I, in return, try to overcome it and, with God’s grace, shall overcome it in this very life.

     SISTERS,  Silence 	Day, December 12, 1927 
  	There is profound solitude around me, but it is the solitude of a 	sick man’s room. When I see the state of people here my heart 	burns within me, and I very much long to stay on here. If any of you 	is willing to come here, I would invite her to do so. All the women 	here observe purdah. The people have neither enough clothes 	to wear nor food to eat. When Mirabehn suggested, before I went to 	Orissa, that it was our duty to put on still fewer clothes, I felt 	embarrassed. But when I see things here, I feel that her suggestion 	was indeed proper. Women here put on only one dhoti, one half covers 	the lower part, and the other half the upper part of their bodies. 	They get neither milk nor ghee. They are terror-stricken. Because of 	some policeman’s threat, they do not even come anywhere near me. I 	left Mirabehn in a house    
 and went out; immediately about fifty women surrounded her and began to ask her questions. If someone of you is willing to work here among these women, she can, I am sure, do a great deal. But all this is about the future. For the present, all of you should get fully trained. ‘Training’ means forgetting oneself. If you do that, you can then go anywhere you like.

 ON TOUR,
    BHAI 	RAMESHCHANDRAJI,  December 	13, 1927 
  	I preserved your letter till now in the hope of answering it. Only 	today can I do so.  	Eating flesh and eating vegetables both involve violence but without 	the latter man can survive nowhere, while without the former he can 	ordinarily survive anywhere. If sensitivity to pain differs among 	creatures, the pain experienced by a cow in the throes of death 	cannot be experienced by plants. For all living beings, violence in 	some form is unavoidable. The votary of non-violence will commit the 	minimum of violence. The other religions do not enjoin flesh- 	eating; they just do not forbid it. It is well to know the custom in 	the other religions or even in Hindu dharma, but if our reason 	considers vegetarianism superior from the moral point of view, we 	must accept it. The votary of non-violence will progressively 	restrict himself, even in the use of vegetables. It is difficult, 	not impossible, to remain a vegetarian in places like Greenland. 	Even if proved impossible, it cannot establish the necessity of 	flesh-eating everywhere. Though our acts are seldom without a fault, 	we abstain from many on the basis of comparative merit. Abstinence 	is constantly on the increase in the life of a seeker after moksha, 	and it is essential too.  	Eggs and milk differ. Eggs are not essential. Milk too is not 	essential for crores of people. I have eaten eggs in England under a 	delusion, as I ate meat in India. But on coming to my senses I left 	them and even in the company of vegetarian friends I accepted only 	those dishes that did not contain eggs. I have now come to know that 	a great number of unfertilized eggs are laid. This can be 	systematically checked and generally unfertilized eggs alone are 	eaten. But this cannot make eggs an item of our food.  	Non-violence is a comprehensive dharma. Violence does not consist 	only in taking life away from the body. Abandoning brahm- acharya 	too is violence in my eyes. It is well known that a brahm- 	achari must abstain from fleshdiet, eggs and milk too. 	Brahm- acharya is more easily attainable with 	vegetable diet alone.  	In conclusion, though the question of diet is very important for a 	religious man, yet it is not the be-all and end-all of religion or 	non- violence; nor is it the most vital factor. The observance of 	religion and 
 non-violence has more to do with the heart. He who does not feel the necessity of abstaining from meat for inner purification need not abstain from it."

       (CAMP) BALASORE,  December 	14, 1927  DEAR 	FRIEND,  	I have your letter written on the train. It is pathetic, for, though 	I believe that I have a most accommodating temperament, I see vital 	differences between us, where you seem to say only differences in 	mere matters of detail. Our outlooks appear to me to be wholly 	different. Whereas you have before your mind’s eye that 	microscopic minority, the educated Indian, I have before my mind’s 	eye  the lowliest illiterate India living outside the railway beat. 	Important as the former class undoubtedly is, it has no importance 	in my estimation except in terms of the latter and for the sake of  	the  latter.  The educated class can justify its existence only if 	it is willing to sacrifice itself for the mass. Your scheme 	therefore makes no appeal to me. I have read Sir P. C. Ray’s 	preface and I have read the other writings you have been sending me; 	but though I admire these great men, they cannot move me from my 	fundamental position. I want you therefore to recognize the 	fundamental difference between us and love me in spite of that 	difference if you can. For my part, the existence of that difference 	does not prevent me from loving you and therefore writing to you as 	often as I can in reply to your communications and striving 
 to make clear the differences between our temperaments so that we may quickly agree to differ and hope one day that one or the other will become a convert.

33,"February 12, 1922",INDICTMENT,"
  
 Do you agree that it is the primary duty of an ideal Government and more so of a Great Soul to put down the wicked and to protect the righteous? If so, may we know how your political philosophy is consistent with this age-long dictum? Was not this the keynote of Shri Krishna’s preaching to Arjuna on the battle-field of Kurukshetra?
 Was this not the shrewd policy of the avataraslibtech_30_footnote, that brought about the dethronement of the renowned Bali, the destruction of Vali, and the  annihilation of Jarasandha?
 How can you expect ordinary mortals, and and that too large numbers at a time, to withstand the attacks of unscrupulous enemies without retaliation? In view of the above, are we not justified in considering your emotional preachings and teachings as impracticable and not within the realization of ordinary persons? Your temporary and piecemeal success in South Africa had been exaggerated greatly by your admirers, and the Indians of average intelligence, innocently (sheep-like) following your lead, have been entangled in difficulties, not realizing that the parrallel of South Africa does not hold good in the case of a vast country of different languages and religious sections like India. Have you not yourself realized, at the cost of the life- interests of a large number of young patriots, that all your talk of “swaraj within a year” has proved vainglorious? Don’t you admit that your somersaultlibtech_31_footnotein the Bardolilibtech_32_footnoteaffair caused much havoc to the people of Guntur who boldly and manfully withheld payment of taxes for a considerable period,libtech_33_footnotelibtech_34_footnotein  pursuance of your programme?
 May we know the net result of your participation in the Khilafat agitation
 
 “Working Committee’s Resolutions at Bardoli”, February 12, 1922.
 and the consequent playing of the Congress into the hands of a few fanatical Mussalmans? Has not the Hindu-Muslim unity of which you spoke and wrote so much, and in the name which you appealed to all Hindus to join their Mohammedan brethren in the hour of their trial, proved a veritable castle of cards, the moment the need of the Mohammedans was over? Can you ever expect by your pious teachings to bring about any real unity between the bigoted and brave Mohammedans and caste-ridden and timid Hindus? Have you ever realized the fact that the communal feuds are increasing all the more, ever since you came into prominence in the Congress by virtue of your creed of non-violence?
 Will you not admit that Pandit Malaviya, C. R. Das, Lala Lajpat Rai, Vijayaraghavachariar, Kelkar, Dr. Moonje and other all-India leaders were disgusted with your political philosophy, however much it might be garbed in the language of dharma?
 Have you not recognized the leadership of that great soul Tilak at least at the beginning? But how is it, you are today raking up intricate controversies of a social and religious character, to the detriment of the national cause? Do you not realize that these tend only to accentuate dissensions all the more among the docile Hindus? Are you not thereby indirectly playing into the hands of the enemies of our cause, whose one argument against us is that we are socially unfit for poliitcal freedom?
 It is worthy on your part to set up and encourage Panchamas to enter the holy temples of caste Hindus for whom and by whom they were built exclusively? Do you consider yourself to be a Trinetra (God Rudra) to set at naught those time-honoured customs at one stroke? Rcently, we are surprised to note that you have taken up the the cause of widows and boldly advised immature youths to marry widows. Don’t you consider  that Swami Vivekananda and others were prudent enough not to advocate widow marriage as they realized the the difficulties which confront us even in the case of the marriages of maids, as they are taking place today? May we know how far it will help to create harmony by mixing up such highly controversial problems with the question of swaraj which is purely political and on which all of us are expected to make a united stand?
 Your charkha cannot be popularized in this advanced age of science. Don’t you think that you will do well, in the light of practical experience, to confine your activities to the field of labour organizations?
 As a real believer in ahimsa dharma is it not your clear duty to refuse addresses from municipalities which are harbouring slaughter-houses?
 The foregoing is a condensation of a letter sent to me by a
 correspondent while I was in Berhampur. As I have reason to think that the correspondent has boldly voiced what many are harbouring in their breasts, I feel that the indictment deserves an answer.
 It is hardly necessary to answer he questions in detail. Many of us make the very serious mistake of taking literally what is accepted as scriptures, forgetting that the letter killeth and the spirit giveth life. The Mahabharata and the Puranas are neither history nor simple religious maxims. They appear to me to be wonderfully designed to illustrate the religious history of man in a variety of ways. The heroes described therein are all imperfect mortals, even as we are—the difference being one of degree only. Their alleged actions are not infallible guides for us. The Mahabharata sums up its teachings by declaring emphatically that truth outweighs everything else on earth.
 But I do no seek to justify everything written under the name of scriptures. I take, as all to be true must take, the sum-total of the effect produced on me by a prayerful reading of such books. Thus I hold that my belief in truth and non-violence is derived from and bases on the scriptural teaching of the very books from which  the correspondent presents me with conundrums. Nay more, my belief today having become part of my fundamental being is capable of standing independent of these books or any other Surely there must come a time in the life of a very religiously minded man when his faith must be self-sustained. Whatever therefore the avataras may be proved to have done or not done is of little moment to me. My experience daily growing stronger and richer tells me that there is no peace for individuals or for nations without practising truth and non- violence to the uttermost extent possible for man. The policy of retaliation has never succeeded. We must not be confounded by the isolated illustrations of retaliation, including frauds and force, having attained temporary and seeming success. The world lives  because there is more love than hate, more truth than untruth in it. This is a proposition capable of being verified by everyone who will take the trouble to think. Fraud and force are diseases, truth and non-violence is health. The fact that the world has not perished is an ocular demonstration of the fact that there is more health than disease in it. Let us, then, who realize this, live up to the rules of health even in the midst of circumstances the most adverse.
 My preaching and teaching are not emotional or unpractical, for  I teach what is ancient and strive to practice what I preach. And I
 claim that what I practise is capable of being practised by all, because  I am a very ordinary mortal open to the same temptations and liable to the same weaknesses as the least among us.
 The success in South Africa was complete according to the standard then aimed at. And what is true of small groups must be true of larger groups with correspondingly larger effort of the same types.
 I have faith enough in my method to be able to prophesy that posterity will consider the years 1920 and 1921 as among the most brilliant in the pages India’s history, and among them the Bardoli ‘somersault’ the most brilliant of all. The Bardoli decision has enabled India to look the world square in the face and to hold up her head. With her creed in the Congress constitution, it was the only correct, bold and honourable course for the nation to take. The battle for swaraj was no camouflage. And if any suffered involuntarily, they suffered because they played with fire.
 The participation in the Khilafat agitation has made both the parties strong and has resulted in a mass awakening which would have otherwise taken ages. If real uniy is to come, it will come only by a due adherence to my teachings. The present Hindu-Muslim feuds and inter-Hindu feuds and even inter-Muslim feuds are a sign of the mass awakening. What we see happening today is nothing but the coming of dirt to the surface in the process of purification. Let the correspondent watch the process going on in a sugar refinery, and he will understand my meaning. This froth in the shape of feuds had come to the surface only to be thrown out in the end.
 I am unaware of the fact that Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviyaji and the other leaders mentioned by the correspondent are disgusted with my political philosophy. Of some at least I know to the contrary. But even if they are disgusted I hope that my faith will stand the strain of the disgust of all friends whose opinion I have learnt to value and cherish.
 The correspondent betrays his ignorance of the Lokamanya when he imputes to him policies which I know he was never guilty of.  I know that there were fundamental differences between us but not what the correspondent imagines. What we should learn from our heroes is not a slavish imitation of their actions which we may not know or understand. We need to assimilate their bravery, their great self-sacrifice, their equally great industry, their love of their country and a steady pursuit of their own ideals. We make fatal blunders when without relevance or without adequate knowledge we copy their
 isolated actions.
 I hold that without the social reforms that I am  advocating,  thank God, in common with many of our distinguished countrymen, Hinduism is in danger of perishing.
 The charkhas is making steady progress in spite of the correspondent’s unbelief. The charkhas work is my contribution to the ocean of labour.
 When I receive addresses from municipalities, I claim to remain untouched by the slaughter in the municipal slaughter houses. On the contrary, their addresses give me an opportunity of preaching my doctrines to them, and I am happy to say that they never resent them and some of them even adopt the suggestions I humbly place before them.

              DEAR 	FRIEND,     AS 	AT THE ASHRAM,  SABARMATI,  December 	15, 1927 
  	I had your letterlibtech_35_footnote. 	I have not any time at my disposal to send you a long message, but 	this I can say.  	The present and the future policy of the Anglo-Indian community 	should be not to strive for recognition as Europeans, but strive to 	make common cause with India’s masses to whom they owe everything. 	The fact of European blood should be treated as a handicap and 	turned to good account not by aping the superficial veneer of 	Europe, but by striving to assimilate the good qualities of the 	Europeans and sharing them with the masses. The attempt on the part 	of some Anglo-Indians to treat themselves as a class apart and wrest 	special privileges will be found in the end to be vain and 	inglorious.  Yours 	sincerely,  LT. 	COL.

 DEAR FRIEND,
 I have secured from Deshbhakta Venkatappayya the names of these Andhra friends who gave proper legal guarantees  for  the moneys advanced by the Khadi Board, now Charkha Sangh, for khadi work. I understand that you are one of these guarantors and that there is difficulty in securing payment from you. I would make a fervent appeal to you to discharge your obligation which is not merely legal but also moral. And we who profess to serve the country are in my opinion more bound by moral obligations even than by those that are merely legal. I therefore hope that you will discharge this obligation as if it was a first charge upon all your assets and induce other friends to discharge their responsibility.

 BALASORE,
 December 16, 1927 You acted very wisely in opening your heart before Jamnalalji, Maganlal and others. A person who has realized his or her own error,
has changed into a new body, why should he or she feel ashamed of
 talking about the old one? Even sin is a disease. Conversely, every disease is a sin. You may feel embarrassment in talking about your mental appendicitis if I feel it in talking about my appendicitis. Yes, of
 
 course, so long as we cling to the disease we shall feel shame, embarrassment and remorse. But, just as the body feels light after the cause of the disease has been expelled with an  operation,  so  too should the mind.

38,,ARTICLES ON COW-PROTECTION,"
  From 	a Gujarati original: C.W. 5011. Courtesy: Tehmina Khambhatta         	Some readers have made a request that articles written by Shri Valji 	Desai on cow-protection, in Gujarati in the Navajivan and in 	English in Young India, may be published in book form. Shri 	Rameshwardas of Dhulia has promised to contribute Rs. 35 towards the 	expense. It is doubtful whether the book would fetch the cost of 	publication; hence it could be published only if other cow lovers 	contribute towards the cost. It is not possible for the Navajivan 	to undertake this venture without others’ help. The funds at 	the disposal of the All-India Cow-protection Association are not 	sufficient to meet the expenses of its constructive activities; 	hence, I do not dare to meet the deficit out of these funds. The 	book will be published immediately if readers send in small 	contributions. If any profit is left over, it will be handed over to 	the  Gorakshamandallibtech_37_footnote. The book will   be brought

         MY 	DEAR THIRUKOOTASUNDARAM,  CUTTACK,  December 	18, 1927 
  	I received your letterlibtech_38_footnotelibtech_39_footnotewhen I was about to finish the Ceylon visit. I could 	not reply to you earlier as your letter was mislaid and therefore 	escaped my attention. I have made full enquiry into the matter and I 	have come to the conclusion that Sjt.  Varadachari  counted the 	purse as soon as it was humanly possible. In rapid tours,  it is not 	possible to count purses in the presence of donors or even during 	the night of the day on which the purses are received. The donors 	give purses only when they have full confidence in  the  integrity 	of the donees and their ability to choose honest  instrumentsfor 	their keep as well as disposal. This is not the first time that the 	purses have been found to contain less than the amounts announced, 	and the deficiencies occur often without any fault of the persons 	who keep the purses before they find themselves into the hands of 	the donees. All the consolation therefore that I can give you is 	that you should not agitate yourself over the deficiency. It means 	no reflection on you, nor should it carry and reflection upon those 	who are associated with me in the conduct of the khadi organization.  	Sjt. Varadachari is one of the most trusted amongst khadi workers 	and I assure you that you have no reason whatsoever to suspect his 	honesty or doubt his diligence. I had not known a more eiligent and 	honest worker in the All-India Spinners’ Association. He tells me 	that he did count the purse at Palamcottah, but you were not 	available after he had counted the purse. There is evidently 	therefore some misunderstanding regarding the date of counting as 	understood by Sjt. Viswanatha Pillay. And if you are still not 	satisfied, you may    
 see me whilst I am in Madras and I shall try to give you a few minutes.

  	I have been able to read carefully the copies of the articles on 	sugar and malaria sent by you only today. Per 	capita = per head  	The bone powder used for cleansing sugar seems to  be  harmless. Not 	a trace of it remains in the sugar. It is thrown out with the 	impurities. lt is not necessary to kill even a single cow for 	obtaining bones for this purpose. This should be regarded as the 	same thing as the use of bones for fertilizers. It is therefore 	wrong on our part to object to it on religious grounds. Sugar worth 	Rs. 18 crore is imported into India. The quantity would have perhaps 	increased now. It is impossible to produce sugar worth Rs. 18 crore 	in India. No one has ruined our sugar industry. We use up all  the  	sugarcane  we produce. The use of sugar has increased 	disproportionately in India as well as in the whole world. . .libtech_41_footnoteWhatever sugar we produce is like a drop in the 	ocean. If you want to ask me more on the subject, please do. Write 	to me if you know more.  	I am sending the copy of the article on malaria to Navajivan. 	There is some mistake in the copy. I constantly think about why we 	have not been able to control malaria in the Ashram but am unable to 	find a solution. I have talked to Kakasaheb. He is carrying on 	correspondence on the subject with Dr. Talwalkar. I feel it is due 	to our fields and the inept method of burying the night-soil of our     
 toilets. Only experiments can ascertain the causes. But how can we conduct the experiments? I intend to give more thought to this on reaching the Ashram. Only God knows how much I will be able to do.
I hope to reach the Ashram before January 1.

         DEAR 	FRIEND,  AS 	AT THE ASHRAM,  SABARMATI,  December 	19, 1927 
  	I have your letter. Of course if you wish to publish your book, 	there is no harm. Perhaps my own experience is that it is better to 	wait for publishing such books till one has obtained greater and 	more accurate experience.  	Your reference to different kinds of asanaslibtech_43_footnoteseem to me to  have been taken from various books. I 	have been in courrespondence with the writers of such books and I 	have found that whatever they have written is not capable of being 	borne out fully either by their own experience or the experience of 	others on whom one can rely. But if you have confidence in what you 	have written, I have no desire to dissuade you from publishing the 	book. If  asana and  pranayamaslibtech_44_footnoteare really efficacious as they are claimed to be, why 	don’t you give them a thorough trial yourself? I intended to do so 	myself but experts themselves dissuaded me owing to my illness.  	I see no inconsistency between advocating brahmacharya and 	widow remarriage at the same time so long as I do not do so in 	connection with the same persons. Whilst I would like all young men 	to be and remain brahmacharis, I did not hesitate to 	advocate, countenance and even officiate at marriages of those who 	find it impossible to practise self-restraint. Of course when I 	advocate the marriage of child widows, I presume that they want the 	pleasure which all animals seek and some human beings only can 	restrain themselves from seeking. Brahamacharya is not a 	thing that can be superim-     
 posed, and it is sinful to compel child widows to remain unmarried.
 If the fallen sisters to whom you refer will not mind marrying a person belonging to any caste, there should be no difficulty and they ought not to object to any caste. My asking them to obseve celibacy, if they cannot secure a proper match, has a meaning. That is to say, if they will restrict themselves to a caste or a province, and yet lead a pure life, naturally they must observe celibacy or they must accept any person of any character.
 You may publish a translation of Self-restraint v. Self-indu- lgence. But please ask the Manager of navajivan before you do so lest he might have given the permission to somebody.
 I do not know what you wrote about Ramakrishna Paramah- amsa. In spite of your information, it would not be wrong to say that he was an embodiment of ahimsa. He believed in that dharma and tried to follow it to the best of his lights. That he did something which to us toda with our fuller epxerience appears to be repugnant to the doctrine of ahimsa, does not take away from the merit of Ramakrishna inasmuch as he could not think out of the custom pravalent around him, so far as  food  was  concerned.  It  is  notlibtech_45_footnotelibtech_46_footnotepossible  that  future generations will condemn the eating of cooked food as contrary to ahimsa and yet the existing authorities of ahimsa will not be liable tocondemnation for not having discovered the inconsistency of eating cooked food. No person is able to practise completest ahimsa. Possession of a material frame involves a certain amount of unavoi- dable himsa. A votary of ahimsa therefore continually strives  to reduce the extent of himsa to a minimum.
 Please tell me if you want me to return the manuscript of your book.

  	God willing, there will be only one more Monday for me to write to 	you.  	I have received Manibehn’s letter. You suggest that I should 	discuss the question of dress in greater detail. I shall not do so 	now, but you may reopen the point when we meet. As long as we retain 	an attraction for fineries in the deepest recesses of our heart, it 	is useless      
 to give up wearing them or adopt any other change just to imitate others who have given them up. But if our infatuation for fineries passes off, and still the mind is drawn towards them, then we should make the necessary outward changes, whether through a sense of shame or by way of imitation of others, and ultimately root out this craving. Infatuation and things like that are our enemies; they harass us so much that we should protect ourselves against them with help secured from every possible quarter. I am writing all this for those who are honest and sincere. The Gita says somewhere that those who deny themselves pleasures and crave for them in their hearts, are foolish and deceitful. This refers to the hypocrite. To those who are really honest and sincere, the Gita says that they should constantly control the passions that agitate them.

WORKERS, CUTTACKlibtech_53_footnote","
  
 December 20, 1927
 I
 The directors should be as vigilant and as jealous of the interests of their concern as the directors of the Bank of England, one of the greatest co-operative corporations in the world. But they have to be even more unselfish than they, inasmuch as the khadi company was not for exploitation, but for service of the poorest in the land. Their ability lay in attention to the most minor details in mastering the science of spinning. It is impossible for them to achieve any result unless they were expert spinners and expert organizers.
 Some of the questions you have asked showed how unpractical you are. Some of you want to know if I would have you put on loin- cloth and to have a particular diet. Well, I have no desire to regulate either your dress or diet. What I want you to do is to realize the spirit of the movement and shape your life accordingly.
 To you who want to serve Orissa I say, make Orissa a khadi depot for the whole of India. And you cannot do so until all the spirit of rivalry goes out and all concentrate on production. There can be no rivalry between khadi and khadi. I can understand your objection to khadi from other provinces, but you should make no distinction between khadi produced in different parts of Orissa. Concentrate on unifying your efforts and co-ordinating your sales.
 I heard the other day some young men talking of the development of agriculture. If someone can prove to me that it is practicable and for the millions we have in view now, and can keep all the impoverished population from poverty and want, I will change my opinion about spinning. But I warn you in the present conditions you will not be successful. I have been working to build a model farm. There are foolish friends to entrust me with money to indulge in experiment, and I squander money on them. I had a talk with the late Sir Ganga Ram and supplied him with all the information about my lands, but he could not present me with a ready-made workable plan
 
 to improve our agriculture. I ask you to go to the villages and bury yourselves there, not as their masters or benefactors, but as their humble servants. Let them know what to do and how to change their modes of living from your daily conduct and way of living. Only feeling will be of no use just like steam which by itself is of no account unless it is kept under proper control when it becomes a mighty force. I aks you to go forth as messengers of God carrying balm for the wounded soul of India.
 II
 Do not be troubled by the question of the disposal of your production. I could, if need be, disengage you from the obligation of selling. Go on producing as much as you can. There cannot be a better field for the production of khaddar than Orissa. Only Orissa can make khaddar a proved proposition. Intuitively of course it was a proved proposition to me in 1908, but you should demonstrate it practically. Show to the world that you cannot exist without khadi. Don’t derive your faith from me, but derive it from yourselves and then refuse to be moved even if Gandhi changes his faith. Show to the people that they must work if they want more food, and the work can be none else than you can give them and on your terms. Remember that you cannot go on indefinitely relying merely on the patriotism of the people. You must produce khadi which is in quality superior to any other cloth.
 I ask you to remember that unless the people understand that khadi is their only salvation, unless they feel that they cannot be without khadi, you cannot succeed. Mind you, I am not conducting this campaign to bring about a boycott of foreign cloth for its own sake. It is a necessary condition of our living, and an incident of our producing our own cloth if we must live.
 Go then to the villages and become villagers. The story that the schoolmaster revealed at Charbatia was an eye-opener. It was a typical village. What a field of operation he has! You can take charge of the village school, make the children flesh of your flesh and bone of your bone and work amongst the villagers through the children. You will enter into their sorrows, ask them why they send their men to those pestilential hovels in Calcutta instead of working for their bread in their own homes. Go and get into their homes, handle their wheels, their carding-bows, show them their defects, see how they live, teach them the elementary principles of sanitation. It is this spinning of a constructive type that can bring swaraj and it is in this land that the charkha can sing its finest music. Make every village self-contained, make every home produce and use its own khadi, and as for the
 surplus khadi, take a written guarantee from me to sell it all if it is of standard quality. Remember that only that worker will be worth his salt who makes the village he lives in self-reliant. The upshot of it all is the personal equation. No learning is necessary, except learning in the school of love. Have we workers honest, true, defiant, and burning with love of the country?
 III
 One word, that I would like to leave with you, doubly afflicted people of this afflicted land, is that you will lose yourselves in the ocean of the submerged humanity about you.  Because it  is submerged, the problem is simple. The way is straight, even though it is narrow. And you must treat it in the right and prayerful spirit. We have been praying here for three days. Prayer brings a peace, a strength and a consolation that nothing else can give. But it must be offered from the heart. When it is not offered from the heart, it is like the beating of a drum, or just the vocal effect of the throat sounds. When it is offered from the heart, it has the power to melt mountains of misery. Those who want are welcome to try its power.

 battled with the calamity with great decision and equally great success. Miss Schlesin has been of late writing to me regularly, and of course  she  is  as  mad  and   as  good   as  ever.   Albertlibtech_58_footnotenever   writes
nowadays. I did however get accounts of him and know that he and
 his are doing very well indeed. Manilal and his wife have been writing to me regularly.
 I am keeping fairly well. Perhaps I shall never regain  the  original health, but I am thankful for whatever strength God has yet left me.
 
 I hope you are getting Young India as also Indian Opinion regularly. If not, please let me know. Prabhudas is now much better. He is at a hill station with his father. The others whom you know are doing well. If you are photographed do send me one. I am sure all at the Ashram who know you and love you well, love to see you in the spirit if they cannot see you in the flesh. I have had a strenuous tour in the south of India including Ceylon as you must have seen. I hope now to reach the Ashram on or before new-year’s day.

 DEAR FRIEND,
 I have your letter. I can quite see that unless you have a living faith in God you cannot get rid of sinful thoughts much less sinful acts. The only way I can commend to you to have that belief is to realize man’s littleness and therefore your own and persist in believing. . .libtech_59_footnoteassuming that there must be a ‘Being’ who is perfect and who is responsible for the wonderful phenomenon, the world.
 I have no capacity to argue with you about the origin of evil. It is enough for me humbly to recognize evil as evil and strive to combat it. For, I know that God in Whom I believe helps me always in the combat. Victory lies in striving. To find honestly a guru and the striving necessitates the living of a pure life.

 DEAR FRIEND,
 I have been unable to deal with your letter earlier. I cannot help feeling that your judgement is warped according to your reasoning that there should be no effort on the part of mankind for self- improvement. A prisoner who is innocently convicted you would say should not try to secure his release. I see no distinction between a helpless innocent girl being given away in bondage to a person whom she has never known and a prisoner. Your arguments seem to be on a par with the first.

  	I have not been able to deal with your letter earlier. I do not 	think you need a scheme so much as proper workers, and since you 	have Miss Gmeiner and Babu Jugal Kishore, I think you cannot do 	better than be guided by them. One mistake I would ask you to guard 	yourself against, namely, making the Widows Home a mere literary 	school where widows will have everything done for them. I should 	give the widows some industrial training and make them self-reliant 	and ultimately self-supporting. I shall also guard against making 	them sectional.  Yours 	sincerely,  PEAREYLALlibtech_61_footnote, ESQ.  NO. 	2, METCALF HOUSE 	ROAD 	DELHI  From 	a microflim: S.N. 12658       	The long deferred Orissa visit has come to fill the bitter cup of 	sorrow and humiliation. It was at Bolgarh, thirty-one miles from the 	nearest railway station, that whilst I was sitting and talking with 	Dinabandhu Andrews on the 11th instant, a man with a half-bent back 	wearing only a dirty loin-cloth came crouching in front of us. He 	picked up a straw and put it in his mouth and then lay flat on his 	face with arms outstretched and then raised himself, folded his 	hands, bowed, took out the straw, arranged it in his hair and was 	about to leave. I was writhing in agony whilst I witnessed the  	scene. Immediately the performance was finished, I shouted for an 	interpreter, asked the friend to come near and began to talk to him. 	He was an untouchable living in a village six miles away, and being 	in Bolgarh for the sale of his load of faggots and having heard of 	me had come to see me. Asked why he should have taken the straw in 	his    
 mouth, he said that was to honour me. I hung my head in shame. The price of honour seemed to me to be too great to bear. My Hindu spirit was deeply wounded. I asked him for a gift. He searched for a copper about his waist. “I do not want your copper, but I want you to give me something better,” I said. “I will give it,” he replied. I had ascertained from him that he drank and ate carrion because it was custom.
 “The gift I want you to give me is a promise never again to take the straw in your mouth for any person on earth, it is beneath man’s dignity to do so; never again to drink because it reduces man to the condition of a beast, and never again to eat carrion, for it is against Hinduism and no civilized person would ever eat carrion.”
 “But my people will excommunicate me, if I do not drink and eat carrion,” the poor man said.
 “Then suffer excommunication and if need be leave the village.”
 This downtrodden humble man made the promise. If he keeps, it, his threefold gift is more precious than the rupees that generous countrymen entrust to my care.
 This untouchability is our greatest shame. The humiliation of it is sinking deeper.
 But this never-to-be-forgotten incident was only part of the shame and sorrow. Never since the days of Champaran  (in  1917)libtech_62_footnotehave I witnessed such death-like quiet as I did on entering political Orissa through Banpur. And I fear that the quiet of Orissa is worse than that of Champaran. There was spirit in the ryots of Champaran after a few days” stay in their midst. I doubt if the Orissa ryot would respond so quickly. I was told that the zamindars, the rajas and the local police had conspired to frighten the ryots out of coming near me. I had begun to flatter myself with the belief that the rajas, the zamindars and the pettiest police officials had ceased to distrust or fear me. The experiences of Orissa have chastened me. Being too weak to go about much, I sent my friends among the people and ascertained the cause. They brought the news that people were told, on pain of punishment, not to come near me or to take part in any demonstration in my honour. Such warnings have been issued before and in other provinces, but they have had little or no effect in normal
 
 times such as these. The ryots in Orissa, however, seemed to me to be living in a perpetual state of fear and liable to be acted upon by the slightest attempt.
 This is a shame both we and the foreign rulers have to share. It is true that the rajas and zamindars and the petty officials are our own kith and kin. But the primary source of fright is in the rulers. Their system is based on ‘frightfulness’. In the name of prestige they have compelled somehow or other the tallest among us to bend low. They have intensified, where they have not created, demoralization. They have known the existence of abject fear among the ryots. But they have done nothing to remove it and the causes, where they have not hugged the condition of things in the alleged interest of their rule. Whilst therefore they may not be directly responsible for the pathetic scenes I witnessed, they cannot be acquitted of a considerable share of responsibility for them.
 But our shame is greater. If we were strong, self-respecting and not susceptible to frightulness, the foreign rulers would have been powerless for mischief. Those only who are susceptible to fear are frightened by others. And it has to be confessed that long before the British advent we were habituated to fear by our own zamindars and rajas. The present rulers have but reduced to a science what was in existence before in a more or less crude share. The workers in Orissa have therefore to teach the ryot to shed the oppressive  nervous timidity bordering on cowardice. And this they will not do by  swearing at the zamindar. the raja or the police officials. These latter become docile and even friendly when they find that the ryot has unlearned the unmanly habit.

61,,NOTHING TOO SMALL,"
  
 A friend sends me for publication a charkha dialogue. I am not printing it as I have discovered no plot about the story, but I gladly publish the following instructive verses the writer has quoted and put into the mouth of a little girl telling her little brother that they should begin to work the charkha for the sake of the poor even though they were youngsters :
 Suppose the little cowslip
 Should hang its golden cup, And say, ‘I’m such a tiny flower,
 ‘I’d better not grow up :’ How many a weary traveller
 Would miss its fragrant smell? How many a little child would grieve
 To lose it from the dell ?
 
 Suppose the glistening dewdrop Upon the grass should say,
 ‘What can a little dewdrop do? ‘I’d better roll away :’
 The blade on which it rested, Before the day was done,
 Without a drop to moisten it, Would wither in the  sun.
 
 Suppose the little breezes, Upon a summer’s day,
 Should think themselves too small to cool The traveller on his way :
 Who would not miss the smallest And softest ones that blow,
 And think they made a great mistake If they were talking so?
 How many deed of kindness A little child may do;
 Although it has so little strength And little wisdom too.
 It wants a loving spirit,
 Much more than strength, to prove How many things a child may do
 For others by his love.
 These beautiful verses apply equally to many of us grown-up people who talk no better than the little children in the imaginary story. We may not excuse ourselves from sacrificial spinning on the flimsy excuse that it is too little to be of use. Not for us thus to argue ourselves into laziness; ours is but to do our little best and leave to God to use it as He wills.

  	I have your letter. You are needlessly worried. I am hopeful that 	health will be restored. But if it does not happen and I remain 	bed-ridden then....  	I began this letter four days ago. Just then the doctorlibtech_65_footnotearrived and it was left there. I now take it up in 	Madras where I arrived today. We shall see about that. For the 	present let us resolve that on the Vasant Panchamilibtech_66_footnoteday you will be entering a new life and shouldering a 	new responsibility in the name of God and with His help.  	Apparently there is nothing wrong with my health. But the 	blood-pressure is very high. There is no doubt of that. All I need 	is rest. It is not also true that I do not observe the rules about 	health which I prescribe for others. But I shall explain this to you 	one day if you ask me.  	Today I wish to write about one point in your previous letter. Why 	should Nimu not do independent work? You know that millions of our 	poor people work like that. We have become sweepers and scavengers! 	What about Ramjibhai and Gangabehn? In countless peasant families 	both husbands and wives earn. In factories both men and women work. 	Here both Anna and his wife Gomatibehn take salaries and also do the 	Hindi work. By following this practice your family life will become 	not difficult but smooth and you will become an ideal couple. 	Thousands of people have children while they work. Yes, it is true. 	that they are not able to live in comfort. But you must ask me for 	further clarification on this point. I wish you to have a happy, 	simple, useful and interesting life. The circumstances are also 	favourable. Everything depends on your education and Nimu’s. I 	wanted to train her but could not manage it. There were obstacles in 	the way. I fell ill and on returning to the Ashram could not cope 	with three obstacles at the same time. But Nimu is herself a good 	girl and hence I am not worried. The only question is how far your 	body will co-operate. I 	shall not write anything more now. Imam Saheb has fallen ill      
 and has come here. I am going to meet him. I hope to reach the Ashram in January or earlier.

	EXHIBITIONS, MADRAS","
  
 December 23, 1927
 Mahatmaji, before declaring the Exhibition open, made a speech in English which was translated into Tamil by Mr. C. Rajagopalachari. He said that it was a great privilege to be called upon to open the exhibitions. He was not physically fit to raise his voice to such a pitch as to be heard by all. He was not going to make a long speech and he was not able, in his present state of health, to address such a large
 
 audience. He need not dwell long on the necessity for khaddar for he was just returning from Utkal where he had seen with his own eyes emachiated men and women on account of starvation. To such people khaddar would do an immense good. If the people present at the meeting has seen those famished people of Utkal they would readily agree with him that khadi was the only thing that could save them from such a low condition. Khadi was a movement in which Tamils and Telugus, and people of the north and south of India could take part without any distinction of caste or creed. A visit to Utkal would make them instinctively support the khadi movement. The khadi exhibition by the side of the industrial exhibition looked like an ant before an elephant. In the bigger exhibition there were both foreign and indigenous articles. In the khadi exhibition they would find only indigenous goods, hand-spun and hand- woven and there was no competition here, the only competition being ‘how shall I serve, how shall I serve best’. In the khadi exhibition they would find goods manufactured by poor men and women and those goods must have given food to a number of poor people. Manchester goods and Indian mill-made goods went to enrich English and Indian capitalists, whereas khaddar provided food for the poorest labourers who had no other means of living. The khadi movement had given food to seventy-five thousand spinners scattered in 2,000 villages and also six thousand weavers lived by weaving khaddar cloth. He had mentioned only spinners and weavers  in connection with the movement and had not taken into consideration others engaged in printing, dyeing, etc., who were benefited by it. In addition to these poor people about one thousand young men belonging to middle-class had also taken up the khadi work. Khadi would also give employment to the unemployed and solve the problem of unemployment among the middle classes which was agitating the minds of many. Khadi would give work to the people of India—Brahmins and Non- Brahmins, Hindus and Mussalmans and the so-called untouchables. Very soon they would go round the stalls to see the exhibits for themselves. When they did so, he would ask them to go round the exhibition with a feeling of sympathy for the poor and to consider what amount of energy and time must have been spent upon those products by the poor people to earn something to keep body and soul together. They would also find that the cost of the khaddar products was much reduced.
 Next to the khadi exhibition, they would find the Hindi exhibition. The Hindi movement was conceived in the interests of millions of Indians. Hindi or Hindustani was spoken by 21 crores of people and it was the mother tongue  of  many  Mussalmans. It was the only language which could be inter-provincial. For some time past attempts had been made to propagate Hindi in South India. The Hindi Prachar Sabha had been instituted and had been giving instruction in Hindi to a large number of people in the Tamil Nadu and Andhra Desha. Many people in those two provinces had learnt Hindi and passed examinations. The Hindi exhibitions was to have been opened by Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya but, he having not arrived, he (Mahatmaji)
 had been asked to open the exhibition. He would ask them to learn Hindi and would inform them that it could be learnt easily. After learning it, they would find it a beautiful language.
 With these words he declared the khadi and Hindi exhibitions open.

75,,THE INDRARAJ SPINNING-WHEEL,"
  
 In the issue of the Khadipatrika dated 1-12-27 Shri Harjivandas Kotak has written an article on the place that khadi occupies in Kashmir. I would recommend the article to all lovers of khadi. Its merit lies in Shri Harjivandas’s personal experience. He has written the article after having observed things for himself during his stay in Kashmir. Three facts become clear from this.
 The 	importance of 	the spinning-wheel, The 	place it still occupies in Kashmir, The 	ruin of 	this invaluable industry 	in Kashmir. 
 We can get proofs of the value of the spinning-wheel in the south in Nagercoil right up to Kanyakumari. We get these right up to Assam in the east and we have now found them as far north as Kashmir. In the west, we find them right up to Kathiawar. I do not mention Karachi in the west because Karachi is a new city and, it is natural that people there being enamoured of wealth do not realize the value of the spinning-wheel—although even there, because of the efforts of such lovers of khadi as the late Shri Ranchhoddas even up to this day, propaganda for the spinning-wheel is being carried on in a
 
 new manner and khadi is being used.
 Shri Harjivandas’s article reveals that the silk produced there (in Kashmir) is not hand-spun. Until this day some of us who are fond of good clothes wore Kashmiri silk under the impression that it was hand-spun; however, it is clear that those who wish to use clothes of only hand-spun cotton, silk or wool must give up the use of Kashmiri silk. One should spin oneself as much as is necessary to prepare what one wishes to wear of the finest stuff; one should get cloth of medium quality spun at the nearest possible place, while inferior cloth could be bought from whatever in an honest dealer sells under the name of hand-woven fabric.

 "
76,,WHAT SHOULD A HINDU WIDOW DO ?,"
  
A gentleman from Ajmer writes in Hindi to say :
I wish you to answer the following questions of mine, in
 Navajivan :
 How should Hindu widows not wishing to remarry spend the rest of their lives?
 Maharshi Dayanand has written to say that they should practise celibacy, educate themselves and also educate young girls.
 Do you agree with this view? If so, keeping in mind the present plight of our country, what would you like to add to this?
 Maharshi Dayanand did not hold that all widows should spend their time in learning and teaching; this could only be by way of an example. In this case teaching means imparting a  knowledge  of letters. This knowledge is necessary to some extent; in my opinion, however, the more important teaching is how to stave off starvation. And every day, I am more firmly convinced that this lies in the spinning-wheel. If we of the middle class who are educated, and who look upon ourselves as belonging to the higher castes give a thought to the condition of the poorer classes, nothing else but the spinning- wheel will occur to us. The spinning-wheel will be plied mainly by women as it is primarily they who have time to spare. Hence I have been crying from the house-tops at various places, day and night, that
 it is through them that we would prevent crores of rupees from being drained out of the country and secure true swaraj—Ramarajyalibtech_76_footnote.
 It is women who can readily approach others of their sex. Here in the Province of Orissa where I happen to write this, and where even the poorer women observe purdah, who can set aside purdah and approach them? I sent Mirabehn who has accompanied me to the women of a certain village. About fifty women surrounded her and became crazy with joy they started asking her about many things and the spinning-wheel came up for discussion. These women were absolutely naive, simple and ignorant. It is innumerable women of this type who should really be educated. Widows with pure character can readily impart such education, serve their own interest and, at the same time, help India solve its problems. Widows who are benevo-lently inclined can easily learn this work and do justice to it. However, an important prior condition for this is that they should be keen  on going to villages and, while living there, should not get impatient. A widow who takes the vow of celibacy is not a helpless, crippled individual. If she is fit for self-realization, she is a strong independent woman capable of protecting herself. Compared with this, the education given to girls today is, I thing, of little consequence. If however a widow refuses to go to the villages, idles away her time or, year after year, runs’ from one place of supposed pilgrimage to another, mistaking this for dharma, it is obviously better if she stayed even in the city and engaged herself in teaching children. She has before her the vast field of nursing the sick. Very few Hindu women take up the profession of nursing. Widows in Maharashtra are found undergoing this training. Outside Maharashtra, very few widows are prepared to undergo this training. However, the jobs that I have suggested should also be regarded only as examples. Every sensible widow who wishes to practise celibacy should seek out some useful activity for herself and devote her whole life to it.

 This Congress, while acknowledging the relief received by the Indian settlers in South Africa and regarding the signing of the Indo- Union Agreement as a token of the desire of the Union Government to Accord better treatment to the Indian settlers, cannot be satisfied till the status of the settlers is brought on par with that of the enfranchised inhabitants of the Union and appeals to the Union Government to consolidate the goodwill created between the two countries  by repealing all class legislation, especially the Colour Bar Act of 1926, the clause in the Liquor Bill of 1927 prohibiting the employment of Indians as waiters in hotels and the Municipal Land Alienation Ordinances or Natal in so far as the latter involve racial segregation.
 This Congress places on record its sense of deep gratitude to Deenabandhu C.F. Andrews for his great and humanitarian work in South Africa and East Africa in connection with the status of the Indian settlers in those countries.

85,,POLITICAL PRISONERS,"
  
 Lala Dunichand of Ambala has sent me a copy of the statement published by him in England about political prisoners who are undergoing incarceration in the various jails of India. The statement contains nothing new for the Indian public and might easily have been fuller and more precise for the purpose intended by the author. In a convering note he administers to me a gentle rebuke for rarely mentioning these prisoners. If the absence of mention of these countrymen of ours means apathy or negligence on my part, the rebuke is well deserved. But I claim that I yield to no one in my desire to see these prisoners released. But the omission to mention these cases is deliberate. I hope that the pages of Young India do  not contain any idle words. Whatever is written in these pages has a definite purpose. Time was when I used to analyse these cases and expose the injustice done in many of them. But that was when I had faith in the British system and when I used to take pride in its ultimate goodness. Having lost that faith, I have lost also the power of making an effective appeal to the administrators of that system. I can  no longer write about British fair play and the British sense of justice. On the contrary, I feel that the administrators are precluded by their  system from dealing out fair play or justice when their system is or seems to them to be in jeopardy. It is still possible, I admit, to secure justice from them when their system is not at stake in any shape or form. But when that system is or is felt by them to be in danger they lose not only their sense of justice and fair play but they lose their balance and no means appear to them to be too dishonourable or despicable for adoption to sustain it. Dyerism and O’Dwyerismlibtech_85_footnotelibtech_86_footnotewere no isolated phenomena. Only I was blind to them before Jallianwala. As a matter of fact, they have been resorted to in all climes and at all times whenever they have felt the need of them.
I  am satisfied that the political prisoners who are  held   under
 restraint with or without trial, decorous or farcical, are so held in the interest of that system. The administrators would far rather discharge a murderer caught red-handed and found guilty of murder committed for private ends than discharge a political prisoner suspected  of designs on their system, especially if he, the suspect, is believed  to
 
 have violent means in view.
 It seems to me therefore to be waste of time and inconsistent with respect to make any appeal to the administrators in behalf of the political prisoners Lala Dunichand has in view. And he has in mind the prisoners of the Gadr party, the Punjab Martial Law prisoners and the Bengal detenus. Nor need we be led astray by solitary discharges like that of Sjt. Subhas Bose. In spite of the agitation that was set on foot he would in all probability not have been discharged if his precarious health had not come to the rescue. Indeed, have they not said in the plainest language possible that they were released purely on grounds of ill health? Has not Earl Wintertonlibtech_87_footnoteflatly declined to release the Bengal detenus in answer to the appeal to create  a favourable atmosphere for their precious Statutory Commission?
 Let those who still have faith in the system by all means make an appeal to the British sense of justice and fair play.
 My course is clear. We have not yet paid anything like adequate price for the freedom we would fain breathe. I therefore regard these imprisonments as only a small part of the price we have to pay if we would have the freedom which is the birthright of man. And we shall have to march as willing victims to the slaughter-house and not helplessly like goats and sheep. We may do this violently or non- violently. The way of violence can only lead us to a blind alley and must cause endless suffering to unwilling ignorant men and women who do not know what freedom is and who have no desire to buy the valuable article. The way of non-violence is the surest and the quickest way to freedom and causes the least suffering and that only to those who are prepared for it, indeed would gladly court it. But suffering, intense, extensive and agonizing, there must be in every case. What we have gone through is but a sample of what is to come.
 Therefore the task before those, who share my views about the inherent evil of the system, is to cease to appeal to the administrators, and ceaselessly and with unquenchable faith in our cause and the means to appeal to the nation. Not until the nation has developed enough strength to open the prison gates, can these prisoners be released with honour and dignity for it and them. Till then let us with becoming patience and courage submit to the imprisonment of the prisoners and ourselves prepare joyfully to share their fate. We shall certainly not hasten the advent of freedom by appealing to deaf ears
 
 for mercy and thus unconsciously inducing in the people a mentality that would dread the prisons and the gallows. Lovers of freedom have to learn to regard these as welcome friends and deliverers.

86,"December 30, 1927",INTERVIEW TO “INDIAN DAILY MAIL”,"
  
 BOMBAY
 December 30, 1927
 In reply to a question by the interviewer as to which of the three draft constitutionslibtech_88_footnotedrawn up by the Madras leaders he considered best suited to India, Mr. Gandhi said that he had no decisive opinion about the future Constitution of India. He, however, added :
The Constitution of India is not a matter for a single individual
to decide.
 Seated in the midst of his friends and disciples, playing the inseparable charkha, Mr. Gandhi politely invited our representative to put questions to him. “What are your impressions of the Madras Session of the Congress?”, was the first question by the interviewer.
ANSWER: The Madras Session was a unique one inasmuch as it
 seems to have laid the foundation of Hindu-Muslim unity. This, I say, not because of the quality of the resolutions, but because  of  the manner in which they were presented and accepted. Pandit Malaviyaji’s happy speech and the still happier response made by Ali Brothers appeared to me to be a good augury for future. I was not present when the scene of Maulana Mahomed Ali in ecstacy falling at Malaviyaji’s feet and Maulana Shaukat Ali fanning him after he had finished his great speech took place; but it was described to me by the President of the Congress. It filled me with great joy and hope. I hope this spirit of cordiality and mutual trust will prove infectious and we shall be able to find such trust amongst the rank and file. Both Dr. Ansari and Mr. S. Aiyengar deserve the gratitude of the nation for this happy event.
 Asked why he was not present when the Independence Resolutionlibtech_89_footnotewas
 
 discussed, Mr. Gandhi said that he was not expected to be present at any of the meetings of the Committee because of his health. It was against the instruction of doctors and against the wishes of his friends that he had gone to Madras which he did only in order to help to the best of his ability Mr. Srinivasa Aiyengar and Dr. Ansari and to be available to them if at all it was necessary. He was not supposed to take any part in the deliberations of the Working Committee, Subjects Committee or even in the open Session. He never attended any of the Committee meetings except one informal meeting and attended the Congress at the opening only for a few minutes.
 Our representative asked: “But is it true that you did not approve of the Independence Resolution?”
ANSWER: That is an open secret. But my disapproval of the
 Independence Resolution is based upon grounds that are not common to those who generally condemn the Independence Resolution. I dealt with the subject last year when the Independence resolution was passed and I have given my reasons for my attitude towards it. Let me, however, guard myself against any possible misunderstanding. I do not for one moment consider that India is not fit for independence, or that she is not ripe for it.
 Our representative next mentioned the deathlibtech_90_footnoteof Hakim Ajmal Khan and Mr.
 Gandhi made the following statement :
 It is a great and grievous loss at this juncture. Hakim Ajmal Khan was one of the truest servants of India and for the cause of Hindu-Muslim unity he was one of the most invaluable men. I can but hope that what we did not do and learn during his lifetime we shall now learn after and by his death. If the accounts that have been published, viz., that Hindus took part in paying respect to the memory of the deceased in just as large numbers as the Mussalmans, are true, it is a very healthy sign and I hope that the spirit of brotherhood and friendliness that has been evoked in Delhi by his death will continue and become permanent and percolate throughout the length and breadth of the land.
 For me the death of Hakimji is a deep personal loss. I entirely associate myself with the appeal issued by Dr. Ansari  and  other leaders that the National Muslim University at Delhi which Hakimji nursed with very delicate care should be placed beyond any risk by patriotic Indians subscribing to the Fund that Hakimji was raising for putting its finances on a firm footing. But, of course, the best monument to be raised to the memory of the great patriot would be to
 
 bring about unbreakable unity between, Hindu, Mussalmans and other communities residing in India.

 CHI. MANILAL AND SUSHILA,
 I got both your letters. I have now returned to the Ashram, and shall know, therefore, what letters arrive. You gave at least one particular in your letter, and that was good. I understand what you say about Sastriji. You can boldly, but courteously, tell him what you may wish to. You have given a good description of your conversation with him.
 I certainly like the idea of closing the Durban  Office.  Personally, I believe that, if the paper does not run on its own merit, we should not be too eager to continue it. If it runs on its own merit, it should without difficulty run even from Phœnix. Do not run it by incurring debts or simply for the sake of running it. In this matter, at any rate, please do accept my advice. If you find it difficult to stay there on this condition, both of you should return here. Do not wait till it is too late.
 You have not replied to what I said about the money you owe to the Ashram. This is to remind you again.
And now to Sushila :
 Your letters are dull. Manilal is justified in saying that, being very busy with work, he cannot write much, but you certainly ought to write. If you have interest in life, you will find much to write about. Sons and daughters fill sheets and sheets when writing to their parents about their happy and unhappy experiences, but your letters contain no more than a few lines. Your physique does not seem yet to have become stronger. If you wish, you may consult some doctor there. Do anything, but get strong. If you wish to return here, discuss the matter between you two. So far as I am concerned, you have my permission. It will also be for you to decide where you will live. You may live either here or at Akola. Think of me not as a father-in-law but as a father. In order that you may be able to do some service, it is also your duty to take care of your body. Do not neglect that duty.
 I saw Nilkanthlibtech_91_footnoteyesterday. He has  returned  from  Japan.  You must have got his letter. Balubhai, too, saw me.
Let me know :
 The time when you get up and the hours of meals. How often and what you eat. The day’s time-table, the contacts you have made there, the expenses, etc. I had the cable signed by four of you.

MY DEAR JAWAHARLAL,
 I feel that you love me too well to resent what I am about to write. In any case I love you too well to restrain my pen when I feel I must write.
 You are going too fast. You should have taken time to think and become acclimatized. Most of the resolutions you framed and got carried could have been delayed for one year. Your plunging into the ‘republican army’ was a hasty step. But I do not mind these acts of yours so much as I mind your encouraging mischief-makers and hooligans. I do not know whether you still believe in unadulterated non-violence. But even if you have altered your views, you could not think that unlicensed and unbridled violence is going to deliver the country. If careful observation of the country in the light of your European experiences convinces you of the error of the current ways and means, by all means enforce your own views, but do please form a disciplined party. You know the Cawnpore experiences. In every struggle bands of men who would submit to discipline are needed. You seem to be overlooking this factor in being careless about your instruments.
 If I can advise you, now that you are the working secretary of the Indian National Congress, it is your duty to devote your whole energy to the central resolution, i.e., Unity, and the important but secondary resolution, i.e., boycott of the  Simon  Commission.libtech_109_footnoteThe Unity resolutionlibtech_110_footnoterequires the use of all you great gifts of organization and persuasion.

98,,IN MEMORIAM,"
       	In the death of Hakim Saheb Ajmal Khan the country has lost one of 	its truest servants. Hakim Saheb’s was a many-sided personality. 	He was not merely an able physician who practised his art as much 	for the rich as for the poor. But he was a courtier patriot. Though 	he passed his time among potentates, he was a thorough- going 	democrat. He was a great Mussalman and equally great Indian. He 	loved equally Hindus and Mussalmans and was in turn equally 	respected and loved by both. Hindu-Muslim unity was the breath of 	his nostrils. His later days were soured because of our dissensions. 	But he never lost faith in his country or his people. He felt that 	both the communities were bound in the end to unite. Having that 	unchangeable faith, he never ceased to work for unity. Though he 	took time, he finally threw in his lot with the non-co-operators and 	did not hesitate to put in peril his fondest and greatest creation, 	the Tibbia College. He loved this College with a passion which only 	those who knew him well could realize. In Hakimji I have lost not 	merely a wise and steadfast co-worker, I have lost a friend on whom 	I could rely in the hour of need. He was my constant guide in the 	matter of Hindu- Muslim unity. His judge- ment, sobriety and 	knowledge of human nature enabled him for the most part to give 	correct decisions. Such a man never dies. Though he is no longer in 	the flesh with us, his spirit shall be ever with us and calls us 	even now to a faithful discharge of our duty. And no memo- rial that 	we can raise to perpetuate his memory can be complete until we have 	achieved real Hindu-Muslim unity. May God grant that we may learn to 	do through his death what we failed to do in his lifetime. But 	Hakimji was no idle dreamer. He believed in realizing his  	dream. As he realized his dream about medicine through the Tibbia 	College, so he sought partially to realize his political dream 	through the Jamia Millia. When this national university was almost 	on the point of dying, he, almost single-handed, carried out a plan 	of removing the institution from Aligarh to Delhi. But the removal 	meant more worry 
 for him. He believed himself hence forward  to  be  specially responsible for the financial stability of the College. He was the principal man to find support for it either from his own pocket or by way of contributions collected from personal friends. The immediate and indispensable memorial that the nation can raise is to put the financial condition of the Jamia on a stable basis. Both Hindus and Mussalmans are and should be equally interested in it. It is one of the four national universities still struggling for existence, the other three being the Bihar, Kashi and Gujarat Vidyapiths. When the Jamia was brought into being Hindus subscribed liberally to it. The national ideal has been kept intact in this Muslim institution. I commend to the attention of the reader the notelibtech_111_footnotelibtech_112_footnoteprepared by Sjt. Ramachandranlibtech_113_footnoteout of his own experience covering over twelve months. In Principal Zakir Husain it has a learned Principal of liberal views and undoubted nationalism. The Principal is ably assisted by a chosen staff some of whom have travelled abroad and possess foreign degrees. The institution has grown since its transfer to Delhi and if it is well supported, it promises rich results. There can be no doubt that it is the duty of those Hindus and Mussalmans who wish to honour  the  memory of Hakim Saheb, who believe in the constructive side of non- co-operation and who believe in Hindu-Muslim unity, to give as much financial assistance as is possible for them to give. Dr. Ansari, Sjt. Srinivasa Aiyengar, Seth Jamnalal Bajaj and Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru have already issued an appeal in this matter. I am now trying through Principal Zakir Husain to find out the exact condition and placing myself in correspondence with Dr. Ansari, and as soon as I have collected enough information, I hope to lay it before the readers. In the mean time I invite subscriptions so as not to lose time. The subscriptions received will not be handed to anyone unless a proper committee is formed and an absolutely  correct  administration  of funds is assured. I do hope that Hindus and Mussalmans swill vie with one another to well the subscription list.

99,,THE NATIONAL CONGRESS,"
  
 UNITY
 The special feature of Dr. Ansari’s speech was its intense hunger for unity. He knew that he was expected to bring it about. And if any single person could do it, it was certainly Dr. Ansari. He accepted the highest honour in the gift of the nation because he had confidence in the nation, the cause and himself. He certainly left no stone unturned to achieve his ambition. Stars favoured him. Sjt. Srinivasa Aiyengar helped him by his very recklessness. No  other  president  would perhaps have dared as he did after the partial failure at Simla. But Sjt. Aiyengar was not the man to shrink. He took Dr. Ansari, the Ali Brothers, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad and others with him and with his accustomed impetuosity carried his resolution. He was not committed to any formula. When the almost fatal flaw in the resolution about the cow and music was pointed out and a substitute submitted, he whole- heartedly, frankly and generously admitted the flaw and accepted the substitute as a great improvement on the original. The Mussalmans present rose to the occasion and, though not without some reluctance and hesitation at first, accepted the substitute without reserve. Pandit Malaviyaji had come with the full intention of accommodating himself to the general wish so far as it was possible for him. He knew and everybody realized that it was within his power to block the way. He did not. True, he had many amendments which he considered were necessary but he was not going to resist the resolution if his amendments could not be carried. Pandit Malaviyaji is probably the oldest Congressman. His loyalty to the Congress is beyond compare. His patriotism is of the highest order. But my Mussalman friends have hitherto always belittled my faith in his bona fides and nationalism as against communalism. I have never been able to suspect either even where I have not been able to share his views on Hindu-Muslim questions. It was, therefore, a great joy to me that the Ali Brothers warmly acclaimed his great speech on the unity resolution. So long as Hindu and Mussalman leaders distrust one another’s  motives, speeches and actions, there can be no real unity in spite of perfect resolutions. Let us hope that the trust generated at the meeting will continue and prove highly infectious. Maulana Mahomed Ali, in his joy over Malaviyaji’s speech, said that the Mussalmans no longer wanted protection of minorities from Earl Winterton for it could be
 better secured by Malaviyaji. If there be one Hindu  who  can guarantee such protection on behalf of Hindus it is Malaviyaji. But whether he can ‘deliver goods’ or not, I would like the Maulana and the other Mussalmans and all minorities once for all to renounce the idea of expecting or getting protection from a third party. It were better, if such protection be not given voluntarily by the majority, to wrest it by force from unwilling hands than that a third party should be invited to intervene and should weaken and humiliate both and hold the nation under bondage. The greatest contribution of the Congress then to me was this apparent change of heart.
 So far as the vast mass of Hindus are concerned, they are interested only in the cow and music resolution. It was wholly bad in its original form. As it has finally emerged from the Subjects Committee and passed, all that can be said for it is that it is innocuous and that it is the best that could be had at this stage of the national evolution. But I for one cannot enthuse over it. I can only tolerate it as passable. Nevertheless it has great possibilities. If the appeal of the Congress penetrates the hearts of Hindus and Mussalmans and if each party spares the feelings of the other in terms of the claims advanced by each, peace is in sight and swaraj within easy grasp. A definite realization of the folly of fratricide and corresponding action will be the best and the most dignified answer to Lord Birkenhead’s insolent flaunting of British might in the nation’s face.
It   is,  therefore,   profitable   to   examine   the   meaning   of the
 Congress appeal. I know what would spare the Hindus’ feeling in the matter of the cow. It is nothing short of complete voluntary stoppage of cow-slaughter by Mussalmans whether for sacrifice or for food. The Hindu dharma will not be satisfied if some tyrant secured by force of arms immunity of the cow from the slaughter. Islam in India cannot make a better gift to the Hindus than this voluntary self-denial. And I know enough of Islam to be able to assert that Islam does not compel cow-slaughter and it does compel its followers to spare and respect to the full the feelings of their neighbours whenever it is humanly possible. For me, music before mosques is not on a par with cow-slaughter. But it has assumed an importance which it would be folly to ignore. It is for the Mussalmans to say what would spare Mussalman feelings. And if complete stoppage of music before mosques will be the only thing that will spare the Mussalman feelings, it is the duty of the Hindus to do so without a moment’s thought. If
 we are to reach unity of hearts, we must each be prepared to perform an adequate measure of sacrifice.
 If this much-to-be-desired consummation is to be reached, Dr. Ansari will have to send out peace parties with definite instructions to preach the message and secure for it the approval of the masses. Have we sufficient energy for the mission, have we enough  honest, industrious and willing missionaries? Let us hope.
 IRRESPONSIBILITY
 Though I was not able to attend any of the Committee meet- ings, I could not fail to perceive that irresponsible talk and work were the order of the day. Indiscipline was not a rare feature. Resolutions involving great consequences were sprung upon the Subjects Com- mittee and readily accepted by that august body without much thought or discussion. The Independence Resolutionlibtech_114_footnotethat was rejected last year was passed almost without opposition. I know that its wording was harmless but, in my humble opinion, it was hastily conceived and thoughtlessly passed. I hope to deal with this resolution separately in an early issue.libtech_115_footnote
 The boycott of British goods resolution was passed with an equally light heart. The Congress stultifies itself by repeating year after year resolutions of this character when it knows that it is not capable of carrying them into effect. By passing such resolutions we make an exhibition of our impotence, become the laughing-stock of critics and invite the contempt of the adversary.
 Let me not be misunderstood. The Congress has a perfect right to boycott British goods if it so wishes. But as the most representative assembly in India, it has no right to expose itself to ridicule by using threats which it cannot carry into effect. I have singled out but two out of the several irresponsible resolutions passed by the Congress.
 The conception behind the Congress constitution was to make it the most representative and authoritative body in all India, and by its commanding voluntary obedience on the part of millions, automa- tically, almost imperceptibly to replace the sham enslaving assemblies and councils and other foreign machinery masquerading under the name of representative bodies. But the Congress cannot become the irresistible force it was and is intended to be, if its resolutions are ill- conceived and are to remain merely paper resolutions having no
 
 response from the people or having no correspondence to the popular wants and aspirations and if the members are not to observe the rules of discipline, decorum and common honesty. If they only knew, if they would regard themselves as servants of the nation, the members of the All-India Congress Committee have the rights and opportunities of service equal to those of the members of any parliament in the world. But at the present moment, we have almost sunk to the level of the schoolboys’ debating society.
 The Working Committee is the national cabinet. It has to enforce the resolutions of the Congress and the All-India Congress Com- mittee. It must, therefore, be the body responsible for bringing before the A.I.C.C. resolutions required for the attainment of the Congress goal. Any non-official resolutions sprung upon the A.I.C.C. must be carefully scrutinized and should have but a remote chance of passing, if opposed by the Working Committee. Every resolution, official or unofficial, must have behind it a working plan. When, therefore, an unofficial resolution is brought forward, the sponsor must be prepared to disclose his plan of action if his proposal is to be accepted. A resolution proposing the establishment in every village of a free night school for its adult population has  everything to commend itself to a body like the Congress. But if the proposer has no definite feasible plan of action behind it, the A.I.C.C. would be justified and bound to reject it summarily. If then the Congress is to retain its prestige and usefulness, the members of the A.I.C.C. will have to revise their attitude and realize their great responsibility.
 THE ELEPHANT AND THE ANT
 In my humble opinion, the Reception Committee of the Congress at Madras committed a grave blunder by permitting and countenancing the so-called All-India Exhibition under its aegis. That it received Government patronage and imprimatur adds nothing to its merit, if it does not rob it of what little merit it otherwise might have had. The Congress long ago outlived Government favours and frowns. The ideals for which the Congress has been working since, say, 1918, to go no further back, were almost all ignored in the plan of this Exhibition. Let me point out what the All-India Exhibition contained. Among the pavilions were several assigned to foreign firms for exhibiting their wares, one assigned to machinery and mechanical contrivances, some to textiles containing foreign yarn, others  to foreign clocks and watches. There was little of swadeshi, much of
 foreign and British goods about the Exhibition, and this in the name of and under the patronage of a Congress which promulgates the gospel of swadeshi and which has on its programme a boycott of British goods! There was hardly anything to interest or instruct the villagers. The Exhibition represented not the rural civilization of India, but the exploiting city civilization of the West. It was a denial of the Congress spirit and was in marked contrast to the khadi and swadeshi exhibitions of the past six years. The textile court seemed to have been designed to ridicule khadi although the Congress  still retains the khadi franchise and lends its name to the activities of the All-India Spinners’ Association. As if the visitors were to be all English, all the notices were printed in English. Here is one designed to belittle khadi.
 Feed the poor and work the able. Let the charkha spin the weft And the mill the warp.
 In this combination lies the solution
 Unless the author of this notice has a deliberately mischievous intention, he has demonstrated his ignorance of the  evolution  of khadi. The fallacy of charkha weft and mill warp has been often exposed and refuted in these columns. Suffice it here to say that the charkha would have died a well-deserved death if the policy of using charkha yarn for weft only had long continued.  Experience  has shown that the combination was bad in every respect.
Here is another equally, if not more, mischievous poster :
 To force a weaver to use hand-spun warp yarn
 Is like forcing him to fight a battleship with a knife. To cut a weaver off from best methods of work
 Is like cutting off his thumbs.
 This poster betrays venomous prejudice against khadi and ignorance of the art of weaving and the condition of weavers. The writer forgets that all the world over, a time was when weavers took delight in using hand-spun yarn both for weft and warp and that the art then exhibited by the weaver has never yet been excelled. The writer could easily have corrected himself by visiting the khadi court outside the precious All-India Exhibition court. He would there have seen weavers actually working fairy tales on hand-spun warp with the same ease and facility that they would have with mill-spun yarn. It is easy of proof that, whereas mill-spun yarn must in time—not far off—
 kill out the weaver, hand-spun yarn must revive and is reviving the weaver and has already rescued some of them from the butcher’s trade and closet-cleaning work. Every ten hand-spinners mean an addition of one whole-time weaver, one whole-time carder, not to mention more work for dhobis, tailors, carpenters, blacksmiths, dyers, printers, etc.
 The coming into being of this foreign and anti-India-spirit exhibition under the Congress aegis is an ocular and forcible demonstration of the irresponsibility to which I have already adverted.  I do not think any Congressman deliberately countenanced this white elephant. Want of thought, want of care, want of responsibility are answerable for—I cannot help calling—this scandalous creation.
 There was no doubt the ant of the Khadi Exhibition was happily thrown outside the elephant court. Rumour has it that the Madras Government would not have a Khadi Exhibition inside the all-india court. It certainly suited me. For, having gained a knowledge of what this all-india exhibition was, I would have found it difficult, if not impossible, even for opening the Khadi Exhibition to enter what was chiefly a foreign court—a reminder of national humiliation. The Khadi Exhibition on the other hand was, though like an ant, a work of indigenous art. It was a school for study and demonstration of the potency of khadi. There was beside it an Indian fine arts court, a result of the devoted labours of Dr. J. H. Cousins. No doubt there were a few other things purely Indian or a result of Indian enterprise in the so- called All-India Exhibition. But they only served to entrap the unwary and as a shield for the predominant foreign show.
Let future Reception Committees beware.

100,,A CALL TO INDIA’S POETESS,"
  
 Shrimati Sarojini Devi has received a calllibtech_116_footnotelibtech_117_footnotefrom America chiefly for the purpose of undoing the mischief created by Miss Mayo’s untruthful and libellous production. No writing undertaken in India can possibly overtake the mischief done by that sensation-monger who has the ear of a gullible public—hungering for and living on sensation. No serious American can possibly be taken in by Miss Mayo’s scurrilous writings. The seriously-minded American does  not
 
 need any refutation. And the general public that has been already affected by Mother India will never read the refutations, however brilliant, attempted in India. The idea, therefore, has been happily conceived in America of bringing out Sarojini Devi on a lecturing tour by way of reply to Mother India. If Sarojini Devi would respond to the invitation, her visit is likely to undo some at least of the mischief wrought by Miss Mayo’s novel. That the Poetess would draw crowds wherever she goes and command a patient and respectful hearing need not be doubted. She is as sure by the magic of her eloquence to captivate American imagination as she captivated South African and paved the way for the Round Table Conference, and finally for the great work that the Right Honourable Srinivasa Sastri is doing in South Africa. Let us hope that the way would be clear for her to accept the invitation and that Dr. Ansari would be able to spare her for the foreign mission that seems to call this gifted daughter of India.

 You must have received my letter sent with Jamnalalji. I had also sent a telegram asking you not to attend the Assembly till your health returned to normal. I wanted to mention this to the pujya Malaviyaji but we were so busy with other things that I did not remember you. I see no need of writing to him now. You must have sent the money to Jamnalalji? I have not yet heard about it.
 The pujya Malaviyaji’s speech had a magic effect and he proposes to make a mighty effort in this matter. Let us see what happens. Up to the end of March, I shall be at the Ashram itself. On the 17th I shall have to leave for Kathiawar on a five days’ tour.libtech_118_footnote

107,"January 	7, 1928","DISCOURSES ON THE
“GITA”libtech_125_footnote","
       January 	7, 1928  	This chapterlibtech_126_footnoteis 	as sweet as the manner in which  it  has  been sung. It is balm for 	people like us who suffer from inner torments. We are all troubled 	by evil desires, and the Lord holds out an assurance here to all 	those who seek refuge in Him that He will free them from such 	desires. We can also see from this chapter that at the time when the 	Gita was composed, distinctions of high and low had already 	made their appearance in the varnashrama system and some had come to 	be regarded as lower than others. In truth, however, can we describe 	anyone as higher or lower than others? Let him who is completely 	free from evil desires point an accusing finger at another. All of 	us are equal in this regard, and this chapter points out the 	unfailing means of winning-freedom from evil cravings, namely, total 	surrender  to   the      
 Lord. We should not of course conclude from this that such surrender will by itself, without further effort on our part, purify us of our evil. If a person who is dragged by his senses, against his will, to objects of pleasures turns to God for help, with tears in his eyes, as he ceaselessly struggles against them, the Lord will certainly free him from the evil desires which trouble him.
 Another thought also arises out of it, but we shall consider it tomorrow.
 That thought is that this also explains the means of expiation of one’s sins. Such expiation consists not in fasting, but in bhakti, in self- surrender. I fully understand the usefulness of fasting but there are also limits to it. Fasting can never expiate a sin; it  may,  on  the contrary, serve to cover it up. A sinner is one who has committed a sin, but papayoni means one born of sin itself and therefore the most wicked of all sinners. We cannot say to whom this notion  first occurred, but everyone is assured of freedom through total surrender to the Lord. Expiation of sin consists in bhakti. Fasting may seem necessary sometimes as a means of filling the heart with bhakti, and everyone may decide for himself when it is so. The real means, however, is bhakti, and bhakti means reducing oneself to a cipher, erasing the ‘I’. If we can do this, no matter how many our sins in the past, they will not stand in the way of our freedom. The thoroughly wicked mentioned in this chapter are none else but ourselves. We, who commit all manner of sins in our hearts and move in the world as respectable people, are sinners, all of us, and in this chapter the Lord holds out an assurance to us.
 Chapter XIV contains a description of the three gunas and Chapter XV a description of  Purushottamalibtech_127_footnote. Thirty years ago I read Drummond’slibtech_128_footnotebook in which he had established by means of several examples that the rules of the material world apply to the spiritual world also. We see it proved in this world which is made of the three gunas. There are not three gunas but many; those three are the major divisions of the many. He who transcends those three becomes one with Purushottama. None has been born in this world who could exist with only one guna. Even if a man possesses a high degree of the sattvik guna, the latter still includes something of the gunas of tamas

 and rajas. The example of water occurs to me. In the form of ice, it remains like a stone. But when it boils and becomes steam, it rises in the sky. As ice it lacks the capacity to rise, but as steam, it ascends higher and higher. Its highest power appears in the form of steam. And finally, ceasing to be steam, it becomes a cloud and benefits the world in the form of rain. However, if steam becomes ice, it lies dead and still. Ice too has its uses. Melted ice flows in the form of rivers. It also causes floods but we are not concerned with that. It is a proven fact that without the sun, even water cannot turn into steam. But that shows that it cannot do without someone else’s help. The long and short of what I want to say is that steam points to a state of moksha. It benefits the world in its state of moksha. This is how we should understand the meaning of these two chapters.

 The suggestions put forward in both these letters may be freely utilized in treating many ailments.

It can certainly be applied in this manner on the lower part of the abdomen and those who do not benefit by using a pack of mud wrapped up in cloth may certainly place it directly over the skin. Even at present, I am experimenting with mud in ordinary cases and am getting good results. This remedy is so simple, inexpensive and so easy that everyone could make use of it within limits. True, the treatment of placing mud on the abdomen can be carried out only on an empty stomach. One should also remember that the mud should always be taken from a clean place. Ice is used for headache or fever; in such cases, mud is  generally more efficacious than ice.

  	I was delighted to hear from you. I have often wondered why you had 	been silent. You must take care of yourself and preserve the body 	for future use. I am keeping well enough for the work. The reports 	were exaggerated.  	Do please come to the Ashram as to your own home and stay as long as 	you like. You will tell me what conveniences you will need in the 	interest of your health. The weather just now is cold, dry and good. As 	for the help for khadi work please continue to knock at the     
 door of the A.I.S.A. You know that I am not exercising administrative control for reasons of health. You have therefore to convince Sheth Jamnalalji and Sjt. Shankerlal Banker. I shall speak to them. Of course the financiers of the A.I.S.A. are not over-flourishing. What I collected in Karnataka and Tamil Nad has to be spent mostly in those provinces.

 BHAISHRI NAJUKLAL,
 It is good that you have started the mud-pack treatment. After moistening the earth once, you need not do it again. If the pack dries up and if it is still necessary to continue the application, you may prepare another pack. If the pack is about an inch thick, it does not dry up. A pack applied on the stomach at night remains damp the whole night. One applied on the head during the noon is likely to dry up. Never put a pack on the stomach during the day, because the process of digestion is going on then. My experience about fragrant, i.e., clean red earth is good, but you may use black earth if you can get only that. The only thing is that it should be clean.
 You should be careful about two things only as regards blood- pressure. You should not overwork either physically or mentally, and the motion must always be clear. If you do not have a clear motion every day, take an enema or a laxative. Never strain. Eat very light food. One need not worry about blood-pressure at all, if there is no other complaint. Since, however, you have had an attack of paralysis, you should certainly be careful. In addition to what you are doing, you may certainly take the injections, if advised by the doctor, since they have helped you. The headache should certainly be cured by the mud-pack. Even for this purpose, however, the stomach should be light.
 Prabodh seems to be a very fine boy. May God fulfil all our hopes about him.

122,"January 12, 1928","SPEECH AT PRAYER
MEETING, SABARMATIlibtech_149_footnote","
  
 [Before January 12, 1928] I have to give you this evening an instance of a folly of which  three of us have an equal share. Or rather my share is the biggest
 inasmuch as I, as the head of the Ashram, am expected to be much
 more vigilant than anyone of you.
 Mnay of us could not imagine what this would be. But he narrated it in vivid and, as he is wont to describe his mistakes, in exaggerated detail. Those who have seen Gandhiji’s room in the Ashram will remember that between the wall which faces the river and the roof there is a piece of lattice work. It is meant for ventilation, but it also lets in the sun’s rays straight on Gandhiji’s face. So he asked one of us to put something there as a screen. This friend asked another who immediately brought in the carpenter with a board. He naturally thought a shutter would be better than a screen, and asked if Gandhiji would like it. Gandhiji agreed, but soon after the carpenter began his work, he seemed to have perceived that he had not done the right thing. . . .
Now this is not what we who are pledged to poverty may do. It
 ought to have occurred to me that a piece of cardboard or a piece of cloth would serve as well as this shutter which costs a couple of rupees and three hours’ labour for the carpenter. The cardboard or the piece of old cloth would have cost nothing and anyone could have fixed it there with a couple of nails. It is in these simple little things that our creed is tested. The Kingdom of Heaven is for those who are poor in spirit. Let us therefore learn at every step to reduce our needs and wants to the terms of the poor and try to be truly poor in spirit.

  [Before 	January 12, 1928]  	Well, I do not remember the exact words of the song. But no one can 	forget the substance of the song. It is not only the music, but the 	substance that has been haunting me the whole day. You do not come 	to prayer to listen to music, or to admire this man’s or  that     
 man’s voice, but in order that you may carry with you for the day something from what you hear to guide and inspire you in all your actions. If we do not do so, all our prayers would be like sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal. What a great song was today’s! Kabir, in his homely telling way, has described the treasures of the humble.

124,"January 12, 1928",SPEECH ON FORGIVENESSlibtech_151_footnote,"
       SABARMATI, 
  	[Before January 12, 1928] This 	talk of passive non-resistance has been the bane of our national 	life. Forgiveness is a quality of the soul, and therefore a  	positive quality. It is not negative. “Conquer anger,” says Lord 	Buddha, “by non-anger.” But what is that “non-anger”? It is 	a positive quality and means the supreme virtue of charity or love. 	You must be roused to this supreme virtue which must express itself 	in your going to the angry man, ascertaining from him the cause of 	his anger, making amends if you have given any cause for offence and 	then bringing home to him the error of his way and convincing him 	that it is wrong to be provoked. This consciousness of the quality 	of the soul, and deliberate exercise of it, elevate not only the man 	but the surrounding atmosphere. Of course, only he who has that love 	will exercise it. This love can certainly be cultivated by incessant 	striving.  Young 	India, 12-1-1928    "
125,,"INDEPENDENCE v.
SWARAJ","
  
 It is said that the Independence Resolution is a fitting answer to Lord Birkenhead. If this be a serious contention, we have little notion of the answer that we should make to the appointment of the Statutory Commission and the circumstances attending the announcement of the appointment. The act of appointment needs, for an answer, not speeches, however heroic they may be, not declarations, however brave they may be, but corresponding action adequate to the act of the British Minister, his colleagues and his followers. Supposing the Congress had passed no resolution whatsoever, but had just made a bonfire of every yard of foreign cloth in its possession, and induced a like performance on the part of the whole nation, it would have been some answer, though hardly adequate, to what the act of appointment means. If the Congress could have brought about a strike of every Government employee beginning with the Chief Judges and ending with the petty peons, not excluding soldiers, that act would have been a fairly adequate answer. It would certainly have disturbed the comfortable equanimity with which the British ministers and those concerned are looking upon all our heroics.
 It may be said this is merely a counsel of perfection which I should know is not capable of execution. I do not hold that view. Many Indians who are not speaking today are undoubtedly preparing in their own manner for the happy day when every Indian, now sustaining the system of Government which holds the nation in bondage, will leave the denationalizing service. It is contended that it is courage, it is undoubtedly wisdom, to restrain the tongue whilst one is unprepared for action. Mere brave speech without action is letting off useless steam. And the strongest speech shed its bravery when, in 1920, patriots learnt to court imprisonment for strong  speeches. Speech is necessary for those who are dumbstruck. Restraint is necessary for the garrulous. The English administrators chaff us for our speech and occasionally betray by their acts their contempt of our speeches and thereby tell us more effecti-vely than by words: ‘Act if you dare.’ Till we can take up the challenge, every single threatening speech or gesture of ours is, in my opinion, a humiliation, and admission of impotence. I have seen prisoners in chains spitting forth oaths only to provide mirth for their jailors.
Moreover, has independence suddenly become a goal in answer
 to something offensive that some Englishman has done? Do men conceive their goals in order to oblige people or to resent their action? I submit that, if it is a goal, it must be declared and  pursued irrespective of the acts or threats of others.
 Let us, therefore, understand what we mean by indepen- dence. England, Russia, Spain, Italy, Turkey, Chile, Bhutan have all their independence. Which independence do we want? I must not  be accused of begging the question. For, if I were told that it is Indian independence that is desired, it is possible to show that no two persons will give the same definition. The fact of the matter is that we do not know our distant goal. It will be determined not by our definitions but by our acts, voluntary and involuntary. If we are wise, we will take care of the present and the future will take care of itself. God has given us only a limited sphere of action and a limited vision. Sufficient unto the day is the good thereof.
 I submit that swaraj is an all-satisfying goal for all time. We the English-educated Indians often unconsciously make the terrible mistake of thinking that the microscopic minority of English- speaking Indians is the whole of India. I defy anyone to give for independence a common Indian word intelligible to the masses. Our goal at any rate may be known by an indigenous word understood of the three hundred millions. And we have such a word in ‘swaraj’ first used in the name of the nation by Dadabhai Naoroji.libtech_152_footnotelibtech_153_footnoteIt is infinitely greater than and includes independence. It is a vital word. It has been sanctified by the noble sacrifices of thousands of Indians. It is a word which, if it has not penetrated the remotest corner of India, has at least got the largest currency of any similar word. It is a sacrilege  to displace that word by a foreign importation of doubtful value. This Independence Resolution is perhaps the final reason for conducting Congress proceedings in Hindustani and that alone. No tragedy like that of the Independence Resolution would then have been possible. The most valiant speakers would then have ornamented the native meaning of the word ‘swaraj’ and attempted all kinds of definitions, glorious and inglorious. Would that the independents would profit by their experience and resolve henceforth to work among the masses for whom they desire freedom and taboo English speech in its entirety in so far as mass meetings such as the Congress are concerned.
 
 Personally, I crave not for ‘independence’, which I do not understand, but I long for freedom from the English yoke. I would pay any price for it. I would accept chaos in exchange for it. For the English peace is the peace of the grave. Anything would be better than this living death of a whole people. This Satanic has well-nigh ruined this fair land materially, morally and spiritually. I daily see its law-courts denying justice and murdering truth. I have just come from terrorized Orissa. This rule is using my own countrymen for its sinful sustenance. I have a number of affidavits swearing that, in the district of Khurda, acknowledgments of enhancement of revenue are being forced from the people practically at the point of the bayonet. The unparalleled extravagance of this rule has demented the Rajas and the Maharajas who, unmindful of consequences, ape it and grind their subjects to dust. In order to protect its immoral commerce, this rule regards no means too mean, and in order to keep three hundred millions under the heels of a hundred thousand, it carries a military expenditure which is keeping millions in a state of semi-starvation and polluting thousands of mouths with intoxicating liquor.
 But my creed is non-violence under all circumstances. My method is conversion, not coercion; it is self-suffering, not the suffering of the tyrant. I know that method to be infallible. I know that a whole people can adopt it without accepting it as its creed and without understanding its philosophy. People generally do not understand the philosophy of all their acts. My ambition is much higher than independence. Through the deliverance of India, I seek to deliver the so-called weaker races of the earth from the crushing heels of Western exploitation in which England is the greatest partner. If India converts, as it can convert, Englishmen, it can become the predominant partner in a world commonwealth of which England can have the privilege of becoming a partner if she chooses. India has the right, if she only knew, of becoming the predominant partner by reason of her numbers, geographical position and culture inherited for ages. This is big talk, I know. For a fallen India to aspire to move the world and protect weaker races is seemingly an impertinence. But in explaining my strong opposition to this cry for independence, I can no longer hide the light under a bushel. Mine is an ambition worth living for and worth dying for. In no case do I want to reconcile myself to a state lower than the best for fear of consequences. It is, therefore, not out of expedience that I oppose independence as my goal. I want India to come to her own and that state cannot be better
 defined by any single word than ‘swaraj’. Its content will vary with the action that the nation is able to put forth at a given moment. India’s coming to her own will mean every nation doing likewise.

126,,TAKING UNLAWFUL LIBERTY,"
  
A Sindhi friend writes :
 I am enclosing herewith a cutting from the Sind Observer of Karachi wherein you will find your name among others used in support of medicines sought to be popularized and sold through the medium of such advertisements.
 I can hardly believe you could have spoken or written appreciatively of the medicines, mixtures, pills or potions of the pharmacy in question.
 I hope you would write in Young India about this matter.
 I have seen the advertisement too. It is taking an unlawful liberty with my name and, I doubt not, the names of other leaders. It is remarkable the freedom these pharmacies take in order to find custom for their wretched traffic. In my opinion this use of names of persons without their permission is an illegality punishable in law. Since, as a non-co-operator, I may not seek the protection of the law, I must be satisfied with warning the public against being misled by the use of my name in connection with any drug whatsoever. My disbelief in drugs in general is as strong as ever notwithstanding the very limited use by me in recent times of one or two comparatively harmless and well- known opening drugs and quinine. I have no desire to see pharmacies multiplied in this country, I would rather see people freed from the slavery of drugs.

127,,MADRAS KHADI EXHIBITION,"
  
 Mr. Polak being in Madras during the Congress Week, I invited him to visit the Khadi Exhibition and give me his criticism. He has now sent me a letter from which I take the following extract libtech_154_footnote:
 Though the criticism is not a considered opinion it will be useful to the organizers of future exhibitions. I do not share the view that educated Indians will not patronize khadi unless they have it supplied
 
 to them on the same terms as machine-made cloth as to price, quality, durability, etc. Whilst they do expect a particular standard to satisfy their artistic taste, they are gladly paying extra cost, and are by no means insistent on equality with machine-made cloth in point of quality.
 The knowledge that khadi supports the poorest of the land who would otherwise be without such support is a great determining factor with the educated and well-to-do classes in buying khadi. But that of course is no reason for khadi producers to be remiss in their attempt to improve the quality. Indeed the advance made in this direction is highly encouraging. The workers are not going to be contented with anything less than the excellence that khadi had when there was no machine-made cloth and which no machine has been yet able even to equal.

 DEAR BROTHER,
 Seeing your letter I  should  neither  answer  it  nor  go  there. But I cannot help replying. We are both stubborn. We would both consider each   other   obstinate.   Your   obstinacy   lies   in   writing to Gujaratis in English. I am obstinate in writing to Gujaratis in Gujarati. In the case of one of us the obstinacy will be justified.Shall we ask the poet Nanalal to judge? If not, I am willing to make
 
 Saraladevi the judge, provided she does not show partiality. I would certainly like to come to your place on Sunday. I am sure I am still the same as I was in 1915. Even then, though I used to be hard pressed for time, people dear to me did take my time by stealing or snatching it, and I let them do so. Even today  they  have  not abandoned their ways and I am not able to go against them. What else can a non-violent man do? Hence, even though, mercifully, there is no illness in your family and even though to a Mahatma an occasion like Saraladevi’s birthday is of no importance, I would come if I could manage it. I do not know what I would be having to eat, though I would certainly lose some time. But I am really sorry. Some twenty men and women belonging to the International Fellowship are starting their work in the Ashram from tomorrow. Sunday is the last day for them. So as soon as I return from my visit to the Vidyapith, I have to present myself among them. What can I do now? I have suggested that you should invite all of them one evening and call a few   friends.libtech_159_footnoteSurely, I can take that much liberty with you? But if this is in convenient I would not wish you to do it. The letter about your small car was also being despatched, but your letter came in the meantime and so I am sending that letter along too.

CHI. MANILAL AND SUSHILA,
I got your letters.
 Only today I had a letter from Akola which gives the news of Sushila’s miscarriage. Manilal has written neither to Ba nor me about it. There should be no shyness or hesitation in writing to me about such matters. It will not help you to keep back such things from me
 
 
 because of my views about them. In any case, I would come to know about the thing indirectly. I might feel hurt for a moment. People may hold the same views as I do about this matter and yet not be able to refrain from indulgence. If they could, would they ever marry? The wish to marry comes from the desire for self-gratification. Our rishis, however, tried to make marriage a means of learning self-restraint, or say that regulated through marriage a relationship which was unregulated. But man is more inclined towards self-gratification and he turned marriage also into another means of self-gratification. However, from a couple like you I can expect nothing more than that you should remain vigilant and constantly strive for  self-control. There is, therefore, no need for you to keep me ignorant about the fruits of marriage.
 Sushila must be better now. If after a miscarriage proper treatment is taken, its harmful effects can be controlled. You may trust me that one such treatment, and a very effective one, is the Kuhne Bath. It removes the cause of miscarriage and makes future deliveries easier and less painful. Sushila should have plain food and regular sleep, and should keep away from things that excite the  body.  I should like both of you to read Kuhne’s book, as also Juste’s. Dr. John Nicholson’s book, too, is worth reading.
 The Ashram has started filling up and in two days it will be full. Nearly thirty persons are coming. Among them there will be twelve to fifteen Europeans too. Ramdas arrived today. Rami, Manu came yesterday. Devdas is still in Bombay taking treatment for one of his bones.
 I do not know why you did not get the chapters of the Gita. I have finished the translation. I will tell Mahadev.

 [Before January 15, 1928]
 In order to attain a perfect fellowship, every act of its members must be a religious act and an act of sacrifice. I came to  the conclusion long ago, after prayerful search and study and discussion with as many people as I could meet, that all religions were true and also that all had some error in them, and that whilst I hold by my own,  I should hold others as dear as Hinduism, from which it logically follows that we should hold all as dear as our nearest kith and kin and that we should make no distinction between them. So we can only pray, if we are Hindus, not that a Christian should become a Hindu, or if we are mussalmans, not that a Hindu or a Christian should become a Mussalman, nor should we even secretly pray that anyone should be converted, but our inmost prayer should be that a Hindu should be a better Hindu, a Muslim a better Muslim and a Christian a better Christian. That is the fundamental truth of fellowship. That is the meaning of the wonderful passion, the story of which Andrews read out to you, of the song and verses that Khare, Shastri and Imam Saheb recited. If Andrews invited them to give their song and verses for mere courtesy or by way of patronizing toleration, he was false to the fellowship. In that case, he should not have done so, but I have known Charlie Andrews too well, and I know that he has given the same love to others as he has for his own, and thereby broadened  his Christianity, as I broaden my Hinduism by loving other religions as my own. If however there is any suspicion in your minds that only one religion can be true and others false, you must reject the doctrine of fellowship placed before you. Then we would have a continuous process of exclusion and found our fellowship on an exclusive basis.
 
 frank exchange of views ultimately bound to establish a  better understanding. .  .  .
 There was no difference of opinion as to the object of all to work for the widest toleration, to combine and side with the forces of light against the forces of darkness, or as Deenabandhu Andrews said, those who blankly leave God out and become materialists. Everyone seemed to be agreed on this, but many seemed to run away from what would appear to be the necessary corollary of the proposition. This was defined by Gandhiji at some length at this and other meetings. ”
 
 Above all I plead for utter truthfulness. If we do not feel for other religions as we feel for our own, we had better disband ourselves, for we do not want a wishy-washy toleration. My doctrine of toleration does not include toleration of evil, though it does the toleration of the evil-minded. It does not therefore mean that you have to invite each and every one who is evil-minded or tolerate a false faith. By a true faith I mean one the sum total of whose energy is for the good of its adherents, by a false I mean that which is predominantly false. If you, therefore, feel that the sum total of Hinduism has been bad for the Hindus and the world, you must reject it as a false faith.
 Gandhiji’s insistence on a member of the fellowship not  even  secretly wishing that a member of another faith should be converted to his own led to a general discussion on the question of conversion. Gandhiji again defined his position more clearly than before :
I would not only not try to convert but would not even secretly
 pray that anyone should embrace my faith. My prayer would always be that Imam Saheb should be a better Mussalman, or become the best he can. Hinduism with its message of ahimsa is to me  the  most glorious religion in the world—as my wife to me is the most beautiful woman in the world—but others may feel the same about their own religion. Cases of real honest conversion are quite possible. If some people for their inward satisfaction and growth change their religion, let them do so. As regards taking our message to the aborigines, I do not think I should go and give my message out of my own wisdom. Do it in all humility, it is said. Well, I have been an unfortunate witness of arrogance often going in the garb of humility. If I am perfect, I know that my thought will reach others. It taxes all my time to reach the goal I have set to myself. What have I to take to the aborigines and the Assamese hillmen except to go in my nakedness to them? Rather than ask them to join my prayer, I would join their prayer. We were strangers to this sort of classification—“animists”, “aborigines”, etc.,—but we have learnt it from English rulers. I must have the desire to serve and it must put me right with people. Conversion and service go ill together.
 The next day early morning the friends met for an an informal conversation with Gandhiji when again the same question was asked by many of them.
 “Would you have a ruling of such a character that those who had a desire to convert should not be eligible for membership?”
 Personally, I think they should not be eligible. I should have framed a resolution to that effect as I regard it as the logical outcome
 of fellowship. It is essential for inter-religious  relationship  and contact.
 “Is not the impulse to proselytize God-given?”, inquired another friend.
 I question it. But if all impulses are God-given, as some of our Hindus believe, He has also given us discrimination. He will say, ‘I have given you many impulses so that your capacity to  face temptation may be tested.’
 “But you do believe in preaching an economic order?”, inquired one of the fair
  sex.   I 	do, as I believe in preaching laws of health.  Then why not apply the same rule in religious matters? It 	is a relevant question. But you must not forget that we have 
  	started with the fundamental principle that all religions are true. 	If there were different but good and true health laws for different 	communities, I should hesitate to preach some as true and some as 	false. I am positive that, with people not prepared to tolerate one 	another’s religious belief, there can be no international 	fellowship.  	Moreover, physical analogies when applied to spiritual matters are 	good only up to a certain point. When you take up an analogy from 	Nature, you can stretch it only to a certain point. But I would take 	an illustration from the physical world and explain what I mean. If 	I want to hand a rose to you, there is definite movement. But if I 	want to transmit its scent, I do so without any movement. The rose 	transmits its own scent without a movement. Let us rise a step 	higher, and we can understand that spiritual experiences are 	self-acting. Therefore, the analogy of preaching sanitation, etc., 	does not hold good. If we have spiritual truth, it will transmit 	itself. You talk of the joy of a spiritual experience and say you 	cannot but share it. Well, if it is real joy, boundless joy, it will 	spread itself without the vehicle of speech. In spiritual matters we 	have merely to step out of the way. Let God work His way. If we 	interfere, we may do harm. Good is a self- acting force. Evil is 	not, because it is negative force. It requires the cloak of virtue 	before it can march forward.  Did 	not Jesus Himself teach and preach?  	We are on dangerous ground here. You ask me to give any 	interpretation of the life of Christ. Well, I may say that I do not 	accept 
 everything in the gospels as historical truth. And it must  be remembered that he was working amongst his own people, and said he had not come to destroy but to fulfil. I draw a  great  distinction between the Sermon on the Mount and the Letters of Paul. They are a graft on Christ’s teaching, his own gloss apart from Christ’s own experience.

MY DEAR JAWAHARLAL,
 I have your letter which I appreciate more than anything else you could have written to me, because you are absolutely frank and I am glad for having written that article if only to draw from you what you have been keeping to ourself fall these long years. But of this later.
 This I am dictaing merely to tell you that poor Brockway is in a bad way. I understand that he will have to undergo another operation of a far more serious nature and might have to stay in India for may more months. I understand too that he has come  with  an understanding with the A.I.C.C. arrived at by Father that his passage to and fro should be paid by the Congress. If that is so, I suppose we should defray his hosptial expenses also and perhaps these in any case seeing that he was coming to the Congress. I understand that he will be soon in arrears about his hospital charges. Will you please inquire and do the needful, even set the wire in motion if necessary.
 I understand that the Madras Comittee has already paid nearly Rs. 400. The hospital charges alone are said to amount to Rs. 12 per day. I am writing to Srinivasa Iyengar also.
 Yours sincerely,

VIDYAPITH","
         January 15, 1928 Deenabandhu Andrewslibtech_164_footnoteis not only a good Englishman who has sacrificed 	everything for this country; he is also an artist, poet and fluent 	orator. Those who have studied his speeches and his deeds can  	realize that there is art in whatever he does. He is a poet because 	he understands what the future should be and what it may be. He is a 	fluent orator, not because he can speak volubly or because his style 	and pronunciation are excellent, but because all his words flow from 	his heart. One may form a certain impression on reading his 	speeches, but they must have made a different impression on his 	immediate listeners. Ordinarily we take it that one who can speak 	continuously for hours together is a fluent orator. Some may think 	that  Mr.  Andrews read out a written speech because he could not 	speak extempore. But it would be foolish to think so. He made his 	written speech so interesting that we got completely engrossed in 	it. It was so absorbingly interesting because his speech came 	straight from his heart.  	He referred in his speech to the late Hakim Saheb. On a superficial 	view one may wonder what a convocation address has to do with the 	death of Hakim Saheb; reference to it would show a lack of artistic 	sense! I feel that in this very thing he has revealed his artistic 	skill and has achieved his aim. Andrews is quite old compared to 	you.    
 He talked about his childhood. He spoke of the beginning of his training under Hakim Saheb. Hakim Saheb had become a well-known physician, and used to serve the rich and the poor through his knowledge of medicine; then it was that Andrews realized that he was taking training from him. He spoke from his own experience and said that he did not remember the lectures deli-vered by his teachers, but the greatest and the holiest thing he remem-bered was how one his teachers whose memory he cherished was able to penetrate his heart. It was to show this very purpose of education that he narrated the story of Hakim Ajmal Khan. Therein lies wonderful art. Compassion is certainly there in it. And while reading his speech he made us taste the sentiment of courage and in the end taught self-sacrifice.
 Moreover, he narrated the story of his own life. Our hearts have sunk into the valoe of despondency and though at present we have these buildings we apprehend that perhaps two years hence only pigeons might haunt them. He understands this feeling of anxiety. I have not told him about this, but he is able to smell it in the air around us. Therefore he said to you, “You have buildings, money and land; you will go on receiving money in a province like Gujarat. But if I tell the origin of the college in which I had studied, you will be surprised and you will see a ray of hope, because it was started in a mere small cottage and that too by a brave widow, who had lost her husband on the very day of her marriage. She could have remarried, but she dedicated herself to the religion of service. She found out saints and sadhus and asked them to give education to students; she had huts built for them to stay in. From those very huts developed the present great Pembroke College which gave us poets like Spenser and Gray, outstanding statement like Pitt and philosophers like Browne.” He has tried to comfort you by saying that his own college and your college have had a similar history, that if you work in patience your college too can produce great men. And the remedy that he has suggested is self-confidence. It is born of faith in God and patience. The finest things cannot be produced all at once. The seed-tree remains hidden in the ground and a big strong tree takes long years to grow. But the gardener knows that the tree will take its own time to grow, that he has to let the grass grow on the ground. The gardener does not get disheartened, because he knows. Andrews does not expect such knowledge from us, but he expects faith. He placed before us the definition of faith in the Bible, faith is the evidence of things not seen. If you have such faith, then the Vidyapith will never collapse. The
 Vidyapith has not taken as many years to grow as Pembroke. You may well say: ‘Here is our achievement; fifteen kumar mandirslibtech_165_footnotelibtech_166_footnotehave been disaffiliated! And that some more may yet be disaffiliated! But if you have faith you will not be disheartened. The kumar mandirs had to be disaffiliated because we would not bend, we insisted on our conditions and said: ‘If you wish the affiliation to continue, the students must spin; otherwise it will be terminated.” A day may come when no one would stay here; only the chancellor would be sitting, he would be the teacher and the student; a spinning-wheel would be in front of him; then he may have a visitor; but if  noone  comes,  monkeys at any rate would come and if he has faith he would speak to them like Vaidarbhilibtech_167_footnoteand find comfort. What is the evidence of my faith? The only evidence is that it does exist. If anyone asks you then you may refer him to the one who is never tired of speaking about the spinning-wheel. If you have that much faith, then according to Andrews you can create not one but a thousand Pembrokes here. How can you compare England with India, a country which can hold many Englands within it? But do we have such courage? Do we have such patience? Without courage and patience, faith cannot be fruitful. We must always adhere to our principles and have confidence. We do not wish to behave like a deceitful businessman. He fixes the price and prepares the packets after seeing the customer. If we yield this much, then students will come; let us then be that much lenient. This kind of business will benefit neither the public nor the Vidyapith. If the teachers have faith, then they will speak with one voice. Even the student will chime in and say: ‘What does it matter even if I am left alone, the teachers will pass on to me everything that they have. God is one, but in His creation there is infinite variety.’ Thus, if one student, though all alone, clutivates fearlessness, there will be a hundred to follow him. That is the substance of Andrews’s speech, the burden of his song.
 You may take his speech as mine. Be proud of your college, cherish the Vidyapith and enlighten you life. Wherever you may be, remember the Vidyapith. Soon you will know what turn it will take in the future, but I want you to wait with faith and patience and I promise you that, so long as any one of us is alive, we will not let the Vidyapith close down. I am ready to die, to be buried alive, if the Vidyapith
 
 lives. If you can bear the austerities of the Vidyapith, then rest assured that it will always offer a shelter for you; but if you cannot, do not blame me or the teacher but blame your fate. But if we fail to fulfil our pledge, then I must tell you that, although we are wedded to non- violence, you have the right to kill us.

 THE ASHRAM, SABARMATI,
 January 17, 1928
 MY DEAR JAWAHARLAL,
 I must dictate and save time and give rest to my aching shoulder. I wrote to you on Sunday about Fenner Brockway.libtech_171_footnotelibtech_172_footnoteI hope you got that letter in due time.
 Do you know that it was because you were the chief partner in the   transactions   referred   to   that   I   wrote   the   articleslibtech_173_footnotelibtech_174_footnoteyou   have criticized, except of course about the so-called ‘All-India Exhibition’? I felt a kind of safety that, in view of  the  relations between you and me, my writings would be taken in the spirit in which
 
 
 they were written. However, I see that they were a misfire all round. I do not mind it. For, it is evident that the articles alone could deliver you from the self-suppression under which you have been labouring apparently for so many years. Though I was beginning to detect some differences in viewpoint between you and me, I had no notion whatsoever of the terrible extent of these differences. Whilst you were heroically suppressing yourself for the sake of the nation and in the belife that by working with and under me in spite of yourself, you would serve the nation and come out scatheless, you were chafing under the burden of this unnatural self-suppression. And, while you were in that state, you overlooked the very things which appear to you now as my serious blemishes. I could show you from the pages of Young India equally strong articles written by me, when I was actively guiding the Congress with reference to the doing of the All-India Congress Committee. I have spoken similarly at  the  All-India Congress Committee meetings whenever there has been irresponsible and hasty talk or action. But whilst you were under stupefaction these things did not jar on you as they do now. And it seems to  me, therefore, useless to show you the discrepancies in your letter. What I am now concerned with is future action.
 If any freedom is required from me, I give you all the freedom you may need from the humble, unquestioning allegiance that you have given to me for all these years and which I value all the more for the knowledge I have now gained of your state. I see quite clearly that you must carry on open warfare against me and my views. For, if I am wrong I am evidently doing irreparable harm to the country and it is your duty after having known it to rise in revolt against me. Or, if you have any doubt as to the correctness of your conclusion, I shall gladly discuss them with you personally. The differences between you and me appear to me to be so vast and radical that there seems to be no meeting-ground between us. I can’t conceal from you my grief that I should lose a comrade so valiant, so faithful, so able and so honest as you have always been; but in serving a cause, comradeships have got to be sacrificed. The cause must be held superior to all such considerations. But this dissolution of comradeship—if dissolution must come—in no way affects our personal intimacy. We have long become members of the same family, and we remain such in spite of grave political differences. I have the good fortune to enjoy such relations with several people. To take Sastri for instance, he and I differ in the political outlook as poles as under, but the bond between
 him and me that sprung up before we knew the political differences has persisted and survived the fiery ordeals it had to go through.
 I suggest a dignified way of unfurling your banner. Write to me a letter for publication showing your differences. I will print it in Young India and write a brief reply. Your first letter I destroyed after reading and replying to it, the second I am keeping, and if you do not want to take the trouble of writing another letter, I am prepared to publish the letter that is before me. I am not aware of any offensive passage in it. But if I find any, you may depend upon my removing every such passage. I consider that letter to be a frank and honest document.

         THE ASHRAM, SABARMATI,  January 	17, 1928  DEAR 	FRIEND,  	Your letter is proof of the fact that a leopard cannot change his 	spots. I detected in it the old Collector parrying blows and making 	out a plausible case out of indifferent material. Let me take an 	analogy. The floor space that the English rulers occupy in India is 	infinitesimal, their numbers still more infinitesimal compared to 	the teeming millions. There are more “natives” in the Government 	employ than Englishmen. According to your reasoning, Englishmen will 	be able to call their rule therefore swadeshi rule. And yet you and 	I would repudiate any such preposterous claim. And it was certainly 	very  clever of you to have 62 thousand square feet allotted to 	khadi part of the indigenous thing. Whilst I was glad that khadi was 	outside the elephantine court, it was disgraceful if what I was told 	by reliable men was true, namely, that the Government had stipulated 	that  khadi  should be outside that court. And, is it proper for you 	to say that I ‘permitted’ the exhibition of foreign textiles? Do 	you not recall the    
 very great reluctance with which, when I heard of the proposed exhibition of foreign textiles, I consented to hold the Khadi Exhibition? Do you not remember that I did not care to have the Khadi Exhibition at all during the Congress Week? I yielded only because you, an old friend, were insistent that I should hold the Khadi Exhibition and told me that you would be embarrassed if I did not hold it. After I gave you my consent to hold it, I received letters of protest, but having given my word, I did not wish to withdraw.
 If this does not satisfy you and if your letter was written for the public eye, I would gladly print it and reply.
 I need hardly assure you that in all I have written I had nothing personal against you. You were but one of the parties to the performance which in the present chaos is nothing extraor- dinary. I would even have kept silent but for the fear of the same thing being repeated at the next Congress. Out course, it may be repeated in spite of my warning and protest. If it is, I shall not accuse myself of cowardice.

Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	the Hindi original C.W. 1639. Courtesy: Ramaniklal Modi           	I have now heard from Dr. Ansari regarding the fund to be raised in 	memory of the late Hakim Saheb Ajmal Khan and for the purpose of 	putting the Muslim National University on a firm footing. Dr. Ansari 	authorizes me to say that he and Principal Zakir Husain join me in 	making this appeal. Sheth Jamnalalji Bajaj has consented to be the 	treasurer of the Fund. In the existing raw state of feeling between 	Hindus and Mussalmans, it has not been thought advisable to issue 	this appeal under many names. But our hope is that all those who 	revere the deceased’s memory and who approve of the idea of 	connecting the proposed memorial with the National Muslim University 	will help the movement as if they were joint partners in this 	appeal.  	In my humble opinion, it is the duty of Hindus and Mussalmans who 	believe in unity to perpetuate Hakim Saheb’s memory in the 	tangible form proposed. It is their duty to ensure the stability of 	the Jamia, for it was a creation of the times when it was thought 	that the two communities were united for ever. And if the 	non-co-operating national colleges do not stand for, work for and 	finally ensure unity, nothing else can or will. I hope, therefore, 	that all the lovers of unity will liberally subscribe to the Fund.  	There are today two hundred students studying in the central 	institution and seventy-four in the city branch. There are more-over 	two night-schools which draw nearly two hundred students. The Jamia     
 has a staff of twenty-three workers. The highest salary being paid is Rs. 265, the lowest being Rs. 35. The idea constantly before the Principal is to have volunteers who would draw just enough for their wants. The salaries amount in all to Rs. 2,300 per month, the house rent is Rs. 425 per month. The total monthly expenditure is Rs. 4,800. The regular income, including boarding fees Rs. 1,300, is Rs. 2,700. There is thus a deficit of Rs. 2,100. This was somehow met whilst Hakim Saheb was alive. Before the teachers create for themselves a name and a prestige enough to command help, the deficit must be met by the public. And the memorial cannot be considered lasting till the Jamia has a building of its own. The subscribers will, therefore, in deciding the amount of donation bear in mind what is required.
 Dr. Ansari tells me that the Central Bank has generously offered to receive subscriptions for the Ajmal Jamia Fund and to cash all cheques and drafts at par in all its branches. The address of the treasurer is 395, Kalbadevi Road, Bombay.
 Finally, all donations received will be held by the treasurer on behalf of us four as trustees and will be given only after a proper trust-deed is created on behalf of the Jamia.

147,,TO NO-CHANGERS,"
    
 I see that the news that there was to be at Sabarmati a meeting of ‘No-Changers’ some time this month has found its way to the Press. Prehaps this was inevitable. But I am sorry to have to inform all concerned that the idea has been dropped for the time being at any rate. Many No-Changers have been long suggesting such a meeting with a view to the formation of a programme and a general interchange of views. The demand became insistent at Madras when the No-Changers who attended the Congress felt that on several resolutions they should have a definite joint policy and that they should be able to act as a distinct party within the Congress. Though I was not enamoured of the idea of forming a party, I was not averse to the calling of a meeting of No-Changers for the purpose of discussion. But as I came to the drafting of a circular letter, I saw that  it was a difficult performance and it was an equally dfficult thing to select the names of invitees. I found both to be hopeless tasks. On going into the thing deeper, I found that the convening of such a
 meeting might embarrass Dr. Ansari and make the working of the national programme of boycott more difficult by drawing the  attention of country away from the boycott and distracting it by a discussion of matters that may well await a better opportunity. I discovered further that the formation of a ‘No-Change’ party without me in it was not likely to function fully and vigorously so long as I was alive, available and retained a fairly healthy and active mind. And the idea behind the suggested meeting was to form a party in which I need not take any part. It may be theoretically possible, but in practice reference would always be made to me for opinion on many matters, which opinion would be more likely to be faulty than it would be if I was present at the discussion from which the matters  for  opinion might have risen. These considerations made me incline to the view that the meeting might at least be postponed. Vallabhbhai, with whom I first shared my revised opinion, agreed with me. Other friends came to the same conclusion on other and independent grounds. The idea of the meeting, therefore, remains under suspension for  the  time being.
 I hope that the suspension will not disappoint the No-co- Changers. I am not sure that it is not a better arrangement. Whilst non- operation as a national programme is partially suspended, individual non-co-operators have an opportunity of testing the strength of their faith. Their faith will be all the stronger for standing alone without the warmth of a party. When anything assums the strength of a creed which non-co-operation must be with those who still remain true to it, it becomes self-sustained and derives the needed support from within. Let us also have faith in the country that, when a forward movement becomes possible, all those who left non-co-operation will rejoin it whole-heartedly. I have no forward step to suggest at the present moment. Anything intermediate I can suggest may disturb the joint programme that various parties in the country are trying to evolve. Meanwhile, I can only invite the attention of No-Changers to the great constructive programme of khadi. Those who do not appreciate it do not understand the most potent and the most operative part of non-co- operation, viz., non-violence. Non-co-operation without non-violence can never rise to the dignity of a creed and becomes merely one among many strategies in a campaign. Non-violent non-co-operation has been conceived as an infallible remedy replacing all others. And khadi is the corner-stone of its positive side. Here is a reluctant testimony in favour of khadi given by Mr. Harcourt Robertson in the
 Daily Despatch. The writer is claimed by the editor to be “one who has spent many years in British India where he was engaged in occupations demanding an intimate knowledge of market conditions and the Indian psychology”. I am indebted to The Leader of the 12th instant for the following:libtech_185_footnote
 He (Mr. Robertson) ascribes the heavy drop in the amount of British cotton fabrics purchased by India not to post-war dislocation and economic stress, nor to the poverty of the masses, . . . nor to famines . . . but to the competition of Indian and Japanese mills and most of all to khaddar. He
 regards khaddar as the real enemy.  He says:
 “Khaddar is a native-made cloth, woven on primitive looms from hand- spun yarn by unskilled, amateurish workers. It is coarse, stiff, full of knots and faults, and always looks dirty—yet there is a positive vogue for it, even wealthy natives taking a pride in garments made from it. For khaddar represents in concrete form the slogan of the rapidly growing Nationalist party: ‘India for the Indians’. Not a penny of the money spent on it leaves the country. He who wears it helps to feed India’s starving millions, proclaims his country’s independence and shows himself a  patriot of  the first water. .  .  .
 Khaddar is one of the weapons used by, and, indeed, invented by, Mahatma Gandhi in his fight against foreign rule in India. Half saint, half fanatic, and wholly patriot, Mahatma Gandhi now speaks, in his person and through the native Press, to the very hearts of India’s educated classes. Non-co-operation is not dead in India because it is no longer talked. It has now reached the stage of silent and dangerous activity.        Let Mr. Gandhi’s missionaries once rope
 in the masses, and India will no longer be a poor buyer, she will be no buyer at all.       The blow is aimed not only at cotton. It is a definite attempt to ruin
 the market for all British goods.”
 These remaks cannot but hearten those who have been working, under the inspiring leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, for the spread of khaddar . . . .
 Mr. Robertson is alarmed and       he suggests that something should be done
 to give wide publicity in India to ideas such as “Lancashire fabrics of Indian cotton”, “India’s best customer is Lancashire”, “To buy Lancashire cloth is to help India’s cultivators”. . . . It is not by interested propaganda but by substantial concessions to the national demands of Indians that the relations of the two countries can be placed on a healthy footing and the causes which are operating to the detriment of Lancashires’s trade with India removed.
 Needless to  say that khadi is  not a  threat. It  is  the  breath of
 national life like swaraj. The khadi movement like swaraj cannot be
 
 given up against any concessions however generous. To give up khadi would be to sell the masses, the soul of India.

               DEAR 	DR. ROY,       SATYAGRAHA ASHRAM,  SABARMATI,  January 	19, 1928 
  	I thank you and Dr. Sircar for your letter and the medicine you have 	kindly sent me. You know my repugnance to medicine. I would not take 	anything that contained something taken from the human body except 	mother’s milk. The tabloids sent by you contain kidney and 	pancreas. Isn’t this something taken from a human body? Supposing 	that it is taken from a sub-human animal, my objection will still 	stand. You know my weakness for dietetical experiments. And ever 	since your discovery of excess of uric acid in my system, I have 	felt impelled to make a radical dietetic change. The comparative 	stability in the Ashram has given me the opportunity and I am now 	taking simply fresh fruits and nuts. The diet now consists of 	raisin-tea,    
 which means about 40 raisins boiled and the skin and seeds removed. This I take three times a day, and I add to it half an ounce of almond paste each time and twice two tolas of coconut milk and one or two oranges each time. Coconut milk is prepared by pounding a fresh ripe coconut and extracting the juice by adding a little water and straining it through a stout piece of khadi. This I had been  doing  for  a fortnight without any way comming to harm. The bowels are much more regular. I have not been weighed nor have I had the blood- pressure taken, but the feeling about me is good. I have purposely refrained from taking the blood-pressure and weight beacuse it seems to me to be of no consequence, if I otherwise keep fit.
 As you have taken so much interest in my health, I thought I owed you the information of the change I have made and the reason why I will not take the medicine so thoughtfully sent by you. I wish Indian medical men would make original researches and explore the possibilities of dietetic changes. It may be that the general body of people will not take to what may be called austere ways of treating diseases, but may not poor fanatics like myself have a corner in the minds and hearts of medical men? Has Indian medicine no fresh contribution to make to the medical science? Or must it always rely upon the patented nostrums that, together with other foreign goods, are dumped down upon this unfortunate soil? Why should the West have a monopoly of making researches?
 This letter is not written to you for acknowledgement and reply unless you want to give me any direction. You may therefore throw it into the waste-paper basket if there is nothing more to be said to me by way of advice and guidance.
 Yours sincerely,

 You have raised the subject of boycott of foreign cloth. But in the same context you also mention mill-cloth. How shall I convince you that, as long as the mill-owners do not come to terms with us and we are not able to control their prices, their help will be not only useless but positively harmful. On the contrary, what happened in Bengal will be repeated and the public will lose faith in the power of boycott.

		PORBANDARlibtech_191_footnote","
    
 January 22, 1928 With a view to avoiding the possibility of any misunderstanding between the rulers and the ruled, and with a view to fuller recognition
of its own limitations, as also in confirmation of the custom which has
 been for some time in operation, this Conference resolves that it shall not pass any resolution condemning or criticizing any individual State.libtech_192_footnote
 Moving the above resolution Gandhi said:
 Young people would not appreciate the restriction  imposed today, but I must realize my responsibility before I suggest that swaraj means the right to make mistakes. Not only have I thought over it and then suggested it, but I have drafted the resolution myself. Day before yesterday I advised the Subjects Committee not to pass the two resolutions criticizing individual States when the resolutions were moved in the Committee. It came to me as an after thought that the advice given by me should hold good for some time more for the same reasons for which it was tendered. It we do not resolve to this effect, our existence is in jeopardy. But one may also argue why we should have such a restriction only to postpone the death. The Committee would have turned down the resolution if it had been sponsored by any other person, but the Committee and  the  Kathiawaris have added to my responsibility by reposing faith in me. I hope you would do the same by passing the resolution. Young people will have to tolerate words such as ‘misunderstanding’, etc., which are found in the resolution.
 At the Bhavnagar Session of the Conferencelibtech_193_footnotethe question  of only Jamnagar and Gondal States was discussed. I had met the Jamsaheb and had discussions with him. I know what the issue was and it, but due to pressure of work, I could not derive full benefit from the discussions. I cannot say at the moment whether I won or lost. I have
 
 suffered defeat at the hands of Thakore of Gondal; even then I did not allow any criticism of him individually.
 At present the Conference is weak, lame and blind, and because I hold that we should not indulge in personal criticism I demanded here as well as in Bhavnagar that in the Conference no resolution or criticism on individual States should be allowed. The participants as well as the office-bearers of the Conference should be vigilant about such resolutions. They should do what is worthy of them. The ruler and the subjects should love each other and, in spite of their eagerness to point out to the ruler his shortcomings, they should put curbs on their speech and pen. Such restraint would help us a lot. Knowing our weakness, we should in future also adhere to the restraint which we have accepted in the two conferences. A person who is conscious of his inadequacy feels relieved when he confesses it before the world.
 If someone asks me what the brave people would do after the imposition of the restriction, I should say that such brave people have no place in the Conference. Their place is outside the Conference. They may form another association but this Conference is not meant for satyagrahis. Even the congress is not for them. This Conference does not restrain them. They may criticize but should not malign others. If I am asked what should be done if there is maladm- inistration in a particular State, my answer would be that we should acquire the courage to criticize the State. If the subjects being docile bear everything quietly, we should go to work amidst them in order to help them. Injustice is there, but we should find out some other platform for its redress. The princes are mutual friends  and  they won’t allow any one of them to be criticized. Of course,  the Conference as such cannot indulge in the criticism or censure of individual States.
 Apart from such criticism, you have enough work to do for khadi and for redressing the injustice inflicted on Antyajas by the sanatanis which is more severe than the injustice prevailing in the princely States.

         January 	24, 1928  	If a Hindu does service to an untouchable he does not at all oblige 	the latter, he obliges only himself. The Hindus, who were 	responsible for the existence of their so-called untouchable 	brothers, have committed many sins. Whatever they may do by way of 	self- purification and expiation for these sins would be inadequate. 	Therefore, whenever I have a chance to serve the untouchables, I 	consider it a God-sent opportunity to do some slight atonement for 	past sins. No one should feel elated, thinking that since he does 	some service he has no need at all for expiation. I want to make it 	clear to you that we are all jointly responsible for the 	ill-treatment given by a single Hindu. It is a universal rule that 	the whole world is responsible for the sin committed by any one 	person. Both Hindus and Muslims should accept this rule. As long as 	there are barriers of caste and community in this world, the group 	as a whole is responsible for sin of every individual member.  	A temple is not merely an edifice of brick or marble, nor does it 	become a temple by the installation of the image of a deity. It can 	be called a temple only when life has been breathed into the image. 	There may be hypocrisy in calling the priest and making sacrificial     
 offerings at the time of laying the foundation of the temple. The truth is that those who made a pious resolve to build a temple should, from that very moment, spend their life in deeds of penance and should surrender to the temple the fruits of all their good deeds. The managers and the priests of the temple should be leading a life of austerity so that one’s heart is moved as soon as one enters the temple. If this is not going to be that type of a temple, if sufficient purity of heart and mind is not behind it, it is merely a building and, take it, it is a burden on the earth. Since it would be called a temple, the area occupied by it would go waste; it can be put to no use and it may turn out to be a pernicious institution and even a haunt of many sins. I have laid the foundation-stone of this temple in the belief that no such defects are here. To lay the foundation-stone as soon as the idea of constructing a temple occurs and then to live in the hope of erecting a temple some day is not good. Nothing is achieved in haste; the plants of religion do not grow fast. True faith, industry and patience are the prerequisities for this.
 I should lie to say only this to the untouchable brethren: the Hindu precept which says that no one can go to heaven before death is perfectly true. You have to work yourselves for your own uplift. Do not believe that the caste Hindus are helping you; by serving you they are in fact helping themselves. If you wish to show your mettle, wake up. Give up those faults for which the Hindus blame you and shun you. Please make it a rule that those amongst you who are given to drinking, meat-eating and so on do not enter the temple. Do not point to the defects of the so-called high-caste Hindus. As the saying goes, “those in power can do no wring”, the world will forgive them but not you. Whatever may be the defects of others, you must try to remove your own.

 [January 24, 1928]libtech_197_footnote
 I sincerely thank the Maharaja Saheb, the people and members of the Modhlibtech_198_footnotecommunity for having welcomed my companions and myself and for presenting me with an address. I should, at any rate, tell my brothers belonging to the Modh caste that I have no right whatsoever to accept an address of welcome from them. Not even in my dreams have I imagined that I have in any manner served this caste as such; there are some gentlemen who believe that I have not only not served this caste but rather have caused it some harm. If I accept this allegation for the moment, your address merely suggests your large-heartedness. However, I am not content with this large- heartedness because, although it may be a sign of generosity, there is always an implicit understanding between the giver and the receiver of an address of welcome that the giver blesses and approves of the work that is being done by the receiver. I hesitate to accept your address, as there is no such understanding between us.
 There is a purpose behind what I am saying about your small caste; for I believe that these small barriers must be broken down. I am clear in my mind that there is no room for castes in the Hindu faith; I say this to those belonging to the Modh or any other caste who happen to be present here. In the true Shastras there is no reference to castes; there is a reference only to the four varnas, God has washed his hands off after creating these four varnas. There is not even a trace of castes in the varnadharma. I wish to tell all of you, and plead with all, through the Modhs, that you should forget the  barriers  created by caste. Make use of the castes that exist today in destroying the caste system, offer them to the sacrificial fire and, if there is anything in them that teaches you self-control, practise it. A foul smell is emitted by such puddles if we do not clear them. The doctors advise us to fill up puddles. In addition to giving off a foul smell, they breed mosquitoes and these in turn prove fatal. You must realize that these caste puddles are likewise fatal to man. You must realize that God would never create such a deadly organization. You will be happy if
 
 you act upon these words which I speak out of my own experience. Time goes on, doing its own work. You can go and raise your hand against it if you wish to, but you must realize that it is all futile. If we foolishly delay things, trying to defend these barriers  against  the march of time, it would be like the game of trying to throw dust on the sun and throwing it in our own eyes. I would not have spoken thus to you nor would I have had the occasion to do so if you had not presented me this address. Do not regard this as an  insignificant matter. For many years now we have been steeped in superstition and ignorance; do not give these the name of knowledge. Comparative studies of different religions are being made in the world today, and if you examine these without any prejudice, you will find that these castes act as barriers to progress, to dharma, to swaraj and to the Ramarajya of which I speak so often. I would like to ask you: ‘What are the achievements of the Modh caste that should prompt us to sing its praises exclusively?’ We find that many cases there is a contradiction between our thoughts and actions. Our conduct is at variance with our proclaimed beliefs. This is like the track remaining even after the disappearance of the snake. Make a Bhagiratha- prayatnalibtech_199_footnotelibtech_200_footnoteto bring about conformity between your beliefs and your conduct. In return for the address of welcome that you have given me I would ask you to make this effort. If you also accept the implicit understanding of which I spoke, I shall feel that I did well to have accepted your address and to have been born in your caste.
 I have been making the most sincere efforts to bring about conformity between my thought and action and hence it was that the Modh caste used to boycott me, although the Modhs realized later on that I did not deserve boycott as I never even thought of taking any advantage of the caste system. I wish to carry forward this attempt of mine to break down caste barriers. Perhaps you do not know that I got one of my sons married outside my caste and have lost nothing by doing so. My son got bride from a devout Vaishnava family, for which he is grateful to me. I could claim that by doing so I have stolen a gem belonging to another caste. I ask those belonging to the smaller castes to hand their daughters over to me, if the latter cannot be married off. I shall get them married to good upright boys belonging to other castes, the marriage expenditure being no more
 
 earth
 than a tulsi leaf or a hank of yarn. If other castes do not hesitate to hand over their girls to me who has adopted an untouchable girl as daughter,  why  should  you  have  any  fear?  I  am  getting   my   sonlibtech_201_footnotemarried to a Modh girl after three days. I carry on my duties in this manner and find no difficulty in doing so.
 In this way, through the Modh caste, I wish to ask all those who recognize such barriers, to break them. The eighteen varnas are mere myth; there are only four varnas, so divided on the basis of their occupational aptitudes. The customs in respect of eating and drinking with others are a part of untouchability, whereas the varnas are like a beautiful tree under the shade of which mankind can find shelter and nourishment for itself. The system of varnas is the dharma of self- control; there is no economic consideration involved in it  but  its object is to enable people to practise their dharma. Sages and ascetics have conceived and organized it as a thoroughfare on which one could tread the path of one’s dharma, whereas it has now become the means of furthering our self-interest, our vices, and the gratification of our senses. Try to preserve the varna system in its pure form.
 In my opinion swaraj and Ramarajya are one and the same thing; however, I do not often use the latter expression before audiences of men. This is so because, in this age of rationalism, if one who talks of the spinning-wheel to women talks also of Ramarajya, this would appear to our intelligent young men as idle sermonizing. They want swaraj, not Ramarajaya, and of swaraj too they give strange definitions which, in my opinion, are absurd. But today, while I am standing before the Maharaja Saheb and his subjects, when the former has poured out his heart to me for an hour, I also feel like speaking out my mind before him. The conce-pt of swaraj is no ordinary one;  it means Ramarajya. How will that Ram-arajya come to be established? When will it come into being? We call a State Ramarajya when both the ruler and his subjects are straightforward, when both are pure in heart, when both are inclined towards self-sacrifice, when both exercise restraint and self-control while enjoying worldly pleasures, and, when the relationship between the two is as good as that between a father and a son. It is because we have forgotten this that we talk of democracy or the government of the people. Although this is the age of democracy, I do not know what the word connotes;  however, I woudl say that democracy exists where the people’s voice
 
 
 is heard, where love of the people holds a place of prime importance. In my Ramarajya , however, public opinion cannot be measured by counting of heads or raising of hands. I would not regard this as a measure of public opinion; the verdict of the panch should be regarded as the voice of God. Those who raise hands are not the panch. The rishis and the munis after doing penance came to the conclusion that public opinion is the opinion of people who practise penance and who have the good of the people at heart. That is the true meaning of democracy. It is not democracy but something else that is reflected in the support secured by someone like me who makes a vote-catching speech. The democracy that I belive in is described in the Ramayana—in the essence that is derived from my simple and straightforward reading of it. What was the manner in which Ramachandra ruled? The rulers of today assume that it is their birthright to rule and they do not recognize the people’s right to voice their opinion. However, you rulers who may be regarded as the descendants of Rama, do you know how he ruled? You may also be regarded as the descendants of Krishna. And what did Krishna do? He was the most perfect servant; at the time of the rajasuya yajna, he washed everyone’s feet. That he actually washed his subjects’ feet may be fact or legend, that custom may or may not have been  prevalent at the time; its under-lying implication, however, is that, at the sight of his subjects, he bowed to them or rather bowed to their wishes. This very matter has been diffe-rently presented in the Ramayana. Through his secret agents Ramachandra elicits public opinion and finds that Sita is the object of censure in a particular washerman’s home. He was well aware that this adverse criti-cism was groundless; Sita was dearer to him than his own life, nothing could lead to a difference between him and her; nevertheless, he renounced her, realizing that it was improper to let such criticism continue. As a matter of fact, Ramachandra and Sita had become one; they lived for and in each other; nevertheless, he thought it necessary to endure the physical absence of that very Sita for whom he led an army to battle, whose presence he desired day and night. Rama honoured public opinion in this manner; his rule is called Ramarajya. Even a dog could not be harmed in that State, as Ramachandra felt that all living beings were part of him-self. There would be no licentious conduct, no hypocrisy, no falsehood in such a State. A people’s government would function in such a truthful age. The ruler forsakes his dharma when this age ends. Attacks will then be made from outside the State
 Germs from outside attack the body when the blood becomes impure. Likewise when society as a body gets corrupted, people who are like its limbs are subjected to external attacks.
 However, when there is a bond of affection between the ruler and the ruled, the people as a body can face attacks. The authority exercised by the State should be one of love; the sceptre does not signify the exercise of brute force but rather a bond of love. The word ‘Raja’ is derived from the root ‘raj’ which means ‘that which is befitting’. Hence Raja implies one who does credit to the office. The people are not as wise as he is. He has bound the people to himself with the bonds of affection and he is a servant of his servants. Shri Krishna was such a servant and he was subjected to kicks like  a servant. Hence I tell the rulers and the chiefs that if they wish to be known as the descendants of Rama and Krishna, they should be prepared to put up with their subjects’ kicks. They should put up with the latter’s abuses; although the people may act in an irresponsible manner, the ruler cannot do so. If the rulers did, the world come to an end.libtech_202_footnote
 Can not this country which is primarily agricultural with seven lakhs of village in it, save itself from this machine age? It consists of living machines and saving them is the only means of saving the country. They are the cow and her progeny, human beings and their descendants. If those who have living machines at their disposal and who can always add to this wealth, would become worshippers of the machine age, they will be cursed by humanity. If this country, which was once ruled by mighty emperors and which has thirty- three crores of living machines in it, starts worshipping this machine age, you must conclude that we are descendants of Ravana and not of Rama. These are harsh words but they are inspired by love and come from the heart. The maharaja Saheb sopke to me sincerely. Wherever I come across sincerity, I forget myself and reciprocate with all my heart. If not today, after my death, you will realize that what I said was right. You will be cutting your own throats the day you give too much importance to the machine age. If some Chengiz Khan invades us in future and through slaughter reduces the 33 crores to 3 lakhs, we may then need machines just as Britain and the United State need them. Moreover, these two countries have established the practice of
 
 
 robbery. Whom are you going to rob? There is no reason why our country should remain poor when it has so much natural beauty, good climate, a variety of plant life and an inexhaustible store of other resources. We have become our own enemies. It is for this very reason that I keep insisting upon khadi.
 I request you to maintain an eternal bond of mutual affection. What the ruler is like will depend on his subjects and vice versa. What can the ruler do if the people, are dishonest, cowardly, deceitful and wicked? If the ruler is a good man, his soul may perhaps be spared; but he cannot save his subjects. If they cannot protect their women themselves, how can the ruler do so? In a town of the size of Morvi with a population of twelve to fifteen thousand—for whose good and to what end should there be so many factions and so many disputes? You should give up these things. There is no dharma other than truth and non-violence. Why should you, who are devotees of non-violence, indulge in intrigues? Passion and malice are nothing but violence. Non-violence does not merely consist in sparing the lives of bed-bugs or flies. That indeed is non-violence in its lowest from. The world is sanctified by one out of whose heart love flows constantly like a stream—these are not my words but the words uttered by Mahavira, the words uttered in the Gita. I have had just a slight experience of this. My mission is fulfilled by my endeavours to practise truth and non-violence. You will save yourselves if you practise these. However, your khadi or your cattle cannot be spared if you give in to hypocrisy or deceit. You will find it easy to practise what I have preached if you have a vision of the stream of truth, of the Ganga of non-violence.

  "
158,,BOYCOTT OF BRITISH GOODS,"
    
 It is not at all surprising that the nation should wish to show resentment of the studiously insulting and defiant acts of the British Government. Every new discovery in the direction adds fuel to the fire. The latest is the abhorrence the late King Edward VII and his son, the present King, are reported to have betrayed of ‘natives’ and that in connection with Lord Sinha. The representatives of the nation have for years past endeavoured to demonstrate their resentment  by bringing about a partial or complete boycott of British goods. It is the nation’s right to bring it about if it so wishes. There is no doubt that it will produce a great effect if it could succeed to the necessary extent.
 But it has been my misfortune or good fortune consistently to oppose the cry for the boycott of British goods. Though I adhere to the fundamental ground that the proposed boycott is contrary to non- violence, I wish to confine myself at present to an examination of its possibility. The fact that we have hitherto made no headway whatsoever with it, in spite of the agitation for so long a time, is proof presumptive of its very great difficulty. If we were to take even such a simple instance as soap, we shall discover that we have made no progress even in the boycott of British made soap. The Committee appointed by the Congress recommended certain articles for boycott. So far as I am aware, no such effort has yet been made in the direction of excluding even one such article from the nation’s use. The use of a punitive boycott lies in the effectiveness. Anyone studying the articles of import will soon discover the utter futility of spending labour on achieving the boycott of most of these articles from the standpoint of creating an impression on the British Government. It should not be forgotten that for all these long long years, we have not been able to have a body of specialists devoted to this single task. It is the fashion in some quarters nowadays to blame me for the failure of any and every resolution that the Congress passes. I am told that a particular resolution does not succeed because I oppose it or do not work at it. There can be nothing more humiliating for a nation than to be in such an impotent state. Surely boycott of British goods was conceived and vehemently advocated before I returned from South Africa. The real and the more natural reason for the failure of the British  goods  boycott resolution lies in the obvious fact that no committee of
 experts has yet been able to arrive at a satisfactory plan of working it out. It has been suggested that we can succeed if China has succeeded. Yes, we can if we have the will, the courage and the opportunity to regulate the boycott by armed force, by creating an army of open revolutionaries, by forcing for that specific purpose a strike of dock labourers and others connected with the handling of British goods. It seems to me that even if we have the will, we have neither the means nor yet the capacity for managing such an open armed revolution. And neither those who have advocated boycott of British goods nor the special Committee appointed by the Civil Disobedience Inquiry Committee have ever contemplated armed force. I hold, therefore, that it will be more consistent with national dignity, prestige and welfare to give up the cry, proved to be useless, and  almost  impossible,  of boycott of British goods. The permanent necessity of advocating true swadeshi in all things capable of being produced at home  is  untouched by the argument against the punitive boycott.
 But there is no cause whatsoever for despair. We have a means ready made and most effective of signifying our resentment over the series of wrongs being continuously heaped upon our devoted heads. If we have the will, I claim that we have the present capacity of achieving a complete boycott not merely of British cloth but of all foreign cloth. And if we do this, we not only successfully demonstrate our resentment, but we serve the masses in a manner we have never done before and we secure their co-operation in a national effort. We have got an army of workers for doing this work. We have experts who have first-hand knowledge of the thing. There is no division of opinion on the propriety of the thing. The only thing that retards our progress towards the completion of boycott of foreign cloth is our own disbelief. It is strange but tragic that through our ignorance we believe more in the possibility of achieving a boycott of certain British goods than of foreign cloth.
 But even this boycott of foreign cloth cannot be achieved without a well-thought-out and prepared plan. If it is the mere boycott we want rather than the higher and the more permanent result in the shape of the economic well-being of the masses, we can do so quickly enough if we receive the co-operation of mills on our terms. Without honest and hearty co-operation of our weaving and spinning mills, to attempt to achieve the boycott with mill-cloth would be to  court  suicide and to run into the arms of profiteering mill-owners. If indigenous mill-cloth is to play a part in this national effort, the mills
 must come to terms with the Congress as to the kind of production and the prices to be charged. The mill agents should with the consent and co-operation of their shareholders cease to be merely trustees for themselves and shareholders, but both should become trustees for the whole nation. Then, with khadi, foreign cloth can be successfully and permanently banished from the land. But it is possible, even without the co-operation of mills, though less easy in point of time, to achieve the boycott of foreign cloth through khadi alone. Mills will still play a part, but that will be in spite of the owners. Khadi will put an effective check on their head, it will prevent a famine of cloth and it will give life and hope and work to starving millions, reinstate weavers of plain cloth in their ancient calling and will eventually, but within a short time, lead to a replacing of foreign cloth and regularizing of mill profits. Time limit can be determined by the strength of the nation’s will and its capacity for sacrificing a little of its taste for fine cloth and a little money never beyond the capacity of individual users of cloth.

 DEAR DR. MOONJE,
 You have been quite discreet in writing to me. I would also agree with your general proposition. But can we enforce it only  among Muss-almans, or can we begin the reform with them? Have we not got in the country innumerable purely Hindu institutions? Moreover, this Muslim University has no bar against the entry of Hindus. As a matter of fact, there are already discharged Hindu graduates of this University who are doing good national service. There are some Hindus in it even now studying. Thirdly, even a sectional institution may be called national if its outlook is national and is in reality utilized for national advancement. I would like you, therefore, if you can, to support this memorial to Hakimji.
 Sharddhanandji Memorial stands on a different footing and in one respect a higher footing, because of the circumstances in which Swamiji met his death. But the memorial as it has been conceived cannot be claimed to be national. It is a purely Hindu memorial. For, the shuddhi work as also untouchability are things for Hindus alone to look after. The two, therefore, have to be kept separate. Each has its own special object.
 Yours sincerely,

 January 27, 1928 In the evening he [Gandhiji] referred to the public aspect of the question. He dilated on the pernicious system which had divided the four original varnas into
 numerous castes and sub-castes and hoped that the weddinglibtech_214_footnotejust celebrated would
 perhaps be for the Ashram the last as between parties belonging to the same caste. It behoved people in the Ashram to take the lead in this respect, because people outside might find it difficult to initiate the reform. The rule should be on the part of the Ashram to discountenance marriages between parties of the same caste and to encourage those between parties belonging to different sub-castes. He wished girls could be kept unmarried up to 20 and even 25. Towards the end he again came back to the solemn significance of the ceremony.
Do not think that the Ashram has as its object the popularization
 
 of marriage. It has and will have the promotion of lifelong brahmacharya as its object. It countenances marriage only to the extent that it serves as an instrument of restraint rather than of indulgence. And those who are for a life of restraint must order their lives differently from those who are for indulgence. Remember that there is always a limit to self-indulgence but none to self-restraint, and let us daily progress in that direction.

 [January 29, 1928]
  A 	year ago 	I heard you 	speaking on 	the supreme necessity of 	every one 	of us 	wearing khadi and thereupon decided to adopt it. But we are poor 	people. My husband says 	that khadi is 	costly. Belonging as 	I do 	to Maharashtra, I 	wear a 	sari nine yards long. Now 	if I reduced 	the length 	of my sari 	to six 	yards, there 	would be a 	great saving, but 	the elders will 	not hear of any 	such reduction. I 	reason with 	them that wearing khadi 	is the 	more important thing and 	that the style 	and length 	of the 	sari is 	absolutely immaterial, 	but in 	vain. They say 	that it is my youth 	that puts all these 	new-fangled notions 	into my 	head. But 	I expect 	that they will agree to 	the proposed 	reduction in length 	if you 	are good enough to 	write to 	me, saying 	that khadi 	ought to be used, 	even at 	the cost of 	style of clothing.  	I have sent the desired replylibtech_223_footnoteto the sister. But I take note of her difficulty 	here, as I know that the same difficulty is encountered by many 	other sisters as well.  	The letter in question bears witness to the strong patriotic feeling 	of the writer, for there are not many sisters who, like her, are 	ready to give up old styles or old customs on their own initiative. 	The number of such sisters and brothers is legion as would gladly 	have swaraj if it could be attained without suffering any discomfort 	or incurring any expenditure and in spite of their sticking to old 	customs, regardless of their propriety or the reverse. But swaraj is 	not such a cheap commodity. To attain swaraj implies the cultivation 	of a spirit of self- sacrifice, including the sacrifice of 	provincialism.  	Provincialism is a bar not only to the realization of national 	swaraj, but also the achievement of provincial autonomy. Women 	perhaps are more responsible than men for keeping up this narrow 	spirit. Variety is worth cherishing up to a certain limit, but if 	the limit is exceeded, amenities and customs masquerading under the 	name of variety are subversive of nationalism. The Deccani sari is a 	thing of beauty, but the beauty must be let go if it can be secured 	only by sacrificing the nation. We should consider the Kachchhi 	style of short sari or the Punjabi odhani to be really 	artistic if the wearing of khadi can   be   cheapened   and   	facilitated   by   their   means.  The Deccani,     29-1-1928  
 Gujarati, Kachchhi and Bengali styles of wearing sari are all of them various national styles, and each of them is as national as the rest. Such being the case, preference should be accorded to that style which requires the smallest amount of cloth consistently with the demands of decency. Such is the Kachchhi style, which takes up only 3 yards of cloth, that is, about half the length of the Gujarati sari, not to mention the saving of trouble in having to carry a smaller weight. If the pachhedo and the petticoat are of the same colour one cannot at once make out whether it is only a pachhedo or full sari. The mutual exchange and imitation of such national styles is eminently desirable.
 Well-to-do people might well keep in their wardrobes  all possible provincial styles of clothing. It would be very courteous and patriotic on the part of a Gujarati host and hostess to put on the Bengali style of dress when they entertain Bengali guests, and vice versa. But such procedure is open only to the patriotic rich. Patriotic people of the middle and poorer classes should take pride in adopting that particular provincial style which cheapens as well as facilitates the wearing of khadi. And even there they should fix their eye upon the clothing style of the poorest of the poor.
 Swadeshi does not mean drowning oneself in one’s own little puddle but making it tributary to the ocean that is the nation. And it can claim to contribute to the ocean only if it is and keeps itself pure. It is therefore clear that only such local or provincial customs should have a nation-wide vogue as are not impure or immoral. And when once this truth is grasped, nationalism is transmuted into the enthusiasm of humanity.
 What is true of clothing is equally true of language, food, etc. As we might imitate the dress of other provinces on a suitable occasion, so might we utilize the language and other things. But at present all our energy is wasted in the useless, impossible and fatal attempt to give English the pride of place to the neglect, conscious or  unconscious, of our mother tongue and all the more so, of the languages of other provinces.

I have no comments to offer on Shri Thakkar Bapa’slibtech_224_footnotespeech, on the attendance of the public, on the welcome given by the reception committee, on the gentleness and courtesy of the honourable Rana Saheblibtech_225_footnote, on his presence in the Conference or the hospitality that he extended to the guestes. Sheth Devidas left nothing undone so far as the reception was concerned. He acted very well on behalf of Sheth Omar Haji Amod Zaveri who had been elected the chairman of the reception committee and did not hesitable to spend his own money in providing a welcome. The speech of the President was worthy of the priest of Bhils and the Dheds. The resolutions passed by the Conference were innocuous. These did not interest me as they did not reflect any firm determination or power to put them into actual practice. It seemed that many of those who put forward the resolutions thought that with the mere moving of them their duties were discharged. I realized that this was not a khadi conference and inwardly experienced a sense of defeat. I was alone concentrating on that subject. I realized that I had been unsuccessful; my faith in khadi, however, did not waver. I do not, therefore, wish to spell out my sorrow.
 I wish to comment on one resolution alone. I am the author of that resolution and I feel that, by framing it and getting it passed, I have served the Conference and Kathiawar. That resolution runs as follows:libtech_226_footnote
 The acceptance of this resolution became possible because of my devotion to truth. I found that this Conference could be held in Porbandar only because of some implicit understanding with the honourable Rana Saheb and that for some years to come it would be possible to hold such conferences only with such an understanding. This reflected the measure of the weakness of the Conference. No conference should be helpless to this extent. There  is  something wrong somewhere when such helplessness is found to exist. However, it is not got rid of by hiding it from view. Those who try to be
 
 secretive about their sickness merely increase its intensity; they ignore remedial measures and become their own enemies.
 There were two occasions in the Subjects Committee when the members introduced two resolutions criticizing individual States. I cannot claim that there was no reason for  introducing  these resolutions. However, I clearly saw that it was beyond the power of the Conference to admit such resolutions or act on them. The committee ruled out these resolutions. However, I felt that the Conference could not continue to function long if it brought forward such resolutions. Hence, I advised the Conference to declare to the world its own weakness, its own limitations. I suggested that, by proclaiming the truth, the Conference will soon overcome its weakness and save itself.
 This was a very bitter pill for the Subjects Committee to swallow. I, too, did not like to give such advice; however, I could see clearly what my dharma was. One should act in accordance with the truth, whether it happens to be pleasurable or painful. Does not true happiness often appear to be like poison? Although some members did not approve of this resolution, they as well as others accepted my advice because of their generosity and far-sightedness.
 Thereby, my responsibility has increased. I know that I will be blamed if this resolution leads to any undesirable consequences. Not only am I not afraid of these but I believe that, if the Conference implements that resolution in good spirit and does everything that is implied by it, the result must necessarily be rewarding. Restrictions which are volun-tarily imposed, self-control which is voluntarily practised, are always beneficial to anyone who undertakes them. There is no other condition which need be applied to a restriction thus voluntarily undertaken.
 If the Conference abides by this resolution in thought, word and deed, it will thereby increase its capacity to fulfil its obligations within its province. Before this restriction was imposed, rulers were hesitant to allow the Conference to be held, for fear of personal criticism and censure. As the members were not clearly aware of their limitations, they made attempts, apparently glamorous but in fact futile, to rid the States of their individual shortcomings and, by doing so, were inattentive towards those tasks which, though apparently without glamour, were capable of being carried out. Now, they will either perform these useful, though uninteresting, tasks or shut up shop. As no one likes to become bankrupt, let us hope that the office-bearers of
 the Conference will accomplish, willingly or unwillingly, those tasks which are worth accomplishing.
 No one will interpret the above resolution to mean that in passing it we admit before the world that the States do not deserve any criticism. We should not speak ill of anyone. Although these States deserve criticism, we do admit that as we live within the boundaries of Kathiawar we do not have the capacity to criticize at the moment any State in Kathiawar or even elsewhere. We have imposed the restriction for this very reason and in the hope that we shall be able to develop the strength to make such criticisms in the future. The Committee of the Conference has the right, or rather the duty, to utilize the means at its disposal for the redressing of any grievances that it may find in any State, without bringing in resolutions in the Conference to that effect and without making any criticism against any individual State either directly or in an indirect manner at the Conference. For instance, at the time when the Conference is in session, any member  of  the Subjects Committee can describe the drawbacks of any State in Kathiawar to his fellow-members and ask for the guidance of the Committee on the matter. The only restriction is that he cannot move  a resolution on it in the session of the Conference. He could meet that rulers or their officers and request them for redress, or if the grievances prove to be untrue he should declare them as such. In other words, the Committee can approach each and  every  State through proper channels, in a friendly manner. There is a possibi-lity that if the States in question, after having come to know the idea behind this restriction, have not suddenly started acting in an irrespon- sible manner and do not wholly disregard public opinion, they would wel-come this step taken by the Committee and would even use it as a shield. Here we should bear in mind that the Committee should not take undue advantage of such an investigation and publicly discuss the facts which have come to light; it should suffer in silence even if it cannot gain access to the States in question or gets no satisfaction even after gaining access, and realize that the remedy for the disease lies beyond its powers.
 The outcome of such limited interference, or investigation if you wish to call it by that name, depends on the tact, industry and courtesy of the Committee. It will be able to achieve nothing if it forms preconceived notions about those States and becomes  prejudiced against them. It should have the self-confidence to melt the hearts of rulers. Such self-confidence can be acquired only through
 
 supreme service to both the ruler and the ruled. Both should be served in a dispassionate manner for their ultimate good and not in order to placate them. The members of the Committee should not even dream of serving their own self-interest through such service. The belief that we do not wish to do away with the existence of Indian States but only ask for an improvement in these is at the very heart of this idea. The Conference does not deserve to be held in the States at all if the idea behind it is to put an end to the system of princely States.
 It is change and not destruction that can be brought about through non-violence. Democracy can be realized through the rulers; neither the ruler nor the ruled should be destroyed and whatever is good in both these can be harmoniously harnessed. In short, the relationship between the two should be one of dharma and not of brute force. The modern trend is towards destruction, whereas ancient culture is in favour of growth and nurture. Non-violence achieves the good of all, whereas violence bases the prosperity of one upon the destruction of another. Democracy is not an advantage in all respects nor is monarchy altogether harmful. Each has its own uses and it is the duty of the Political Conference to find these out, for it wishes to reach its goal by following the path of truth and non-violence.
 Let us examine what the Conference can do. Khadi, the service of the untouchables, social reforms, etc., are of course there. By taking up these activities the Conference should nurture democracy. Administrative problems are not few—prohibition, education, the railway department, storage of rain water for the whole of Kathiawar, preservation of trees and their multiplication, introducing uniformity in the excise levy throughout Kathiawar as well as uniformity in its administration. Other matters, too, which would be advantageous to both the ruler and the ruled can be enumerated. Such matters are of the utmost importance and Kathiawar can subsist on these alone. By disregarding them Kathiawar will bring about its own ruin.
 In order to accomplish these tasks, the help of the officer class is required more than that of the rulers. If the former are selfish or narrow-minded, even the reforms decreed by the rulers cannot be brought about. The officers are the limbs of the rulers and the officer class means the people. The ruler would necessarily improve if the people improve; however, the larger section of the public which is vocal, happens to belong to the officer class. Hence, so long as that section does not give up its self-interest and adopt the path of
 morality, so long as it does not cease to worry over earning its livelihood, so long as these fearless persons do not comprehend the nature of public activities and take interest in them, there is little hope of any true reforms being introduced in the Indian States. The greater part of the effort of the Political Conference should, therefore, be directed towards and concentrated on the people, as it is the people who are like roots whereas the rulers are like fruits. If roots become sweet, fruits are bound to be sweet too.
 Moreover, if the Kathiawar Political Conference is destined to add prestige to itself, there should be separate Conferences of State people in each of the more important States; these conferences may certainly criticize their own States in all matters, within the bounds of decency. These conferences should develop their own strength; even in order to do so they should engage themselves in constructive activity. The development of its strength depends on this.
 Selfless and fearless workers are required for these activities. Where to find them? It those that are there, whatever their number, would keep on doing their duties silently, their number  would multiply. No one should entertain the cowardly thought: ‘What could I achieve all by myself?’libtech_227_footnote
 So far I have addressed my words to the people. If the rulers could realize it, the above-mentioned resolution has greatly added to their responsibilities. To this day, they avoided and some even ignored the Conference for fear of its criticism and harsh words against them. However, in my humble opinion, they should respect the Conference by appreciating its civilized nature, satisfy its demands and use it as a bridge between the people and themselves. The evidence I have before me leads me to believe that it is not the case that all the States in Kathiawar are above criticism. I have been told that there are some very major shortcomings in these. They should come to recognize this age. The chaos that is there in the world and has affected India too, is an important symptom. It is certainly harmful in its chaotic form; however, the purpose underlying it is an honest one. People worship morality, although they follow consciously or unconsciously a path that deviates from it. They are tired of the blind forces of authority; they have become impatient. And, in their impatience, although they may forget that the remedy adopted by them is even more dangerous than the disease itself, they are eager for reforms and for moral power.
 
 
 Though devotees of truth and non-violence like myself can see that morality will not be attained by their means, they are also aware that, if those in authority do not take this warning, destruction awaits them. It is necessary for rulers to take this warning. Let not perversity foreboding destruction prevail with them. I am kept alive by my unwavering faith that India will never take to the path leading to moral death. May the rulers prove my faith to be correct.

175,,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"
  
 A worker asked whether a school for untouchables should be started in State ‘A’. Gandhiji replied:
 I have heard at many places and from many persons that ‘A’ is an unholy State; if that is true, we should not go there for any sacred work. The only exception to this would be the work of removing the unholiness of that State. As we have been living under British rule, it has acquired a certain kind of prestige; however, as we wish to break up this unjust administration from within, no other alternative is open to us. Otherwise, for any good person to go or to live in an unholy State in order to carry out any other sacred work would amount to his going there to increase the prestige of that State.
 Q.	Is it necessary to have an all-India satyagraha  organization  for  introducing reforms in Indian States?libtech_228_footnote
A.	No. There were 60,000 people associated with my work in
 South Africa; how many of them continue to be satyagrahis today? However, all the twenty-two of you have been selected for the purpose of giving a helping hand whenever it becomes necessary. Whenever you take up the work—and you will not do so without exercising discretion—you will find many other people who will join hands with you. If you are discreet satyagrahis the all-India satyagraha organization that you envisage is not necessary. The talent that lies hidden within you and in the country will manifest itself  when occasion arises.
 Q.	How should the Satyagraha Dal grow in numbers and in quality?
 
 Dal.
 A. Every satyagrahi should remain alert. He should not be idle or lazy, he should not be lethargic or sick, so that he can be introspective. He should keep on evaluating his own contribution to the activity which he has chosen for himself. The commander-in-chief must maintain a record of the work done by each soldier.
 Q. At present many persons are engaged in running schools for untouchables and in such other activities.
A. I would ask such satyagrahis how far they have been able to
 convert these children to satyagraha, to what extent they have been able to become one with the children. If I may ask the children who these persons are, they should reply that they look upon their teachers alone as their fathers.
 There are satyagrahi doctors amongst you. Shall I tell you what a satyagrahi doctor should be like? He would treat the poor before all others and would disregard me and others like myself who can get the services of doctors whenever they wish to. He would ask a poor man whether he required a set of false teeth because he has lost his natural ones. Such a doctor should not worry how he could thrive in his profes-sion if he did not find people with bad teeth. You should look up  Hind Swaraj for a detailed description of  a  satyagrahi  doctorlibtech_229_footnotelibtech_230_footnote. Such an individual should not even hope to make a living from his profession. Dr. Wanless has per-formed thousands of operations, people donate thousands of rupees to his institution, but he does not take a single pie out of it. Sam Higgin-bottom was the agricultural expert of the Scindia. He received a salary of Rs. 4,000 a month for his advise; did he, however, take a single pie of it for his personal expenditure? Yes, we do have our Dr. Chandulallibtech_231_footnotelibtech_232_footnote; he acts in a similar fashion, he knows his own job very well, he does not take a single pie for himself and the poor can readily approach him.
 The satyagrahi should dedicate himself to his chosen field of activity in a spirit of purity, and adhere to it. His unflinching faith will be recognized by his truthful adherence to something which he has regarded as true although it may be untrue. Tulsidas has said: “The shell appears as a piece of silver and the sun’s rays appear as a sheet of water—such is the character of illusion. Though it is ever non- existent, one cannot get rid of it.”
 
 Since we act as if the world is ultimately true, we should remain absorbed in such actions as would bring about the good of the world. That alone is beneficial.
 Q. Supposing State ‘A’  has  so  deteriorated  that  satyagaha needs to be practised there, should we set up our camp in it?
 A. No, your duty is to muster strength, remaining outside it and  to educate public opinion in State ‘A’ while doing so. When you find that you have grown in strength and that a part of the fortress of State ‘A’ has given way, if it appears that some Vibhishana can be found there, only then should the Satyagraha Dal invade it. Despite such an attack the Dal should bear goodwill towards the ruler whild maladministration is the reason for this attack. The Satyagraha Dal can set up its camp there when all these factors are  present. Meanwhile, you can educate the people of that State. You can create an awareness of their sorry plight amongst the large number of people who visit your place. You should train people of that State through boycott or by not going there even though you may have relations living there who may be celebrating a wedding or some  such auspicious occasion.

A conscientious man would regard as his own the institution to which he belongs, and, therefore, will carry out all the obligations without insisting on his rights.

 I have not come to take you by storm, not in the Caesarean spirit of veni, vidi, vici. But I have simply thrown myself in your midst, so that you can make whatever use you like of me on the eve of the changes that are impending. It would perhaps be better if I said that I have come to clear a long-standing debt I have long owed to you as your Chancellor to come and stay in your midst and identify myself with you as much as I could. But I have never been able to do so. I am thankful to the Giver of all good for having given me this opportunity of spending some time with you.
 I have not come to create any disturbance in the even tenor of your lives. I do not insist on your attending  the  four-o’  lock morning prayers. If you are convinced that prayer is an  essential thing in one’s life and that it is best to begin one’s day with prayer in
 
 
 
 the early hours of the morning, you will attend it. If you do not, I shall certainly be sorry, but will not resent your absence. In the same way, I should like you to accompany me every evening to the Ashram to attend the evening prayer there. That also you will do if the spirit moves you, and if you feel that your work will permit you to do so. I want you to go there, not because I want you to join the Ashram, though I would be glad if you did so, but because I want you to understand and identify yourselves somewhat with the Ashram. For I make no secret of it that the Ashram is the best of my creations. I can myself point out numerous defects in it, and can add many more from your own experience. But I assure you that I am more conscious of them than anyone else and yet I hold that, with all its shortcomings, it is the best of my creations. I would have me and my work judged by the Ashram more than by anything else. Hence I would love you to attend the evening prayer daily. But this is a mere suggestion to be rejected or adopted out of your own free will.
 Let me not live in your midst as a burden, but as a friend, and, if possible, a guide if you will.
 I am willing to give you a quarter of an hour every day or two periods every week just as you might desire. I am not sure what I shall read with you, but that also I shall leave to you to decide.

187,,MISS MAYO AGAIN,"
  	Bravo! Now that you have become a family man, you must need stop 	writing to me! That will not do. Things are going on quite well 	here. The mail is going just now.  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	the Gujarati original: Mrs. Sumitra Kulkarni Papers. Courtesy: Nehru 	Memorial Museum and Library       	Miss Mayo is clearly trading upon her knowledge that what we in 	India write can at best reach but a few hundred Americans, and that 	what she writes reaches thousands. She therefore feels per- fectly 	free, just as it suits her, to misquote, half-quote or distort other 	people’s writings or speeches intended to contradict her. She has 	done me the honour again of referring to me in her article in 	Liberty attempted to discredit my writing about her 	compilation, Mother India This she has felt called upon to 	do, I suppose, because I enjoy a certain amount of credit among 	cultured Americans, and lest therefore their judgment may be 	affected by my article. But in her article in Liberty she has 	outdone herself. Her reference to my secretaries is a clever attempt 	to hoodwink the unwary reader. All that could be inferred from my 	repudiation of the statement that I had two secretaries (whether 	always or not is not the point) is that Miss Mayo was at least a 	careless writer if not a wilful perverter of truth. But the manner 	in which she     
 described the secretaries leaves the reader under the belief that I have always two secretaries. Her adherence to the statement that I did give her the message she ascribed to me proves her to be guilty of a gross suppression of truth. She seems to have thought that I would not have a copy of the corrected interview between her and me. Unfortunately for her I happen to possess a copy of her notes. Here is the full quotation referring to the hum of the wheel:
 My message to America is simply the hum of this wheel. Letters and newspaper cuttings I get from America show that one set of people overrates the results of non-violent non-co-operation and the other not only underrates it, but imputes all kinds of motives to those who are concerned with the movement. Don’t exaggerate one way or the other. If, therefore, some earnest Americans will study the movement impartially and patiently, then it is likely that the United States may know something of the movement which I do consider to be unique although I am the author of it. What I mean is that our movement is summed up in the spinning-wheel with all its implications. It is to me a substitute for gunpowder. For it brings the message of self-reliance and hope to the millions of India. And when they are really awakened, they would not need to lift their little finger in order to regain their freedom. The message of the spinning-wheel is, really, to replace the spirit of exploitation by the spirit of service. The dominant not in the West is the note of exploi-tation. I have no desire that my country should copy that spirit or that note.
 The first sentence only of the foregoing extract, which Miss Mayo quotes without the most important commentary on it,  is intended to ridicule me. But the whole paragraph, I hope, makes my meaning and message clear and intelligible. I wrote my article on her book whilst I was travelling. Had I had the notes before me, I should have quoted from them, and thus added force to my article. I claim, however, that the message as it appears in the full paragraph quoted is not different from what I have stated in the article Miss Mayo attempts to shake.
 Whilst, therefore, even in “the trivial quibble” as she rightly calls the subject-matter of her contradiction, she is, I trust, proved wholly unsuccessful, I claim that even if my memory had betrayed me, my conclusive reply to her is left unanswered and untouched. Having no case, she has followed the method of the pettifogging lawyer who vainly tries to discredit a hostile but unshakable witness by making him state things from memory which might be found on
 
 verfication to be not quite accurate. It gives me pain to have to say that her article in Liberty proves her to be not only an unreliable writer, but an unscrupulous person devoid of sense of right and wrong.

188,,GUJARAT VIDYAPITH,"
  
 This National University, the first of its kind established when non-co-operation was at its height, has been struggling for existence for the past three or four years. The attendance of boys has gone down considerably. Several schools affiliated to it have closed or sought Government recognition. There would be nothing to worry over this decline, if there were no internal causes for it. But most of us including myself have felt that we have not done all we might have for this most useful national work of reconstruction. But whilst, if all had been vigilant, the defections might have been not so large as they have been, there are for the decline causes over which no one had any control. And though the quality of the work already done might have been easily better, what has been achieved is such as any institution would be proud of. I make bold to assert that but for the Vidyapith, Vallabhbhai Patel would not have been able to command the valuable assistance he did of so many workers during the late disastrous floodslibtech_249_footnotelibtech_250_footnote. Indeed, the Vidyapith volunteers went even to Sind in order to assist Professor Malkani who has been doing heroic work there in connection with the Sind floods. I hope some day to deal the  Vidyapith graduates’ work of which an accurate but brief analysis has been prepared by a graduate proud of being owned by it. Sufficient for the time being to make the confession of our neglect both  avoidable and unavoidable and to state that we seem now to have been roused from our slumbers.
 The preliminary cleansing step was taken on Sundaylibtech_251_footnotelast when the Senate handed over charge of the valuable property and the still more valuable responsibility connected with the Vidyapith to a Board of Trustees by means of a resolution of which I give the translation below:
 
 “This meeting of the Senate of the Gujarat Vidyapith is of opinion that
  By 	having established 	the Gujarat Vidyapith 	in connection 	with the 	non-co-operation 	movement and 	by maintaining 	it in spite 	of a 	set-back in 	the movement, 	Gujarat has 	rendered essential 	service to the nation.  The 	Vidyapith has 	however continued year 	after year to 	suffer in 	point of numbers.  The 	Vidyapith could 	have achieved better 	results in point 	of quality, 	had the internal 	conditions been 	favourable; and,  The 	Vidyapith has now 	reached a 	stage in its evolution, 	when, in 	order to 	make it 	work more effectively 	and in 	order to 	ensure an 	unswerving observance of 	the principles 	hereinafter enunciated, 	the administration 	of the 	Vidyapith should 	be entrusted 	to a Board 	of Trustees.  Therefore, 	and in 	pursuance of 	the resolution 	for the 	reconstruction of 	the Vidyapith 	passed by this 	Senate on the 	4th of December 	1927, the Senate 	appoints a 	Board of Trustees 	called the 	Gujarat Vidyapith 	Mandal to 	be composed of 	those who, 	from the list herein 	below, pledge themselves to 	subscribe to 	and observe 	the principles 	hereinafter enunciated; hands over 	charge of 	all the institutions 	connected with the 	Vidyapith, along 	with their 	property, movable 	and immovable, 	as also  all  the rights 	and responsibilities 	pertaining thereto, 	to the  said Vidyapith 	Mandal; and 	authorizes the 	Mandal to 	add to 	its membership subject 	to the same qualifications 	so as not to exceed 	25; and authorizes 	it to exercise  all  	other  rights 	including that 	of filling 	vacancies caused by 	resignation, death, 	or dismissal 	of any 	member for 	breach of 	the pledge 	or similar 	other reason, 	the latter 	to take 	place by a 	vote of 	four-fifths of 	their number.

 PRINCIPLE
  The 	principal object 	of the 	Vidyapith shall 	be to prepare 	workers of 	character, ability, 	education and 	conscientiousness, 	necessary for 	the conduct 	of the 	movements connected 	with the attainment of swaraj.  All 	the institutions conducted 	by and affiliated 	to the Vidyapith shall 	be fully 	non-co-operating and 	shall therefore 	have nothing 	to do with 	any help from Government.  Whereas 	the Vidyapith 	has come 	into being in connection 	with swaraj, 	and non-violent 	non-co-operation as a 	means thereof, its 	teachers and trustees 	shall restrict 	themselves to those 	means only which 	are not inconsistent 	with truth and 	non-violence and 	shall consciously 	strive to carry 	them out.  The 	teachers and 	the trustees of 	the Vidyapith, 	as also 	all the 	institutions affiliated 	to it, 	shall regard 	untouchability as a 	blot on 	Hinduism, shall 	strive to the 	best of 	their power for 	its removal, and 	shall not exclude 	a boy 	or girl 	for reason of 	his or 	her untouchability nor shall give him or 	her differential 	treatment having once 	accorded admission to 	him or her.  The 	teachers and 	the trustees of 	and all 	the institutions affiliated 	to the 	Vidyapith shall 	regard hand-spinning as 	an essential part 	of the 	swaraj movement and 	shall therefore spin 	regularly, except when 	disabled, and shall 	habitually wear khadi.  The 	language of 	the Province 	shall have the principal 	place in 	the Vidyapith 	and shall 	be the 	medium of instruction. 
 EXPLANATION. Languages other than Gujarati may be taught by direct method.
  The 	teaching of 	Hindi-Hindustani shall 	be compulsory 	in the 	curricula of 	the Vidyapith.  Manual 	training shall receive 	the same importance 	as intellectual 	training and only such 	occupations as 	are useful 	for the 	life of 	the nation 	shall be taught.  Whereas 	the growth 	of the nation 	depends not on cities 	but its villages, 	the bulk 	of the 	funds of 	the Vidyapith 	and a 	majority of 	the teachers 	of the 	Vidyapith shall 	be employed 	in the 	propagation of 	education conducive to 	the welfare 	of the 	villagers.  In 	laying down 	the curricula, 	the needs 	of village- 	dwellers shall have principal consideration.  There 	shall be complete 	toleration of 	all established 	religions in 	all institutions 	conducted by and 	affiliated to 	the Vidyapith, and 	for the spiritual 	development of the 	pupils, religious 	instruction shall be 	imparted in 	consonance with 	truth and non-violence.  For 	the physical development 	of the 	nation, physical 	exercise and 	physical training shall 	be compulsory 	in all the institutions 	conducted by and 	affiliated to 	the Vidyapith. 
 NOTE. Hindi-Hindustani means the language commonly spoken by the masses of the North, both Hindu and Mussalman, written in the Devanagari or the Persian script.
 But drastic as this step is, it may mean nothing if it is not to be followed up by quick, persistent and vigilant effort. Such effort may for the time being even result in further defections. The Senate, now the Board of Trustees, have been quite aware of the possibility. They want quality and feel that if the quality is assured, quantity will come in its own time. They are prepared to sacrifice everything to quality. It would be wrong to use donations of those who have given and will give in the belief that the principles for which the institution has professed to stand will be worked out in practice in so far as it is humanly possible. As reformers the trustees would belie their trust if they sacrifice principles for holding the institution together anyhow. Personally I have no fear as to the result if the trustees remain staunch, as I have every reason to believe they will.
 On the surface there wold appear to be a descent from demo- cracy to oligarchy. As a matter of fact it is not. The large elected body could not be sustained when the principles for which the elected
 Senate for the time being stood were in the melting-pot.  A democracy’s ideals and principles vary with the times. A refor- mer’s principles are rigid and fixed. When non-co-operation ceased to be national, those who believed in it as a creed, the only final solution for the removal of India’s fetters, were bound to save the creed by working it to its logical conclusion in their own lives. Hence did the Congress bring into being an independent self-governing body styled the All-India Spinners’ Association, composed of those who had a living faith in the message of the wheel. The unwritten understanding was that the Association would work out the programme of khadi so as to become in process of time a tower of strength to the parent body. The permanent trust has been created in the hope of evolving a truly democratic institution. And there is a democracy such as the world had never seen if khadi becomes a truly national institution. Even so has the Senate emerged as a Board of Trustees pledged to work out its present ideals so as to make national education a living force, so as, that is to say, to cover every village in Gujarat, to enable the students to realize the dignity of labour equally with the dignity of learning, to produce national servants who will serve the nation in her villages. The Senate, when after a full discussion it came to the resolution on Sunday, has no less, a hope, the Trustees shouldered no less a responsibility. No oligarchy can arise from  a  voluntary surrender such as the Senate’s was. It gave up its powers to  a permanent body when it was in posession of the fullest powers and in a position to exercise them to the fullest extent. It was an act of self- denial whose virtue has to be proved by the Trustees. Theirs is an awful responsibility. But, with proper consecration, it will sit lightly on their shoulders and Gujarat as well as India will be the gainer thereby. They will be judged not by the quantity of result turned out but by the quantity and the quality of self-service put in.

         DEAR 	FRIEND,       [February 3, 1928]libtech_255_footnote 
  	I have your kind letter. I have not abandoned the yogic exercises at 	all. Shavasan I take perhaps indifferently. The breathing I 	am taking as prescribed by you. But I have made a radical change in 	my diet. You know my dislike for milk for religious reasons. Having 	no travels on hand, I am trying the nut and fruit diet. It is now 	nearly a month. I am taking three times one tola of almonds 	pounded to a milky substance with stewed oranges or raisins each 	time. Twice I take half a coconut grated and squeezed so as to get 	the milk out of it with     
 stewed unripe pawpaw or unripe banana. The unripe banana I started only today. Since this change, I have not had any opening medicine and the bowels have been much better than before. Probably you don’t like this change. But if you can bear with me and can guide me, please do. If you have any more ex-ercises to recommend, please tell me. On the strength of Dr. Muthu’s advice, I have not had blood- pressure taken at all for a month.

If you 	wish to invite the specialist on fasting to Pilani, that too can be 	arranged.  	It is my firm belief that on no account should you go to Delhi.

204,,AFTER HARTAL?,"
    
 With great deliberation and not without the exercise of great self-restraint have I hitherto refrained practically  from  writing anything about the boycott of the Statutory Commission. I recognized the force of the appeal made to me by the Leader of Allahabad not to meddle with or influence the boycott movement, but to let the various parties manage it themselves. I recognized that my interference was bound to bring in the masses more prominently into the movement and might possibly embarrass the promoters. Now that the great demonstration is over, I feel free to say a word. I tender my congr- atulations to the organizers for the very great success they achieved on the hartal daylibtech_270_footnotelibtech_271_footnote. It did my soul good to see Liberals, Independents and Congressmen ranged together on the same platform. I could not but admire the courage of the students of Government colleges in absenting themselves from their colleges for the sake of the national cause. All the world over students are playing a most important and effective part in shaping and strengthening national movements. It would be monstrous if the students of India did less.
 My object now is to draw attention to the fact that the very success of the hartal will be turned against us if it is not followed up by sufficient and persistent action. We must belie the prophecy of Lord Sinha that the hartal was but a passing cloud. Let us bear in mind that, notwithstanding our opposition, the Commission, backed as it is by British bayonets, will go its own way. Where it cannot get bona-fide recognition, it will be manufactured for it. Did not a so- called deputation on behalf of ‘untouchables’ welcome the Commi- ssion as its true deliverers? Claiming to know the untouchables more than the members of the deputation, I make bold to assert that they no more represented the untouchables than would a party of Japanese, for instance.
 If then we are to ensure a complete boycott, not only will there have to be a joint organization by all the parties for carrying it out and possibly picketing, wherever the Commission goes, but there must be some further demonstration of the nation’s strength. Even though mine may be a voice in the wilderness and even at  the  risk  of repeating a thousandth time the same old story, I suggest that there is
 
 nothing before the nation other than boycott of foreign cloth which can be brought about effectively and quickly. But like all great undertakings, it requires planning and organizing. It requires  sustained and vigilant effort by a party of earnest, able and honest men and women exclusively devoted to the task. It is not an easy task. If it was, it would not produce the great results that are promised for it. It must evoke the best in the nation, before it is accomplished. But let us also frankly recognize that if we cannot organize this one thing, we shall organize nothing else.
 Let me make my own position clear. I have no desire even now to interfere with the present evolution of the  national  movement except through occasional writings. This is written, therefore, by way of a humble appeal to the different parties who are jointly acting in order to vindicate national honour.

205,,NOTES,"
    
 UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA
 Though through the heroic efforts of the Rt. Hon. Srinivasa Sastri the social status of our countrymen in South Africa has undoubtedly improved and life is becoming less unbearable for self- respecting Indians, reminders come now and then from that sub- continent that much yet remains to be done before the Indian settlers enjoy the ordinary civic rights and feel their position safe. The latest shock comes through  a cable just received from Mr. Albert Christopher, the new Deputy President of the South African Indian Congress. Mr. Christopher was one of the volunteers who served as well during the Boer War as during the late War. He is South Africa born and has just returned after finishing his education in England. The cable runs as follows:
 Second reading Liquor Bill now going through Parliament notwithstanding strong protest. Bill seeks deprive three thousand Indians their families and dependents of livelihood ultimately drive them out of country. Bill direct conflict letter spirit Cape Town Agreement. Clear racial legislation. Indians greatly alarmed Government’s attitude. If Bill passes Cape Town Agreement smashed. Earnestly appeal your immediate interven-tion.
Even   the   respectable   South   African   Press   agrees   with the
 opinion  of  the   South  African  Congress   that   the   Bill   violates the
 Agreement which resulted from the Round Table Conference. That it is aimed even at those who are already earning an honest livelihood in hotels and bars is unquestioned. If the Union Parliament persists in the Bill, it simply means that being the stronger party to the contract, it can safely commit breach of contract whenever it wills. Our hope lies in Sjt. Sastri’s gentle diplomacy saving not only the situation, but the honour of the Union Government, the Union Parliament and the white people of South Africa in spite of themselves. He, however, needs energetic support from the Indian Press and the Indian public.
 A PARALLEL FROM CHINA
 A friend sends me a cutting from the New York Times containing the report of an interview with Mr. Ku Hung-Ming, one of the most prominent Chinese, referring to the cultural greatness of the Chinese people and its being belittled by foreigners. And referring to the inroads of foreign merchants upon China, Mr. Ku says:
 “I was similarly blind when I first returned from my long years abroad,” he admits with disarming frankness. “At first I was ashamed to admit I was Chinese; now I am so proud of my heritage that I am conceited enough to think the rest of you are all barbarians.
 “You see, our main trouble is economic. You Americans, for instance, thought a great influx of Chinese labourers would upset your industry and lower your standard of living. You acted promptly and shut your door against Chinese.
 “But we in China have suffered an invasion of your foreign machines and of cheap machine-made goods, and those things have ruined us, just [as] an influx of several million Chinese coolie labourers would have ruined your industrial scheme.
 “When I was a young man, for instance, even the women in our own families spun and wove. At the time fully 100,000,000 Chinese women spun and wove. Then came cheap foreign cotton goods and these 100,000,000 women have no productive life, but must live on the labours of their menfolk. We are prevented from following your example of shutting the door by the fact that the treaties forbid our taking any action. We do not have even tariff autonomy.
 “If I were an artist, I would draw you a cartoon which would show you what I think of the unequal treaties.
 “Picture a Chinese prone upon the ground and a foreigner standing over him holding him down with his foot. ‘Get up,’ say the foreigner. ‘Take your foot off first,’ says the Chinese. ‘No, you get up first,’ says the foreigner,
 putting more weight upon the foot.”
 AJMAL JAMIA FUND
 The following sums only have been hitherto received in answer to the appeal in these pages:
        Sheth 				Jamnalal Bajaj Sjt. 				Rameshwardas, Dhulia       Rs. 1,000-0-0 ,, 51-0-0     ,, 				Pyare Ali, Bombay       ,, 				100-0-0           Total     Rs. 				1,151-0-0    
 This is as yet a poor response. Ofter the response to appeals made in these pages is an indication of the manner in which the people receive certain movements. Evidently the strained relations between the two communities are keeping the general body of readers from responding. May I hope that wherever there are men and women who believe in Hindu-Muslim unity, believe in Hakimji as a great patriot, and in the necessity of supporting the Jamia, they will not only themselves soon send in the contributions, but will also canvass them among their friends and neighbours? Every subscription big or small will be acknowledged in these pages.
 TO THE FRIENDS IN KARNATAK AND ANDHRA DESH
 Inquiries are being made as to whether the proposed tours in these provinces have been altogether abandoned. I may state in answer that, though under pressure from Sjt. Gangadharrao Deshpande and Deshbhakta Konda Venkatappayya, I have postponed the tours, I have no idea whatsoever of abandoning them altogether. If health permits and God otherwise wills it, I propose to undertake them after the monsoons are over. But it is safe not to build hopes on any fixed season. Sufficient for me to give the assurance that I would like to tour in these and the remaining province at an early date, if it is at all possible. Meanwhile those who have already collected purses should send them either to me or to the organizers.
 KHADI IN THE PUNJAB IN 1885
 I extract the following valuable information that Sjt. Balaji Rao of Coimbatore collects for me from time to time from several books. The extract is taken from a Monograph on the Cotton Manufacture in 1885 by E. B. Francis:libtech_272_footnote
 
 That the remuneration earned by the spinners was low did not baffle the good workers, for, as the author says, they worked during the leisure hours and whatever they earned was so much gained. If the things are different now, it is because the tastes have become vulgarized and foreign cloth, under an insidious system of indirect protection, has been dumped down on this unhappy land.

 SATYAGRAHA ASHRAM,
 SABARMATI,
 February 11, 1928
 DEAR DR. ANSARI,
 Don’t you worry about my health. Doctors will frighten one. This time the registered blood-pressure does not seem to produce any impression on me. I am keeping fairly [fit]. I have strength to walk, and I only lie on my back because doctors are impera-tive and tell me that some blood-pressure cases are most illusive and specially dangerous when the patient himself feels no visible effects.
 This letter I am dictating in connection with Ajmal Jamia Fund. Whilst you are in the midst of all the big people, I want you to buttonhole them and get them to subscribe, no matter how much. I fear that there will be little spontaneous response or it will come when noted men and women have subscribed. If I had not become bedridden, I would have done lobbying this side of India. And I have not yet lost hope of being able to do it. I am not at all sure of your scheme of deputations going round succeeding. I know it is cruel to ask you to spare the time when it is occupied between your practice and direct Congress work. But you have got to find it for this work too.
 If you have not seen my article “After Hartal?”libtech_273_footnote, please look at it. Unless you take up this universal and possible thing, boycott of foreign cloth, the energy created by the boycott of the Statutory Commission will be all waste of effort. Every negative action without corresponding positive action becomes useless in the end.
 Yours sincerely,

I do continue to hear about the 	progress of your health through Paul and others. But I was more than 	pleased to have your own letter and to know that you were on the 	road to complete recovery and that you were able yourself to write 	long letters. Yes, 	the violence during the Madras hartal was most unfortunate. The 	slightest relaxation of control precipitates violence.  	I had a letter from Mr. Runham Brown. I sent a reply saying that I 	would not be able to go. I still feel that my work outside is also 	better done from the Indian platform. It can be said of it that it 	is still in too experimental a stage to make any confident claim 	about it, and if anything definite can be said about it with 	complete confidence, it would be itself a very striking 	object-lesson in no-war. But I am keeping both the letters for 	reconsideration. I shall watch also how the blood-pressure behaves, 	and if I find meanwhile any prompting from the inner voice in the 	direction of going, I shall not hesitate to say yes.

That 	is most dangerous. Government will fight you with the  	help of your own money and recover the increment in a moment.

I do not know. I have 	not read the articles with care. But remember that you will have to 	keep the whole country with you, and    
 the first condition is that your cause must be perfectly just. Then there is another point. The people may be ready to fight. But do they know the implications of satyagraha? Supposing Vallabhbhai is removed with the rest of you, will they stand together?
 K.	That is more than I can say.
 G.	Well, you will have to ascertain that. But what does Vallabhbhai say?
 Sjt. Vallabhbhai had just arrived. He said he had studied the case and had no doubt that the cause was just. Gandhiji said :

Sabarmati is not very far from Jacobabad, the hottest place in  India.  Why  not reproduce wherever you are the ideals for which the Ashram stands? Then you have the Ashram without its obvious limitations, and you can add to or modify the ideals as much as you like."

 THE ASHRAM, SABARMATI,
    DEAR 	FRIEND, Mira 	has translated your latest letter for me.  February 	14, 1928 
  	My whole soul goes out to you in your grief especially because it 	comes over a letter which makes you suspect me of hardness of heart. 	I appreciate your desire to find me correct in all I do and think.  	I do indeed want to stand well with you, but I must be true to 	myself if I am to continue to deserve your warm friendship.  	Let me first tell you that Mira’s letter reflected her own views 	though they were found to coincide with mine. Neither Mira, so far 	as  I know her, nor I had the remotest idea of judging those two 	good peasants. libtech_275_footnoteTheir 	action was undoubtedly one of heroism. What we had in our minds was 	the heroism of a war-resister, and from the record sent by you and 	as it was interpreted to me by Mira, I missed that particular type 	of heroism which a war-resister demonstrates in his own life. Joan 	of Arc was a heroine. So were Leonidas and Horatius. But the heroism 	in each case was of a different type, each noble and admirable in 	its own sphere.  	In the answers given by the peasants, I do not notice any definite 	repugnance to war as war and a determination to suffer to the  	uttermost in their resistance to war. These peasant friends, if my 	recollection serves me right, are heroes representing and defending 	the simple rustic life. These heroes are no less precious than those 	of a militant war-resister type. We want to treasure all this 	heroism, but what I feel is that we will serve the heroes and the 	cause of truth better if we treated each type separately.  	You have curiously raised the question of my participation in the 	late War.libtech_276_footnoteIt 	is a legitimate question. I had answered it in the last 	autobiographical chapter as if in anticipation of your question. 	Please read it carefully and tell me at your leisure what you think 	of the     
 argument.libtech_277_footnotelibtech_278_footnoteI shall treasure your opinion.
 Lastly, I do want to reach perfection, but I recognize my limitations, and the recognition is becoming clearer day after day. Who knows in how many places I must be guilty of hardness of heart, and I should not be surprised if you have noticed want of charity in my writings in more places than one. I can only tell you that the lapses are there in spite of my prayerful effort to the contrary. I suppose it was not without reason that the early Christians considered Satan to be not merely an evil principle but evil incarnate. He seems to dominate us in every walk of life and man’s mission is to overthrow him from power.
 This letter of yours to Mira makes me more and more anxious to see you in the flesh, and there is just a distant hope of my being able to do so this year if I keep good health and if otherwise the inner voice guides me towards Europe. I am seriously considering two invitations, and the desire to meet you may precipitate my decision in favour of accepting those invitations.
 Yours sincerely,
 ROMAIN ROLLAND

217,,ON THEIR TRIAL,"
         	What happened to the students during the Rowlatt Act agitation is 	repeating itself now. During those precious days, one of them wrote 	to me that he felt like committing suicide because he was 	rusticated. A student now writes:  The 	students of. . . heard the mother’s call and responded to it. We 	observed hartal on the 3rd. For this courageous deed of ours, we are 	being fined Rs. 2 per head. The poor students are losing their 	freeships, half-freeships and scholarships. Please write to Mr. the 	Principal, or advise him through  Young 	India. Tell him we 	are no criminals, we have committed no crime. Tell him we listened 	and responded to the mother’s call, we saved her, to our utmost, 	from dishonour. Tell him we are no cowards. Please come forward to 	our aid.  	I cannot follow the advice to write the Principal. If he is not to 	lose his ‘job’, I suppose he has to take some disciplinary 	measures. So long as educational institutions remain under the 	partronage of the Government, they will be, as they must be, used 	for the support of the Government, and the students or the teachers 	who support anti- Government popular measures must count the cost 	and take the risk of being dismissed. From the patriot’s 	standpoint, the students did well and braverly in making common 	cause with the people. They would have laid themselves open to the 	charge of want of patriotism, if not wrose, if they had not 	responded to country’s call. From the Government standpoint, they 	undoubtedly did wrong and incurred their severe displeasure. The 	students cannot blow hot and cold. If they will be with the people’s 	cause, they must hold their scholastic    
 career sub-servient to the cause and sacrifice it when it comes in conflict with the interest of the country. I saw this quite clearly in 1920 and subsequent experience has confirmed the first impression There in no doubt that the safest and the most honourable course for the student world is to leave Government schools and colleges at any cost. But the next best course for them is to hold themselves in readiness to be thrown out whenever a conflict occurs between the Government and the people. If they will not be, as they have been elsewhere, leaders themselves in the revolt against the Government, they must at least become staunch and true followers. Let their facing of the consequences be as was their response to the nation’s call. Let them not humiliate themselves, let them not surrender their self- respect in trying to re-enter colleges and schools from which they may have been dismissed. The bravery of their response will  be counted as bravado, if it succumbs on the very first trial.
 I hear that, during the days preceding the hartal, the students discarded foreign cloth and very largely patronized khadi. Let it not be said of them that this was but a passing show and that they have, on pressure from without or temptation from within, discarded khadi as quickly as they discarded foreign cloth. To me foreign cloth for this country means foreign Government. I wish this was accepted as a self- evident proposition.

218,,MY HEALTH,"
    
 It is a matter of great sorrow to me that my health should cause anxiety to many friends. Hitherto I have allowed Mahadev Desai, subject to censorship, to write whatever he has wished about my health, seeing that the break-downs, important or unimportant, occurred whilst I was travelling, and were supposed to be due to fatigue, and because those who were in charge of me during the travels had a responsibility about my bodily condition. But circumstances have now altered. I am having a respite from travels and onerous public duties. I am taking part only to the extent that I wish in reorganizing some of the activities in Gujarat, specially educational, for which I am perhaps predominantly responsible. I have, therefore, felt called upon to take up what has been a hobby of a lifetime, namely, dietetic experiments. They are to me as important as many of the most important activities which have engrossed me from time to time, and it was in the course
 of these experiments that the present so-called break-down has occurred. The alarming registrations of doctors’ instruments have had no reponse in my own feeling. But I have accepted the statement of medical friends that very often blood-pressure patients feel no evil effects, although they may be stealthily present in the body and must, therefore, be guarded  against. Happily, however, even these instruments registered last Sunday a very great improvement, a fall from 214mm. systolic to 178mm. and a rise from 120mm. [sic] diastolic to 118mm. I am also taking the rest prescribed by Dr. Haribhai Desai and his medical companions, and carrying on my dietetic experiments under their observations and  guidance.  Dr. Muthu who seems to have made special study of dietetics is  also kindly guiding me by correspondence.
 Having given all this information, I would implore newspaper correspondents to curb their pen and kindly to forget me and my health for the time being. And I would ask anxious friends not to worry about my health, accepting my assurance that I am in no hurry to die and that, therefore, I shall be taking all the care of my body that is humanly possible for me, and is consistent with the ideals to which the body is dedicated and which I hold to be more precious than the body. Let the friends rest assured that, if the nation has any use for this body of mine, it is because a serious attempt has been made for many a long year to hold it in trust for those ideals. I would ask them also the share my belief, which I hold even at the risk of being dubbed a fatalist, that not one hair of anyone’s body can be touched without His will and that when He has no use for our bodies, He defies all the care, attention and skill that money, prestige, patriotism, friendship and what not can summon to one’s assistance. This belief does not mean that I do not want to take advantage of the assistance  that medical friends all over India ungrudgingly and most generously render to me. I take that assistance gladly and faithfully. For God has given me no inkling of His intentions, but He has imposed upon me the duty of taking care of the body consistently with other more imperative obligations which, in my opinion, He has imposed upon me in common with the rest of humanity.

I gladly publish the following first instalmentlibtech_280_footnotelibtech_281_footnoteof notes by Prof.
  R. 	Malkani about the 	distress in 	Sind which was 	truly no 	less acute 	than in 	Gujarat. But 	as I have already 	remarked before, 	Gujarat attracted 	the widest 	attention not merely 	because of its being 	the store- 	house of 	India’s donors, but 	also, and 	perhaps more, because it 	found an 	army of 	workers under 	Vallabhbhai Patel 	ready and determined to 	handle and 	organize the 	task of 	relieving distress.

220,,CORRESPONDENCE,"
    
 If for nothing else, I cannot refrain from publishing the foregoinglibtech_282_footnotelibtech_283_footnotefor its subtle wit and sarcasm. Unfortunately for me, I am responsible for the phrase ‘blot on Hinduism’, notwithstanding my claim, often repudiated I know, to be a sanatani Hindu. If the institution of war, in spite of its being contrary to the spirit of the Christian teaching, may be said to be a blot upon Christianity because war is universal in Christendom, untouchability may  safely  be regarded as a blot Hinduism in spite of the contention of a growing number of Hindus that untouchability has no place in true Hinduism. If the expression pains some Hindus, it is a healthy sign. When it pains the majority of Hindus and they repudiate the charge, there will be no occasion to repeat it. And if it is a blot, why may not a Mussalman who believed in the truth and purity of Hinduism hold with his Hindu co-member that it is a blot ?

 MY DEAR C. R.,
 Herewith Kelappan’s letter. I have asked him to discuss his scheme with you. Whatever you think is feasible should be done. You will not hesitate to sanction anything for fear of funds being exhausted. All I am anxious about is that whatever work is done is substantial and honest.
 I hope you are now not worrying about my health. I have not yet taken any vow about the milk and I am not going to do anything unless I find the experiment to be absolutely successful. And not only  I am carefully watching myself, but so also are the  Ahmedabad doctors. It is open to them to veto the experiment at any time they like and I have promised to stop it. But I want you, instead of thinking of somehow dodging and making me to take milk, find out doctors or physicians who will help me to arrive at a proper, purely vegetarian diet which will be more than a substitute for milk. I am sure it is perfectly possible. Do please therefore think over my suggestion.
 Have you heard from Singapore friends at all? If we are to go, I should like to start during the first week of April, because the hot weather commences in right earnest in April in Ahmedabad and it would be better to avoid it. And then there is the talk of a visit to Burma from Singapore. I should like to negotiate it and, if that also is to be done, there is very little time left. And then there are two invitations from Europe to go there during July and August.libtech_284_footnoteI  am inclined to accept them. The idea is cooking in my brain. One is from the World’s Youth Peace Movement. It seems to be an important movement managed by a good organization. You may also consider the propriety or otherwise of accepting these invitations.

  	I have your letter. I am very glad you have written to me so rankly 	and fully. Bad though this proposed wedding of the ex Maharajah of 	Indore is, I would like you to understand the distincion between 	that wedding and the Simon Commission. The Simon Commission is a 	public thing, whereas the wedding is a private affair. A wedding 	cannot affect the future of three hundred millions of India but the 	doings of the Simon Commission are calculated for better or for 	worse to affect the future of the whole of India. You can now 	understand the public resentment over the Simon  Commission. Nobody 	thinks anything of the misdeeds of private Englishmen or other white 	men. But when an Englishman does anything wrong in his official 	capacity, it is immediately resented and quite properly too. If you 	have not yet understood or do not appreciate the distinction I have 	made, please write to me.    
 You ask me whether I would again come to Ceylon if one lakh rupees worth of khadi is taken up by the people there. I have no doubt that the generous people of Ceylon are quite capable of taking up more than a lakh rupees worth of khadi because there is nothing strange about [it], but what will induce me to come back to Ceylon is another donation to khadi. Buying of khadi is merely exchanging, valuable as that is, and donation to khadi enables me to widen the sphere of work among the poorest classes.

225,,HAKIM AJMAL KHAN MEMORIAL,"
    
 Readers know that this memorial is with regard to the Nationalist Muslim University in Delhi. This Vidyapith is not meant exclusively for Muslims. Hindus may also join it. The teachers too are not exclusively Muslim; Hindus and Christians also are there. However, as in the case of the Gujarat Vidyapith, where the students are mostly Hindus, since Muslim students rarely join it, so at the Jamia Millia too, few Hindus are enrolled. If the authorities of the Gujarat Vidyapith could be blamed for the reluctance of Muslim students the authorities of the Muslim university can also be blamed for the reluctance of Hindu students to join them. Considering the present vitiated atmosphere we should be content and grateful to God if the management and the staff of both the institutions are free from rancour and mutually accomodating. It is my belief that just as the Gujarat Vidyapith will contribute substantially towards the attainment of swaraj and will help to safeguard it, that is, in implementing such constructive programmes as Hindu-Muslim unity, etc., so too will this Vidyapith at Delhi. This prophecy of mine may or may not come true but if we owe anything to Hakim Saheb, and if it brings us credit to have a memorial to him for ever with us, we should all, to the best of our abilities, contribute to his Fund. The Fund is growing at less thana snail’s pace, from which I gather that the Gujaratis do not respond to this cause as they do to other causes. I regard it my duty to say that
 this is not the correct attitude. Those who wish to achieve Hindu- Muslim unity should help this cause. Everyone is inclined to contribute to a popular cause. People remain indifferent to a fund which is not popular, though it be beneficial in the long run, if there is no one to rouse them. This is my appeal to that indifferent class. It is not that the readers of Navajivan always encourage only what is popular. The readers of Navajivan have contributed in other ways, if not in the form of money, to funds that were not popular but would increase people’s strength. They must now show that liberal spirit and power of discretion. Let not the Jamia Millia be crushed between the two opposing forces. Since the Jamia Millia does not nourish the present atmosphere of hatred, the general Muslim masses appear indifferent towards it, and if the Hindus too should be indifferent under the presumption that Muslims alone should support it, the Jamia Millia would be nowhere and Hakimji’s memorial would meet with the same fate. It is the special duty of Swarajists, Hindus as well as Muslims, not to let this happen. I hope the readers of Navajivan will observe this dharma. I suggest donors should not rest content after giving in their personal contributions but should also try to collect as much as possible from their neighbours.

226,,TO THE PEASANTS OF BARDOLI,"
    
 There is not a corner of India familiar with the word ‘swaraj’ which is not also familiar with Bardoli. The country has, therefore, a right to expect something distinctive and courageous in all the tasks that are undertaken by this taluk. You have taken the very grave step of offering satyagraha. You have now no alternative but to prove yourselves worthy of it. No one could have found fault with you if you had not taken that step. However, having once taken it, you will make yourselves an object of ridicule in the eyes of the whole of India if you beat a retreat now. No one can blame Bardoli for the postponement of the fight for swaraj that it had pioneered. People in a far-off province committed an act of indiscretion and the Bardoli movement had to be postponed. I have not the slightest doubt that it was all to the good. However, on this occasion, I think it is proper to remind you that thereafter you have not been keeping to the extent you should your vows about khadi, untouchability and so on. And,
 because of this laxity on your part, I have my doubts about how far you will adhere to the pledge you have taken this time. I hope you will dispel this fear by your determined conduct.
 Shri Vallabhbhai Patel had given you a clear warning. It is not in his hands to make a success of your struggle. The key to success is in your own hands. Even if he goes to the gallows, Vallabhbhai cannot fulfil your pledge. As the saying goes: “One cannot go to heaven unless one dies.” So also one has to fulfil one’s own pledges. I do not think there are two opinions about the justice of your cause. If, however, you do not have the strength to prove it you will not triumph despite its justice. If you understand it, rather than till the land only to pay the vighotilibtech_288_footnotelibtech_289_footnoteit would be saving yourselves a great deal of trouble if those who collect this tax confiscated your land. If the Government will not listen to you and you do not bow down to them—and if the Government aims at ruining you, it will not send you to jails, but will rather seize your property. As in Kheda, here too they would confiscate your utensils and your land. Nevertheless, you have one invaluable thing which they cannot attach and that is your soul, your self-respect. If you put your person and all your property in one scale and your self-respect in the other, the latter will always be found heavier. Satyagraha is the mantra for safeguarding it. Victory is is yours if you are prepared to withstand whatever loss you may incur while safeguarding it and you will prove worthy of having a leader like Vallabhbhai; moreover, you yourselves will be included in the catergory of the courageous. You must see to it that by fulfilling your pledge you enhance your own prestige as well as that of Vallabhbhai, Gujarat and the whole of India.

  	Under British rule, millions of children are starving for want of 	nourishing food and they are shivering in winter for want of 	sufficient clothing. And this I say not of the cities of India, 	which contain but a microscopic minority of the population of India, 	but I say this without fear of contradiction about the seven hundred 	thousand villages of the country scattered over a surface 1,900 	miles long and 1,500 miles broad.  	I suppose your first question ‘under non-Christian Religions’ is 	included in the second. But, if your first question relates to India 	before British rule, I can only give you my inference that the 	little ones were infinitely happier than they are now under British 	rule.  	Your third question is difficult to answer. Which Jesus have you in 	mind? The Jesus of history? Not being a critical student of history, 	 I do not know the Jesus of history. Do you mean the Jesus whom 	Christian England and Christian Europe represent? If  so,  your 	question is, it seems to me, already answered. If you mean the 	mystical Jesus of Sermon on the Mount who has still to be found, I 	suppose the

All public institutions have their ups and downs. Has not the House of  Commons  got  its hypocrisy and humbug? I know that it is no model for us, but for the British nation, modelled as it is, it would be wrong to decry the House of Commons. They can only mend it wherever it is possible, unless there are Englishmen who consider the civilization that the House of Commons represents is worthless. Personally, I still cling to the ideal that the Congress represents, and, therefore, generally observe silence where I cannot serve and I ask you and co-workers who are non- violent non-co-operators to do likewise.

239,,REMINDING OF OLD TIMES,"
    
 Sjt. Shankarrao Dev and Sjt. V. B. Harolikar were convicted the other day at Poona under Section 124-A and sentenced to undergo imprisonment for two years with hard labour. There were two charges against them: waging war against the King (Section 121) and attempting to excite disaffection against the Government established by law in British India (Section 124-A). Sjt. Dev as editor of Swarajya wrote the article which was the subject-matter of the offence and Sjt. Harolikar was the publisher. I print elsewhere the authorized translation of the offending article as produced before the court by the prosecution. Though it admits of improvement, it cannot be called an unfair presentation of the original.
 The accused will not be defended by counsel though free assistance was volunteered by Dadasaheb Karandikar and other lawyers of distinction. Friends advised them to be defended. They were told that everybody nowadays sought legal advice without any slur being cast on them. But these non-co-operators were adamant. They did not care what others did. They were non-co-operators on principle and therefore did not wish to listen to any advice based on prudential considerations. I knew Sjt. Dev in Yeravda. He with Sjt. Dastane had undertaken a severe fast from which it was difficult for me to wean them. I tender my congratulations to these friends on their firmness in abiding by their own convictions. For I am convinced that of such will the Kingdom of Swaraj be made. They have undoubtedly brought swaraj nearer by their crystal-like sacrifice. Let no one think that such solitary individual sacrifice has no place in national upbuilding, or that it does not produce great consequences. Indeed, it is the purest sacrifice alone that will count in the end. It lays the surest and the purest foundation of swaraj.
 The article is undoubtedly written to promote disaffection against the existing Government. To promote such disaffection is the bounden duty of every nationalist. Every Congressman is, I hope, an avowed enemy of the existing Government. We have no quarrel with men, but if we are worthy of swaraj, we must destroy the existing system of Government by all legitimate and peaceful means. The recent debate in the Assembly on the Statutory Com- mission was an object-lesson in disaffection in which all parties, be it said to their eternal credit, whole-heartedly joined. The late Harchandrai Vishandas
 risked his life in travelling to Delhi for the sake of registering his vote in favour of disaffection. One daily comes across stronger articles than Dev’s in point of disaffection. His is a reasoned appeal to Hindus and Mussalmans to disown the protection of a Government that enslaves the country and if fight they must, fight fairly, squarely, honourably. I have read the article more than once and whilst I may not use the same language, there is nothing in the argument that I cannot adopt. A prejudiced critic may cavil at the verse quoted from the Mahabharata. But, read together with the context, its meaning is clear. We have no King. We have a rule masquerading under the sacred name of law. Rulers are many. They come and go. The rule abides. But it is a corrupt, mischievous, soul-destroying rule which has to be ended at any cost. The cost that Dev and people like him are prepared to pay has to be consistent with their creed of non-violence. They seek to establish the rule of real law not by killing other people, however misguided or cruel they may be, but by being themselves killed, if need be, in the attempt. This is the necessary limitation imposed upon them by their very conception of swaraj. It is, therefore, most difficult for me to understand why these two innocent workers were singled out for prosecution, or shall I call it, persecution. If they are fit for imprisonment, Lala Lajpat Rai and company are surely fit for transportation, if nothing worse. If it be said that the Assembly gives members privileges for statutory crimes which ordinary mortals outside do not enjoy, there is then, perhaps, no one who is guilty of such calculated and deliberate disaffection towards the ‘Government established by law’ as I am. The whole of my being is worked in order to achieve the destruction of this Government and to that end to spread disaffection as wide as possible, and I think I can lay a fair claim to having a somewhat larger audience than Dev and Harolikar. But real consistency, justice and courage are hardly to be expected of governments that are based upon exploitation sustained by violence.

240,,"HANDLOOM v.
SPINNING-WHEEL","
    
 Apropos of the contention often thoughtlessly advanced than the handloom is the only thing worth preserving and that it can only be preserved through the use of mill-spun yarn, Sjt. C. Balaji Rao writes:
 An effective answer to those who, in order to belittle the charkha, would exalt the handloom, is given here. Lord Curzon was voicing the opinions of his departmental scientific advisers when he declared at the Delhi Durbar that it was inevitable that the handloom should be superseded by the powerloom, just as the hand punkah was being superseded by the electric fan.
 Of course, Lord Curzon’s dictum need not be accepted as a conclusive answer if the longevity of the handloom can be sustained through mill yarn or any other means save the spinning-wheel. And these pages, I hope, are daily making it clear that hand-spinning can save the handloom in spite of the prediction of Lord Curzon. Indeed, if the wheel regains its ancient status in our national life, the handloom and many other domestic industries must revive automatically.

 "
241,,THE ORIGIN OF IT,"
    
 I observe that newspaper paragraphs have been going round that I have predicted my own death by the 12th of March next and that, as a consquence, I am in a despondent mood. It is also stated that I am my own astrologer. I would have passed over this delicious morsel of news but for the fact that many anxious friends have taken it seriously and have, therefore, been upset. If the enquiring friends had only followed my advice never to depend upon newspaper paragraphs, but always to ascertain, at their source, the truth of statements seen in the Press, they would have been spared all that anxiety. The correspon- dent who set the news in motion could also have spared the enquirers considerable anxiety if he had been good enough to test the truth of statements made by him. But if the correspondents became more scrupulous about statements they may make, their occupation would be largely gone. I may then state for the information of friends that I am not an astrologer, I know nothing of the science of astrology and that I consider it to be a science, if it is a science, of doubtful value, to be severely left alone by those who have any faith in Providence. Nor
 am I in a despondent mood, despondency being foreign to my nature. What precisely, however, did happen was this. When I was convicted six years ago and was asked what I thought about the prospects of swaraj, I said that it was highly likely that there was the hand of God in the limit of six years and that during that time either we should win swaraj or that I should die and that six years’ time was long enough time for the country to win her freedom. This statement was based upon an observation of the state of things as then prevailed in India. I never attached any importance to it beyond this that I should myself leave no stone unturned to contribute so far as an individual could to the attainment of our freedom. The statement was on a par with the conditional statement made by me in 1920 about attainment of swaraj within one year.libtech_321_footnoteThat statement has served the purpose, if of nothing else, of giving satisfaction to my critics of laughing at my folly and to me that of seeing a tremendous effort being made by the country during that eventful year. I did not hesitate to say at the end of the year, when the Congress was held in Ahmedabad, that whilst we had not been able to achieve statutory swaraj, the freedom that politically- minded India gave itself and the unity that seemed to exist among the various communities amounted to substantial swaraj, and that if the people had carried out the conditions mentioned by me at Calcutta and Nagpur, they could have even attained statutory swaraj within the year. But even as I remained unaffected, in spite of the failure to attain statutory swaraj within the year specified, so do I remain unaffected in spite of the approaching termination of six years which, by the by, is not the 12th of March but the 17th of March nextlibtech_322_footnote.  Not  only  am  I not preparing for the imminent approach of the dissolution of my body, but I am making every effort to put it in as good order and condition as is possible, and have already fixed some provisional appointments for the coming summer and the rainy season. After all the relevant portion of my talk six years ago, twice repeated to friends, was the attainment of India’s freedom. Nothing depends upon the death of an individual, be he ever so great, but much depends upon the freedom of India. Let us, therefore, all forget individuals and concentrate upon attaining that precious freedom which will never be

 showered upon us from Downing Street or elsewhere, but which can be ours the for taking any day even inside of the 17th of March. No great preparation save a mental revolution is necessary for us— Hindus, Mussalmans, Parsis, Sikhs, Christians and Jews and others—to feel as one indivisible nation and as having a common stake in the country, nor is more than a mental revolution required for Hindus to forget that anyone is to be considered superior to any other and to regard the so-called ‘untouchables’ to be their own kith and kin, nor is much effort required if we but make the resolve to achieve complete boycott of foreign cloth. I repeat what I have said so often, at the risk of exciting laughter, that if we achieve this triple programme,  no power on earth can prevent us from attaining our birthright. It is for us to work out our own salvation as it is in us to compass our own undoing.

    MY 	DEAR FRIEND,  February 	24, 1928 
  	I have your very delightful letter which I deeply appreciate. I must 	not however accept your advice. ‘Resist not evil’ with me has 	never meant passive resistance. The word ‘passive resistance’ I 	have described as a misnomer for the resistance which I have known 	and offered. The paraphrase of ‘resist not evil’ means resist 	not evil with evil, and therefore necessarily means resist evil with 	good. And, if at the present moment, I do not seem to be actively 	resisting evil, it is a mere appearance. For, if you are a constant 	reader of Bhagavad Gita, you will recall the passage, 	“He who sees action in inaction and inaction in action  sees  	truly.”libtech_325_footnotelibtech_326_footnoteOr  is  there  not  the  corresponding English saying 	“He also serves who waits and prays” or something like that? 	Anyway such is absolutely my position today. If I could see my way 	clear leading to boycott movement, do not imagine for one moment 	that I would sit still for a single moment. But the way is not 	clear. It may clear any day. I want a living faith on the part of 	known workers in the boycott as I have prescribed from time to time 	in the pages of Young India. I am positive that no  other  	boycott  can possibly succeed, as I am equally positive that this 	boycott must succeed if there is enough work behind it. Huge 	demonstrations that have been taking place in Calcutta are good in 	their way, but not good enough for me. There is no reality behind 	them. They have their use too, but they cannot enthuse me as an 	active soldier.  	I hope I am clear. If not, do please tackle me again.

 CHI. CHHAGANLAL,
 I received your first letter today and the second letter three days earlier. I have given them to Mahadev for everyone to read. You have done a good job if you have seen in a short period  all  those  institutions as closely as possible.
 Look after your health and for doing so, you have to use a mosquito-net. Do not have the least hesitation in using it there. You might come across people who would criticise it the first day, the next day the same people would praise you for your   well-maintained health, and on the third, they would follow your  example. Mosquito-net is just an example.
Do not hesitate to write to me. I have always liked your letters.
Reading your handwriting is never a problem.
 I knew that you were hesitant to go to Orissa because of my health, but it is your dharma to overcome that hesitation and to help you in that is my dharma. I believe that my health is very good. The experiment with milkless diet seems to be successful so far. I take 8 tolas of wheat, 3/4 tola olive oil, 4 tolas almonds, one seer tandarjolibtech_327_footnoteand 6 to 9 oranges. I still need to increase my diet. If I can do that gradually, I hope to regain part or entire weight I have lost.
 Chi. Ramdas and Nimu have gone to Rajkot. From there, they will go to Amreli and will be back here  in  15  days.libtech_328_footnoteJamnadas  is tempting Ramdas, so he may stay on there. He may even stay there if he has to live permanently in Amreli. He will make a final decision on coming here. These days he is cheerful and free from worries.
 Brian Gabriel is here for the last two days. He will leave on Sunday. Govindji (Gregg) is coming for ten days. Others too, keep on coming and going. Do not worry at all about my health.

 DEAR SATIS BABU,
 I have your letter. I did indeed know that Congress Committees were practically sleeping. It would be a great thing if you can put life into them without giving rise to any suspicion about your notice.
 What is this British goods boycott demonstration? And what are these ten thousand volunteers? I see Dr. Ray also has been in this thing. Please let me know the inwardness of this movement.
 I do not at all mind your having gone third class if it agrees with you. I am glad you are giving Kuhne’s baths to Nikhil. Why not consult Bose. He is a water-cure specialist. You know he had an institution in Bow Bazaar where I used to go for my treatment. At that time Bose was away, but Mazmudar used to give me massage and electric bath. Often the simple remedy succeeds where specialists fail.
 The meaning you have given to the word ‘sankara’ is original, but thoroughly in keeping with my definition of ‘varna’, and, after all, my definition is the literal definition of the Veda. The third chapter is undoubtedly the key chapter of the Gita. The first two are introductory and the last fifteen a commentary. I think I told you that for some time now in the Ashram we have been reciting the Gita every day, the whole of it being finished every fortnight, Chapters VII and VIII, XII and XIII, XIV and XV, and XVI and XVII being recited each pair one day.

251,,WHO WILL RESCUE THIS HUMAN COW?,"
    
 A gentleman, nearly 70 years old, belonging to the Brahmabhatt caste was married four times. All four wives are dead. He has no son, only a daughter who is fifteen. She has already been married. He now wishes to marry for the fifth time in order to have someone to run his household and fulfil his desire for a son. This gentleman has been abroad. He held a decent post in the Gaekwar’s State. He has lost his eyesight owing to cataract. This, much-married old man is waiting for some cruel father who is prepared to sell his daughter. Some young men of the Brahmabhatt community are trying to save the meek cow from being sent in this way to the slaughter-house. One of them wrote a letter to the old man in order to persuade him not to commit such an act. The gentleman has replied to it at length. A copy of this has been sent to me. I give below extractslibtech_332_footnotelibtech_333_footnotefrom it :
 I publish this letter at the risk of being considered foolish. If there is an absence of feeling for young girls in the Brahmabhatt community, if sensitive people in the community lack courage and if there is no such thing as public opinion in it, no one will be able to prevent this ill-mat-ched union. However, the handful of kind-hearted young men or women belonging to that community must not neglect their duty. Reform, if it is to be carried out in a peaceful manner, can be carried out only through love and patience. We must put up with anger in any form if it is the re-sult of self-interest. We should not be dazzled by anyone trying to impress by his knowledge. Within the last one year, two such marriages could be prevented through diligence and by arousing public opinion. An engagement that had already taken place was broken off whereas in this instance there has only been talk of an engagement. If public opinion can be created the meek cow is likely to be rescued from being slaughtered.
 Let us now examine the letter from this gentleman, who had been to England. I am unable to understand what he intends to prove by giv-ing instances of men becoming fathers at an advanced age. His arguments are the same old ones that have always been advanced by sinners. In novels, we have come across murderers describing the benefits of murder in beautiful language. And we have also come across robbers singing praises of their deeds. These acts may well have benefited those who committed them; but they have not benefited the world. Let us take the practice of ill-matched unions. In the instances
 
 which have been cited in the above extract, the men concerned may well have seen in it advantage to themselves. However, these old men of experience who are motivated by self-interest and  a  desire  to gratify their lust are misinterpreting these instances in trying to get their own acts approved. This gentleman does not have the time and does not feel the need to think what these young girls must have thought when marrying these old men, how often they must have sighed. If one old man has the right to marry a girl of thirteen or fifteen, all old men should have this right and, if all of them were to follow this practice, we can easily imagine what consequences it would have on the people. Nowhere in the world have wise men been known to commend ill-matched unions. They have been condemned in all countries and in India we actually see the many evil consequences that follow from them. Hence, I hope this gentleman would review his own letter, written in an angry and impulsive mood, in a new light and gain control over his lust. And, if the cannot do it, he should look for a widow who is prepared to marry him of her own free will.
 The craving for a male offspring needs to be given up. It cannot be said that this desire is always noble. Amongst a people where the birth and death ratio is regularly balanced it is noble to restrain rather than indulge the desire for a son. In India today because we are slaves, everyone is in a state of fear, and because we have lost the capacity to protect ourselves, our relatives as well as our property, I regard it as a sin to beget children.
 Now about the desire to be nursed. What a misconceived idea that only one’s own people can render this help. I regard it as the limit of audacity to grab an innocent girl by bribing or luring her father and then regarding her as one’s own. Instead of calling that girl one’s own, it would be nearer the truth to say that ‘a slave girl has been bought’. As for service one can still get good loyal servants if one is prepared to pay well. I wish to leave aside now the other atrocious ideas in the letter. If he happens to read  this  article,  I  humbly request him to calmly reflect on it and save himself from the misadventure on which he is about to embark.

 Navajivan, 26-2-1928"
252,,STUDENTS’ NOBLE SATYAGRAHAlibtech_334_footnote,"
    
 In referring to the universality of satyagraha I have time and again observed in these columns that it is capable of application in the social no less than in the political field. It may equally be employed against Government, society, or one’s own family, father, mother, husband or wife, as the case may be. For it is the beauty of this spiritual weapon that, when it is completely free from the taint of himsa and its use is actuated purely and solely by love it may be used with absolute impunity in any connection and in any circumstances whatever. A concrete instance of its use against a social evil was furnished by the brave and spirited students of Dharmaj (in Kheda District) a few days back. The facts as gleaned from the various communications about the incident received by me were as follows :
 A gentleman of Dharmaj, some days back, gave a caste dinner in connection with the twelfth-day ceremony of the death of his mother. It was preceded by a keen controversy about the subject among the young men of the place who shared with a number of other local inhabitants their strong dislike of this custom. They felt that, on this occasion, something must be done. Accordingly, most of them took all or some of the following three vows :
  Not 	to join 	their elders at 	the dinner 	or otherwise 	partake of the 	food served on 	that occasion.  To 	observe fast 	on the 	day of the 	dinner as 	an emphatic protest 	against this practice.  To 	bear patiently 	and cheerfully 	any harsh 	treatment that might 	be accorded 	to them 	by their 	elders for taking 	this step. 
 In pursuance of this decision, quite a large number of students, including some children of tender age, fasted on the day on which the dinner was given and took upon themselves the wrath of their so- called elders. Nor was the step free from the dangers of serious pecuniary consequences to the students. The ‘elders’ threatened to stop the allowances of their boys and even to withdraw any financial aid that they were giving to local institutions, but the boys stood firm. As many as two hundred and eighty-five students thus refused to take part in the caste dinner and most of them fasted.
 
 Navajivan. 26-2-1928.
 I tender my congratulations to these boys and hope that everywhere students will take a prominent part in effecting social reform. They hold in their pocket, as it were, the key to social reform and the protection of their religion, just as they have in their possession the key to swaraj—though they may not be aware of it owing to their negligence or carelessness. But I hope that the example set by the students of Dharmaj will awaken them to a sense of their power. In my opinion, the true shraddha of the deceased lady was performed by these young men fasting on that day, while those who gave the dinner wasted good money and set a bad example to the poor. The rich, monied class ought to use their God-given wealth for philanthropic purposes. They should understand that the poor cannot afford to give caste dinners on wedding or on funeral ceremonies. These bad practices have proved to be the ruin of many a poor man. If the money that was spent in Dharmaj on the caste dinner had been used for helping poor students, or poor widows, or for khadi or cow- protection or the amelioration of the untouchables, it would have  borne fruit and brought peace to the departed soul. But, as it is, the dinner has already been forgotten, it has profited nobody and it has caused pain to the students and the sensile section of the Dharmaj public.
 Let no one imagine that the satyagraha has gone in vain because it did not succeed in preventing the dinner in question from taking place. The students themselves knew that there was little possibility of their satyagraha producing any immediate tangible result. But we may safely take it that, if they do not let their vigilance go to sleep, no shethialibtech_335_footnotelibtech_336_footnotewill again dare to give a post-mortem dinner. A chronic and long-standing social evil cannot be swept away at a stroke; it always requires patience and perseverance.
 When will the ‘elders’ of our society learn to recognize the signs of the times? How long will they be slaves to custom instead of using it as a means for the amelioration of society and the country? How long will they keep their children divorced from a practical application of the knowledge which they are helping them to acquire? When will they rescue their sense of right and wrong from its present state of trance and wake up and be  mahajanslibtech_337_footnotelibtech_338_footnotein the true sense of the word?

And I am sorry 	to have to say—but it is true—that no one else can successfully 	replace you at the present moment. The familiarity that your stay in 	South Africa might have produced has certainly not bred contempt;  	on  the contrary, it has gained greater respect for you from those 	whose respect counts for the work.

 our own countrymen. You may not desert them. Do please therefore let me have a reassuring letter. Of course I don’t know what the Government may want you do to. Verb. sap.

    MY 	DEAR RITCH,  February 	27, 1928 
  	I was glad to receive your long letter though a business letter. 	Unlike you, I am going to commence with domestic business. I was 	distressed to hear from Miss Knudsen, who by the way is staying with 	me at the present moment, that you had lost one of your legs. But 	she was unable to give me the reason for it. You shall give it. And 	how is Mrs. Ritch doing? And what about Erick and Harold? The 	daughters’ names I forget. I hope they won’t accuse me of want 	of chivalry. What are they all doing? For me, I am dictating from a 	sick-bed, not that I feel anything particular within me, but doctors 	have warned me against exerting myself either physically or mentally 	for some time yet. Mrs. Gandhi is keeping quite well. Harilal has 	practically forsaken me. He drinks, eats and makes himself merry. 	But he is a brave boy in    
 one sense that he makes no secret of his vice and his rebellion is an open rebellion. If he had not done his creditors down, I would not have minded his other lapses as I mind this betrayal of his creditors. Manilal you know is in Phoenix and Ramdas and Devdas are assisting me in my work. Polak is in India just now, travelling about his business. I met him for a few minutes in Madras and he is likely to call at the Ashram before he re-em-barks for London. Andrews is a frequent visitor to the Ashram and he is due here about the third of March. This Ashram is a big, growing affair. We are at the present moment supporting a population of about two hundred, quite a little village by ourselves. And not only do we go through all the processes of cotton till it comes out as cloth, we are conducting a little dairy, a little tannery and we are having a little bit of farming. We have some fruit-trees and we grow our own vegetables. We grow some grains and enough fodder for cattle. We have as a rule one or two Europeans with us and there is a constant stream of such visitors. Life is very simple, and yet not simple enough for the Indian setting. You can’t have any notion from that distance of the grinding poverty of the masses. And if we could only sustain ourselves well enough for our work in less, I would straightway reduce our expenses which amount to a pound per month on an aver-age including clothing but excluding rental. Of course we are paying no rent. We have nearly 75 boys and girls for whom we are condu-cting what I may call a model school making tuitional experiments.
 Now for business. My own opinion is that neither Andrews nor Sastri could have got more than they have. I quite agree with you that these Union Ministers will be driven to getting out of the bargain. But if Sastri is permitted to remain in South Africa for any length of time,   I am inclined to think that his correct, that is, his righteous, diplomacy will triumph over the crooked diplomacy of South Africa. If we are to achieve the full result of the struggle of 1906 to 1914, we must act on the square and cleanse our stables, and I feel sure that if those who have entered surreptitiously will cease to be greedy, will make a clear confession and truthfully, not encourage any single fraudulent entrant in future, the position can be saved and the condition of the resident population steadily improved. If, however, the desire is not only to cover surreptitious entries already accomplished, but to leave the door open for more, I think that the community will be unable to remain in South Africa with any degree of self-respect. It will hold on some- how or other I have no doubt, it will be difficult to wipe out such a
 large and resourceful community, but it would be a sordid existence; whereas I would like the Indians of South Africa to play an honourable part not merely for the upbuilding of South Africa but for the upbuilding of India itself. If we play the game in South Africa, it is possible in course of time to secure full rights of citizenship. You may share this letter with any friend you like.
With regards to you all,
 Yours sincerely,

I have your letter.
 You did well in sending a telegram to Dr. Muthu. I have had good experience of him. He has a great reputation. Send me a telegram when you hear that he is on his way, so that I may write to him again. I have in any case to reply to his wire.
 If you find him a friendly person, consult him about  your  health too. Swelling indicate weakness of the heart. It is proper that you have stopped physical movements. But you need fresh air the most.
 Manilallibtech_352_footnotewants Chi. Jekilibtech_353_footnoteto join him immediately. He seems to be doing well in Aden. He has also paid Jeki’s fare to Thomas Cook. He is suffering from hydrocele and wishes to be operated upon in Aden, that is why he wants her there. I believe that he would have called her even if he had not been suffering from the disease. He wants the children too. Jeki is completely at home here. The kids are making great progress in their studies. All of them keep fit. But I feel that, since Manilal wants her, it is Jeki’s clear duty to go to Aden. She, too, is ready to go. Let me know your opinion about this, so that I may act accordingly.
I am keeping well.

But he seems to have taken to it very gracefully and 	pleasantly.  	Now about your donation. I did not know that you were a pucka bania 	by choice. But you little knew that you were dealing with a still 	more pucka bania voluntarily acting as the agent of Daridranarayana. 	You say that you had announced a donation to the Ashram of Rs. 500 	on the marriage of your son and you propose, to use the language of 	law, wrongfully to divert part of the funds to the payment of a debt 	voluntarily incurred by you with Sjt. Manilal Kothari. How can a 	donation be utilized for discharge of a debt whe- ther moral or 	legal? And what connection can you promise to pay the All-India 	Spinners’ Association have with the Ashram which repres- ents 	multifarious activities—tanning, dairying, farming, experiments in 	hygiene, cotton-growing, ginning, carding, spinning, weaving, 	dyeing, printing, carpentry, smithy, conducting educational 	experiments, looking after widows, taking care of so-called 	untouchables, etc.? And why such a donation, not paid on the date on 	which it was announced,    
 should not carry double interest in the hands of the donor who from date of announcement becomes a trustee? You will please deal with these conundrums before I can deal with your cheque finally. And I would ask you in deciding this question to consult Mrs. Dunichand, who, when I had the pleasure of being under your roof, was found to be less bania-like than you have proved to be.

 I have your letter. If you have the courage of your convictions, then of course you will not send the two boys to the school and make either private arrangements for them or send them to a national school. I must at the same time say that I do not like the tone of the letter you adopted, and it would have been far more dignified if you had frankly told the head master that you did not send your boys because of the national declration of boycott. The boys would have been sent out of the school, it is true; but it would have been a courted and, therefore, dignified dismissal.

273,,FOREIGN PROPAGANDAlibtech_362_footnote,"
  
 I have no desire to start any hot controversy over the question of foreign propaganda, but I publish the foregoing as it summarizes the views of many workers who hold them in no sense weakly because they do not express them in public. If the pure Non-co-operation of 1920 is not witnessed on an extensive scale at the present moment, it is most decidedly going deeper with some and everything that is happening today in the land goes to strengthen their belief. But they cannot make themselves felt by being vocal in season and out of season. On the contrary, they feel that they serve the cause of swaraj better by observing silence where they cannot serve by speech and helping humbly and actively wherever they can.

 "
274,,"CHAOS v.
MISRULE","
  
An esteemed friend writes :libtech_363_footnote
 It is not often that I intrude upon your expressions of political opinion. But a sentence of yours in a recent editorial, repeating a heresy uttered by you long ago, compels me to ask you whether you have measured your words with the care that one expects of an expounder of moral issues. You declare that you would accept chaos in exchange for freedom from the English yoke. That an Indian should desire and work for freedom from any foreign yoke is perfectly natural, normal and healthy. That anyone in his senses should exchange any kind of orderly government for chaos is simply incomprehensible, for the one implies some sort of discipline, whether imposed or stimulated, whereas the latter is the very negation of self-discipline. . . .
 If non-violence be, as you claim it to be, creative, purposeful, and divine in its nature, then chaos cannot be its consequence or characteristic. If you have used the term with deliberation, then I should comment that you have rendered no service to mankind, who need rather a reminder that they should acquire the cosmic vision rather than the chaotic one to which they are already prone. . . .
 There is no mistaking the earnestness running through the letter. And I have so much regard for the friend’s views, that if I could have
 
 suited mine to his, I would gladly have done so.
 But I must say that my choice was deliberate. Chaos means no rule, no order. Rule or order can come, does come out of no rule or no order, but never directly out of misrule or disorder masquerading under the sacred name of rule or order. My friend’s difficulty arises, I presume, out of his assumption that the present Government of India represents “some sort of discipline whether imposed or stimulated”. It is likely that our estimates of the existing system differ. My own estimate of it is that it is an unmitigated evil. No good therefore can come out of this evil. I hold misrule to be worse than no rule.
 Nor need my words cause any confusion in the minds of the ignorant or the violent. For I admit my correspondent’s contention that chaos can be the result only of violence. Have I not often said in these pages that if I were compelled to choose between this rule and violence I would give my vote for the latter though I will not, I could not, assist a fight based on violence? It would be a matter for me of Hobson’s choice. The seeming quiescence of today is a dangerous form of violence kept under suppression by greater violence or rather readiness for it. Is it not better that those who, out of a cowardly fear of death or dispossession, whilst harbouring violence refrain from it, should do it and win freedom from bondage or die gloriously in the attempt to vindicate their birthright?
 My non-violence is not an academic principle to be enunciated on favourable occasions. It is a principle which I am seeking to enforce every moment of my life in every field of activity. In my attempt, often frustrated through my own weakness or ignorance, to enforce non-violence, I am driven for the sake of the creed itself to countenance violence by way of giving mental approval to it. In 1921 I told the villagers near Bettiahlibtech_364_footnotethat they had acted like cowards in that they had instead of resisting the evil-minded Amlas left their wives and homes on their approach. On another occasion I expressed myself ashamed of a priest who said he had quietly slipped away and saved himself when a ruffian band had entered his temple to loot it and break the idol. I told him that if he could not die at his post defending his charge non-violently, he should have defended it by offering violent resistance. Similarly do I hold that, if India has no faith in non-violence, nor patience for it to work its way, then it is better for her to attain her freedom from the present misrule even by
 
 violence than that she should helplessly submit to a continuing rape of her belongings and her honour.
 Look at the shameless manner in which, for sustaining the spoliation of India, British statesmen (?) are setting one party against another. They have suddenly discovered the untouchables, for they seem to fear that the Hindu-Muslim dissensions alone might not prove enough secu-rity for retaining possession of the ‘most  glorious diadem in the British Crown’. They are trying to set the helpless princes against the people. Sir John Simon finds it necessary to play the same game. The penetrating intellect he is said to possess does not penetrate the very thin veil that covers the frauds that are set up for his edification and he finds nothing seriously amiss in the Indian atmosphere. This sort of ‘orderly discipline’ has unmanned and unn- erved the people as nothing in their previous history has ever done.
 My own position and belief are clear and unequivocal. I neither want the existing rule nor chaos. I want true order established without having to go through the travail of chaos. I want this disorder to be destroyed by non-violence, i.e., I want to convert the evil-doers. My life is dedicated to that task. And what I have written in the previous paragraphs directly flows from my knowledge of the working of non- violence which is the greatest force known to mankind. My belief in its efficacy is unshakable, so is my belief unshakable in the power of India to gain her freedom through non-violent means and no other. But this power of hers cannot be evoked by suppressing truth or facts however ugly they may for the moment appear to be. God forbid that India should have to engage in a sanguinary duel before she learns the lesson of non-violence in its fullness. But if that intermediate stage, often found to be necessary, is to be her lot, it will have to be faced as  a stage inevitable in her march towards freedom and certainly preferable to the existing order which is only so-called but which is like a whited sepulchre hiding undiluted violence underneath.

 Knowing your interest in Tolstoy, I am sending you copy of a circular just issued to members of the Tolstoy Society, as well as copy of a letter by Bernard Shaw.
 We are anxious that this Centenary Edition should find a place in public libraries and also that its publication should enable us to give assistance to members of Tolstoy’s family, who are in distress since the  Russian Revolution.
 Should you have an opportunity of mentioning the Edition to librarians or members of the committee of any of your Indian libraries, the Committee of the Tolstoy Society would feel greatly indebted to you.

277,,KHADI NEAR MEERUT,"
  
 Dr. Ray gave me soon after his recent visit to Meerut an account of his impressions. I take the following from his letter :libtech_367_footnote
 . . . I was taken to a village 20 miles north of the town where the peasants are comparatively prosperous.	In almost every house I visited the mother, the
 daughter and sometimes the daughter-in-law were found basking in the sun and spinning 10 to 12 count yarns. The coarse cloth woven in the village itself is used by the local people and ready-made sliver hawked about. In the field also side by side with the standing crops there are patches of cotton cultivation.
 
 The march of ‘civilization’ has not yet fully overtaken the unfortunate villagers, but they have begun to taste  of it.	The Banaras Gandhi Ashram
 with the help of a local band of devoted sacrificing workers is doing its level best but funds and proper organization are both badly needed.
The hum of the wheel need not die either in the Punjab or
 elsewhere in India, if we would be true to our trust. The band of workers from the Banaras Ashram who attracted Dr. Ray’s attention are working in and near that district to put khadi on a stable foo-ting. Now that he parent of the Ashram, Acharya Kripalani, is in the midst of his workers, there should be redoubled zeal on their part and  greater support and appreciation from the public.

 DEAR SISTER,
 I have your letter. I am happy to learn that there has been some improvement in Nikhil’s health. Rest and water-treatment may bring about a complete cure.
 Study the Ramayana well. Recite the quatrains and  couplets over and over again and meditate on them. Keep your   mind absolutely calm and never give way to depression. This is the teaching of Gita. This is the purpose of Ramanama. Those blessed by God do not regard sorrow as sorrow. Daily we chant here the verse :
It means that sorrow is not sorrow, happiness is not happiness.
 Sorrow is forgetting Vishnu; happiness is remembering Narayana. He who has Narayana in his heart, how can he know sorrow?

 DEAR MOTILALJI,"
279,"March 3, 1928",LETTER TO MOTILAL NEHRU,"
  
 
 THE ASHRAM, SABARMATI,
 March 3, 1928
 
  	I have your letter. I have discussed it with Jawaharlal, but he 	suggests, and I agree, that it will be better for me to reduce to 	writing the views I have expressed to him so that there may be no 	misunderstanding about the correct interpretation of my views, and 	so that he may also know whether he understood me correctly.  ELECTORATE: 	I am of the same opinion that I expressed years ago at Delhi 	that we should not be party to separate electorates or to 	reservation of seats, the latter should be by mutual voluntary 	arran- gement if such is necessary. But unless the Mussalmans agree, 	there is no going back by us on reservation of seats. The Congress 	is  committed to it. I think, therefore, that we must simply adhere 	to the Congress resolution and expect Hindus and Mussalmans to carry 	out that resolution. If the All-Parties Conference cannot discover 	another method acceptable to all, we must simply work out the 	Congress formula.  THE C 	ONSTITUTION: 	Personally I am of opinion that we are  not  ready for 	drawing up a constitution till we have developed sanction for 	ourselves. Any constitution that we may arrive at must be a final 	thing in the sense that we may improve upon but we may not recede 	from it even by an inch. There seems to be no atmosphere for 	arriving at such a constitution. I would personally therefore prefer 	instead of a constitution, a working arrangement between all parties 	upon which all may be agreed. This would be not a constitution but 	chief heads of it, as for instance, the Hindu-Muslim arrangement, 	the franchise, the policy as to the Native States. If we are to make 	this thing popular, I should bring in total prohibition and 	exclusion of foreign cloth as an indispensable condition. Of course 	we should guarantee equality of treatment of all religions as also 	of the so-called untouchables. I am not exhaustive in the list of 	things on which there should be an agreement, but I have simply 	given a few things by way of illustration.  I think that if we go 	beyond such a general agreement, we would be making mistake. In any 	case, I do hope that the Conference will not break up without doing 	anything, and even if it does, the Working 
 Committee should take the matter in its own hands and issue its own authoritative statement on behalf of the Congress on all the matters for which the Conference has been convened.
 SANCTION: More important than the two foregoing things, in my opinion, is the sanction. Unless we have created some force ourselves, we shall not advance beyond the position of beggars, and I have given all my time to thinking over this one question, and I can think of nothing else but boycott of foreign cloth with the assistance of mills if possible, without if necessary. I hold it to be prefectly capable of attainment within a measurable distance of time if we can create sufficient public opinion in its favour. Iwould have exclusive concen- tration upon this thing if I had my way. Though I have said nothing in public, I do not at all like what is going on in Bengal. So far as I can see, it is doomed to failure and I can see much harm coming out of that failure; and unlike boycott of foreign cloth, it is valueless, unless it succeeds to the extent we want. Jawaharlal and I have given most of our time to a consideration of this question. And he will explain it all to you. As soon as he can be dispensed with, I would like you to send him back for further discussion of this problem if we do not finish before he leaves for Delhi.
I see that I am not to expect you here in the near future.
 Yours sincerely,

An expert in cattle breeding writes from Kathiawar to say :libtech_370_footnote
 This letter deserves the attention of rulers (of Indian States) and their officers. The several methods of cattle-protection shown here have been discussed in various ways in the letter itself. However, I mention them here as they have been stated with reference to the local conditions by a person who has lived in Kathiawar. The cows and bullocks of Kathiawar were at one time famous. It is a matter of shame for every State in Kathiawar that today they are being sent to the slaughter-house and that economically they are regarded as a burden.
 This reform requires neither a large sum of money nor any great courage. It is only a matter of giving up lethargy and sparing a little time from politics. It requires no great effort to get scrub bulls castrated or to regulate cattle fodder. The States should train some students by offering them scholarships. In the mean while, they should carry on the work with whatever help they can get.
 The heads of pinjrapoles too should take note of the above suggestions. Infirm cattle ought to be looked after. However, it is a thousand times more important to prevent useful cattle from being sent to the slaughter-house.

 "
283,,SATYAGRAHA IN BARDOLI,"
  
 In this issue the reader will find the letters exchanged between the Government and Shri Vallabhbhai. In a way this correspondence is a sorry chapter. So far as I can see, the facts mentioned by Shri Vallabhbhai or the arguments that he has based on them lack nothing. The Government’s reply is marked by cunning and equivocation and amounts to a snub. It makes one sad that power thus makes a person arrogant and that he in his arrogance loses his humanity and forgets himself. Although we may have known thousands of such instances of human weakness, each new one is bound to cause pain. This  is because though man is not free from fault, at heart he wants to do good. Hence he is pained by insolence, discourtesy, etc., from others.
 I shall not enter into the correctness or otherwise of the facts and the arguments. The reader may not have before him all the literature which would enable him to examine the pros and cons; if he has it, he may not have the patience to read and reflect upon it. However, Shri Vallabhbhai’s demands will be found reasonable by the disinterested reader even on the basis of justice alone. Vallabhbhai does not insist that his arguments should be accepted by the Government. What he in fact says is that, while the Government is on one side, the people are on the other. There is a difference of opinion between the two regarding the facts themselves. There should be a third party to arbitrate in this dispute. Whatever award is given by this party will be accepted by Vallabhbhai on behalf of the people.
 This is the crux, the essence, of Vallabhbhai’s letter. The question that now arises is whether there could be such arbitration to settle disputes between the Government and the people. Is not the former the supreme authority? In matters relating to law, even this Government is theoretically prepared to stand in the dock in a court of law. The Government regards the question of land revenue as extra-judicial.The reason for this is beyond the common man’s  powers of comprehension. Let us not enter into the intricacies of this argument at this moment.
 However, if the question of land revenue is outside the juris- diction of courts, what could Vallabhbhai do but ask for arbitration? Should he advise the people to appeal to the Government and then sit quiet? Even if he wished to give such advice, the people had not left the door open to him; they had already appealed to the Government.
 Vallabhbhai would not help them make such appeals, so they approached those who would. Having been unsuccessful there, they returned to Vallabhbhai to make him accept their leadership in  offering satyagraha.
 In accordance with the rules of satyagraha, Vallabhbhai approached the Government with a polite offer of peace. He said that the Government might not be wrong, it was possible that the people might have misled him. He asked the Government to appoint an arbitrator and ask him to dispense justice. He hoped the Government would not claim infallibility. The Government, by committing the grave mistake of rejecting this proposal, cleared the  way  for  the people to offer satyagraha.
 The Government, however, claims that Vallabhbhai is an outsider and does not belong there, that he is an alien and, if he and his alien friends had not entered Bardoli, people would have certainly paid up the revenue—that is the trend of the Government’s letter.
 This is like the thief trying to punish the policeman. As long as Bardoli is in India neither Vallabhbhai nor anyone else amongst us will understand how either he or any Indian living within the territory between Kashmir in the north and Kanyakumari in the south and between Karachi in the west and Dibrugarh in the east, can be called an outsider. It is the British officers of the Government who are foreigners, outsiders who do not belong here, and, to speak more plainly, all the officers—whether they are black or white—who serve this foreign, outside authority belong to this category. Those who owe their livelihood to the Government would of course be on its side. Even persons like Drona and Bhishma had to tell Yudhishthira that they were on the side of those who provided them their livelihood. How crooked of this foreign Government, to call a person like Vallabhbhai an outsider in Bardoli! This is like darkness at noon! It is because of such things that people like me regard it a sin to be loyal to such a Government, and practise non-co-operation. How can we hope for any justice where such gross impertinence prevails? Who can teach justice to this Government? Only a satyagrahi. The Govern-ment cannot be vanquished by intellectual arguments. For the mighty, reason lies in might. It weighs justice at the point of the sword.
This   sword  becomes  blunt  when  it  meets  the   sword   of  the
 satyagrahi. If the satyagrahis of Bardoli are capable of standing by
 truth, either an arbitrator will be appointed, or Vallabhbhai’s arguments will be accepted and he will cease to be considered an outsider and come to be accepted as a ‘native’.
 The other questions arising out of this correspondence will be dealt with later. It is enough for the people of Bardoli to remember that it is for them to win or lose the game.

292,,WAR AGAINST WAR,"
  
A correspondent writes:
 My excuse for writing this is that the autobiographical chapter about your attitude towards war as a follower of truth and ahimsa has apparently stirred the thoughts of many, and abler people would be writing to you about it. But I wish to present some aspects that have struck me. Is it not a fundamental doctrine that to the true disciple of truth and ahimsa, there can be no tampering with bad things even though one connot resist them? War is a necessary evil as some say, but that is no excuse for supporting it in the hope that after it there will come to the world a realization of the wickedness of waging war. It cannot be. On the contrary, the callousness of man is increased further in intensity and the feeling about the sacredness of life is  destroyed.  The anarchist could argue just as you do and say: “We cannot stop European aggression and terrorism. We cannot resist terrorism by mass force. But if we can only domonstrate to them the wickedness of such methods by using them against them, they will see the folly of their attitude and we shall become free, and we shall also save the world from terrorism. So long as himsa is resorted to by our rulers and so long as we hate terrorism, what is the harm in using these weapons provided we do not allow them to obsess us?” Has the Great War actually done any good to the nations and particularly to the victors? Materially, morally, and socially they have lost heavily as a result of the victory. Their moral standards have all been upset and the strife after the life of the moment, and the disregard for truth and honesty in international dealings is becoming more and more apparent every day. Can any good come out of a war, however ‘righteous’ it may be? Are we not bound to oppose it and invite suffering for the cause rather than in any way acquiesce in it either passively or actively? Do you not believe that the pacifists served the cause better than those who actively engaged in the War? What you say might represent the state of your mind in 1914 when you thought there was a sense of justice in the British mentality. Do you now feel that it was right? If another war was declared tomorrow, would you volunteer your help to England in the hope that you would be making things better after the war? I know I have not presented the case in the best way but you can understand what it is that I am trying to tell you, and I shall be glad to have your reply.
 I agree with the correspondent that he has not presented his case ‘in the best way’, but he does represent a type of readers who will not read carefully even writings that are meant to be serious simply because they happen to be found in a weekly journal. If readers like
 the correspondent will re-read the chapter in question they will be able to deduce from it that:
  I 	did not offer 	my services 	because I 	believed in war. I offered 	them because 	I could 	not avoid 	participation in 	it at least indirectly.  I 	had no status to 	resist participation.  I 	do not 	believe that 	war can be avoided 	by taking 	part in 	it even 	as I do not 	believe that evil can 	be avoided 	by participation 	in it. 	This however needs 	to be distinguished 	from sincerely 	helpless participation in many things we hold to be evil or undersirable.  The 	anarchist’s argument 	is irrelevant 	as his 	participation in 	terrorism is 	deliberate, voluntary 	and preconceived. The War certainly did no good to the so-called victors.  The 	pacifist resisters who 	suffered imprisonment 	certainly served 	the cause 	of peace.  If 	another war 	was declared tomorrow I 	could not 	with my 	present views about the 	existing Government 	assist it in any 	shape or 	form; on 	the contrary, 	I should 	exert myself to the 	utmost to 	induce others 	to withhold 	their assistance 	and to 	do everything possible 	and consistent 	with ahimsa to bring 	about its defeat.

 This creation of Raja Mahendra Pratap has a proud record and is one of the very few pre-non-co-operation institutions that were created and have lived without Government aid, recognition or affiliation. Like all such undertakings it has had to pass through many vicissitudes but has come out scatheless through them all. Recently it celebrated its anniversary. Dr. Ansari presided on the occasion. The report before me states that “the proceedings began with a takli demonstration and hoisting of the national flag by Dr. Ansari and singing of the flag-song by the volunteers of the Hindustani Seva Dal followed by Vande Mataram”. The report then proceeds :libtech_375_footnote
 Principal Gidwani had every reason to anticipate my support for an institution for which he was able to claim so much. The reader

294,,NOTES,"
    
 THE SUPREME ARBITER
 In answer to the blind adherence one often sees given to everything written in Sanskrit verse and going under the name of Shastra, Sjt. S. D. Nadkarni sends me the following verses taken from sources universally regarded as authoritative and supporting the final authority of reason :
 ‘A Shastra, though man-made, should be accepted, if it appeals to reason; and the contrary one rejected, though claiming to be inspired. We should be guided by our sense of the just alone. A saying sound in reason should be accepted, though it proceed from a child; and the contrary one rejected as a straw, though it purport to proceed from the God Brahma.’
 —From Yogavasishtha (Nyaya-prakaranam )
 ‘A convention adopted by the good shall be as good an authority as the Veda.’
 —From the Madhava-Smriti (otherwise called the Madhaviya Vyakhya ) The verses show that the Shastras were never intended to supplant reason but to supplement it and never could be pleaded in
defence of injustice or untruth.
 FOR THOSE WHO WOULD SUCCEED
 There is so much despondency on the one hand and bluster retarding success on the other, that I gladly reproduce the following maxims handed by a friend and intended to cheer the despondent and warn the blusteres. There is practically nothing impossible for those
 who would persevere in the face of the heaviest odds. Nothing is possible for those who would brag, bluster and merely make a brave show. Here are the maxims:
 Every noble work is at  first impossible.	—CARLYLE
 Success in most things depends on knowing how long it takes to succeed.
 —MONTESQUIEU
 Victory belongs to most persevering.	—NAPOLEON
 Perpetual pushing and assurance put a difficulty out of countenance, and make a seeming impossibility give way.	—JEREMY COLLIER
 Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel.
 The nerve that never relaxes, the eye that never blanches, the thought that never wanders, these are the masters  of victory.	—BURKE
 However discordant or troubled you have been during the day, do not go to
 sleep until you have restored your mental balance, until your faculties are poised and your mind serene.	—CARTWRIGHT

 THE LATE LORD SINHA
 To the many tributes that have been paid to the memory of this distinguished servant of India I respectfully tender my quota. Lord Sinha’s contribution to the making of modern India will always rank high whenever the estimate of such contributions comes to be made. His advice in all matters of State was always sought and esteemed. The country is the poorer for Lord Sinha’s death.
 A GREAT REFORMER
 Death has removed from the public life of Gujarat in Sir Ramanbhai Nilkanth a man of great purity of character, a reformer of equally great zeal and intrepidity, a public worker of singular constancy and a scholar who has made a permanent contribution to Gujarati literature. In common with the numberless Gujaratis I tender my respectful condolences to the bereaved family.

296,,BARDOLI AND GOVERNMENT,"
    
 The illuminating correspondence that has passed between Sjt. Vallabhbhai Patel and the Government of Bombay regard- ing the assessment in the Bardoli Taluk affords food for reflection to the public worker and reveals in its true light the nature of  the Government under which we are living. Vallabhbhai is not unknown to fame or to the Government. They have been obliged to acknowledge his worth as a public worker of great capacity, integrity and industry. They have acknowledged his great work in the Munici- pality of Ahmedabad. Only the other day he received unstinted praise for his philanthropic services in connection with the floods in Gujarat.
 But his work seems to have counted for nothing when they found him engaged in an activity calculated to cause them embarrass- ment and possibly loss of prestige and what is the same thing to them loss of land revenue. Their prestige they need for the sake of their revenue. They are no believers in empty prestige.
 And so in their very first letter in the matter, they thought it becoming to insult Sjt. Vallabhbhai by calling in question his profess- ions of goodwill and describing him as an outsider in Bardoli. The last letter emphasizes the insult by leaving no doubt that His Excellency the Governor too was party to it. Sjt. Vallabhbhai had courteously assumed in his letter that whilst His Excellency might be identified with a policy enunciated in Government communications, he need not be identified with the manner of expression, more especially the insulting language often adopted by civilian secretaries incensed over any the least resistance or independence betrayed by the public in their correspondence with them. That the Governor has chosen to become a party to the unwarranted insult shows how difficult it is for Governors, however well-intentioned and impartial they may  be reputed to be as the present Governor is, to escape the bureaucratic coil. ‘Pride goeth before destruction and haughtiness before a fall.’
 But Vallabhbhai has a back broad enough to bear the wordy insults that the bureaucracy may choose to heap upon him from its safe and entrenched heights. My reason for dwelling on the insult is to draw attention to the utterly irresponsible nature of the Government that dares to insult a public worker of the foremost rank.
 But let us see for the moment what it is that has upset the Government. Land revenue is a close preserve beyond the pale of law such as it is. The regulation of assessment rests entirely with the executive authority. Every attempt hitherto made to bring it under
 popular or judicial control has failed The Government must somehow or other meet the ever-growing expenditure, bulk of which is military. Land revenue lends itself to arbitrary increase as it affects the largest class and a class that has no voice, a class that can be squeezed without wincing. There would be an end to irresponsible government if the governed are either allowed to have a say in their taxation or to resist it successfully. Bardoli does not appreciate the increase made in its assessment. Its people approached the Government with petitions and exhausted all the means that are regarded as constitutional to secure redress. Having failed they invited Vallabhbhai to advise them and if necessary to lead them in resisting the Government through satyagraha.
 Vallabhbhai investigated their case and though he found it to be just, sought to approach the Government with a view to save them embarrassment and spare the people prolonged  suffering and suggested and honourable course, i.e., suggested that if  the Government did not admit the justice of the people’s  case,  they should appoint an impartial tribunal to investigate the case on either side and assured the Government that the people would abide by the decision of such a tribunal. This reasonable suggestion the Govern- ment has scornfully rejected.
 The public, therefore, are not called upon to accept the popular version as against that of the Government. They are asked merely to support the demand for the appointment of an impartial tribunal and failing such appointment to support their heroic resolve peacefully to resist the assessment and suffer all the consequences of such resistance even including confiscation of their land.
 Sjt. Vallabhbhai has rightly distinguished the proposed saty- agraha from the swaraj satyagraha. This campaign cannot be properly deemed to be a no-tax campaign launched for the  attainment  of swaraj as Bardoli would have done in 1922. This satyagraha is limited in scope, has a specific local object. Every man has the right, nay, it is his duty to resist an arbitrary unjust levy as the Bardoli assessment is claimed to be by its ryots. But though the object of the proposed satyagraha is local and specific, it has an all-India application. what is true of Bardoli is true of many parts of India. The struggle has also an indirect bearing on swaraj Whatever awakens people to a sense of their wrongs and whatever gives them strength for disciplined and peaceful resistance and habituates them for corporate suffering  brings  us  nearer swaraj.

 RESPECTED REVASHANKERBHAI,
 I had asked Mahadev to write to you but I am afraid that he forgot to mention one thing in the letter. Mahadev is not here so that I can ask him. I wanted him to write about Dr. Ansari. There is no doubt that Dr. Ansari is a very intelligent man, but he has no special knowledge of this subject. He has a high opinion of a Swiss doctor’s remedy, which consists in serum drawn from many horses.  That  doctor charges £1,000 for one tube, but the serum does not necessarily benefit everyone. Nor do all doctors in Europe accept this man’s treatment as scientific. I don’t think we need go in for it. We should put Dhiru in the hands of a good doctor and then rest content.
I have now started taking milk. I keep good health.

 DEAR SATIS BABU,
 I have your two letters. They only confirm the fears that were raised in me on reading the sensational reports about boycott and I feel sorry that Dr. Ray signed the manifesto which he knew was perfectly useless.
 I do not like the proposal contained in your article. I think we must not be mixed up with the use of foreign yarn under any circumstances whatsoever. We must leave it to regulate itself or to those who have not a living faith in khadi. If we mix ourselves up with the use of foreign yarn, you will see that we shall have surren-dered our position. I want you to consider this well and confine your assistance and activity to the supply of khadi if they want it. Our own mills may come in if they wish to and if they will develop the national spirit. But even there, our institution will have to be most cautious.
 I am glad that Hemprabhadevi, Nikhil and Tarini have gone to Giridih. I received a very despondent letter from Hemprabhadevi. She was herself reported to be unwell. Please let me know all about her condition."

 DEAR FRIEND,
 I have your letter. I have forwarded it to Dr. Roy with a letterlibtech_382_footnotecopy of which I enclose herewith. You will appreciate the moral difficulty that faces me. Though I have claimed to be the richest person perhaps in the world, you will realize at the same time the depths of my poverty. I quite recognize that between Dr. Roy and myself you should not be made to suffer. But if you cannot get relief from him or from Captain Basu, you will treat this incident as a lesson never to have anything to do with Mahatmas or those who use their names. Mahatmas are the most slippery customers treading on this overburdened earth.

 I have again to acknowledge with thanks a further contribution of 10 dollars for the relief fund. All these amounts have been passed on to the Secretary of the Relief Fund Committee. But I hope that you have adopted some means of conveying to the donors my sincere thanks for their generosity.
 About the general situation here, I would  warn  you  against going by newspaper reports. Whilst there is the bitterest resentment

Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	a photostat of the Gujarati: S.N. 9708         THE 	LATE 	SIR 	RAMANBHAI  	Sir Ramanbhai has passed away leaving Gujarat in tears. Ramanbhai 	embodies the history of modernism in Gujarat. Ramanbhai stands for 	social reform. Ramanbhai was the friend of the poor. He was the warp 	and woof of the civic life of Ahmedabad. His service to the Gujarati 	language was of a very high standard. His high moral code never 	failed to leave an impression on whosoever came into contact with 	him. Ramanbhai’s humour permeates his works. He did not however 	look upon life as something of a jest. He found the fulfilment of 	his life in devoting it to the performance of duty. Ramanbhai would 	indeed help any good cause. In matters of national welfare he always 	contributed his full share. 
 He never hesitated or spared himself in anything  that  he regarded as service. In spite of his serious illness and in spite of severe differences in political matters he recognized the value  of Vallabhbhai’s service to the municipality and he unfailingly co- operated with him to the utmost whenever occasion arose. There could hardly be a public institution in Ahmedabad which did not wish to have Ramanbhai’s name associated with it.
 The loss of such a jewel of Gujarat will not be felt by his family members alone; the whole of Gujarat shares this grief of separation.
 Nowadays, it has become customary to underestimate the quiet, unostentatious service of persons who do not take part in politics, especially in active politics. In my humble opinion this is a mistake though time will certainly rectify it. He who wipes the tears of even a single widow, who saves a single young girl from the immolation miscalled marriage, who renders selfless service to a single Antyaja, serves the country and society in a pure manner, and it is likely that, when the fight put up by a valiant political warrior is forgotten, this other service done in some obscure corner will still keep bearing fruit. That service which is accompanied not by ovations but by God’s blessings is indeed true service. Such was the service rendered by Ramanbhai. He received his share of ovations too, but why describe what Ramanbhai never cared for! He was a brave warrior. Who has not seen him stick to his views as well as his own place amidst the whistling and shouting of young men? Let us pray that we inherit his virtues.
 LORD SINHA
 India has suffered a great loss in the death of Lord Sinha. He was a pillar of India. He had reached the highest office on the strength of his intellect. Although it is true that that office has little value in this age of non-co-operation, the abilities that were required in order to reach it have much value. Lord Sinha did not go out of his way to seek office. It could be said on the contrary that offices came seeking him. However, I do not wish to discuss here the various offices that he held at different times. The reader must have come to know of these from other newspapers. I wish to give a short account of my acquaintance with him.
 I saw him for the first time at the Congress in 1915. This was my second experience of the Congress. At this session, I came to know only of his intellectual powers. Everyone appreciated his erudite
 speech. His criticism of the Empire carried weight. Everyone on the Congress Working Committee admired the way in which he transacted business.
 We cannot all emulate his intellectual powers. There  was  however one quality of his, of which I came to know at a reception in his honour, which we could all imitate, and that is his humility.
 I came to know more of this quality at the time of  Desh-  bandhu Das Memorial Fund. All of us felt that the association of his name with the raising of this Fund would indeed be welcome. Persons belonging to all parties felt that, if his name was associated with it, it would facilitate the raising of the Fund and that this would make people from all parties readily associate themselves with it. I  was among those who approached him. He was in indifferent health at that time; but he would meet people whenever necessary. He willingly agreed to the inclusion of his name and also agreed  to  give  all possible help. On these occasions, I became well aware of his humility, his courtesy and his greatness and I felt that India would add to her prestige if all our elder statesmen possessed these qualities. I noticed that he did not crave for respect but was always eager to show respect to others. Those who do not crave for respect deserve it; privileges cling to those who try to shake them off. Lord Sinha happened to be in this happy situation. May all of us inherit that humility and that courtesy.

  	I like the manner in which you are combating my views. I discovered 	the difference between us even in Orissa. For me, there is no 	difference between the individual and the social position. At the 	same time there is ample room for the compromise of the nature 	suggested by you, for the simple reason that I ever compromise my 	own ideals even in individual conduct not because I wish to but  	because the compromise was inevitable. And so in social and 	political matters I have never exacted complete fulfilment of the 	ideal in which I have believed. But there are always times when one 	has to say thus far and no further, and, each time the dividing line 	has to be  determined on merits. Generally speaking where the sum 	total of a movement has been evil, I have held non-co-operation to 	be the only remedy and where the sum total has been for the good of 	humanity, I have held co-operation on the basis of compromise to be 	the most desirable thing. If I seem to be holding myself aloof from 	some of the political movements just now, it is because I believe 	their tendency to be not for the promotion of swaraj but rather its 	retarding. It may be that I have erred in my judgment. If so, it is 	but human and I have never claimed to be infallible.

 MY DEAR PROFESSOR,
 With reference to a letter by the Secretary to the Association dated 1st March, I want to say that in spite of all the difficulties in our way we must aim at getting a complete list of the spinners who bring their yarn to the common bazaar. I hold it to be absolutely necessary for the movement itself. If we are to really serve these spinners, we must establish direct contact with them. It may take a little time but our work is incomplete till we know our spinners and know them in their own homes and see how they work, where they get their cotton, how they pass their time otherwise and so on and so forth. If we would consider this to be a necessary part of our work there will be no question of sparing or not sparing workers, just as there will be no question as to the keeping of our accounts or knowing the quality and the quantity of yarn we receive. I have no time to say more to you. I speak to you on other matters through Krishnadas. I hope there is no trouble about the seat of operation now.

317,,WHAT CAN OUR MILLS DO?,"
    
 Everybody is anxious that at this critical juncture in our history, we should be able to exhibit some real strength. It is being more and more realized that such strength can be developed and shown only through boycott of foreign cloth as distinguished from British cloth. In this boycott it is possible for our mills to play an important, indeed  a decisive, part if they wish.
 Some day or other they will have to choose between this alien Government and the people. There is no doubt that to a large extent they are dependent for their existence upon the toleration if not the goodwill of the Government. Thoreau told the truth when he said that possession of riches under an evil government was a sin and poverty was virtue. The riches of the rich are always at the disposal of the government of the day whether it is good or bad.
 But if the mills are dependent for their existence on  the toleration or goodwill of the Government, they are no less so on the toleration or goodwill of the people. They can afford to ignore the people only so long as the latter remain ignorant, supine or disunited. But the past seven years have not been lived in vain by the nation. The mass awakening that has taken place will never die. No one can tell when and how the people will show their strength.
 But the mills occupy a privileged position. By showing a little courage, a little consideration for the true interests of the nation and by exercising a little self-sacrifice they can serve both the Government and the people. They can convert the government and advance the people’s cause.
This is now in my humble opinion they can do it:
 They can standardize their prices taking the lowest average of a number of top and lean years.
 They can come to terms with the leaders organizing boycott as to the qunatity and quality of cloth required for the nation.
 They can refrain from manufacturing those varieties that can be easily and immediately produced by khadi organizations, thus freeing
 their energy for manufacturing more of the varieties they can at the present moment more easily manufacture than the khadi orga- nizations.
 They can limit their profits to a minimum and let the surplus, if any, be devoted to the fulfilment of the boycott or, if that be unnecessary, to the improvement of the condition of the labourers.
 This would mean all-round honesty, perseverance, mutual trust, a voluntary and honourable triple alliance between labour, capital and the consumer. It would mean capacity for organization on a vast scale. And if we are to attain boycott of foreign cloth through non-violence, we shall have some day or other to fulfil the tests just enumerated by me.
 In my humble opinion we are eminently fitted for the task. The organization required for the purpose is not unfamiliar to us. The only question is, have we the will? Have the mill-owners enough visi- on, enough love of the country? If they have, they can take the lead.
 Let me redeclare my own faith. For boycott to be swiftly brought about a combination between khadi and truly indigenous mills is desirable, but not absolutely necessary. I use the words truly indigenous, because we have bogus mills in India which are Indian only in the sense that they are located in the country but whose shareholders, whose management, whose spirit are mainly, when not wholly, foreign. But if the indigenous mills cannot or will not lead or join national movement, I am convinced that khadi alone can achieve the boycott if the politically-minded India has the will, the faith and the energy required for the purpose. We have not enough horsepower expressed through steam engines, oil engines or electricity, but we have an inexhaustible reservoir of manpower lying idle and pleading to be used, and essentially qualified for the purpose. Oh, for a faith that would see and use this supply of living power!

318,,HOW TO DO IT?,"
    
 Notice has already been taken in these pages of the West Khandesh Zilla Mandal of which Sjt. Shankarrao Dev is the founder president and guardian angel. This Mandal has village reconstruction as its principal activity, and has become convinced that spinning must be the centre of every activity connected with reconstruction, if it is to prosper and respond to the deep poverty of the masses. All its work is
 
 as thorough as it can be made. Sjt. S. V. Thakkar has been training himself for some time before settling down in a village for reconstr- uction service. He has been travelling together with Sjt.  Balubhai Mehta in those centres where such activity is going on. The brief report he has presented to the president of his Mandal is worth reading. I therefore reproduce the main part of it for the guidence of those who do this work:libtech_389_footnote

 "
319,,NOTES,"
    
 A.I.S.A. MEMBERSHIP
 The foregoing summarieslibtech_390_footnotetell their own tale. There is a drop from the figures of 1927 in all the three classes. The reason is that there has been little or no canvassing for membership because the policy of the Association rightly has been not to incur any expenses over sacrificial spinning. It loses all merit when it requires to be canvassed and stimulated through paid agency. But the membership can be easily doubled if every member were to undertake to find one new member. It is worthy of note that whilst the membership has decreased, there has been a marked increase in the production and sale of khadi as well as in the number of spinners who spin for hire.
 For the information of juveniles, I reproduce below  the resolution of the Council of the Association. National schools can do  a great deal for increasing the number of juvenile members:
 Resolved that a B class of juvenile members of the Association be created, consisting of persons below 18 years of age who habitually wear khadi and contribute to the Association an annual subscription of 2,000 yards of self- spun yarn well-twisted and uniform.
 INSTRUCTIVE FIGURES
 I have been always repeating at public meetings that 50,000 spinners were being served by the All-India Spinners’ Association in 1,500 villages. This statement was based on the figures compiled by the All-India Spinners’ Association on the basis of yarn production and was made in 1927. Since then more than a year has passed. An attempt was made to arrive at the total number from direct evidence,
 
 i.e., by taking a census of spinners and incidentally of weavers and carders supported by the All-India Spinners’ Association. The tablelibtech_391_footnoteappended to this note gives those figures. It will be seen that all the provinces have not made their returns to have all the organizations in the provinces that have sent their figures been able to comply with the requirements of the All-India Spinners’ Association.  The  figures given below are therefore in every way an underestimate and yet they are a decided advance upon 50,000 spinners and 1,500 villages. But this is merely a foretaste of the possibilities of a movement which awaits the tangible support of an enlightened public opinion. There is an illimitable scope for production of khadi if demand can only be guaranteed.
 Young India, 15-3-1928
 "
320,,STILL AT IT,"
    
 The autobiographical chapter dealing with my participation in the late War continues to puzzle friends and critics. Here is one more letter:libtech_392_footnote
 No doubt it was a mixed motive that prompted me to parti- cipate in the War. Two things I can recall. Though as an indi- vidual I was opposed to war, I had no status for offering effec- tive non-violent resistance. Non-violent resistance can only follow some real disinterested service, some heart-expression of love. For instance, I would have no status to resist a savage offering animal sacrifice until he could recognize in me his friend through some loving act of mine or other means. I do not sit in judgment upon the world for its many misdeeds. Being imperfect myself and needing toleration and charity, I tolerate the world’s imperfections till I find or create an opportunity for fruitful expostulation. I felt that if by sufficient service I could attain the power and the confidence to resist the Empire’s wars and its warlike preparations, it would be a good thing for me who was seeking to enforce non-violence in my own life to test the extent to which it was possible among the masses.
 
 
 The other motive was to qualify for swaraj through the good offices of the statesmen of the Empire. I could not thus qualify myself except through serving the Empire in its life-and-death struggle. It must be understood that I am writing of my mentality in 1914 when I was a believer in the Empire and its willing ability to help India in her battle for freedom. Had I been the non-violent rebel that I am today, I should certainly not have helped but through every effort open to non-violence I should have attempted to defeat its purpose.
 My opposition to and disbelief in war was as strong then as it is today. But we have to recognize that there are many things in the world which we do although we may be against doing them. I am as much opposed to taking the life of the lowest creature alive as I am to war. But I continually take such life hoping some day to attain the ability to do without this fratricide. To entitle me in spite of it to be called a votary of non-violence, my attempt must be honest, strenuous and unceasing. The conception of moksha, absolution from the need to have an embodied existence, is based upon the necessity of perfected men and women being completely non-violent. Possession of a body like every other possession necessitates some violence, be it ever so little. The fact is that the path of duty is not always easy to discern amidst claims seeming to conflict one with the other.
 Lastly, the verse referred to from the Gita has  a  double meaning. One is that there should be no selfish purpose behind our actions. That of gaining swaraj is not a selfish purpose. Secon-dly, to be detached from fruits of actions is not to be ignorant of them, or to disregard or disown them. To be detached is never to abandon action because the contemplated result may not follow. On the contrary, it is proof of immovable faith in the certainty of the contemplated result following in due course.

  	After a great deal of thought and bother I have established at the 	Ashram a little bit of a tannery without any power-driven machi- 	nery and without skilled assistance save that of a man who has 	received a rough-and-tumble experience of tanning in America and who 	is a crank like myself. Though I did not succeed in sharing your 	troubles and taking the load off your shoulders in connection with 	your own great national enterprise, your inspi-ration is partly 	responsible for the establishment of this little tannery at the 	Ashram. Can you please help me with a list of literature on the 	subject, a handbook on tanning and the like? If you think that there 	is nothing like it in English, will you 
 out of your own wide and varied experience write out something that may be of use for propaganda, just a few hints? What is happening at the Tannery? Who is in charge? I may add that my idea is to make the Ashram Tannery a model for villages so that the villagers may be able to treat their own dead cattle and make use of the hide themselves. I have asked many people without success as to how I can skin dead cattle. Everybody knowing anything of tanning has something to say about hides after they are received from the village  tanner;  but  nobody has yet told me if I take charge of a dead animal I can skin the carcass economically and hygienically and make use of other contents such as bones, intestine, etc., for purposes of manure.

  	I have now heard from Mr. Jayakar and I see from it that Sir 	Purushottamdas is no longer the president. This, however, is the  	opinion he forwards to me :  He 	is however of 	opinion that the 	scheme is 	a useful one. He 	suggests one 	caution to 	you that any help that 	you may be inclined 	to give, 	if it is to take 	the form 	of a collection 	of funds, 	should be conditioned 	that its control 	in the 	way of investment or 	disbursement should be in the hands of a few men of your own 	choice whose veracity 	and judgment could be 	implicitly trusted. 	He assures that 	the scheme has 	a strong 	potentiality of 	being useful 	to the community, 	and deserves your support. The funds at present in the hands of the 	office-bearers are only a 	few hundred rupees, and unless they are supplemented 	  it well be difficult for the institution to commence its work. It 	therefore resolves itself into what I have suggested all along  	the line that there should be a proper trust-deed. I can now only 	suggest that you should see Seth Jamnalalji when he  comes  to  	Bombay which he will do in two or three days. I am giving him all 	the papers and if he is satisfied about the trust, I shall be in a 	position to do something.  Yours sincerely,  M. K.

331,,THE WEAPON OF BOYCOTT,"
    
 It has been reported that the satyagrahis of Bardoli are getting ready to use the weapon of boycott against those who agree to pay the revenue to the Government. This weapon is a powerful one and the satyagrahi can use it only within limits. Boycott can be violent as well as non-violent. It is only the latter kind that a satyagrahi may use. At the moment I will only give examples of the two forms of boycott.
Non-violent boycott may mean not accepting any service.
Refusal to serve may involve violence.
 Non-violent boycott may include a refusal to dine at the house of the person boycotted, refusal to attend marriages and such other functions at his place, doing no business with him and, taking no help from him.
 On the other hand, refusing to nurse the boycotted person if he is sick, Lot allowing doctors to visit him, refusing to help in performing the last rites if he happens to die, refusing to allow him to make use of wells, temples, etc., all this is violent boycott. Deeper
 
 reflection will reveal that non-violent boycott can be continued for a long period and no external force can prove effectual in terminating it, whereas violent boycott cannot continue for long and external force can be used in a large measure to put an end to it. Ultimately violent boycott only does disservice to a movement. Many such instances can be quoted form the era of non-co-operation. However, on this occasion, the distinction that I have pointed out should be enough for the satyagrahis and the workers of Bardoli.

 I have your letter. You must have had my telegram.libtech_398_footnoteI couldn’t possibly reconcile myself to the idea of your remaining in the College simply for the sake of being able to draw upon it for your maintenance. I see no harm in Flood Relief Fund supporting you. I am in correspondence with Thakkar Bapa about it and if it can be done without in any shape or form compromising your present posi- tion, it should be done. Whether you receive the money through me or the Flood Relief Committee, it would be from a public fund. We must get rid of there being shame in honorary services being paid in the sense in which we use the word ‘honorary’. The labourer is wor- thy of his hire, and, all service is honorary when the servant takes no more than his hire. That your hire has to be above the normal inother parts of India is unfortunate but inevitable. If your honorarium can
 
 not be decently drawn from the Flood Fund, I shall hold myself responsible for it. But I want you to tell me how much you will require.
 Thakkar Bapa tells me that he is going to send you a good worker from the Bhil Ashram and that he had left one with you already. But if you have anybody particularly in mind, please do not hesitate to name him and I shall see whether he can be spared.

 MY DEAR SURESH BABU,
 I have seen the letter from the Secretary regarding the number of spinners served by you. Do you not see that it is as essential for you to reach your spinners as it is for you to keep your books in a thoroughly good order? If you do not take this precaution, you will find that the organization will one day collapse like a house of cards. It does not matter whose yarn in the particular week day you have received but it does matter that you send some reliable person to the people who are actually spinning and find out their condition and talk to them. Surely, it is neither an impossible task nor a very elaborate one. When the spinners who come to the middle men to sell their yarn return home you have simply to follow them to their homes and, if they avoid you once, they won’t avoid you always. They will give you their confidence immediately they cease to distrust you. You must have some middle men at least who are fairly honest and who will not mind taking your messenger to the very homes from which they receive their yarn. And if this very simple thing is beyond your capacity, you are manifestly at the mercy of the middle men to whom it is open any day to stop their custom or to impose conditions which will be either impossible of acceptance or hurtful to your self-respect.  I wish therefore that you will realize the importance of the suggestion which Mr. Banker has been making from time to time at my instance.

347,"March 20, 1928",INTERVIEW TO ALICE SCHALEK,"
    
 
March 20, 1928
 Mahatma Gandhi received Miss Alice Schalek on the 20th of March in the Ashram at 4 o’clock. When she entered, he said :
Please excuse me for my remaining on my seat, I cannot stand
 up.    MISS 	S.: May I ask some 	questions?  GANDHIJI: 	Of course, please do.  Q.	Does 	your influence grow of decline? A. 	A question difficult to answer, but I fancy it is growing, so 
 far 	as the masses are concerned.  Q. 	Is it true 	that in your 	meaning the 	British have 	done no good 	to India? 	 And you even regard the 	railways harmful?  A. Partly true. The total 	effect of the British rule in India has been nothing but evil. The 	railways have done more harm than good.  Q.	Have 	they not been useful in famines?  A. They may serve a 	temporary useful purpose. But they have generally served to carry 	away from the villager what he needs for himself.  Q.	But 	he gets money for it?  A. But he cannot eat the 	money. If you were in the desert of Sahara and you had only as much 	water as you needed for keeping you alive, would you sell it for any 	amount of gold?  Q.	But 	are not they selling only 	what is superfluous?  A. They sell their 	birthright when they sell their raw produce. They do so because they 	know no better. If you have my welfare at heart, would you advise me 	to sell raw hide and get from you manufactured shoes, or to sell my 	cotton and purchase manufactured cloth? I am asking my countrymen to 	store their cotton and spin it into yarn and make their own cloth.  Q. 	They say that where there 	are railways there 	is no starvation. 	In case 	of famine, 	they take food-quickly from a 	place where it 	is in abundance to 	a place where it is needed. A.	Those 	who laid out the railways did not think of the welfare 
 of the people. They thought of the interest of the distant shareholders or principals. The advantage, in case of a famine, is small when we think of the counterbalancing disadvantages. It is like a robber robbing me of my all and then offering me back a trifle.
 Q.	Would India have been better if railways had not been here?
A.	I have no doubt, other conditions being satisfied.
 Q.	How can the railways be made useful?
 A. The policy should be so conceived as to be consistent with the real interests of the people, that is to say, they should enable people to remain self-supporting as they were before the railways came. Today they are being pauperized both in mind and body. They knew how to make the best use of their raw material. They used to turn their cotton into cloth, their hide into shoes, their corn into bread. Today the process is being reversed. I cannot consider anything more [harmful] than that millions should have to export their raw material which they can manufacture at home, and import finished products. The railways can usefully serve to transmit the finished products manufactured by the villagers from one part of  the  country  to another.
 Q. There should be a large movement to teach the people to do all these things?
A.	There was ample interprovincial trade before.
 Q.	Is not the foreign method cheaper?
 A. No. Even if it was, our own product would be cheaper at a higher cost. For instance when we in the Ashram first began to grow our vegetables they cost us more than the market vegetables. But now we grow them better and cheaper than elsewhere and our own inmates get work also.
 Q. May I speak frankly? I was told in Bengal that khaddar is more expensive and coarser than British cloth and that women who pledge themselves to wear khaddar have their underwear made of foreign cloth.
 A. If khaddar is coarser, patriotism demands that measure of sacrifice. There is no doubt that we have made a considerable advance on what we used to produce some years ago and we have been able to effect considerable reduction in prices. As for the ladies you were told about, I can only say that it was not proper for them to use any foreign cloth if they were pledged to wear khadi.
 Q.	What are your aims and ideals?
 A. I want perfect freedom for my country through non-violent and truthful means.
 Q.	Do you think you can reach so far through non-violence?
 A. My own conviction is that we shall obtain it only through non-violence and not otherwise. I think it more possible of attainment through non-violent than through violent means.
 Q.	What do you mean by freedom?
 A. I want the freedom to make mistakes, and  freedom  to unmake them, and freedom to grow to my full height and freedom to stumble also. I do not want crutches.
 Q.	Don’t you think the British have been very helpful to India?
 A. They have been most harmful in every essential particular. By “they” I mean the British Government.
 Q.	And why?
 A. Because they have sapped the economic, mental and moral growth of the people.
 Q.	Don’t you think they have helped in India’s economic growth?
 A. According to the reports of  Government officials  them- selves, India is poorer today than it was fifty years ago. A few individuals may have become rich, but generally poverty is  deepening. There has been a little transfer of wealth, but no general prosperity of the country.
 Q.	Government say there were never before so many purchasers.
 A. It is wrong if they mean that people could not buy then and that they can buy now. It is true in the sense that whereas people did not buy many things in those days, they do so today, and there are more goods to buy.
 Q. But what is the sense of boycotting British goods? England does not give preference to her own goods. There is free competition for all the nations of the world.
 A. No. It is wrong. It only appears as though there was free competition. England does give preference to her goods in a variety of insidious ways. There is apparent freedom, but no true freedom. But even if the British were impartial in favouring foreigners, I would have my quarrel with them. I want preference for Indian interests.
 Q.	How?
 A.	By prohibiting import of all foreign cloth and by levying a heavy tax on all imports that can be manufactured in the country.
 Q.	Buy your cost of manufacture will be much higher.
 A. High and low prices are no necessary indication of the prosperity or depression of a country. It is infinitely better that I grow my vegetable even if the cost is a trifle higher than that I should depend for them on someone else. Then I shall try to reduce the cost by judicious and skilful management. The gain in skill, comfort and the knowledge that we grow our vegetables is much greater than the little gain we might have in getting vegetables cheap in Ahmedabad. Even in the matter [of] producing cloth we could do it in no time and quite cheap if we were left to our own resources.
 Q.	There is no country in the world which is free from foreign competition.
 A. Pardon me. Germany was one. Germany erected a prohi- bitive tariff wall on all foreign sugar and then successfully produced its best sugar. Every nation protects its infant industry by bounties and tariffs.
 Q.	Do you mean to say that all foreign imports must be stopped and that India must use only indigenous goods?
 A. We may have from foreign  countries  all  the  things  we cannot produce, e.g., we may have iodine from Britain or Germany, we may have pearls from Arabia, diamonds from Johannesburg, lever watches from England and good readable books from England, America and all countries in the world. Indeed I should have need[les] and pins—dangerous weapons both!—from foreign coun-tries, and quite a number of other things I can mention. And we may profitably export to other countries whatever they need, but we should never impose anything on anybody. For instance I may grow opium, but would not think of imposing it on China or America.
 Q.	But if you make your own things, would you not have to face the labour question?
A.	Why? If it arises, it will solve itself.
 Q.	Would you do it all on capitalistic basis or communistic basis?
A.	On a nationalistic basis, in the interests of the people.
 Q.	But who will finance the industries?
A.	We. Our finance consists in our own men and women, and
 we have got them in their millions.
 Q.	Should your industry be run by the State or by the country?
 A. It does not matter how it is run, provided it is run in the interests of the millions, not of a class. That principle assured, I should not mind who nominally runs it.

  	I have your postcard. Do come on Saturday evening. If I cannot spare 	time for you in the evening, I will do so on Sunday and will let you 	return at the time fixed by you. I hope you are now completely all 	right.  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	a photostat of the Gujarati: G.N. 4009         CHARKHA 	A PROVED 	WANT  	Akbarpur in U.P. is a little place where Professor Kripalani’s 	khadi band worked for seven years. For reason into which I need not 	go, this band had to withdraw from Akbarpur. Pandit  Jawaharlal  	Nehru describes the touching scenes that followed the withdrawal and 	how the centre had somehow to be kept up. The following from his 	letter to the All-India Spinners’ Association will be read with 	interest:  I 	have told you 	already that 	the Gandhi 	Ashram has left 	Akbarpur. We 	have taken 	charge temporarily because we 	felt that pending 	your decision 	we ought 	to carry on. If we had not taken charge there would have been a 	break and  it 	would have been more 	difficult to 	start afresh. Besides, 	on sentimental 	grounds also 	it was 	a little 	difficult to abandon 	the place. 	It has 	been a well- 	known centre for 	so many 	years and a 	large number of 	weavers and 	others are 	intimately connected with 	it. To leave 	it suddenly 	would have had a bad 	effect on 	the whole neighbourhood 	and upset 	the economy 	of a great 	number of poor 	households who were 	dependent on it. Indeed, we were told that some touching incidents 	were witnessed 	when the Gandhi 	Ashram announced that 	they were closing 	up. Many old women 	spinners who used to 	sell their 	yarn at 	a distant 	centre, finding this 	centre closed, trudged up 	many miles 	to headquarters 	and wept 	when they found that their yarn was not to be bought. Many weavers 	with their wives and 	families came 	up to the 	Akbarpur office and 	said they would perform 	satyagraha. For seven 	years they had been working 	for the Ashram 	and now they were being left in the lurch. You will realize how difficult it was 
 for us to refuse to take charge under these circumstances. But of course, sentimental considerations cannot decide the question. Akbarpur possesses some marked advantages and at the same time a very great disadvantage. As a weaving centre it is famous and even now some of the finest weaving in India is done at Tanda in the neighbourhood. Unhappily this fine weaving—called jamdani work—is done with foreign yarn. On the other hand, there is very little spinning done near Akbarpur if the centre is to be worked it will be necessary to bring yarn from elsewhere. The Gandhi Ashram, I believe, used to get their yarn chiefly from across the border in Bihar, also from Muzaffarnagar. For us it will be easier to get it from the Northern Districts of the U.P.—Moradabad, Bijnor, etc. The cost of sending the yarn is not great.
If khadi became as current as ghee or grain, there could never
 have been a thought of withdrawing from any centre. If we had funds and workers we would have representatives not only in 1,600 villages but in 7,00,000 villages. This is no impracticable ambition, when we remember the fact that there are at least two representatives of the alien Government in each of these villages. If anyone before the British advent had suggested any such thing, he would have been laughed out of court. But reflection should show that the restoration of the wheel in every one of the villages is not half as laughable as the hope of imperial Britain being represented in the republican villages of India would have been in the 17th century. What the women near Akbarpur are reported to have said demonstrates what a felt want the charkha fills or can fill in every village of this ancient land. It is no credit to our patriotism that the able weavers of Akbarpur have to fall back upon foreign yarn for their far-famed jamdani which it was their pride nearly half a century ago to weave out of yarn spun by the sacred hands of their own sisters living next door to them. It won’t be long before the spinners in our villages are able to spin as fine and as strong yarn as any foreign yarn now infesting our market.
 CAN IT BE TRUE?
 The president, Arya Samaj, New Delhi, writes:libtech_410_footnote
 The Baghat State is situated in the Simla Hills and its ruler is  an enlightened Hindu chief.	The population of the State is about ten thousand
 and mainly consists of Rajputs, Kanets and Brahmins. The other tribes are Kolis, Chamars, etc., who are regarded as menials. Although the Kolis chiefly
 
 live on agriculture yet the social disabilities to which they are subject are numerous.       Moved by the inhuman treatment which these people suffer at
 the hands of their Hindu brethren, the Arya Samaj, Simla, brought them into their fold with a view to raise their status in life and invested them with the sacred thread, inasmuch as by occupation they are Vaisyas.       This seems to
 have given umbrage to the caste Hindus who challenged the right of their being invested with the sacred thread. A summary trial consequently held on the 6th January 1928 by the Chief of the State himself and on the subsequent day on the plea of antiquity and customs, the poor kolis who were ten in number were sentenced to undergo six months’ imprisonment in addition to a fine of Rs. 200 each. No opportunity was given to these unfortunate persons to defend themselves, nor was permission given to the Pandit of the Arya Samaj who happened to be present on the occasion to explain the point of view of the Arya Samaj in this matter. It is now reported that they are being coerced in the jail to take off their sacred thread.
The information contained in the foregoing seems to me to be
 unbelievable. The Kolis can in no way be considered to be untouchables or to be of the suppressed or the depressed classes. If they are their own farmers, according to the definition of the different varnas, they are born Vaisyas and have every right to wear the sacred thread. But assuming that they have no right in religion, I was totally unprepared for the news that the wearing of the sacred thread would be considered a crime punishable in law in any State. Equally unthinkable it is that the unfortunate men who thought that they had passed through some desirable or meritorious religious  ceremony were denied even the right of defending themselves and producing their witnesses. And, if the statements about the punishment and farcical trial are true, I should not at all wonder if the sacred thread had been forcibly taken off their persons. I would invite the president of the Arya Samaj to send further details, if any, in corroboration of the charges brought by him against the Baghat State and I would invite the State authorities if they wish to send me their version of the incident which I shall gladly publish.

354,,FOREIGN CLOTH BOYCOTT—SOME QUESTIONS,"
    
 A friend intimately connected with mills and desirous of having our mills contributing their full quota to the foreign cloth boycott movement asks :
    On 			what basis do 			you want 			prices standardized? 			For remember 			all mills 			are not alike. 			Some are bad, some are 			good; some 			use more sizing than 			others, some have more 			reserve than 			others; Bombay mills 			make less profits than 			upcountry ones. 			These difference are 			illustrative of 			many others that 			might be stated.   
The one general answer that may be given is “where there’s a
 will there’s a way”. The mills will contribute their quota only when they get rid of inertia, think “furiously”, and that too in terms of the nation, not merely the pockets of share-holders, directors or agents. But by way of making my position in this matter clearer I may say that all the mills who will join the boycott movement will have to pool all the differences and arrive at a standard price which would at least mean a large slice off from the present profits of at least some mills. If their patriotism is sound and progressive the flourishing ones will cover the losing ones, avoidable differences will be avoided. In the scheme I have in view the mills need never lose in the aggregate and they must not profit at the expense of the buyer.
    Only 			some mills will 			undertake not 			to manufacture 			khadi. But what 			about those that only spin low counts? What is your test of khadi?   
 This is a matter of common honesty and arrangement between khadi organizations and mills. At present I am sorry to have to say that even some good mills are not ashamed to label their cloth ‘khadi’ simply in order to take an illegitimate advantage of the growing khadi atmosphere in the mofussil. If a workable arrangement is come to, I expect that there will be a line of demarcation for the time being between the cloth to be manufactured by khadi centres and mills. The manufacture of cloth will be controlled as it often is in times of war. What in a war based on violence we do by compulsion, in this war based on non-violence we shall do by choice. Our ability voluntarily, i.e., merely under pressure of public opinion, to arrange boycotts, etc., will be the outward but indispensable test of our non-violence if we have any in us.
    How 			will profits be regulated? You know as well as I do that prices of 			cotton fluctuate with 			irritating irregularity.   
 This assumes our inability to control the cotton market. Surely if the largest manufacturers of the country combine in the patriotic effort, they will control the cotton market. America rules our cotton prices because we stupidly, thoughtlessly, and selfishly send out our cotton. But boycott means that we shall control the movement of cotton, as we shall control many other things, if we are to achieve complete boycott, as we must if we have developed the true national spirit and have confidence in ourselves and the nation.
    If 			you lay much stress 			upon honesty, perseverance, mutual trust, etc., 			you are doomed.   
 As I have no bayonet at my command and would not have it even if I could command it, I must press for the qualities which the friend fears are at a discount. I do not share his fear—what is more I have patience enough to wait for the development of those qualities if they are not available in sufficient measure today. For this nation will never come to her own unless we exhibit them as a nation. I know too that we shall take much longer to discipline ourselves for violence, fraud and the like than we shall for truth and non-violence and all that they imply.
 The friend then draws my attention to the following omissions in my previous article :libtech_411_footnote
  The 	mills that join the 	scheme may 	not use foreign yarn 	or foreign 	artificial silk as many 	now do. They 	may not insure 	with foreign companies. They 	may not import foreign 	cloth and lable 	it ‘swadeshi’. 
 I had assumed that (a) and (c) were a foregone conclusion. I should not care to insist on (b) if the insistence would hamper the proposed joint venture. Much as I should like indigenous insurance enterprise, I am convinced that it is the foreign cloth that blocks the way as nothing else does. If we can put this Himalayan obstacle out of the way, we shall easily cope with hillocks.

355,,DIFFERENCE STATED,"
        
 I  gladly  publish  the  foregoing.libtech_412_footnotelibtech_413_footnoteIt  was  made  clear   at   those meetings of International Fellowshiplibtech_414_footnotelibtech_415_footnotethat I had meant the principal religions of the world and I had maintained that all were true more or less and that all were necessarily imperfect. Here therefore there is agreement. But Mr. Ireland’s letter leaves on the mind the impression that there is a fundamental difference between him and me regarding conversion, no matter by what name it is called. Let me extend the analogy of fragrance, faulty as all analogies are in their very nature. The rose imparts its fragrance not in many ways but only one. Those who have not the sense of smell will miss it. You cannot feel the fragrance through the tongue or the ear or the skin. So may you not receive spirituality except through the spiritual sense. Hence have all religions recognized the necessity of that sense being awakened. It is a second birth. A man with intense spirituality may without speech or a gesture touch the hearts of millions who have never seen him and whom he has never seen. The most eloquent preacher if he has not spirituality in him will fail to touch the hearts of his audience. Therefore I venture to think that most of the effort of modern missions is not only useless but more often than not harmful. At the root of missionary effort is also the assumption that one’s own belief is true not only for oneself but for all the world; whereas the truth is that God reaches uslibtech_416_footnotelibtech_417_footnotethrough millions of ways not understood by us. In missionary effort therefore there is lack of real humility that instinctively recognizes human limitations and the limitless power of God. I have no feeling that from a spiritual standpoint I am necessarily superior to the so-called savage. And spiritual superiority is a dangerous thing to feel. It is notlibtech_418_footnotelibtech_419_footnotelike many other things which we can perceive, analyse and prove through our senses. If it is there, I cannot be deprived of it by any power on earth, and it will have its effect in its own due time. But if in matters of medicine and other natural sciences, I feel my superiority over others, a thing of which I may be legitimately conscious, and if I have love for  my fellow  beings, I would naturally share my knowledge with them. But things of the spirit I leave to God and thus keep the bond between fellow beings and myself pure, correct and within limits. But I must not carry this argument any further.
 
 
 My first feeling was not to publish Mr. Ireland’s letter but to send a brief reply to him privately. But my regard for him has prompted me to comply with his wish without any ado knowing full well that this is not a matter which admits of any conclusive argument especially from my side and in view of the position herein described by me.

 Though what Deenabandhu says is the truth and nothing but the truth, I fear that if the British Imperialist rulers offer the Indian emigrants in any part of the world sufficient inducement, they will succumb and imagine that they are “equal partners”, not knowing that they are but “jackals”. But the hope lies in Imperialists never offering enough inducement and the native wit of the Indian emigrants seeing through the thin veil of Imperial maya.

358,,MARRIAGE OF THE OLD AND CHILD-MARRIAGE,"
        
A gentleman from Surat writes to say:libtech_423_footnote
 His criticism of child-marriages is largely correct. If the writer goes through the articles in the previous issues of Navajivan, he will see that they have often severely criticized child-marriages. And I also know that these articles have averted some child-marriages. However, there is still room for a great deal of reform. Society is not as much averse to child-marriage as it is to marriage with old men. In my opinion both these are equally objectionable. Hence, there is no difference of opinion between this correspondent and myself with regard to condemnation of child-marriage. If I had the authority or if my pen had enough power, I would use it to prevent every child- marriage. Parents who marry their children at a tender age become their enemies and are responsible for making them dependent and weak.
 However, the correspondent’s intention appears to be to uphold marriages of old men while discrediting child-marriages. The advantages of marrying an old man as stated by the correspondent seem to be ludicrous and also to ignore completely the poor girl or if there is any consideration for her it is only for her financial condition. The writer appears to forget that consent of the girls who are married off to old men is never secured; perhaps, in his opinion, it is needless to think of it. The correspondent seems to be wholly oblivious of the fact that marriage is a religious rite and, worse still, he fails  to remember that marriage with an old man amounts to a  doubly culpable child-marriage, as in all such cases not only is the bride a child but the old man who despite age contemplates marriage can only be deemed a child, or something worse. Although the husband may be living it is a kind of widowhood for the girl. Society is least likely to be harmed if old men who cannot control their passions or who for some other reason wish to marry, do so with old or mature women prepared to enter into such relationship with them.
 CONGRATULATIONS
 The result of the above-mentioned article has been that a poor girl has been spared as the elderly gentleman  who  was  going  to marry her realized his mistake on reading the article and gave up
 
 
 the idea of another marriage. I congratulate this gentleman on this welcome result. Let us hope that whenever in the future he is moved by passion he will restrain himself, thinking of the girl’s good and of society, and even the country and also remembering God. This case should infuse greater enthusiasm in soical workers. We find from this as well as other instance that have since occurred that social and other injustices can be prevented if timely steps—restrained yet firm—are taken against them.
 WILL ANOTHER COW BE SAVED?
 Some young girls have been rescued from being sold off to old men. Bearing this in mind a gentleman from Ranpur writes to say :libtech_424_footnote
 On the strength of this letter, I do request this Modh Vanik gentleman of Bhavnagar not to go through this marriage. At the age of 55, he should shrink from the thought of marrying a girl young enough to be his grand-daughter.I hope leaders of the Modh community of Bhavnagar will take all steps needed to prevent this marriage. In fact in such cases wherever people in general are alert, not only the leaders of small castes, but the entire public and even the State itself, should act as protectors of the young girls and it is their dharma to rescue girls who are being sold in this manner. Young men are their guardians and if they don the armour of virtue, humility and courage and do their duty they will be able to rescue all the poor young girls and there is no doubt they can.

 You know that I have discussed the matter with Lilabehnlibtech_430_footnotelibtech_431_footnote. She is of the same opinion as the others. Despite all the opposition, I find the general opinion is that if you wish to stay on you may do so. But that can only be if you believe that all these well-wishers are in the wrong. It is quite contrary to the rules of the Ashram if you think it wrong to work even as sacrifice. But I do not insist on your accepting my opinion and doing accordingly. Return this letter after reading it, as also the others. If you wish, I will give you a copy of each.
 Ponder deeply over all these things, and then, if you wish, we will discuss the matter personally. I do not wish to put any kind of pressure on you.

369,"March 27, 1928","SPEECH AT SWEEPERS’ MEETING, AHMEDABAD
libtech_432_footnote","
        
 March 27, 1928
 After having listened to these bhajans I feel that there is no difference between you and me. At present my health is such that I cannot attend any function and the doctors too have forbidden me to attend meetings. Because I am here today, do not think that I am fit. After a long interval and for the first time since I returned to Ahmedabad, I am attending a meeting and that too because Shri Banker and others insisted that I should give some advice to the Bhangis of the city.
 Truly speaking, you are the high-caste Hindus. Your sacrifice is very great. The so-called caste Hindus are more responsible for your blemishes than you are. You come to have these because they fors- ook you. I wish you would get rid of these vices now. I can clean
 
 latrines better than you do, but you prevent me from doing it; this is a grave mistake. Why should you prevent others from doing it?
 The caste Hindus regard your work as low and of little value but my honest opinion is that it is the best. As long as one cannot do that work well, one cannot be said to have served well. What is  the condition of the streets and lanes of Ahmedabad? I say this because I clean everything myself. You should feel that by doing this work, you render the greatest and the most important service to the city. Why do you object if others participate in such service?
 If I had my say I would get the lanes and latrines of Ahmedabad cleaned by High School boys and make the city so beautiful that I could proudly invite everyone to visit it. The key to this lies in your hands. Regard this as an act of service and perform it with diligence because the city’s health depends mainly on it. If you realize this you can remove many of the difficulties faced by Vallabhbhailibtech_433_footnote,  and  you will receive applause from the citizens and at the same time you will put your betters to shame.
 I have no faith in your claim that the evil of drinking has decreased. I think out of every sixteen persons two abstain from drinking and fourteen indulge in it. I do not believe that anyone runs into debt for food; they do so only for indulging in pleasures. You must get rid of all these addictions.
 You should teach your children not to eat left-overs. You too should take a vow to the same effect. You should accept only that which can be accepted without humiliation. In this way you will be able to train your children well. It does not matter if you are not educated, but you must learn how to count so that no one can deceive you. You must also cultivate habits of personal cleanliness. From the leaders of society you have only to learn self-purification. For that you must give up all your addictions. If, in spite of the khadi cap that you wear, you have addictions, you will disgrace the cap. I will also get you good help from the Municipality and from the rich men of Ahmedabad when you do something on your own.

 MY DEAR C. R.,
 I have your letter about the proposed European visit. I have myself no heart in it, nor have I any confidence in myself about making it successful; but an interview with Rolland still remains an attraction. All the reputation I enjoy in the West is borrowed from him and I feel that if I meet him face to face, there may be disillusionment on many points. It may be that we should come closer than we ever were. I do attach considerable importance to our knowing each other much better than we do.
 I quite agree with you that there is nothing to gain from the health point of view. I might possibly suffer, and health is no consideration, whatsoever in the proposed trip. From that point of view any hill station in India would be infinitely superior for me.
 I feel also with you that the withdrawal of my presence is likely to unsettle things a bit especially in Bardoli. Foreign cloth boycott can certainly make no headway during my absence. But now that you are all gathering together at Calcutta. I would like you to discuss the proposed visit at the Council meeting. I am most anxious that I should not become exclusive and should be humble enough to arrive at truth no matter from what source it comes.
 I am sorry about the defalcations, but I shall accept  your  warning not to disturb myself or discuss them.
 I understand what you say about Ramachandran. I want you to write him a warm letter and go out of your way to draw him towards you. He is kind of ‘Chetty’ also, for he did wonderfully well in the way of khadi at Jamia.
 I must not forget one thing, though, about your reference to the defalcations. If the defaulter gives you Rs. 500 and  tenders  an  apology for publication, you should be entirely satisfied. But this is an unconsidered opinion of a layman.
 What do you say to my exploit in conducting an exclusively milk experiment? I do not want to be told you swooned at my saying it is a literally milk-and-water experiment.

378,,THE DOCTRINE OF FRIGHTFULNESS,"
        
 In answer to a question put by a member of the late Hunter Committee, General Dyer admitted that Jallianwala was designed to create frightfulness. In making the admission the late General enunciated no new doctrine. Indeed “the ablest Civil Service in the world” has laid the foundation of its greatness on frightfulnesses.
 In pursuance of this well-known policy, according to the information received at the time of going to press it appears that summary steps are now to be taken against the farmers of Bardoli in order to compel submission. For eight preliminary  notices  of forfeiture have been served upon certain satyagrahis of Bardoli. The names of these seem to have been carefully chosen, for all of them happen to be banias of note. The choice has been so made presumably because banias who have the reputation of being weak and timid are expected to yield under notices of forfeiture. What can be more natural, officialdom would argue, than that banias weakening, the others must follow suit. Satyagrahis need not be surprised at this first show of frightfulness. They have been repeatedly told to expect forfeitures and worse. Let them now show their strength if they have it in them.

 "
379,,THE NATIONAL WEEK,"
        
 The national week comes upon us with seasonlike regularity and has found us more or less wanting since after 1922. The 6th April to 13th April should be regarded as days of privilege, introspection, intense national activity and self-purification. These precious seven days should be days of stock-taking and heart-searching. The morning of 6th April 1919 found an India awakened to a sense of her dignity. Hindus, Mussalmans and others composing the nation felt themselves united like blood-brothers as they are in reality, if they would but recognize themselves as sons of the soil.
 6th of April 1919 found an India endowed with a true spirit of swadeshi which culminated in khadi and which is now feeding according to the latest figures over 90,000 poor spinners.
 The spirit thus awakened continued to advance during 1920 and 1921 and we seemed to be within an ace of statutory swaraj.
 But that swaraj did not come and there was a set-back. Apparently since then there has been only an ebb. Hindus and Mussalmans are flying at each other’s throats.
 Instead of swadeshi we have the cry for boycott of British goods pending settlement as if support of Japanese goods including Japan’s cheap calico can ever be a substitute for swadeshi, i.e., khadi, exclusive of all foreign cloth. After much research, reasoning and experience, we seemed in 1920-21 to have come to the conclusion that the only practical, effective and necessary swadeshi was khadi, not pending any settlement but for all time or such time as we could discover a better and more paying occupation for the starving millions. I have seen no new argument in support of boycott of British goods only as distinguished from foreign goods. No new situation has arisen to warrant the belief that boycott of British goods is a  practical proposition and that the use of foreign cloth other than British is not almost equally detrimental to the best interest of India.
 Would that those who are supporting the cry of boycott  of British goods will seriously think over their programme, and, if necessary, revise their plan and join the khadi movement with the whole-hearted conviction that it and it alone can bring about complete boycott, not merely of British cloth but of all foreign cloth.
 But whether they do so or not, I am sure they do not make of support to foreign cloth other than British cloth a matter of principle. And if I am right in my supposition, let them support the sales of
 khadi during the National Week. If they will but study the progress of the khadi movement during the past seven years that it has been going on, they will discover that the charkha has more potency than they have ever dreamt of. It is potent enough, if it receives the whole- hearted and active support of politically-minded India, to bring about boycott of foreign cloth even without the assistance of our mills. With the active and organized support of the latter, boycott of foreign cloth becomes a much easier proposition. Indeed the mill-owners hold the trump card if only they would play it for the sake of the nation. They have at their disposal a ready-made extensive organization, which, if they devote it to the service of the nation, can simplify the campaign of boycott and arm the nation with the power it so much needs.
 And why will not Hindus and Mussalmans recall those precious seven days and shed all fear, mutual distrust and weakness?
 Let me not forget the so-called untouchables, the classes that we Hindus have been guilty of suppressing. Shall we not have the vision to see that in suppressing a sixth (or whatever the number) of ourselves, we have depressed ourselves? No man takes another down a pit without descending into it himself and sinning in the bargain. It is not the suppressed that sin. It is the suppressor who has to answer for his crime against those whom he suppresses.

380,,NOTES,"
        
 SPECIAL FOR NATIONAL WEEK
 Sjt. Vithaldas. Jerajani (Khadi Bhandar, Princess Street, Bombay) writes :libtech_436_footnote
 I do hope that there will be an adequate response to Sjt.  Jerajani’s legitimate wish and hope. Bombay has always been sens- itive to national moods. Bombay laid the foundation of the national khadi movement by opening the first khadi bhandar. The figures given in the letter are instructive. The great drop in 1925 is to be
 
 accounted for by the fact there was another large khadi store opened in Kalbadevi Road. Nevertheless the figures for the other years are an eloquent proof of the statement that Bombay is the proper barometer for the politically-minded India. The figures for 1927 show a decided improvement upon 1926. Will Bombay rise to those of 1922? Not that even such a rise will be anything commensurate with what is required for the boycott we want and can have if we would but show the necessary measure of sacrifice and determination.
 Another notice I have is from the Shuddha Khadi Bhandar, Richey Road, Ahmedabad. That Bhandar also proposes during the National Week to give discount from one anna to four annas in the rupee according to the variety required.
 I hope that all khadi organizations whether owned by the Association or certified will put forth special efforts to bring khadi to the notice of the public and that the public will make a  liberal response.
 KHADI TOUR IN BENGAL
 It is perhaps necessary to emphasize in Bengal that the khadi tour organized by Sjt. Satis Chandra Das Gupta is also the All-India Deshbandhu Memorial tour. Sheth Jamnalalji, Sjt. Rajagopalachari, Sjt. Manilal Kothari and Sjt. Shankerlal Banker are about to tour in Bengal as from the 5th of next month in the interest of khadi, which an all-India committee decided on the death of Deshbandhu should be the centre and the circumference of an all-India memorial for the late Chittaranjan Das, the uncrowned king of Bengal. There is a wave of swadeshi passing over Bengal at present. But I suspect that the true meaning of swadeshi is missed in the forest of words that surround that simple but life-giving word. Let us adhere to its root-meaning and we shall discover nothing but khadi in it. Swadehsi is “of one’s own country”. Among things of the villagers’ daily use, cloth is the only thing that is “not of one’s own country”. That which they can easily make themselves is also cloth. Hence the swadeshi that they can realize and without which they must starve is khadi and nothing else. Hence is khadi the only real swadeshi for every patriot. I hope therefore that Sheth Jamnalalji and his companions will be whole-heartedly assisted by Bengal wherever they go. Every yard of khadi bought and every donation given to the Memorial is so much help to the boycott movement and to the poorest in the land.
 BOYCOTT AND STUDENTS
 The Principal of a college writes :libtech_437_footnote
 The promoters of the boycott movement are dragging the students into their movement.	When the students leave their schools and colleges and join
 any demonstration, they mingle with the rowdies of the place and have to be responsible for all the outrages of the badmashes and often receive the first blows from the policeman’s batons. They, besides, incur the displeasure of the school and college authorities whose punishment they have to submit to; they further disobey their guardians who might refuse to finance them further, which spells their ruin. I can understand youth movements which aim at doing such constructive work as teaching the ignorant peasants, spreading knowledge of sani-tation, etc., during holidays; but to see them turn against their own parents and teachers and walk along streets in questionable company and help the breaking of law and order is a sorry spectacle. May I request you to advise the politicians not to draw the students from their legitimate work to make their demonstration more effective? . . .
The correspondent has written in the hope of my condemning
 the participation by the student world in active political work. But I am sorry to have to disappoint him. He should have known that in 1920-21 I had not an inconsiderable share in drawing students out of their schools and colleges and inducing them to undertake political duty carrying with it the risk of imprisonment. I think it is their clear duty to take leading part in the political movement of their country. They are doing so all the world over. In India where political cons- ciousness has till recently been unfortunately confined in a large measure to the English-educated class, their duty is, indeed, greater. In China and Egypt it was the students who have made the national movement possible. They cannot do less in India.
 What the Principal might have urged was the necessity of students observing the rules of non-violence and acquiring control over the rowdies, instead of being controlled by them.
 MACAULAY’S DREAMS
A friend sends me the following quotation from Macaulay’s
 Life and Letters :libtech_438_footnote
 On the 7th March 1835 Lord William Bentinck decided that “the great object of the British Government ought to be the promotion of European
 
 literature and science among the natives of India;” two of the orientalists retired from the Committee of Public Instruction; . . . and Macaulay entered upon the functions of President. . . .
 “Our English schools, said Lord Macaulay, “are flourishing wonderfully. .
 . . The effect of this education on the Hindoos is prodigious. No Hindoo who has received an English education ever remains sincerely attached to his religion. It is my firm belief that if our plans of education are followed up,
 there will not be a single idolator among the respectable classes of Bengal thirty years hence. ”
I do not know whether Macaulay’s dream that English-educated
 India would abandon its religious beliefs has been realized. But we know too that he had another dream, namely, to supply through English-educated India clerks and the like for the English rulers. The dream has certainly been realized beyond all expectations.
 PEACE AMIDST STRIFE
 Before now I have shared with the reader some of the beautiful things that a friend sends me from time to time for my Monday silence. I am tempted to share with him the following  further instalment which has been lying with me in my jacket for a long time. All but the last two are extracts from Buddhistic writings. The last but one is from Emerson and the last of all is a Hindu proverb.
 Like a beautiful flower full of colour, without scent, the fine words of him who does not act accordingly are fruitless.
 A mind unshaken by life’s vicissitudes, unstirred by grief or passion, is the greatest of all blessings.
 There never was, there never will be, a man who is always praised, or a man who is always blamed.
 As a solid rock is not shaken by the wind, so wise men falter not amidst blame or praise.
 Let us live happily, then, not hating those who hate us. Let us live free from hatred among men who hate.
 Let us  live happily, then, free from ailments among the ailing.  Let us dwell free from afflictions among men who are sick at heart. Let us live happily, then, free care among the busy.
 Let us dwell free from yearning among men who are anxious. Let us  live happily, then, though we  call nothing our  own. We shall become like the bright Gods, who feed on happiness.
 The greatest prayer is patience.
 Never in this world does hatred cease by hatred.
 
 Hatred ceases by love: this is always its nature. Reverence and lowliness,
 Contentment and gratitude,
 The hearing of the Lord at due season. This is the greatest blessing.
 As a mother, even at the risk of her own life, protects her son, her only son: so let a man cultivate goodwill without measure among all beings.
 Let him cultivate goodwill without measure toward the whole world, above, below, unstinted, unmixed with any feeling of differing or opposing interests. Let a man remain steadfastly in that state of mind all the while he is awake, whether he be standing, walking, sitting or lying down. This state of heart is the best in the world.
 By rousing himself, by earnestness, by restraint and control, the wise man may make for himself an island which no flood can overwhelm.
 As the bee—injuring not
 The flower, its colour, or scent— Flies away, taking the nectar :
 So let the wise man dwell Upon the truth.
 Ye taught my lips a single speech And a thousand silences.
 Even Buddha was once a cart-horse, and carried the loads of others.

381,,ON FASTING,"
        
 The reader is familiar with the letters of a Polish professor from which I have published extracts from time to time in these columns.libtech_439_footnoteIn one of his letters referring to my fasts he writes :libtech_440_footnote
 I publish this as being of use to the reader who is interested in such researches. The physical and moral value of fasting is being more and more recognized day by day. A vast number of diseases can be more surely treated by judicious fasting than by all sorts  of nostrums including the dreadful injections—dreadful not because for the pain they cause but because of the injurious by-products which
 
 often result from their use. More mischief than we are aware of is done by the drug treatment. But not many cases of harm done by fasting can be cited. Increased vitality is almost the universal experience of those that have fasted. For real rest body and mind is possible only during fasting. Suspension of daily work is hardly rest without the rest that the over-taxed and overworked  digestive apparatus needss in a multitude of cases. The moral effect of fasti- ng,while it is considerable, is not so easily demonstrable.libtech_441_footnotelibtech_442_footnoteFor moral res-ults there has to be perfect co-operation from the mind. And there is dan-ger of self-deception. I know of many instances  in  which fasting underta-ken for moral results has been overdone. To a limited extent it is a most valuable agent if the person fasting knows what he is doing. There was considerable force in the warning given by the Prophet against his disciples copying his fasting over and above the semi-fasts of Ramzan.“My Maker sends me food enough when I fast, not so to you,” said the Prophet. Of what use is a spiritual fast when the spirit hankers more after food the longer the body is starved?

382,,TWO CORRECTIONS,"
        
 Two lamentable errors have crept into the footnote to Mr. Ireland’s letter printed at page 93 in Young Indialibtech_443_footnotelibtech_444_footnoteof the 22nd instant. About the middle of the column one reads: “God reaches earth through millions of ways not understood by us.” The stenographer heard “earth” when “us” was spoken. The sixth line after this one reads: “It is like many other things which we can perceive”, etc. The context would show that “not” is obviously omitted from  the sentence. It should read: “It is not like many other things”, etc.

  	I have your letter. You are never without troubles. But they should 	be treated as chasteners. Dhiren’s case is difficult to advise 	upon.libtech_446_footnoteIdealistically 	he  should  disobey  every  order  of  externment and internment and 	submit to any punishment that may be givento him. But that is a 	matter for himself to judge. Before he can disobey the orders I have 	in mind, he must have the inner conviction that disobeying is a duty 	and imprisonment for disobe-yance not a task but a matter of joy. 	And such joy is possible only when one considers such imprisonments 	as conducive to individual as well as national growth. But what 	actually should be done I cannot really confidently say. You know 	Dhiren better than I do and after all Dhiren will be largely guided 	by what you would have him to do.

 I have your letter. You must not hesitate to write to me about your wants, and any other matter. I shall try to meet you as far as possible, but you might be called upon to face privations. Bickerings at home too may be a national servant’s lot.
 Thakkar Bapa saw Sir Purushottamdas about your salary and Sir Purushottamdas considers your receiving salary from the Central Committee as the most natural thing and Rs. 150 as quite reasonable. Now I shall have to ask for Rs. 200.  I  don’t anticipate  any difficulty.
 I am trying to find out whether Jethalal or Parshatlal can be spared. Kalyanji and Naraharibhai it is impossible to spare. Narahari has his own work chalked out for him and Kalyanji must be buried in Bardoli. But I have an able businessman just now free for such work. He is Jaisukhlal Gandhi. He was in charge of Amreli Khadi Karyalaya. It is now being rearranged and Jaisukhlal is being made free. Your letter under reply comes just in time to keep him free. But it is necessary to send him to Amreli for winding up the head office and despatch all the stock here. This is likely to take a fortnight. I have just had a talk with him as to whether he is prepared to do the thing. He is agreeable provided I let him go to Amreli straightway and wind up the business there. I have sent a wirelibtech_447_footnoteto  you  today.  If  I  do  not receive your reply at once, you will have to give a fortnight to be counted after receiving your final reply.

 I have replied to your cablegram. Nothing is yet certain. I am not clear in my own mind as to what I should do. I am now in correspondence with M. Romain Rolland. His final reply will help me to come to some decision. If the visit to Europe is decided upon and if I reach in time I would gladly perform the opening ceremonylibtech_448_footnote. But so far as I can see I can’t possibly reach in time. There seems to be no occasion to leave India before May if at all. I may therefore suggest your making other arrangements.
 As for staying with you, of course, I would love to do so if you can harbour me and my companions, because if I do come I shan’t be alone.

390,"March 30, 1928","SPEECH AT ASHRAM ON RAMANAVAMI
DAY","
        
 March 30, 1928
 The Rama of whom we sing is not the Rama of Valmiki, nor even the Rama of Tulsi—although his Ramayana is very dear to me and I consider it an incomparable work, I never seem to have enough of it once I start reading it. Today, however, we shall not think of Tulsidas’s Rama or the Rama of Girdhar’s Ramayana, much less Rama of Kalidasa or Bhavabhuti. There is great beauty in  Bhavabhuti’s Uttararamacharita. However, here is not the  Rama whose name we may recite to cross to the other shore or whose name we may repeat in moments of despair. If someone is suffering unbearable pain I tell him to repeat Ramanama. If someone is unable to sleep I tell him too to repeat Ramanama. This Rama is not the son
 
 of Dasharatha or the husband of Sita. In fact he is not the embodied Rama. The Rama that dwells in our hearts cannot possibly have a physical form; the heart is no larger than a thumb and the Rama who dwells in some niche there could not have a body, nor could he have been born on the ninth day of the month of Chaitra in a certain year. He is birthless. He is the Creator, the Lord of the universe. Hence the Rama whom one wishes to remember, and whom one should remember, is the Rama of one’s own imagination, not the Rama of someone else’s imagination.
 If we keep this in mind, many doubts that trouble us would not arise at all. Many times we wonder how the Rama who slew Vali could be called the Perfect One. I too come across many such questions, and I am amused. What great achievement is there in having  slain someone, by fair means or foul, or to have destroyed the ten-headed Ravana, if ever there was one such. In this modern age, even if a Ravana is born, not with twenty but countless hands, a child standing behind a cannon can, by firing a single ball, send all his arms and heads flying. We would not regard such a child superhuman;  we would look upon him as a big mons-ter. I believe that we do not wish to acquire the strength of a super-mons-ter. We would not attain peace by worshipping him. We should worship Him, the Inner Ruler, who dwells in the hearts of all, yet transcends all and is the Lord of all. It is He of whom we sing:  Nirbalke bal Ramalibtech_453_footnotelibtech_454_footnote. The song also mentions Draupadi’s despair. Now, what had Draupadi to do with an embodied Rama? Yet, the poet has sung that Rama saved Draupadi’s honour. The Rama mentioned here is the One who is common to all and yet comprehended by none. It is this Rama whom we remember. Between this Rama, the Inner Ruler, and Krishna there is no difference.
 We celebrate the festival of Rama’s birth so that we may practise some self-restraint, and the children may enjoy innocent pleasures and learn some lesson by reading the Ramayana. Man, who is himself embodied,  cannot  easily  conceive  God  in  any  other form. His imagination cannot go  farther.  Therefore  he  conceives God as being incarnated in human form. Hinduism has boundless tolerance. Hence God has been described  as  descending  in  the  forms of a fish, a boar and a man-lion. In this way having super- imposed a form on  God,  men  conceived  Him  as  having  a  body and then imagined Him as taking birth. And when we speak of His
 
 avatars to protect dharma whenever dharma declines and adharma flou-rishes, it is true only in the manner and to the extent which I have just described; how else could we say that the birthless One took birth? There is no reason to believe that any historical figure was the incarnation of God or God as a historical figure was born in human or any other form. If a person is endowed with all the qualities of God, he may be called an incarnation of God. It was because of their divine qualities that all those great men of the past were regarded by people as either plenary or partial incarnations. And yet, knowing this, different devotees have described the same God in the Rama  of Valmiki or Tulsidas and there is no harm in singing those bhajans. If we bear in mind what I said earlier, we would not be deluded. If someone wishes to confuse us confronting us with conundrums, we should tell him that we do not worship embodied Rama as conceived by anyone; we worship our own Rama who is flawless and formless. As we cannot reach Him direct, we sing bhajans that describe Him as personified, and then try to apprehend Him in His purity.
 So long as we are unable to see through the wall of the body, the qualities of truth and non-violence will not become fully manifest in us. When we think of pursuing truth, we must stop mistaking the body for ourselves, for we shall have to die in the pursuit of truth. The same is true of non-violence. The body is the root of ego. One who has attachment to the body cannot free himself of the ego. I cannot become wholly free of violence so long as I have the feeling that this body is mine. One who desires to have vision of God will have to transcend the body, to despise it, to court death.
 It is only when we master these two qualities that we can be saved, that we can practise brahmacharya and so on. How can we do without truth if we wish to practise such vows? The face of truth is hidden by a golden lid.libtech_455_footnotelibtech_456_footnoteWhy should we fear to speak the truth or to act truthfully? How can we catch a glimpse of truth so long as we do not remove the glittering lid of untruth? If anyone commits an offence, are we willing to love him instead of getting angry with him? Although we sing that this world is insubstantial, do we know at all what the word implies?
 “If  you  wish  to  know  me,”  says  Rama,  “you  must   flee  the world.” But the body cannot be wished away. Having trained ourselves to look upon the world as unreal, we may go about our
 
 
 business as a matter of duty all the time and still find Rama. That is the teaching of the Gita. This is why I regard the Gita as a spiritual dictionary. Tulsidas teaches us the same truth through  beautiful poetry.
 The key, however, is the one that I have given, namely, that the Rama in our hearts is the Ferryman who will take us across. We cannot all create poetry as Tulsidas did. But we can fill our life with poetry by bringing God into it.

391,"March 31, 1928","SPEECH AT GATHERING OF STUDENTS
				AND TEACHERS, AHMEDABAD libtech_457_footnote","
        
 March 31, 1928 Mahatmaji, addressing the students, expressed satisfaction  that  his suggestions had been carried out. He however regretted that the boys were not as clean
 as they ought to be. Putting on khaddar, he said, indicated that they were clean both bodily and in their hearts.
 The mill-owners, Gandhiji continued, were not extending their helping hand by becoming liberal in donating money. He was conferring with the mill-owners and requesting them to pay all the money subscribed by them to the Tilak Swaraj Fund for the benefit of the children unconditionally without interfering in any way in the administration of the schools, which must be solely left to the Labour Union. Even if they did not give any money these schools would go on.
 God is great and if you have faith in Him you would get money from any source, provided you have true ideals.
 To teachers, Gandhiji said that they must not make any use of books for imparting education, as books spoiled eyes and blunted the intellect. He himself had experienced that. He understood that in Russia they were conducting one thousand schools for peasants and that they were giving education without the aid of books by making all possible use of the senses. He asked them to clean their own houses and streets themselves and not to depend on others for doing the same.
 Concluding, Mahatmaji asked them to make their schools ideal in every way, so that the boys and girls of the mill-owners might envy them and the mill-owners might be tempted to send their children to the labour schools. On truth depended the foundation of education, and they must always resort to truth.

 I have for a long time wished to write to you just a line. I was told that I could look forward to meeting you at Madras. But that was not to be.
 Will you kindly tell me why you have preferred the cry of boycott of British goods, principally British cloth, to boycott  of foreign cloth and why also boycott of British cloth only pending settlement?

 THE ASHRAM, SABARMATI,
 March 31, 1928
 MY DEAR SHANTIKUMAR,
 I have your letter. The terms that I think the mill-owners should agree to are as follows :
  The 	prices should 	be regulated 	by a 	special committee 	representing all interests.  The 	production both 	as to kind 	and quantity 	should also be 	regulated by 	the said committee.  Mills 	should cease 	to sell 	any mill-cloth under 	the name of khadi 	and should cease 	within three 	months at 	the outside 	of the 	date of 	acceptance of 	terms to 	manufacture any cloth 	that is likely 	to compete 	with khadi and 	to this 	end the committee 	will specify 	from time 	to time 	what the mills 	may not manufacture. Mills will organize not only the sales of mill-cloth but they 
 
 will sell khadi also through the agencies thus organized.
  Mills 	should use no 	foreign yarn, no 	foreign silk, no 	foreign wool 	nor artificial silk.  Mills 	should whole-heartedly 	identify themselves with 	the boycott of 	foreign cloth movement 	and to 	this end should 	put forth 	all their energy 	towards gaining control over 	piece-goods merchants, 	other middle men and cotton market in so far as it may be possible.  If 	a clear understanding is 	arrived at 	with mills, khadi depots 	will naturally 	become agencies for the 	sale of mill-cloth 	under terms 	laid down by 	the said committee.  Mills 	should hand 	to the 	said committee such 	funds as may 	be required 	from time to 	time for 	propaganda. This, 	in my opinion, 	may not exceed 	one lakh of rupees. 
 This letter is being hurriedly  dictated.  You  mill  therefore please supplement these conditions with those stated in the two issues of  Young Indialibtech_458_footnoteif there is any omission. You will not publish this letter in any case, and, you will please remember that these are only my own personal views, and if anything substantial is to come out of these talks, [th]ere will have to be a formal meeti[ng of a]ll concerned.

  	I have your kind telegram. I am extremely sorry that I shall be 	unable to attend the Conference. I however wish you all success and 	hope that the Conference will not forget khaddar which represents 	the dumb millions.  Yours 	sincerely,  SJT. 	RAI 	HARENDRANATH 	CHAIRMAN, 	RECEPTION 	COMMITTEE 	BENGAL 	PROVINCIAL 	CONFERENCE 	CHANDRI, 	CALCUTTA  From 	a microfilm: S.N. 13142             	When member of the Hunter Committee asked General Dyer the leading 	question with reference to the Jallianwala Bagh: “Was it your idea 	to instil fear of the Government in the minds of the people by 	acting ruthlessly?” the latter, enthusiastically accepted the 	suggestion and replied in the affirmative. However, the reign of 	terror had not begun with General Dyer. It is the legacy of 	tradition and the monopoly of Indian bureaucracy. It can, however, 	be said that General Dyer gained notoriety for this repression. 	Hence we know it also as Dyerism. As bureaucracy is dependent for 	its very existence on  a policy of Dyerism, it does not hesitate to 	seek shelter under the latter when occasion arises. According to it 	such an occasion has arisen in Bardoli. Hence it may be said to have 	launched repression on the bania satyagrahis who are regarded as 	cowardly and submissive. Eight of these satyagrahis have been served 	with notices that if they do not pay up their land revenue 	stipulated therein before the 12th of April, their lands will be 	confiscated. The notice served on one bania gentleman shows the 	amount of revenue due as Rs. 160. Perhaps we could not have found 	fault with the Government if it had confiscated land worth Rs. 160, 	but to confiscate land worth thousands of rupees for the sake of Rs. 	160 is nothing but repression. Under this policy, 
 on certain occasions, the punishment for a slap is not ano-ther slap but the gallows. We shall call anyone who extorts a thousand rupees for a debt of one rupee a tyrant, a ten-headed Ravana.
 What reply will the banias, who are said to have forethought, give to this? Will they betray cowardice or prove themselves worthy of having joined the army of satyagrahis?
 Vallabhbhai has warned not once but repeatedly that the Government has by  legislation  acquired  the  right  to  confiscate land, to imprison people, etc., and that it has time and again given proof of the fact that it will not hesitate in the least to exercise those rights. Hence neither they nor others should be flabbergasted by this notice of confiscation. They should have faith that the Government will not be able to derive any benefit from the land which would be confiscated in this manner and that it would not go to a traitor who would come forward to purchase it if it is auctioned. Land which has been filched in this manner is like unprocessed mercury which is bound to erupt as boils.
 Land is not more precious than one’s pledge or one’s self- respect. There are myriads of landless people in this country. During the last floods, many people’s lands were eroded and layers of sand have now been deposited over them. Just as Gujaratis withstood the wrath of the heavens with courage and fortitude, may the satyagrahis of Bardoli similarly put up with this wrath of the Government and may they stand by their pledge!

 "
396,,THE NATIONAL WEEK,"
        
 The forthcoming National Week is the ninth of its kind. In this Week, we should take stock of the progress made by us. However, instead of that we find despondency in many places. For us this Week is the time for calculating the national sum total of achievement, for introspection and for self-purification, for uniting the  hearts  of Hindus, Muslims, Parsis and other, for Hindus to welcome in their midst those men and women who have been regarded as untouchables and to serve them, and for Hindus, Muslims and others to take exclusively to khadi and boycott foreign cloth.
However, today we seem to have forgotten these limbs which
 sustain the nation. Those who have aith in any of these causes are making efforts to promote them. But now all this is not beinng done on an extensive scale. Today we do not hear people say, as they used to do in the past, that swaraj cannot be secured without these.
 An attempt should be  made during  the  National  Week  to bring about a change in this state of affairs. Those who have an unswerving faith in constructive activity should make  great  efforts  in this direction, irrespective of whether some or all national institutions make such an effort; it is only from such efforts that an allembracing activity will and must start again. None should entertain any doubts that khadi is the one visible activity that can be taken up by children, men, women, Hindus, Muslims and all others. The talk of boy-cott is everywhere in the air. However, there seems to be some confu-sion regarding boycott at the moment. Some persons advocate the boy-cott of British goods, others of British cloth alone and that too until such time as a peaceful solution is arrived at, while yet others advocate the permanent boycott of foreign cloth. All these things cannot go on at the same time. After the first two intentions had been proclaimed for twenty years, the people found on deeper reflection in 1920 that the only way of boycotting foreign cloth which was possible as well as obligatory was to replace it by khadi. Moreover, this idea of boycotting foreign cloth does not depend on any conditions but holds good for all time. And that which is everlasting is beneficial even in small measure whereas that which is dependent on conditions is beneficial only if it materializes in an appropriate measure. If the latter brings bout only partial results, it may even prove harmful.
 Hence we ought to free ourselves from this delusion and make constant efforts to carry on propaganda for khadi for the sake of boycotting foreign cloth or, in other words, for the sake of the poor of India. In order to do that :
  those 	who do 	not already wear 	khadi should do so 	and advise 	others to do likewise;  all 	should spin 	as much 	as possible 	and inspire 	others to do 	likewise;  all 	should contribute as 	much as 	possible for 	this cause and collect 	funds from neighbours. 
In this connection, what Shri Vithaldas Jerajani writes is worth
 nothing :libtech_459_footnote
 The figures given here are worth pondering over. Bombay is the barometer for gauging the feelings of politically-conscious India. It is not too great a venture for Bombay to reach the figures of the first year. That is like a drop in the ocean in the matter of making the boycott a success.

397,,MY NOTES,"
    
 ORISSA’S PLIGHT
I give below an extractlibtech_460_footnotelibtech_461_footnotefrom Shri Chhaganlal Gandhi’s letter:
 The reader should remember that these starving children who wander about aimlessly, who pick up from the sand and eat banana skins which have been thrown away, are our own brothers and sisters. if we proudly call India our mother, we cannot but look upon these forlorn children as our brothers and sisters. What can swaraj mean to them? What will they say if we ask them to define swaraj? Shall we fill their stomaches by throwing uncooked rice at them by way of alms? Shall we let them pick up banana skins from the sand? Shall we let them eat rotten grain? Or shall we make human beings of them by making them industrious and providing them with some occupation? In my humble opinion, swaraj lies hidden in the search for a remedy for the starvation in Orissa.
 CHEAP KHADI
 The person in charge of the Shuddha Khadi Bhandar on Richey Road has sent the following notelibtech_462_footnote:
 If we wish to boycott foreign cloth, the stock of khadi lying in this small shop will be sold out on a single day of the week. One such shop should not have much difficulty in meeting its expenses.

 DEAR SATYANANDA BABU,
 I have your letter. It give me joy to think that you do remember me occasionally. You will have seen from the pages of Young India that I am trying my best to induce mill-owners to shoulder the burden of bringing about a boycott of foreign cloth. We may not go beyond the negotiations at the present moment. But the ground will have been prepared for future action, if we can do nothing just now.
 I am not at all sure in my mind as to the propriety of going to Europe. I am therefore still vegetating and still awaiting for the call from within. The next fortnight will perhaps decide the matter. If, however, the negotiations take a concrete shape, of course I do not go because I flatter myself with the belief that a ssuccessful prosecution of the boycott will demand my continuous presence in India.
 Yours,

MY DEAR MALKANI,
 
 THE ASHRAM, SABARMATI,
 April 4, 1928
  	I have your telegram. I am sending not Jaisukhlal Gandhi but 	Mathuradas who is bringing this letter. He is perhaps better fitted 	for the work because his knowledge of English is better and being a 	Cutchi knows the language and habits of many people  there.  Of 	course he is a well-tried worker. He has been working in connection 	with khadi for many years now and has a wide knowledge of mercantile 	business. He was born and brought up in Malabar. He really came with 	Lakshmidas. He has been just now taken up by Kakasaheb for the 	Vidyapith in order to develop the charkha work. Therefore he is 	loaned to you from the Vidyapith  and  his  honoranium will be paid 	by the Vidyapith. His travelling expenses are being paid just now on 	your account, that is, the Committee’s account, but if there is 	any difficulty about paying his railway expenses, you will please 	tell me. I take it that you won’t want to keep him beyond 15th of 	May. If you do want anybody beyond that time, I will have to send 	you someone else because he will be wanted by Kakasaheb on the first 	of June and before that he would want to go to Calicut to bring his 	family.  	About your own honorarium, I have now a letter from Thakkar Bapu who 	says you old him also that you would want no more than Rs. 150. What 	is this? I do not mind the Rs. 200, but I want to know how you came 	upon Rs. 150 and why afterwards you had to increase your demand? I 	am anxious for all of us to be deliberate and firm in all we do. The 	only hope I see of our regeneration lies in some at least developing 	decision, forethought and the like. You are not to take this amiss, 	nor to revert to Rs. 150 unless you can clearly do so whilst you are 	doing relief work. But if you find that you made a miscalculation or 	if you fixed Rs. 150 without previous consultation with Mrs. Malkani 	and others concerned, you must humbly make the admission and ask for 	Rs. 200. You understand why I write all this, don’t you? I want 	you to come up to my expectations.

You will not be able to put your 	whole soul into it if your attention is divided between two trusts. 	One or the other or both must suffer, especially when there is 	likely often to be a conflict between the two.

413,"April 4, 1928",PRAYER SPEECH AT ASHRAM,"
    
 [April 4, 1928]libtech_465_footnote
 The first lesson in emulating Hanuman is to apply all one’s senses to the task in hand. In order to do this, one’s vision must remain unwavering and pure. The eyes are the lamp of  the  body and, one may add, of the soul also. For inasmuch as the soul dwells in the body, it can be looked at through the eyes. A man might through his speech present a false show and deceive others, but his eyes would reveal him. If he does not have a steady unwavering look in his eyes, his real nature will be betrayed. Just as physical  ailments  are diagnosed by examining the tongue, spiritual maladies may  be detected by looking at the eyes. Hence children should be taught to look straight, right from their childhood.
 Hanuman’s eyes had a steadfast gaze and showed that, just as Rama’s name was ever on his lips, it filled his heart and pervaded every fibre of his being.
 I like the custom of installing Hanuman in our gymnasiums; this however does not mean that we wish to gain physical strength alone or that we worship merely Hanuman’s physical strength. We should certainly become physically strong; but we should also know that Hanuman did not have the physique of a giant, he was the son of Vayulibtech_466_footnote, hence his body was as light as a flower and yet wiry. However, Hanuman’s distinctiveness lay not in his physical strength but in his devotion. He was an incomparable devotee and servant of Rama. He found fulfilment in serving Rama like a slave and he performed with the speed of wind whatever service was asked of him. We therefore worship Hanuman and instal him in gymnasiums because though we
 
 do physical exercise we are going to become servants—servants of India, servants of the world and, through these means, servants of God. It is through this humble service that we shall catch a glimpse of God.
 Hence we should not even say that we worship Hanuman only for his brahmacharya. Every servant has to practise brahmacharya; how can anyone who has taken the vow of service enjoy the pleasures of sense? It is necessary for one to practise self-control even to render the limited service to one’s parents; it cannot be rendered if anyone yields to his passions as I did. Similarly, how can anyone who would serve the Ashram, serve men and women, boys and girls, how can he afford to gratify his sensual desires? And serving the Ashram is such a small matter; it is like a drop in the ocean. Hence anyone who would serve the world should flee his desires.
 However, mere fasting and penance are not sufficient to keep away from pleasures of sense; this can be achieved through a Hanuman-like devotion. Hence the key to brahmacharya  and  all other virtues is found in single-minded devotion. Every evening we recite :
The senses of him who fasts may well be quietened,but this does
 not help in controlling the desire for gratifying the passions; the mind very often becomes more restless when the senses become weak; then the mind runs more after the objects of pleasure; that too is calmed by the vision of Rama. This is the message of Hanuman, the lesson to be learnt from his life.
 Yesterday I used an adjective which I had never used previously to qualify brahmacharya. I said that Hanuman’s brahmacharya was sattvik, and, while praising brahmacharya, I mentioned three distinct types of it—sattvik, rajasik and tamasik. Whereas Hanuman’s brahmacharya was of a sattvik nature, Meghnad’s was rajasik. One who practises the latter type of brahmacharya has anger and pride. Total surrender is the mark of the sattvik type. It cannot be said that either of these two was inferior to the other in physical strength. Hanuman however could defeat Meghnad becaue the latter was full of pride, while Hanuman was full of devotion and so possessed additional
 
 strength.
 We should, therefore, keep our vision pure, our hands and feet pure and our speech pure and, by doing so, develop the capacity to imitate Hanuman to some extent. We certainly wish to improve our physique by practising brahmacharya, but the under-lying motive is that we wish to become devotees of Rama even through the means of our body and thereby serve the world. It is not that if we took care of the outer the inner would automatically take care of itself. However, if we keep on taking care of the physical side and if this is not a mere veneer, the mind too will one day become steadfast and only then shall we be as good as Hanuman.

414,,REMEMBER THE UNTOUCHABLES,"
    
 Within two days of the publication of this issue, the National Week will be on us. We used at one time, in the process of self- purification, to picket liquor dens. I am reminded of those days as I go through the following paragraph from an address received from the members of the Coimbatore Adi-Dravida Association :libtech_467_footnote
 The old order has not changed even to a small extent, and even our souls are despised by the other Hindus so that we are not allowed to worship in temples the one God. The churches and mosques have their doors wide open to
 receive us and the missionaries in charge of them extend us a hearty welcome. The Government tempts our young men by locating liquor shops in or near our cheries, the living quarters of our community. If industrial institutions took the place of such shops and if social workers befriended us instead of abkari contractors, we have no doubt that our progress would be assured in a very short time. We, therefore, earnestly appeal to you for help to organize industrial schools in or near our living quarters to save our community from ruin.
We  need   not   consider  during   the   National  Week  what  the
 Government has done or not done, but we are bound to consider what we have done and what we can do. Whilst there is no doubt that public opinion against untouchability has been strengthening day by day, public action still remains weak. We have not even been able to induce the  keepers  of  public  temples   to   throw   their   doors   open   to the
 
 suppressed classes nor have we been able to replace a single liquor den with an industrial school or a refreshment room where, instead of the fiery liquid, they can receive health-giving nutritious drinks and other refreshments in clean surroundings.

415,,BAGHAT STATE AND SACRED THREAD,"
    
 With reference to my note in  Young Indialibtech_468_footnoteof 22nd March last about the treatment of Kolis in Baghat State, president of the Arya Samaj, New Delhi, writes :libtech_469_footnote
 The president is no other than Rai Saheb Lala Ganga Ram, the well-known philanthropist and public worker of Delhi. Lala Ganga Ram’s letter seems to leave little doubt about the correctness of the allegations made in the previous letter published in these pages. I had hoped that his informants had exaggerated the happenings in Baghat State and that it had not treated as a crime the wearing of the sacred thread by the so-called untouchables. I have before me a copy of the letter written to Lala Ganga Ram by the Prime Minister of the State. It runs :
 In reply to your letter dated the 10th January 1928, I regret that the State is unable to supply you the copy of the judgment, as Arya Samaj is not a party to this suit.
I cannot help remarking that the reply is in extremely bad taste.
 It is a bad copy of some English officials’ laconic and stereotyped replies which they ordinarily send to correspondents who ask inconvenient questions. But these estimable gentlemen as a  rule  respect rank and status and do not crudely invent things to suit their replies. The Prime Minister of Baghat State has dared to ignore Lala Ganga Ram’s status in society (I mean apart from his title) and for the sake of insulting him has imagined what Lala Ganga Ram has never said in his letter. For the never asked for a copy of the judgment in the case nor claimed to be party in the case against the unfortunate Kolis. This is essentially matter for the Hindu Mahasabha to take up. I do not know whether the Sabha countenances the wearing of the  sacred thread by the so-called untouchables. Whether it does or not, it cannot possibly approve of coercion being used against those who choose  to  wear  it.  Immediately   the   thread   becomes   a monopoly
 
 carrying with it a punishment for its breach, it will cease to be sacred. It was sacred because and when the wearers were men of learning and piety. It will soon become a mark of degradation if the  alleged example of Baghat State proves infectious.

416,,ANNUAL REPORT OF THE A.I.S.A.,"
    
 
 The All-India Spinners’ Association has issued its second annual report. It is a thoroughly  businesslike and instructive document. The letterpress occupies 31 octavo pages. The appendices occupy 24 pages. If I may advise the reader, I would suggest his reading the appendices first. They will give him a detailed analysis of the income and the expenditure of the Association duly audited and certified. He will discover at a glance how over 20 lakhs of rupees have been laid out for the promotion of the greatest, because the most extensive, national industry. If he will study the figures carefully, he will perceive the value of investing a portion of his income in this industry, and the return he would get for his investment would be the prosperity of the poor villagers on whose toil his own income depends. Among the appendices he will find also the resolutions of the All-India Spinners’ Association defining its general policy, conditions on which loans are granted, conditions on which credit sales may be conducted by its depots and on which bounties are given to private khadi dealers and commissions to khadi hawkers. He will also find in them the constitution of the All-India Spinners’ Association, the names and locations of different agencies and other information of value.
 Having glanced through the appendices, let him go through the report if he has a half-hour or an hour to spare and he will know the way khadi has progressed. He will know the condition of the All-India Deshbandu Memorial Fund. Whereas the total production during 1925-26 was Rs. 23,76,670, in 1926-27 it was Rs. 24,06,370 and the sales during the same period were Rs. 28,99,143 and Rs. 33,48,794, respectively. Investors in khadi may therefore derive comfort that khadi is not a losing but a substantially progressive proposition. As against 50,000 spinners according to the previous report, there were 83,339 serving 5,193 weavers during the year under report. As against
 
 It is satisfactory to note that whilst there is improvement in the quality, the prices have undergone steady reduction. The following information about the special khadi service furnished by the Technical Department will be read with interest :libtech_470_footnote
 I must skip over the other instructive paragraphs of the report. I hope I have given sufficient information to what the appetite of the reader for possessing the report itself which can be had at the office of the All-India Spinners’ Association, Mirzapur, Ahmedabad, for  4 annas worth of postage stamps.

417,,SASTRI’S SELF-DENIAL,"
    
 The decision of the Right Honourable Srinivasa Sastri to remain in South Africa beyond his term will gladden the hearts of the Indian settlers as it has pleased and eased the minds of those here who are interested in the South African question and who have been anxiously following the course of events in that sub-continent. Familiarity in Sjt. Sastri’s case instead of making the Europeans indifferent or lukewarm has made them look to the Agent General as their friend and peacemaker. By his punctilious impartiality combined with firmness wherever necessary Sjt. Sastri has inspired them with trust as well as respect. The grateful Indians have not been slow to discover and appreciate the worth of this distinguished countryman and they were urging him to prolong his stay, if it was at all possible. Let them now demonstrate their affection and appreciation by becoming united and by being correct in the observance of all their part of the agreement. I tender my congratulations to Sjt. Sastri on his self-denial. For I know how anxious he was to return home at the end of his term.

 "
418,,A MILL-OWNER ON BOYCOTT,"
    
An Ahmedabad mill-owner writes:libtech_471_footnote
 The letter is refreshingly candid. I wish that the other mill- owners would take the view that this correspondent takes of the possibility of standardization of prices and necessarily therefore of cloth. It is refreshing too to find that fluctuations of cotton prices do not much affect prices of cloth. And I would add in spite of the correspondent’s view to the contrary that it is possible to control cotton prices if it is possible for us to boycott foreign cloth. For prices of our cotton are dominated by America only because we export large quantities of cotton and that too to the market for which America also caters. If we consider it to be possible, as it has proved to be possible, to appeal successfully to the patriotism of the buyer of cloth it is equally possible to make a successful appeal to that of the grower of cotton. Indeed the importance of foreign cloth boycott is derived from the knowledge that for it to succeed all the component parts of the nation have voluntarily to join the movement. It cannot succeed
 
 
 unless there is willing and hearty co-operation from the vast mass of the village population. My faith in the movement persists because I know the masses to be sound. Only the classes block the way because of their want of faith. If they will only shed their fear and their unbelief and lead the movement, the masses will follow. And this boycott is the only thing in which it is possible for the masses actively to join without having to make much sacrifice.
 I do not share the view of the correspondent that artificail silk may be used with impunity in the manufacture of cloth in our mills. His com-parison of foreign dyes and foreign size with artificial silk is hastily made. Just now we contemplate boycott only of foreign cloth, not of dyes and size. All foreign yarns therefore, whether silk, wool or cotton, nautral or artificial, must be taboo; or if foreign artificial silk yarn may be used with impunity why not foreign cotton or wool or natural silk yarn?
 But with foreign cotton it is a different thing. We need not exclude from use foreign cotton, for it is a raw product. What we must boycott for the sake of the starving masses living in enforced idleness for at least four months in the year is foreign yarn and cloth which the masses can spin and weave in their cottages.
 The indigenous mill-cloth too would be intolerable  if  it displaced these mases without finding for them an equivalent industry. The mills have a place in the economy of national life only to the extent that they supplement the national industry of handspinning in millions of our cottages. They will be a hindrance if they compete with them and supplant them. Their natural tendency no doubt is to supplant both the village spinner and the village weaver. It is only when the mill-owners, mill-agents and their share-holders  become truly national and conduct their affairs not to exploit the masses but for their benefit first and their own profits after, that they will be able to appreciate and not merely to join but of lead the  boycott movement. That, if they take a long view of the matter, they have nothing to lose and much to gain has been made clear by  the foregoing letter. Indeed it is a self-evident proposition. Boycott of foreign cloth, if it is the best assurance of steady work for the masses, is also an equal assurance to the mills of steady profits in the long run. But the history of the mill industry at least during the past seven  years of the mass movement does not fill one with much hope of the
 mills rising to the occasion and realizing their duty to the nation. Instead of looking upon khadi with favour and fostering it, our mills have entered into an unfair, unpartriotic and illegitimate competition with khadi. The following are the figures of khadi manufactured by our mills during the respective years :
           1925   1926   1927     Lb.    2,28,87,970   2,72,36,337    3,39,77,851     Yards    6,50,48,487   7,43,13,280    9,43,80,368   
 They have sold this enormous quantity of coarse cloth as khadi and have not hesitated in some cases shamelessly to use the charkha label, etc., with the deliberate purpose of exploiting the khadi atmos- phere created by Congreass organizations. It gives one pain to have to say that the mills that thus manufactured coarse cloth and palmed it off as khadi did a distinct disservice to the nation.
 If their eyes are now opened and if only  to  do  belated reparation for the grave wrong done by them to the nation, they will head or at least join the boycott movement on the terms suggested by me or others equally effective.
 This painful discovery of the figures has however a bright side to it. It is a revelation even to an optimist and khadi expert like The Ashramme of the hold that khadi has acquired over the people. It shows that a much larger number that we are aware of has  in obedience to the nation’s call changed their taste and preferred to buy and use coarse cloth instead of the fine cloth they used to wear before. They have undoubtedly often paid higher prices than they used to. They have bought mill khadi largely under the mistaken belief that it was genuine and that it had the imprimatur of the Congress. An ardent lover of the mases has in these figures and my legitimate deductions therefrom much food for thought and equal cause for hope. As for my feared visit to Europe, I may assure the correspondent that I do not propose to visit Europe if an effective scheme of boycott materializes in the very near future.

419,,NOTES,"
    
 AFRICANS AND INDIANS
 Deenabandhu Andrews, when he was here recently, drew my attention to what the Poet had written in the Press in connection with a movement in the Transvaal said to be going on on behalf of Indians to isolate themselves from the Africans and wanted me to give my opinion on it. I do not think that any importance need be attached to the alleged movement. For I feel that it has no bottom. Indians have too much in common with the Africans to think of  isolating themselves from them. They cannot exist in South Africa for any length of time without the active sympathy and friendship of the Africans. I am not aware of the general body of the Indians having ever adopted an air of superiority towards their African brethren, and it would be a tragedy if any such movement were to gain ground among the Indian settlers of South Africa. Needless to say, I entirely associate myself with the opinion so forcibly expressed by the Poet condemning the movement. If, as has been stated on behalf of the leaders of the socalled movement, “It is humiliating to the Indian sentiment and to the Indian national honour and civilization to think that our Agent General is trying to bring us down to such a low level”, it will ill befit us to repudiate such a sentiment when it is expressed by the South African whites in respect ouselves. And what is more, the South African whites are able to translate their contempt The Ashramand prejudice against us into action whereas ours towards the South Africans can only react against ourselves.
 WOMEN AND JEWELS
 A lady doctor in Tamil Nadu sends a letter accompanying her gift referred to in it. As the letter, in my opinion, enhances the value of the gift and is likely to serve as an example to others, I compress its contents as follows, omitting the names of the donor, the Raja and the place :
 Just a few lines to tell you that I sent you yesterday a parcel of diamond ring and a pair of ear-rings which were given to me about 12 years ago in remembrance of service in the palace. . . when the heir was born to the Raja. It grieved me much when I came to know that the Raja did not have even the courage to invite you to his palace when you passed by and I was told that it was due to fear of the Government. You can imagine my feeling when after your visit I looked at these jewels which before used to travel with me. Now
 when I looked at them, bitterness rose in my breast and then it turned into deep sympathy for the starving millions about whom you spoke when you were here. I said to myself, ‘Are not these jewels made out of the people’s money? And, what claim have I to keep them as my own?’ I then made up my mind to send them on to you. You could use them for khadi service and so help some of the starving millions. I feel sure that it is a better use to make of them than that they should remain in a corner of my box. A friend has valued them at Rs.
 500. They are therefore insured for that amount. I only hope that some generous person will give you more than the actual price, knowing the circumstancs in which these things are being sent to you. You may make what use you like of this letter.
 It is remarkable how we imagine fears even when there is no cause. There are many Rajas who have openly and willingly supported khadi and therethrough the cause of the poor from whom, after all, as my correspondent correctly puts it, they derive their riches. It is true that khadi has a political significance; but we have not yet come to the stage when support of khadi can be safely declared by  the  Government to be criminal. Every philanthropic movement can be truned to political use, but it would be a sad day when on that account it is boycotted even as to its philanthropic aspect. But it is only fair to state that the Raja to whom reference has been made by the lady doctor is not the only one who is afraid of supporting khadi or showing ordinary courtesy to a public servant like me. It is well The Ashramhowever that the Raja’s boycott of me has stimulated the gift. But I would like all the sisters who may chance to see this note to realize that it is not necessary to be able to emulate the fair donor to have occasions like the one that set her athinking about her duty to the starving millions. Surely it is easy enough to realize that so long as there are millions of men and women in the country starving for want of food because of want of work, the sisters have no warrant for possessing costly jewels for adorning their bodies or often for the mere satisfaction of possessing them. As I have remarked before now in these pages, if only the rich ladies of India will discard their superfluities and be satisfied with such decoration as khadi can give them it is possible to finance the whole of the khadi movement, not to take into consideration the tremendous moral effect that such a step on the part of the rich daughters of India will produce upon the  nation and particularly the starving masses.
 KARVE JUBILEE
 It give me joy to publish the following appeal by Sjt. V. M. Joshi, President of Karve Jubilee Committee :libtech_472_footnote
 Professor Karve is not an ordinary man who is satisfied if he satisfies an indulgent public which, if it proves itself exacting and imperious at times, issues a certificate of merit ninety-nine times out of hundred if some little service is rendered to it during recreation hours. Prof. Karve has obeyed a master that is never generous, never indulgent and ever exacting, though invariably just. This master is his own conscience. His self-effacement, his single-minded devotion to duty, his exhaustless energy, his honesty in all circumstances, his faith in the midst of opposition, his irrepressible optimism are a national asset of the first magnitude. There may be two opinion about the work to which he has devoted his great gifts but there can be only one opinion about the gifts themselves. And the latter are any day far more valuable and lasting than the work itself. The organizers of the Jubilee have set before themselves a very modest task to collect Rs. 25,000 to be presented to Prof. Karve for his work. It is a sum that should readily come forth from the numerous men and women who have come under the influence of this giant among silent and selfless workers or who have profited by his labours of a lifetime.

 I have your letter. If human relations were regulated according to rules of arithmetic, what you propose would be suitable.

 I have your letter. I do not perform any miracles nor do I believe in miracles. I would advise you to be content with what God gives you bearing in mind that there are many who are in a worse plight than you are. And, after all, physical blindness is not half as bad as moral blindness. And, whilst we have no positive control over physical infirmities, we have over the moral infirmities. If, therefore, there is any such thing as miracle, it should be attempted after one’s moral welfare.

 MY DEAR MALKANI,
 I have your letter. I did not need your budget. I must not ask you to cancel your policy. I simply passed on to you what was burdening my mind. My inquiries must not oppress you. We all must try to look as we are. And if we could do that we would not worry over any questions. The Rs. 200 I shall find and that without any loss of self-respect. But you must always let me have the privilege of expecting the highest from you. Why should you worry about  dowries? You are going to pay not a farthing. Why should the daughters be married in an Amil family necessarily? You must train the girls from now to forget that they belong to a caste. They belong to India and if you believe in my view of varnashrama, the matter becomes simple.
 Of course you do not need to pay him anything beyond his, say, fare and food there.

  	I have your letter. I resign myself to your letter to the Viceroy. 	Of course I entirely agree with you that if the States will give us 	assistance we shall receive it gladly. But I know that they dare not 	give it to an institution that is frankly a creation of 	non-co-operation and nursed in its atmosphere. But if they do with 	the certain knowledge that it is a non-co-operationg institution, we 	should gladly accept their assistance.  	The proposed European visit is causing me much trouble just now. I 	can’t make up my mind. I know that I should not be so undecided 	like this. But what is the use of my hiding my weakness? I can’t 	account for it myself. However, I should come to a decision in the 	course of the next frotnight at the latest. Improvement in health 	has no attraction for me. The meeting with M. Romain Rolland and a 	quiet conference with the chief men of Europe is what would take me 	to Eruope. Let us see how God leads me.  	What is the use of Begum Ansari and Zohra wanting me to stay in 	their new abode? All the time I am there, they keep themselves at a 	safe distance hiding themselves behind the purdah. If they 	want me to be there, they will have to expose to view their 	superfluous bangles and other jewellery so that I can ease them of 	the superfluities and turn them to good account.  	So far as the Jamia collections are concerned, I suspect that we 	shall do nothing beyond getting collections from personal friends, 	and, in order that this can be done it is necessary to have that 	constitution and trust-deed. Do please therefore expedite it as soon 	as you can.  Yours 	sincerely,  From 	a photostat: S. N. 13170 "

  	You know perhaps that Krishnadas is not here at present. He has 	however sent me your letter of the 25 March. Why do you say that the 	Spinners’ Register will mean purchasing yarn from cottage to 	cottage? I have not suggested any such  thing  at  all.libtech_483_footnotelibtech_484_footnoteWhat 	 I  have suggested is that we should know the spinners with whom the 	middle men deal. We do not want to do away with the middle men 	altogether. We must not be at their mercy either, nor must we be in 	the dark as to what is actually paid to the spinners. The Register, 	therefore, has to be taken periodically. Once we know who the 	spinners are, where they are, what they get and what they do, you 	need not bother about them again, say for six months. As a matter of 	fact there should be no difficulty in your coming in touch with the 	middle men themselves The Ashramand with the spinners through them. 	I don’t know whether I am even now clear. Not knowing the 	practical working of these, there may be difficulties of which I 	have no knowledge. You will then write to me about those 	difficulties and I might be able to make concrete suggestions for 	overcoming them.  	About the want of capital, I am going to confer with Jamnalalji and 	Shankerlal. You do not say definitely how much you require. Is Babu 	Shivaprasad Gupta ready to advance that sum without interest if 	repayment is guaranteed and if he is, what will be the period of 	such loan?  	The last paragraph of your letter is bad. You can’t afford to give 	way to despair under any circumstances. You have to hold on to the 	Ashram no matter what difficulties face you. You dare not take up 	any other work. Please write regularly. Are 	you now thoroughly restored, or is there still some    
 difficulty? If there is you should now find Dr. Ansari comparatively free.

 April 8, 1928
 MY DEAR JAWAHAR,
 I have your letter. I do not remember Father having told me that he would be back in Bombay to confer with the mill owners during the last week of this month. But he and I discussed the question of foreign cloth boycott at length and he had a conference with Seth Lalji, Shantikumar, Seths Ambalal, Kasturbhai and Mangaldas. It was a good conference, but nothing defenite was done. I have now heard that the mill-owners are going to start their own Swadesh League which means of course that we are not coming to any terms.
 The AshramI had a long discussion with Lalaji today, for he was here for two days. He is enthusiastic about boycott of foreign cloth. I have supplied him with literature. He even suggested that I should invite a few leaders and confer with [them] about boycott. I told him I had not the courage to do so. He is of opinion that if intense boycott propaganda is to be taken up, I must not go out of the country, wherein of course I agree; but I cannot take up intense propaganda unless politically-minded India is wholeheartedly with me and unless the agitation about temporary boycott of British cloth, principally British cloth, is given up. We have, therefore, come to this provisional arrangement that if anything concrete takes place by spontaneous action on the part of the known leaders, I should give up the idea of going to Europe. On the other hand [if] nothing of that kind happens and if otherwise I see my way clear, I should proceed and that Lalaji and others who are minded like him should cultivate an atmosphere for intense propaganda about foreign cloth boycott with or without the Assistance of mills. I therefore suggest that you should confer with
 Dr. Ansari and others. I suppose they will all go to the Punjab and pass the resolution about foreign cloth boycott through  khadi.  I would warn you against any mention of indigenous mill-cloth. You can simply say: “Whereas the only effective means of immediately demonstrating the united strength of the nation lies through boycott of foreign cloth, this Conference urges all concerned completely to boycott foreign cloth and adopt hand-spun and handwoven khadi even though such adoption may necessitate revision of one’s taste about dress and some pecuniary sacrifice.’ You will also let me know the result of private discussions you may have with friends and advise me as to whethere I should give up the idea of going to Europe. Dr. Ansari should really be able to decide."

  	I was thinking of you only early this morning, that is, just after 	prayer when talking to Pyarelal and here is your letter.  	Suppose that there is a colony of orphans shipwrecked on an island, 	that they are all unmarried males, that they have never known that 	they ever had any parents, suppose further that they have a 	knowledge of letters and that from their reading they under-stood 	that they had all parents; suppose then that they in the course of 	their readings coem upon a philosophical book called “Our 	Spontaneous Origin”, should the orphans feel convinced 	philosophically that they were all spontaneous creation? Just as the 	supposed  philosophical book would not unsettle the conviction of 	the majority of the unsophisticated orphans, so should the 	philosophical book that you have read about the non-existence of God 	not unsettle your belief in God. If you will admit the fact of your 	having parents, how can you escape the fundamental fact of the First 	Cause? Having made sure of that, I am indifferent whether you call 	that First Cause God or some other thing. And having been also 	convinced of that fact it is wholly 
 unnecessary to inquire how that First Cause disposes of justice or to inquire about the injustice that we seem to see around us. There are endless theories. I believe in that of cause and effect, that is, of the law of karma. It seems to answer all a man’s doubts. But if they do not answer yours,you must wait, watch and pray and you will some day have the light. But if you do not believe in the First Cause, there is no hope. For to whom should you pray then? Therefore hold fast to your belief in God, never mind the reasoning. Can you reason out the existence of your parents? Will you not say, ‘Whether I can reason or not the existence of my parents is an absolute fact with me’? If you cannot prove it to the satisfaction of your inquirers, you will say ‘my reasoning is at fault but not the fact’. Even so must you say to yourself, ‘Though I may not be able to reason out the existence of God, I must accept the experience of and the belief of mankind in the First Cause’.
If even now you are not satisfied, you must ask me again.
 Yours sincerely,

 CHI. PRABHUDAS,
 For the last so many days or even months, I have wanted to write to you but how was it possible for me to find time for it ? This, too, I am dictating immediately after the morning prayers. I have got the shawl sent by you and when the time comes, I shall certainly use it. But in this season, the occasion will never come. I am getting fully acquainted with your activities and am pleased with them. I even rejoice in them. But do remember that you are not to pursue any activity at the cost of your health for, your first duty in going there lies in improving your health. However, if you can make use of your activities in improving it, I do not have to warn you. Do not have so much attachment for the activities that they ruin your health, and in order to regain it, you have to sacrifice your activities. It is like a saint losing both the worlds. Remember that the efforts to improve your health are also meant to excel in devotion to your duty.
 Nothing has yet been decided about my going to Europe. It has been left to me to decide but I do not have the confidence to take a decision in this matterlibtech_485_footnote. I do not know what is good. I do not at all like going there, but in a week or two, I will decide this way or that. You are dreaming of paying a visit here. Forget about it. It is attachment. You are not fully aware of our wish to rub shoulders with the crores of suffering and half-starved people. Before spending each rupee, you must reckon that with that money, sixty-four persons can comfortably have their second meal. Moreover there is no need to risk your health by coming here in this weather. We meet through letters; that is no less grace of God.
 You are inviting Kashi. The above argument applies in her case also. Only warm climate suits Kashi. The cold climate which you enjoy, which gives you strength, enfeebles Kashi. As far as service to her is concerned, there is hardly anything you could do. Besides, you The Ashrammay not even be able to do that, and for one’s own help, one cannot call one’s parents. Moreover, you have made that relation virtuous. Treat any invalid woman you see there as your mother and help her. Consider such service as service rendered to Kashi. In the same way, treat every invalid man as your father. The spinning-wheel makes us do the same. It teaches us to render pure, selfless and dedicated service to numerous invalid and helpless parents, brothers, brothers-in-law and sons and daughters. Day by day, you are gaining proficiency in rendering such service. I am reminded of you by the figures you had given me about the growing business of lanterns, etc., here. I find from Devdas’s letters that he is doing very good work in Jamia. Do not hesitate to write to me whenever you feel like doing so.

 CHI. MANILAL AND SUSHILA,
 I got your letters. I do not think that I have missed any mail recently. It is good that Sushila is progressing in her studies, but I am worried about her health. I should like her to make every effort to acquire good health.
 Nimu is here at present. Ramdas is on a tour hawking khadi. Afterwards he will go to Jamnadas’s school. Both of them will work there. Devdas has gone to Delhi.
 A proposal is being discussed about my going to Europe. I cannot make up my mind. The matter will be decided within a week.
 Blessings from

Tell Pragji that I got his letter. I have no time to write to him a
 separate letter. It appears that the cases of both have been decided now.

 CHI. MANILAL AND SUSHILA,
 I have no time today to write myself. This is the National Week, and so I give as much time as I can spare and the body can endure, to spinning. Hence I am dictating this letter. You must have settled in phoenix by now. I like your staying there. It would be enough if Sushila went to the town twice or thrice to take her lessons. As a matter of fact, knowledge of a language as well as other knowledge can be acquired by one’s own effort. I hope that Sushila is now completely all right. Yesterday Mr. Wayne met me. We talked The Ashramabout his meeting Manilal. I did not engage him in any particular discussion, but I got the impression that he went away from here with
 
 some useful ideas.
 Ramdas is hawking khadi in Kathiawar. Nimu is here. Devdas is teaching spinning, etc., at Jamia Millia in Delhi. These days the spinning-wheels are working non-stop in the Ashram. Kishorelal was ill, but is now reported to be recovering with common remedies. You must be getting letters from there, so I do not write about anything there.

Readers of Young India are familiar with the name of Richard
 B. Gregg, an American lawyer who was attracted to India over two years ago by the message of khadi and who has been studying the movement in a most minute manner ever since his arrival in India. After a years’s labour, he has written a book on the movement which treats khadi in an almost original manner. Every statement he has made is supported by facts and figures and footnotes give the authorities upon which Mr. Gregg has drawn. The book is published by S. Ganesan, 18 Pycrofts Road, Triplicane, Madras, and is priced at Rs. 1-8-0. From cover to cover it occupies 225 pages of which 165- 225 contain seven appendices. The book contains 12 chapters. Let the reader also understand that Mr. Gregg, when he writes of villages, writes of things he has somewhat seen. The three opening paragraphs of his introduction show the reader the way in which Mr. Gregg has worked :libtech_487_footnote
 It was in order to remove this poverty that Mr. Gregg was driven to an examination of the various schemes proposed to that end and he was forced to the conclusion that the spinning-wheel was the only real solution. The author says:libtech_488_footnote
 This little book is a statement of how the project looks to one who had seven years of practical work and study in industrial and labour problem in America (much of it in cotton mills), together with two and a half years’ study in India of the khaddar movement. The latter period included observation both in the villages and at the headquarters of the movement. The investigation was undertaken primarily to clarify my own thinking. . . .
The originality of  Mr.  Gregg’s  examination  of  the   problem
 consists in his approach to it from the engineering aspect which is the title of the first chapter, and he has no difficulty in showing that the The Ashrammaterial prosperity of a country is increased not merely by  accumulation of  power or  machinery but by  the right use of it.
 
 India is still considered a source of much wealth, the Indian people are ranked among the poverty-stricken of the world, . . . as Professor  Gilbert  Slater  of  Madras University says: ‘The poverty of India is a grim fact.’ ”
 This is how he opens his argument :
 Following Mr. Ford’s idea that the right use of power is more important than any particular kind of machinery, let us briefly examine the fundamentals of physical power and its utilization and then apply that as a test for the validity of the khaddar proposal. We will first state the whole engineering argument in brief, and then consider it in a more detailed fashion.
 All physical power is derived ultimately from the sum. Coal and petroleum are, in effect, reservoirs from the stream of solar energy of past ages converted and stored up by vegetation. Water-power comes from the action of sunshine evaporating water from the oceans and transporting it to the land and rivers in the form of clouds and rain. Even the mechanical energy of horses and cattle and man himself comes from food obtained from plants activated by sunshine. All the power used in modern industry and in the economic activities of man in past ages came from his using some part of the never-ending stream of solar energy. The old Rigvedic hymns sang rightly of Savitar the Sun god: “Savitar . . . Lord of every blessing;” and “God Savitar, the good-eyed, hath come hither giving choice treasures unto him who worships” (R.-V., x. 149; i. 35).
 Any scheme which utilizes and efficintly transforms solar energy to a greater degree than was being done before is sound, from an engineering standpoint, and also from an economic point of view.
 We do not usually think of the charkha as a machine, but it really is so. It uses the available mechanical energy of a man, woman or child for producing material goods. The handloom does likewise. The mechanical energy  is derived from the food eaten by the person. Though in a different degree, manner and mode, the process is the same as that occurring in a steam engine or hydraulic power plant, namely, the transformation of solar energy into mechanical motion.
 There are today great numbers of unemployed Indians. They are, in effect, engines kept running by fuel (food), but not attached to any machines or devices for producing goods. Mr. Gandhi proposes to hitch them to charkhas and thus save a vast existing waste of solar energy.
 If we want to increase the use of mechanical power in India, this is the quickest and cheapest way. The ‘engines’ are all present; a man is as efficient a transformer of fuel energy into mechanical motion as a steam engine is; the spinning and weaving machinery to be used is nearly all ready at hand in The Ashramsufficient quantity to supply all needs. Any additional needs can be quickly and cheaply produced in India by artisans who need no further training in technical skill for this purpose; the speed and quantity of output possible
 
 with charkha and handloom are more closely adapted to the needs of the Indian market and Indian producers than any other type or machinery; no foreign capital is needed to purchase the machinery, and therefore there will be no expensive interest payments or difficulties arising from absentee control; the maintenance of such a factory is inexpensive and can be done entirely by available workers without further training: the amount of training needed for operatives is a minimum and of a sort more easily acquired than for any other type of machinery; the ‘fuel’ or power cost for the man-charkha system will be nothing above the present food bill of the nation; the material to be used is available in practically every Indian province at a minimum of transportation cost; and the market is everywhere.
 must resist the temptation to quote from the other chapters. 
 But if the foregoing excerpts have at all proved tempting for the reader, let me assure him that he will find that the chapters that follows are fully interesting and deeply instructive. Let me close this hasty review with giving the names of the remaining 11 chapters. It will be admitted that they are suggestive enough.

457,,PLACE OF KHADI,"
    
 Lovers of khadi have been writing to me energetically warn- ing me against coquetting with mill-owners in the vain hope, as they call it, of securing their active co-operation on terms beneficial to the nation in the prosecution of the campaign of boycott of foreign cloth. I appreciate their warning. Some of them are tried and experi-enced workers in the khadi movement. But I do not give up hope of the mill-owners some day or other coming round to the national view. After all as an out-and-out believer in the method of non-violence, I may not let a single opportunity to slip of converting the mill-owners to the nationalistic view, even as I may not pass by a single occasion of converting Englishmen to the Indian view of Indian’s good. After all, if we are to win our freedom by non-violent means, we shall have to knock at the doors of those who put obstacles in its way and plead with them to remove them. And even as in a bloody revolution those who are supposed to stand in the way are made to pay the last penalty whether they are countrymen or otherwise, so in a non-violent revolution are they, whether countrymen or foreigners, required to face satyagraha, if they will not listen to reason and wil obstinately stand in the way.
 I therefore see no harm in having stated the conditions on which mill-owners can co-operate with the nation. It would have been wrong not to have done so. And if they accept the terms, I know that khadi, i. e., the masses have nothing to lose. For if the mills work not for exploiting the masses as they now do, but for serving them, they will supplement the products of the cottage spinning-wheel and the handloom and not supersede them as they now do. There is no doubt that if they hesitate to accept the terms stated by me, they will do so because the logical consequence repels them even as the logical consequence of Englishmen really becoming servants of the nation repels them. I would therefore ask khadi lovers not to be afraid of my so-called ‘coquetting’. If we are strong in our faith, if khadi has the inherent vitality we claim for it, if it is the need of the masses, and if we persist in our effort with them, they will not fail to realize it. Khadi will fail only when khadi lovers falter in their faith or if their faith is based on a mere shadow, i.e., if there is no grinding poverty among the masses, if they have no leisure hours during the year, or if, though The Ashramthey have spare hours, the spinning-wheel is not the most
 suitable and practicable occupation conceivable for many millions.
 It is because of the implicit faith I have in khadi in terms of the propositions just stated and of the strength born of that faith that I am ‘coquetting’ with the mill-owners. It is quite likely, it is perhaps now practically certain, that no immediate good will come out of these negotiations. But they will serve for further action or guidance if we have not meanwhile already achived boycott of foreign cloth.
 It is therefore profitable to inquire, even at the risk of repe- tition, what place khadi has in any scheme of boycott. In my opinion, boycott of foreign cloth is both necessary and feasible only because it affects and benefits the masses and can be achieved only if they co- operate. Boycott of foreign cloth would have but a temporary value if it could be obtained solely by the indigenous mills. And I hold it to be impossible in the near future to enforce the boycott through the single agency of mills. In my opinion, it is khadi alone that has made such boycott a practical proposition. Indeed it is so practical that if the politically minded India were to take up the sales of khadi, it  is possible to manufacture in a year all the khadi that may be required by the nation even though there may be not a single yard of mill- calico—foreign or indigenous—available. I affirm this on the basis of the assumption that the villages will mostly manufa-cture their own khadi and the organized centres will manufacture for those who are not self-spinniers. Experience of past seven years shows that if there is a sudden famine of cloth in the country and if the masses are encouraged they have sufficient skil and the indigenous machi-nery for manufacturing their own khadi. No doubt a revolution-ary change in the mental outlook and sartorial tastes of politically minded India is necessary. I have no doubt that if the bulk of them do not respond now, they will have to do so when they realize that khadi has become irresistible. And to make it irresistible khadi workers have to work away with steadfastness, honesty, scientific skill and precision. I have ‘coquetted’ with mill-owners and discussed the possibility of immediate boycott of foreign cloth in association with them, in order to show that if they mean it they can give themselves the privilege of serving the nation at the same time that they serve themselves. Meanwhile, let none doubt that khadi is silently and imperceptibly revolutionizing the national taste and will bring about the boycott in its own good time, if it not anticipated by some such combination as I have ventured to suggest.

 BREACH OF PROMISE?
 When I was in Berhampur, Ganjam District, last year, I was taken to a temple which I was told was open to all including the so-called untouchables. I was accompanied by some untouchable friends. A few weeks after I received a letter that the trustees had declared prohibition against the entry of untouchables. I was loath to believe the statement. I, therefore, inquired and here is the reply to my inquiry :libtech_489_footnote
 If the information is correct, it is clear breach of promise by the trustees—a promise that was publicly made not merely to me but to the public of Berhampur through me. I wonder whether the trustees have any defence of explanation to offer. The untouchables have undoubtedly a clear case for offering satyagraha in this case. I do hope however that the public of Berhampur will redeem their self- respect by insisting on removal of the bar, if the bar does as a matter of fact exist.

            MY 	DEAR MOTILALJI,    THE 	ASHRAM, 	SABARMATI,  April 	12, 1928 
  	I have your letter. I did not write without full knowledge of what 	was being done on behalf of mill-owners. They are starting a 	separate organization which will have nothing to do with us. However 	I am quite at one with you what we should leave no stone unturned to 	secure their full co-operation. I am doing all I can at this end and 	you will let me know what success you have with Sir Purushottamdas. 	But I would like you to study the possibilites of the charkha 	movement. It is not so hopeless as you seem to think. Let me put the 	position in a nutshell. Mills by themselves cannot achieve the 	boycott within the time that will satisfy the politician buy mills 	if they play the game together with charkha can do so within a time 	that will satisfy the most sanguine expectations of any patriot. The 	charkha by itself  can  achieve the boycott within a reasonable 	period, the pace being dependent upon intensity of the work put in 	by the politicians. And as  a khadi manufacturer, I am open to 	negotiate with anyone for supplying almost an illimitable quantity 	provided he does not bind me to the quality beyond a certain limit 	and does not mind the cost.     
 I send you a copy of the report of the Spinners’ Associationlibtech_493_footnoteand a little pamphlet which latter you can read in 5 minutes but which gives you some very telling figures. The only thing that hampers the progress of khadi is the want of demand and want of capital.

 BHAISHRI DEVCHANDBHAI,
 I have decided to hand over to the All-India Spinners’ Association, the Kathiawar khadi work and all the equipment and debts relating to it. Taking responsibility for this work upon ourselves means my worrying about the money problems. I feel that there should be a regular resolution about this. You should therefore get such a resolution passed in the Committee or get the consent of members through a circular.
 It seems that Revashanker Anupchand wishes to take possession of Manasukhlal’s house in lieu of the debt which the latter owes him. If you know anything about this matter, please let me know. Valji says that you are of the opinion that Revashanker cannot take possession of the house.

		VIDYALAYA, AHMEDABAD libtech_495_footnote","
    
 [Before April 13, 1928]libtech_496_footnote
 The idea of the Khadi Seva Sangh was mine. I felt that just as the Government has an organization, its  naukarshahi,libtech_497_footnoteit  would  be good for us also to have an organization of workers. The Govern- ment’s  naukarshahi  is called ‘shahi’libtech_498_footnotebecause its members, although they are servants, function as rulers. But we are not ‘shahi’ because we have to do real service. For admission to this organization a course The Ashramof fixed period was prescribed because in order to be a khadi worker training and proficiency are required. The science of khadi is a serious affair; its scope is extremely vast, because through this science we want to serve the 33 crore people of India and through them the whole world. It is an empirical science; astronomy, on the contrary, is not an empirical science. The science of khadi is empirical because its experiments and conclusions are accessible to experience. Thirty-three crores of people can have direct experience of it. Hence its scope extends to where name of God reaches.
 The vastness of this science can be realized from the fact that all the things that are done in textile mills we have to do in our homes. Those who run these mills have had to read a number of technical books the study of which is essential for acquiring proficiency in the work. Take only one process. Just as in the mills they have to test cotton, we too have to do it. These knowledge which they require as to the strength of cotton, cotton-gathering, etc., is also required by us. Our very first lesson is about cotton and it is a very important one. There are indeed many things which we have to do but which the mills are not required to do. For example, the mills do not have to bother whether in ginning the cotton-seeds remain intact or are broken, but we cannot afford to be careless in the matter. We want that the seeds should retain their properties. We want to feed these to the cattle and extract oil from them. Mills have nothing at all to do with all these
 
 things.
 However rich we may be in resources, and however persistent in our efforts, it is all useless without a purpose. That purpose is national service. And it is so vast that one can go as deep into it as one chooses. There is no end to the labours of the mills because they have a selfish motive, they have to earn money. In their set-up there is scope for punishment as well as for reward and, after all, what is the principle of reward if it is not one of punishment? In our case there is no selfishness and no punishment. But it is not proper that since there is no selfishness we should not work as much as they do in mills. Our work is as deserving of efforts as it is selfless. The more love and labour we pour into it, the quicker will be our victory. Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose takes a leaf from a plant and very carefully and  minutely examines it to see how many sections it has, whether it has organs of sense and whether it can feel as human beings do. He then places the results of his experiments before the world. Does he do this The Ashramfor money? No Then does he do so for fame? No. He does it without any selfish motive. But his objective is gaining knowledge, whereas our experiments are not purely for the sake of knowledge. Ours is an empirical science and we want to se its actual results. We have to observe carefully how much cotton is obtained from a given quantity of raw cotton, how much yarn is prepared out of that cotton and how much cloth is woven out of that yarn. And in this way we can calculate how many people have to put in how much labour in order to meet the cloth requirements of the whole country.
 Acquire as much knowledge as you can in order to gain mastery of this science and carry out as many experiments as necessary. For this, you should have enthusiasm, interest and dedication. The person who cultivates this science with devotion will be granted the inner light by God.
 But it is not enough for us merely acquire knowledge of this science. Mere knowledge would be useful in mills only. We need character in addition to this knowledge. You have come here not for earning your livelihood but with a desire to serve, to dedicate your life to the cause of khadi, and for this character will be very essential. How will you go among the people without character? Who will accept your service? Nobody bothers about the character of people working in mills but everybody will enquire about your character. You have to go to the people as servants, not as tyrants. If possible, you have to be
 labourers living in their midst. For doing this a disciplined life is needed.
 And cleanliness will be the first sign by which you can show your character. The impression which you will be able to create in the people by strict observance of the rules of cleanliness, you will not be able to do in any other way. And what is desirable is that you should not follow these rules for the sake of following them but it should become impossible for you not to follow them. You should so mould your nature that cleanliness becoemse a part of it; if you find uncleanliness anywhere you should be unable to bear it. Uncleanliness anywhere, whoever may be responsible for it, should become an eyesore to us and unless it is removed we should find no joy in living.
 We wish to offer ourselves as oblation in the national yajna. In order to do so we have to become pure and clean. Does it do any The Ashramgood burning a dirty thing? But if your burn something fragrant, the atmoshepre is purified and the perfume  spreads. Therefore let us become pure like sandalwood and offer ourselves up in this sacrifice. This is the purpose for which this Ashram has been established. Let the Ashram become the incense in the  national sacrifice and remove the foul smell wherever it may be found. This is our ideal. Indeed, this is not the Ashram’s ideal only, but that of every khadi worker.
 And are you aware what a high place your work occupies? If someone asked me what the place of khadi in relation to service of the cow or tanning was, I should surely say that it had the first place. According to the grand simile of Tulsidas, this is the most benevolent activity, even though it seems dull:
 How monotonous spinning appears! The Punjabis tell me that it is a women’s work and that they cannot do it. Then there is neither honour nor profit in khadi work. If one becoemes expert in dairying or tanning, one can get big emoluments. But in khadi there is no such attraction because it is the work of millions of people. We requires seven lakh workers in order to organize khadi work throughout the country. How can we afford to give them high salaries? Perhaps seven
 lakh cow workers or tanning experts may not be required by the country, but it would not do to have less than this number for khadi work. 'This work is so important and it is required on such a big scale. Despite its seeming monotony, there is hardly any other work more intresting than this. If you start taking lots of interest in it, you would adorn yourself, the Ashram and the country as well.

I, belonging to a pauper country, think fifty times before sending cablegrams and each time say to myself one rupee means 64 hungry mouths fed per day after an hour’s work each. For one-sixty fourth of a rupee buys sufficient flour to give one meal to one of the starving millions. When therefore we meet, if we do, I am going to ask you to account for all the cables that you have been spending money on although you represent the poor people of Poplar.
 I can’t summon up sufficient courage to make up my mind whether to go to Europe or not to go. I am therefore waiting. for an expected letter from Romain Rolland. The expected letter will compel me to make up my mind finally. I don’t know why I have difficulty in making up my mind about the European visit in spite of your glowing letter.
 Yours sincerely,

 DEAR FRIEND,
 I have your letter. I am sorry I was unable to overtake it earlier. The only thing I can advise you to do is to live absolutely apart from your wife, take clean unstimulating diet, live in the fresh air the whole of the 24 hours, and fill up your waking hours with healthy activities and, when the body is tired, with healthy reading and thinking. You will produce little impression upon your pupils until you have gained mastery over yourself.

  	I have your letter. If the meeting of the representatives of mill- 	owners comes off and if you give me due notice, I shall be present. 	But up to now there is no intimation from Motilalji.  	I am in constant touch with the representatives of millowners and so 	far as I am aware nothing is going to come out of these 	negotiations. The mill-owners have decided upon a separate organi- 	zation of their own from which they wish to eschew politics 	altogether. Sir Purushottamdas has declined to be president even of 	this association. And I understand that he has come to the 	conclusion that the mill-owners will do nothing substantial at the 	present moment. Mr. Birla writes to me almost in the same strain, 	though he wants the boycott campaign without the mill owners. After 	having had so many The Ashramchats and so much correspondence with 	the latter,  I incline to the same view. But that does not mean that 	we should not have the conference Motilalji has in in view.  	You will keep me informed of what is going on. I would like you to 	read all I have written about the mills in the pages of Young 	India. If you have not the articles I can send them to you.

 BHAISHRI VITHALBHAI,
 This letter is in reply to yours. If the boycott becomes universal, we  do  not   have   enough   chhayallibtech_506_footnoteand   dhotis.   We  can   meet   the demands of those who will go about, if need be, in a langotilibtech_507_footnotelibtech_508_footnote, but wear nothing except khadi. To those, however, who are not ready to go to this extent but will take part in the boycott of foreign cloth if they can get some other cloth in its place, we may supply mill-made dhotis and saris. This means that the mills cannot manufacture any other cloth except what we decide and that, even in their shope, khadi will be sold as a substitute for the kinds of cloth which they do not manufacture. I can realize that the mills will not agree to this, but we cannot come to any understanding with them as long as they do not agree. My demand means that the mills should accept the permanent place of khadi. If you do not understand this point, please ask me. I do not want you to come here, leaving your work unattended there. You may discuss the matter when you have occasion to come here and get the necessary opportu nity.

 BHAISHRI DEVCHANDBHAI,
 I have your letter. I understand about Manasukhlal although I am very much confused. I am of the opinion that if a person has incurred debts he himself or his wife or children have to right to keep anything from the wealth amassed by him. But I do not know the facts of this case. And that reminds me: may I know if something has been done about the memorial to him? It is necessary to pass the following resolution about khadi :
 “As the Kathiawar Political Conference has many occupations, it does not have enough men and money to bear the responsibility of the khadi activity. Gandhiji who hitherto used to shoulder the economic responsibility does not have the physical means to do so. The All-India Spinners’ Association is willing to shoulder the responsibility. Therefore the Committee of this  Conference hands over the entire administration, all its money and the entire responsi- bility of the Kathiawar khadi activity to the All-India Spinners’ Association.”
 Did Mulchandbhai get money for the Antyaja movement? Bhai Fulchand is not with you, so who helps you now? What other work of the Conference is going on at present?

473,,SERVICE OF THE SUPPRESSED libtech_509_footnote,"
    
 The servant of the suppressed serves both himself and the society, as the oppressor ultimately oppresses himself, and the engi- neer is always hoist with his own petard.
 We were on the point of being pariahs of the world, having treated the bulk of our brethren as untouchables. We are however likely to escape that catastrophe, as the Hindu society is trying to remove this blot in various ways and in many provinces. By far the biggest and most successful of these efforts is perhaps the one conducted by Anasuyabehn in Ahmedabad.
 I addressed two meetings last month, one under the auspices of the Sweepers’ Mahajan and the other a gathering of the children of the Labour Union schools.libtech_510_footnoteMost of these children belonged to the suppressed classes. I take the followinglibtech_511_footnotefrom the report that was read at the meeting :
 I do not know of workmen’s children elsewhere receiving education under such orderly and careful organization and in such numbers.
 The mill-owners ought to welcome the enterprise. On the contrary they are reported to have threatened to stop the monetary help they are at present giving. I do hope not only that it is a false alarm, but that they will yearly add to their contributions. In doing so  I should humbly think they will be doing nothing beyond what they owe to their workmen.
 A noteworthy feature of the enterprise is the large contribution of the workmen themselves towards the expenses, the ultimate aim being to conduct these schools wholly at their own expense. This of course presupposes their economic betterment, a stimulation in them of the desire for sacrifice and for the education of their children. In the mean while, the mill-owners and other philanthropists should keep the enterprise going.
 
 
 The sweepers’ meetinglibtech_512_footnotelibtech_513_footnotewas remarkable for the things it brought to light. I heard them sing their songs with flawless pronunciation. They were comparatively unlettered, but no one who listened to their songs could say that they belonged to the suppressed classes. But they are indebted, underpaid, and addicted to drink. Most of them beg and live on leavings from plates given to them by Hindus of higher castes. Their condition makes the conclusion irresistible that we the so-called high caste Hindus are responsible for their failings, and only the inherent strength of Hinduism is responsible for their good points. Hinduism has helped them to retain some of their culture in spite of the oppression they have laboured under. They would never have been reduced to their present state if we had regarded them as our own kith and kin.
 Anasuyabehn may carry on welfare work among them, but who will look to their housing? I have seen the hovels they live in. It is the duty of the mill-owners and the municipality to provide them with better houses, and even if the former fail in their duty the latter may not do so, for better housing is essential as much for the health of the city as for that of the workmen.
 UNTOUCHABLES AMONG UNTOUCHABLES
 I   addressed   a   third   meetinglibtech_514_footnotelibtech_515_footnotewhich   was   full    of   painful experience. There is a suppressed class night-school under the Gujarat Vidyapith conducted by the students of the Vidyalaya. They take considerable pains over the school, which until a short time ago had a very large attendance of Dhed children. The teachers thought of the sweepers’ children and induced the sweepers to send their children to the school but as soon as these came, most of the Dheds withdrew their children form the school! The teachers therefore turned to me to find a way out of the situation. So I went there. Very few Dhed parents attended the meeting. One of them whom I tried to tackle said frankly, taking his stand on the traditional religion: “How may a Dhed touch a sweeper?” “But if the touch of the sweeper pollutes the Dhed, why should the higher castes touch the Dheds?,” I asked. “We never ask them to do so,” he quickly rejoined, and floored me.
 
 This is how we are hoist with our own petard. If untouchability had been allowed go to on unchecked, each one of us should have considered the other untouchable and we should have been doomed. But thank God, in spite of the orthodox Dheds and Banias and Brahmins, the snake of untouchability is breathing its last.
 The teachers of course ought to adhere to their resolve. They should not be angry with the Dheds, but neither should they let go a single sweeper boy for the sake of the Dhed boys. Let them shower all their love and attention on the sweeper boys, and there their duty ends. Their determination and faith will melt the hearts of the Dheds, who, as soon as they find the sweepers’ children growing in cleanliness and character, will not help sending their own children too. The anti-untouchability worker has to begin at the lowermost rung of the ladder. There are, I know, some ‘reformers’ who are apt to think: ‘Better reform and serve our own castes before we reform and serve the Dheds.’ This way of thinking betrays impatience and ignorance, impatance because we fight shy of obstacles, and ignorance because we forget that all other reform of Hinduism is nothing worth until the main reform, viz., the removal of untouchability, is achieved. This blot poisons the whole system, even as a drop of arsenic would poison a tankful of milk. Remove this and you open the door  for  other reforms, retain this and you render other reforms nugatory. The disease of a consumptive unless the root cause is tackled remains just the same whether you remove or do not remove a few abscesses on his body.

485,,OFF THE TRAIL,"
    
 Remarkable are the attempts made by and on behalf of the Government to befog people’s minds and take them away from the main point by raising side issues and discovering or professing to discover flaws in evidence produced in support of the main point. It does not suit the Government to admit that its history is a history of the ruin of India’s industries and India’s manhood. One of  such recent attempts is to discredit the oft-told story in the Press and on the platform about the cutting off by the weavers of their own thumbs in order to escape the East India Company’ myrmidons who sought to compel them to wind silk. If the weaver has no thumb he cannot do the work expected of him. And the way the history has been discredited is by digging out the credentials of William Bolts on the strength of whose evidence the late Romesh Chandra Dutt First made the statement regarding the cutting off of thumbs. The writer of the refutation is not able to say that William Bolts gave false evidence, but he says that William Bolts had no character to keep and that therefore his evidence is not worthy of credence. And he further says that he was a dismissed servant of the Company under its resolution which described him as “a very unworthy and unprofitable servant of the Company, his conduct has been distinguished by a  tenacious adherence to those pernicious principles relative to the rights of inland trade, in which he appears to have been so conspicuously oppressive”. Who does not know the tricks of pettifogging lawyers to discredit witnesses by proving their bad character as if a man with a bad character was ever incapable of making a true statement? I make bold to say that whatever the character of William Bolts, his testimony about the cutting off of thumbs need not be discredited unless it can be otherwise disproved, and there has been nothing brought forward to show that that testimony is unworthy to be believed. On the contrary, what is more likely than that weavers in order to escape harrowing and continuous oppression would once for all render  themselves physically unfit to do the work imposed upon them under unbearable punishment? After all, the evidence of William Bolts is only part of the story of the ruin of India’s industries told by Romesh Chandra Dutt with such deadly effect and supported by the evidence of a variety of witnesses, the cumulative effect of whose evidence  becomes irresistible. The main point is whether the industry was or was not
 ruined with the greatest deliberation. If it was, it makes little difference  if the evidence of one witness is rejected and it will lie ill in the mouth of the criminal to say that out of a hundred witnesses one has told an untruth. But as I have said in this instance, there is nothing relevant brought forward to show that William Bolts’s testimony is not to be believed. Let me however put before the reader a few relevant extracts from Dutt’s first volume of the Economic History of India. He says :
 It will appear from the facts stated in the last two chapters that large portions of the Indian population were engaged in various industries down to the first decade of the nineteenth century. Weaving was still the national industry of the people; millions of women eked out the family income by their earnings from spinning; and dyeing, tanning and working in metals also gave employment to millions. It was not, however, the policy of the East India Company to foster Indian industries. It has been stated in a previous chapter that, as early as 1769, the Directors wished the manufacture of raw silk to be encouraged in Bengal, and that of silk fabrics discouraged. And they also directed that silkwinders should be made to work in the Company’s factories, and prohibited from working outside “under severe penalties by the authority of the Government”. This mandate had its desired effect. The manufacture of silk and cotton goods declined in India, and the people who had exported these goods to the markets of Europe and Asia in previous centuries began to import them in increasing quantities.
 So much was the importation of silk and cotton goods from England stimulated by these methods that whereas in 1794 it was
 £156, in 1813 it rose to £108, 824. In 1813 the Company’s charter was renewed and important evidence was taken at the enquiry prior to renewal. “In respect of Indian manufactures,” says the author, “they—the Commons—sought to discover how they could be replaced by British manufactures, and how British industries could be promoted at the expense of Indian industries.”
 The commercial policy of England is thus described by Henry St. George Tucker :
 What is the commercial policy which we have adopted in this country with relation to India? The silk manufactures and its piecegoods made of silk and cotton intermixed have long since been excluded altogether from our markets; and of late partly in consequence of the operation of a duty of 67 per cent, but chiefly from the effect of superior machinery, the cotton fabrics, which hiterto constituted the staple of India, have not only been displaced in
 
 this country, but we actually export our cotton manufactures to supply a part of the consumption of our Asiatic possessions. India is thus reduced from the state of a manufacturing to that of an agricultural country.
Here is another testimony of the same character by H. H. Wilson :
 It is also a melancholy instance of the wrong done to India by the country on which she has become dependent. It was stated in evidence (in 1813) that the cotton and silk goods of India up to the period could be sold for a profit in the British market at a price from 50 to 60 per cent lower than those fabricated in England. It consequently became necessary to protect the latter by duties of 70 and 80 per cent, on their value, or by positive prohibition. Had this not been the case, had not such prohibitive duties and decrees existed, the mills of Paisley and Manchester would have been stopped in their outset, and could scarcely have been again set in motion, even by the power of steam. They were created by the sacrifice of the Indian manufacture. Had India been independent, she would have retaliated, would have imposed prohibitive duties upon British goods, and would thus have preserved her own  productive industry from annihilation. This act of self-defence was not permitted to her; she was at the mercy of the stranger. British goods were forced upon her without paying any duty, and the foreign manufacturer employed the arm of political injustice to keep down and ultimately strangle a competitor with whom he could not have contended on equal terms.
 According to Thomas Munro “the  Company’s  servants assembled the principal weavers and placed a guard over them until they entered into engagements to supply the Company only.”
The author then proceeds :
 When once a weaver accepted an advance he seldom got out of his liability. A peon was placed over him to quicken his deliveries if he delayed, and he was liable to be prosecuted in the courts of justice. The sending of a
 1
 peon meant a fine of one anna (about 12   d.) a day on the weaver, and the peon
 was armed with a rattan, which was not unoften used to good purpose. Fine was sometimes imposed on the weavers, and their brass utensils were seized for its recovery. The whole weaving population of villages were thus held in subjection to the Company’s factories. . . . The control under which the weaver population was held was not merely a matter of practice, but was legalized by Regulations. It was provided that a weaver who had received advances from the Company “shall on no account give to any other persons whatever, European or Native, either the labour or the produce engaged to the Company”; that on his failing to deliver the stipulate cloths, “the Commercial Resident shall be at liberty to place peons upon him in order to quicken his
 deliveries’; that on his selling his cloths to others, the weaver “shall be liable to be prosecuted in the dewani Adalat”; that “weavers, possessed of more than one loom, and entertaining one or more workmen, shall be subject to a penalty of 35 per cent on the stipulated price of every piece of cloth that they may fail to deliver according to the written agreement”; that landlords and tenants “are enjoined not to hinder the Commercial Residents or their officers from access to weavers”;' and that they “are strictly prohibited from behaving with disrespect to the Commercial Residents” of the Company.
Is it to be wondered at if weavers living under such intolerable
 restraint broke loose from it by cutting off their own thumbs? To revive an industry that was thus deliberately destroyed and which supplemented the resources of millions of people is the sacred duty of every Indian who loves his country and should be considered a privilege by every Englishman who would repent of the grave wrong done to a great country by his ancestors. But instead of repentance, we see a painful persistence in the policy initiated 150 years ago and an equally painful effort made by every means possible to bolster up the wrong.

DEAR MOTILALJI,
 I have your letter. I am daily making fresh discoveries which go to show that we may expect nothing from the mill-owners at the present stage. They will yeild only to pressure and the pressure of the Government is more felt than that of the Congress. But we may not be impatient. We need not put boycott of Indian mill-made cloth in the same category as that of foreign cloth. A negative attitude about mill- cloth will be quite enough to keep the mills under wholesome check. A positive boycott will only stir up bad blood without bringing us any nearer boycott of foreign cloth. We shall never, unless a sudden manifestation of mass energy comes into being, succeed in reaching the millions. In spite of all we may do, for the time being the latter will therefore be buying Indian mill-cloth and, further, there will be keen competition between Lancashire mills and Japanese on the one hand and Indian mills on the other. We have therefore to concentrate our effort on changing the mentality of the townspeople and those few villagers whom we are controlling and bringing them round to the adoption of khadi. If we set about doing this, the meassage of khadi will percolate the masses. Then both our and foreign mills will feel the brunt. That will be the time for our mills to come in line with us. The moment they do so we can complete boycott of foreign cloth inside of six months. The programme definitely therefore has to be this :
 We leave Indian mills severely alone. We carry on a whirl- wind compaign for boycott of foreign cloth through khadi, asking people to count no sacrifice too great in adopting khadi. We must have faith in ourselves and in our people and believe that they can make this which appears to me to be small sacrifice. But I confess that at the present moment I do not visualize the organi- zation that is needed to carry on the boycott. The politicals who are in possession of the platform do not mean to do any serious business. They will not
 concentrate on any constructive work. Jawahar in a letter truly describes the atmosphere when he says: “There is violence in the air.” We read and hear so much about the boycott of British cloth in Bengal, but the letters I receive almost every week show that there is no real boycott. There is no organization behind it, there is no will working behind it. All things considered, what will you advise me to do?
 The expected letter from Romain Rolland is due next Tuesday at the latest. I must after that come to a decision quickly. Supposing that Romain Rolland predisposes me in favour of the European visit, what would you have me to do in view of the talk of the boycott? Would you want me for the sake of the boycott not to go to Europe? I shall accept your decision whatever it may be. I am not personally keen on the European visit, but if all is plain sailing in India and if Romain Rolland wants me to visit Europe, I should feel bound to accept the European invitations. Will you please wire your decision? Jawahar will be with you and probably you will know Doctor Ansari’s mind.
 Yours sincerely,

BHAISHRI DEVCHANDBHAI,
 I have your letter. After having read Revashankerbhai’s letter, how can I press him to accept the proposal? Or do you wish only to use his name and do not expect him to do any work? If that is what you wish, then we should find out a temporary vice-president who is a good worker. It is certainly desirable that you should go to Bombay for all this work. Maybe Revashankerbhai could suggest to you in the
 course of discussion the name of such a vice-president or of somebody else as president. Tell me now what you want, so that I may act accordingly.

  	I have not understood the last paragraph of your letter which I take 	first, though I understand that you will be unable for some time to 	bring out Mr. Gregg’s book. It will be terrible if that happens 	after the long notices that have been taken in Young India of 	that book. Please wire on receipt of this when if at all you are 	likely to bring the book out.  	You need not apologize for having sent the book on Self- 	Restraint v. Self-Indulgence to Dr. Stopes. Indeed having 	reviewed her books and even advertised them, you were bound to send 	my book to her. There was nothing wrong in it, but you are certainly 	under no obligation to publish her review of my book, unless of 	course you independently think that it is a good and 	well-arguedreview. And if you do not publish her review, you will be 	rendering her a service by telling her straightway why you decline 	to publish it.  	Now about yourself. The only thing I can suggest to you is to become 	absolutely firm about your resolution and you will find that all 	your difficulties will vanish. Our difficulties really arise when we 	are tossed to and fro by our weakness and indecisive action. A  	decisive, firm, clear action is like the glistening sun which not 	only dispels all darkness but destroys all disease germs. The vast 	majority of our ills and our difficulties arose from our doubting 	state.  	I shall have decided about the European visit next week and if I 	decide to go, it will be somewhere in the middle of May or it may be 	the first week. Do come when you like.

  	I have your letter of the 7th ultimo. If I go to Europe at all and  	if I find the time and have the health for it, I shall gladly attend 	the Conference.  From 	a photostat: S.N. 14944         	Sheth Ranchhodlal Amritlal has sent me the following schemelibtech_540_footnoteof Industrial Insurance for clerks :  	I understand little of insurance, but I take it that in this age of 	insurance any scheme of industrial insurance devised for the benefit 	of the clerical workers would be to their good. Only an insurance 	expert can offer helpful criticism of the scheme, and I take it that 	Sjt. Ranchhodlal has framed the scheme in consultation with some 	large- hearted expert.  	There cannot be two opinions as to the fact that mill-owners, no 	less than other business and commercial firms, ought to take  a  	paternal interest in the welfare of their employees. The relations 	between the employer and the employee have been up to now merely 	those of the master and servant, they should be of father and 	children.  I therefore welcome the scheme.        
 Medical relief should not, in my opinion, be free. It should be genuine, prompt and cheap. Free aid is likely to undermine their independent spirit. Sometimes free aid is rendered perfunctorily and sometimes it is abused, from both of which evils the clerks should be saved.
 The main grievance of the clerk and the working man is low pay and indifference to his welfafre. The measures suggested  in  the scheme will be a direct and simple redress of the grievance, and I welcome them.
 The condition of clerks is, in certain respects, undoubtedly  much more pitiable. I have a vivid picture of their condition before my mind. It was given to me in 1915 in Calcutta by the Marwari Clerks’ Associa-tion. It was a tragic tale of their helplessness. The number of clerks is small, their power of endurance and their capacity for union is feeble. Whereas the clerk is the only earning member of his family, practically all the members of the workingman’s family are wage-earners. The clerks must bestir themselves to improve their own condition. They must unite, and must educate their dependants, especially their wives, to engage in some gainful occupation. They have lost all self-confidence and are helpless. Those who are honest, competent in their work, conscien-tious and hard working need not despair of finding a suitable situation.
 True social economics will teach us that the workingman, the clerk and the employer are parts of the same indivisible organism. None is smaller or greater than the other. Their interests should be not conflicting but identical and interdependent.

  	You will be perhaps sorry to hear that I have decided not to go to 	Europe this year. There was not call for me to go in answer to the 	various invitations, but I felt that, if Rolland considered it worth 	while my going to meet him in furtherance of the common cause, I 	would go and incidentally respond to invitations from Europe. Now 	there is the expected letter from him. I send you a copy so that you 	can better understand my decision. Rolland’s hesitation to let me 	go to Europe principally for the sake of meeting him shows that as 	an artist and as the interpreter of my message he does not regard it 	as necessary that I should leave all my important work here and go 	to Europe to meet him. And as there is no call in him to ask me to 	go or to accept my 
 offer to go, I feel that if my letter to him was truthful, that is to say, if the deciding motive was to see him, I should consider his letter to be God’s guidance in answer to my prayer. As days went by I was hardening my heart feeling more reluctant to go to Europe at the present moment and was feeling also that I had nothing to give to Europe, whereas my hands were absolutely full here. The call of the Ashram is incessant. It is becoming clearer day by day that if I am to do justice to the Ashram, which I claim to be my best creation, and if I cannot give it the whole of my time, I must at least give to it the major part of my time.
 I had Burma in my mind if I did not go to Europe. But now I feel that I don’t want to go to Burma either and I shall pass the summer in the Ashram, if Burma does not want me.
 The heat does not trouble me. I am getting on quite well. And, of course, there are many other things which I can attend to if I am here. On the whole, therefore, I think that I must not go. But I can make this provisional decision that if everything goes well, I would go next year giving myself ample time from now to make all my preparations and dispositions so that I can go without difficulty, and then, perhaps, if I could do so and if the way is clear, taking America also to save time.
 I had a long chat with Ambalal. He said that he had sent his own subscription but that he could not move further unless there was a proper balance-sheet published. He was dissatisfied with the account- keeping and he seemed to be keen on a Gujarati committee because he said that the bulk of the money was found by the Gujaratis. So far as I could see I could not move him in his decision. But he said that in giving his opinion he was more guided by other donors than by his own instinct.
 Marichi described to me the condition of your teeth or rather your toothlessness. To be toothless is by no means a great deprivation and it is decidedly a gain when one’s teeth are a source of disease rather than of health.

After improving your health in Calcutta, if you feel strong enough to go back, do so. I have sent Ramlalji with that hope.

 As I write this letter, I have before me a telegram from Patna informing me that Maganlal is on his death-bed. Radha is there by chance. The friends at Patna are doing their best for him.  Any  moment there may be a telegram about his passing away. What mystery of God’s will is this, that he whom I regard as my heir is preparing to go away, leaving his inheritance? If only all of you who remain behind could follow in Maganlal’s footsteps!
 I get the letters of both of you. Wayne must have given you my message. I think I have already informed you that he met me.
 Ramdas is still in Kathiawar hawking khadi. He should return in four or five days. Chhaganlal fell ill and has, therefore, left Orissa and gone to Almora. Prabhudas is already there on grounds of health. But now he is doing khadi work all the time.
 I want a sample of Sushila’s English handwriting and language. What is her weight now? What painting is she engaged on at present?

  	I have your letter. Consider with Jaisukhlal what should be done if 	the work at Balara stops. I did not understand your intention in the 	last paragraph. If however you have an offer of a better-paid job 	and you feel inclined to accept it, I will not force you to remain 	in the khadi work. If you remain in khadi work, you should do so 	merely in  a spirit of service an without any thought of money, as 	Ramdas does. No one should feel that he is acting under coercion 	from anyone. I certainly like your work. Personally, I should like 	to keep you in the Ashram. But a proposal is under discussion just 	now that only those who observe brahmacharya should be 	allowed to live in the Ashram. Nothing has been decided finally. But 	I believe that there would be no difficulty in fixing you up at some 	other place if not in the Ashram. Maganlal 	expired in Patna.

 CHI. CHHAGANLAL,
 What shall I write to you? Improve your health. There is no urgency for going to Utkal. Whenever you decide to go, do see me before going. Kashi herself, at the moment, does not feel  strong enough to go there. Both of us believe that she will not be able to bear the cold there.
I am touched by your beautiful letter to Joshi.
 The very next day of [Maganlal’s] death, I started a movement that Santok should give away whatever property she has. I had talked about it to Maganlal many a time. I have started the move with the help of Keshu. While talking to Khushalbhai about the  shradhalibtech_554_footnotelibtech_555_footnote, I asked him to do the same. I could not talk to him at length as there was some distraction. However, on this matter, I solicit the help of all you brothers. The property is meant for all of you but none of you need it. Then why should you keep it? I will no doubt  talk  to Narandas too. I remember that you too have something with you. I wish that you would dispose it off. For whom do you need it? Both your sons are able and of self-sacrificing temperament. Kashi and you will never be in trouble. The thought as to what will happen to the Ashram when I am no more, is a mean one and should never be entertained.
I have written all this in a great hurry.

 MY DEAR JAWAHAR,
 I have your letter. Of course you know already the calamity that has befallen me on the death of Maganlal. It is well-nigh unbearable. However I am putting on a brave front.
 I had not read the resolution asking the Congress to drop “peaceful and legitimate means” and change the expression into “by all possible means”. Independence I can swallow, “by all means” is unswallowable. But I suppose we shall have to develop stomach strong enough to swallow any poison. I hope however that you will not allow yourself to be exploited beyond your wish and capacity.
 The mill-owners, it has now become obviously clear, wanted to do a deal with the Congress. But I am not sorry for these abortive negotiations. They have cleared the atmosphere.
 The expected letter from Romain Rolland was received on Sunday. He will not bear the burden I wanted him to do. So I am not going this year. But you will read about this in the pages of Young India.libtech_559_footnote

524,,MY BEST COMRADE GONE,"
         	He whom I had singled out as heir to my all is no more. Maganlal K. 	Gandhi, a grandson of an uncle of mine had been with me in my work 	since 1904. Maganlal’s father has given all his boys to the cause. 	The deceased went early this month to Bengal with Seth Jamnalalji 	and others, contracted a high fever whilst he was on duty in Bihar 	and died under the protecting care of Brijkishore Prasad in Patna 	after an illness of nine days and after receiving all the devoted 	nursing that love and skill could give.  	Maganlal Gandhi went with me to South Africa in 1903 in the hope of 	making a bit of fortune. But hardly had he been store- keeping for 	one year, when he responded to my sudden call to self- imposed 	poverty, joined the Phoenix settlement and never once faltered or 	failed after so joining me. If he had not dedicated himself to the 	country’s service, his undoubted abilities and indefatigable 	industry would have made him a merchant prince. Put in a printing 	press he easily and quickly mastered the secrets of the art of 	printing. Though he had never before handled a tool or a machine, he 	found himself at home in the engine room, the machine room and at 	the compositor’s desk. He was equally at ease with the Gujarati 	editing of the Indian Opinion. Since the Phoenix scheme 	included domestic farming, he became a good farmer. His was I think 	the best garden at the settlement. It may be of interest to note 	that the very first issue of Young India published in 	Ahmedabad bears the marks of his labours when they were much needed.    
 He had a sturdy constitution which he wore away in advancing the cause to which he had dedicated himself. He closely studied and followed my spiritual career and when I presented to my co-workers brahmacharya as a rule of life even for married men in search of Truth, he was the first to perceive the beauty and the necessity of the practice and, though it cost him to my knowledge a terrific struggle, he carried it through to success, taking his wife along with him by patient argument instead of imposing his views on her.
 When satyagraha was born, he was in the forefront. He gave me the expression which I was striving to find to give its full meaning to what the South African struggle stood for, and which for want of a better term I allowed to be recognized by the very insufficient and even misleading term “passive resistance”. I wish I had the very beautiful letter he then wrote to me giving his reasons for suggesting the name ‚ŒÊª˝„U which I changed to ‚àÿÊª˝„U.libtech_565_footnoteHe argued out the whole philosophy of the struggle step by step and brought the reader irresistibly to his chosen name. The letter I remember was incredibly short and to the point as all his communications always were.
 During the struggle he was never weary of work, shirked no task and by his intrepidity he infected everyone around him with courage and hope. When everyone went to jail, when at Phoenix courting imprisonment was like a prize to be won at my instance, he stayed back in order to shoulder a much heavier task. He sent his wife to join the women’s party.
 On our return to India, it was he again who made it possible to found the Ashram in the austere manner in which it was founded. Here he was called to a newer and more difficult task. He proved equal to it. Untouchability was a very severe trial for him. Just for one brief moment his heart seemed to give way. But it was only for a second. He saw that love had no bounds and that it was necessary to live down the ways of ‘untouchables’, if only because the so-called higher castes were responsible for them.
 The mechanical department of the Ashram was not a continuation of the Phoenix activity. Here we had to learn weaving, spinning, carding, and ginning. Again I turned to Maganlal. Though the conception was mine, his were the hands to reduce it to execution. He learnt weaving and all the other processes that cotton had to go through before it became khadi. He was a born mechanic.
 
 When dairying was introduced in the Ashram he threw himself with zeal in the work, studied dairy literature, named every cow and became friends with every animallibtech_566_footnoteon the settlement.
 And when tannery was added, he was undaunted and had proposed to learn the principles of tanning as soon as he got a little breathing time. Apart from his scholastic training in the High School at Rajkot, he learnt the many things he knew so well in the school of hard experience. He gathered knowledge from village carpenters, village weavers, farmers, shepherds and such ordinary folk.
 He was the Director of the Technical Department of the Spin- ners’ Association, and during the recent floods in Gujarat, Vallabh- bhai put him in charge of building the new township Vithalpur.
 He was an exemplary father. He trained his children—one boy and two girls, all unmarried still—so as to make them fit  for dedication to the country. His son Keshu is showing very great ability in mechanical engineering, all of which he has picked up like his father from seeing ordinary carpenters and smiths at work. His eldest daughter Radha, eighteen years old, recently shouldered a difficult and delicate mission to Bihar in the interest of women’s freedom. Indeed he had a good grasp of what national education should be and often engaged the teachers in earnest and critical discussion over it.
 Let not the reader imagine that he knew nothing of politics. He did, but he chose the path of silent, selfless constructive service.
 He was my hands, my feet and my eyes. The world knows so little of how much my so-called greatness depends upon the incessant toil and drudgery of silent, devoted, able and pure workers, men as well as women. And among them all Maganlal was to me the greatest, the best and the purest.
 As I am penning these lines, I hear the sobs of the widow bewailing the death of her dear husband. Little does she realize that I am more widowed than she. And but for a living faith in God, I should become a raving maniac for the loss of one who was dearer to me than my own sons, who never once deceived me or failed me, who was a personification of industry, who was the watchdog of the Ashram in all its aspects—material, moral and spiritual. His life is an inspiration for me, a standing demonstration of the efficacy and the supremacy of the moral law. In his own life he proved visibly for me
 
 
 not for a few days, not for a few months, but for twenty-four long years—now alas all too short—that service of the country, service of humanity and self-realization or knowledge of God are synonymous terms.
 Maganlal is dead, but he lives in his work whose imprints he who runs may read on every particle of dust in the Ashram.

 "
525,,A MORAL STRUGGLE,"
    
 I am a husband aged 30. My wife is about the same age. We have five children, of which two are fortunately dead. I know the responsibility for the rest of our children. But I find it difficult, if not impossible, to discharge that responsibility. You have advised self-restraint. Well, I have practised it for the last three years, but that is very much against my partner’s wish. She insists on what poor mortals call the joys of life. You from your superior height may call it a sin. But my partner does not see it in that light. Nor is she afraid of bearing more children to me. She has not the sense of responsibility that I flatter myself with the belief I have. My parents side more with my wife than with me and there are daily quarrels. The denial of satisfaction to my wife has made her so peevish and so irritable that she flares up on the slightest pretext. My problem now is how to solve the difficulty. The children I have are too many for me. I am too poor to support them. The wife seems utterly irreconcilable. If she does not have the satisfaction she demands, she may even go astray or go mad or commit suicide. I tell you, sometimes I feel that if the law of the land permitted it, I would shoot down all unwanted children as you would stray dogs. For the last three months I have gone without the second meal, without tiffin. I have business obligation which prevent me from fasting  for days. I get no compassion from the wife because she cosiders I am a humbug. I know the literature on birth-control. It is temptingly written. And I have read your book on self-restraint. I find myself between the devil and the deep blue sea.
 The foregoing is a faithful paraphrase of a heart-rending letter from a young man who has given me his full name and address and whom I have known for some years. Being afraid to give his name, he
 tells me he wrote twice before anonymously hoping that I would deal with his communications in the pages of Young India. I receive so many anonymous letters of this type that I hesitate to deal with them, even as I have considerable hesitation in dealing with this letter, although I know it to be perfectly genuine and know it to be a letter from a striving soul. The subject-matter is so delicate. But I see that I may not shirk an obvious duty claiming as I do claim a fair amount of experience of such cases and more especially because my method has given relief in several similar cases.
 The condition in India, so far as English-educated Indians are concerned, is doubly difficult. The gulf between husband and wife from the point of view of social attainments is almost too wide to be bridgeable. Some young men seem to think that they have solved it satisfactorily by simply throwing their wives overboard, although they know that in their caste there is no divorce possible and therefore no remarriage on the part of their wives possible. Yet others—and this is the far more numerous class—use their wives merely as vehicles of enjoyment without sharing their intellectual life with them. A very small number—but daily growing—has a quickened conscience and are faced with the moral difficulty such as my correspondent is faced with.
 In my opinion, sexual union to be legitimate is permissible only when both the parties desire it. I do not recognize the right of either partner to compel satisfaction. And if my position is correct in the case in point, there is no more obligation on the part of the husband to yield to the wife’s importunities. But this refusal at once throws a much greater and more exalted responsibility on the husband’s shoulders. He will not look down upon his wife from his isolent height but will humbly recognize that what to him is not a necessity is to her a fundamental necessity. He will therefore treat her with the utmost gentleness and love and will have confidence in his own purity to transmute his partner’s passion into energy of the highest type. He will therefore have to become her real friend, guide and physician. He will have to give her his fullest confidence and with inexhaustible patience explain to her the moral basis of his action, the true nature of the relationship that should subsist between husband and wife and the true meaning of marriage. He will find in the process that many things that were not clear to him before will be clear and he will draw his partner closer to him if his own restraint is truthful.
In the case in point I cannot help saying that the desire not to
 have more children is not enough reason for refusing satisfaction. It appears almost cowardly to reject one’s wife’s advances merely for fear of having to support children. A check upon an unlimited increase in the family is a good ground for both the parties jointly and individually putting a restraint upon sexual desires, but it is not sufficient warrant for one to refuse the privileges of a common bed to the other.
 And why this impatience of children? Surely there is enough scope for honest, hard-working and intelligent men to earn enough for a reasonable number of children. I admit that for one like my correspondent who is honestly trying to devote his whole time to the service of the country it is difficult to support a large and growing family and at the same time to serve a country, millions of whose children are semi-starved. I have often expressed the opinion in these pages that it is wrong to bring forth progeny in India so long as she is in bondage. But that is a very good reason for young men and young women to abstain from marriage, not a conclusive reason for one partner refusing sexual co-operation to the other. That co-operation can be lawfully refused, it is a duty to refuse, when the call for brahmacharya on the highest ground of pure religion is imperative. And when such a call has clearly come, it will have its healthy reaction upon the partner. Assuming, however, that it does not produce such reaction in time, it will still be a duty to adhere to restraint even at the risk of losinng the life or the sanity of one’s partner. The cause of brahmacharya demands sacrifices no less heroic than, say, the cause of Truth or of one’s country. In view of what I have said above, it is hardly necessary to state that artificial control of births is an immoral practice having no place in the conception of life that underlies my argument.
 Young India, 26-4-1928"
526,,TO EUROPEAN FRIENDS,"
    
 
 It is not without deep sorrow that I am now able to announce that the much-talked-of visit of mine to Europe is not to come off this year at any rate. To those in Austria, Holland, England, Scotland, Denmark, Sweden, Germany and Russia who had sent me kind invitations I can only say that their disappointment will be no greater than mine.
 Somehow or other I dread a visit to Europe and America. Not that I distrust the peoples of these great Continents any more than I distrust my own, but I distrust myself. I have no desire to go to the West in search of health or for sightseeing. I have no desire to deliver pubic speeches. I detest being lionized. I wonder if I shall ever again have the health to stand the awful strain of public speaking and public demonstrations. If God ever sent me to the West, I should go there to penetrate the hearts of the masses, to have quiet talks with the youth of the West and have the privilege of meeting kindred spirits—lovers of peace at any price save that of Truth.
 But I feel that I have as yet no message to deliver personally to the West. I believe my message to be universal but as yet I feel that I can best deliver it through my work in my own country. If I can show visible success in India, the delivery of the message becomes complete. If I came to the conclusion that India had no use for my message, I should not care to go elsewhere in search of listeners even though I still retained faith in it. If, therefore, I ventured out of India, I should do so because I have faith, though I cannot demonstrate it to the satisfaction of all, that the message is being surely received by India be it ever so slowly.
 Thus whilst I was hesitatingly carrying on the correspondence with friends who had invited me, I saw that there was need for me to go to Europe, if only to see M. Romain Rolland. Owing to my distrust of myself over a general visit, I wanted to make my visit to that wise man of the West the primary cause of my journey to Europe. I therefore referred my difficulty to him and asked him in the frankest manner possible whether he would let me make my desire to meet him the primary cause of my visit to Europe. In reply I have a noble letter from him through Mirabai (Miss Slade) wherein he says that in the
 name of truth itself, he will not think of letting me go to Europe if a visit to him is to be the primary cause. He will not let me interrupt my labours here for the sake of our meeting. I read in his letter no false humility. I read in it a most genuine expression of truth. He knew when he wrote his reply that my desire to go to Europe to meet him was not for a mere courteous discussion but in the interest of the cause as dear to him as to me. But evidently he was too humble to bear the burden of calling me merely so that in furtherance of the common interest we might by mutual talks understand each other better. And I wanted him to shoulder that very burden, if he felt that truth required us to meet each other face to face. His reply therefore I have taken as  a clear answer to my prayer. Apart from this visit, I felt within me no imperative call.
 I have taken the public into my confidence as, against my wish, the fact that a visit to Europe during this season was under serious contemplation was published in the papers. I regret my decision but it seems to be the correct one. For whilst there is no urge within to go to Europe, there is an incessant call within for so much to do here. And now the death of my best comrade seems to keep me rooted to the Ashram.
 But I my say to the many friends in Europe, that next year, if all is well and if they still will have me I shall try to undertake the postponed tour, under the strict limitations mentioned by me and this  I shall do whether I am ready to deliver my message or not. To see my numerous friends face to face will be no small privilege. But let me conclude this personal explanation by saying that if ever I am privileged to visit the West, I shall go there without changing my dress or habits, save in so far as the climate may require a change and self- imposed restrictions may permit. My outward form is I hope an expression of the inward.

 The foregoing resume of four months’ increasing  work  is proof, if proof be still necessary, of what earnest effort can do. Where the wheel is reported to have failed, it was not the wheel that failed, but the wheel mesters that failed because they had no faith. Schoolboy all the world over will respond to honest endeavour as the boys of the Sasavane Ashram have done. And from the figures that are published from time to time in these columns, anyone who cares can work out an arithmetical calculation showing how many children working, say, at least one hour per day at the weel or the takli can spin enough yarn to clothe the whole nation. Oh for an imagination that will visualize the simple beauty of the wheel as a sure solvent of the economic distress or the country!

 I have your wire as also Gurudev’s regarding Maganlal. It is perhaps the greatest trial of my life. But so far it appears that He who has subjected me to the ordeal is giving me the strength to go through it.
 Now therefore to the business. Here are copies of cables ex- changed between Sastri and myself. Please tell me if I have erred anywhere in my reply. And if you have got the papers refer- red to  by Sastri in his cable of date after my departure from South Africa after July 1914, please send them to me by registered post, especially the arrangements of 1915 and the recent bill.

  	Whilst I was thinking of applying to you for a contribution for the 	expenses I am incurring in connection with the position of emigrants 	abroad, I received a long confidential cablegram from the Rt. Hon. 	Sastri to which I have been obliged to send a reply which has cost 	me Rs.92-4-0. I do not know how prolonged  this cable correspondence 	will be.  	Whilst I have not Mr. Banarsidas with me, I have Pandit Totaram 	Sanadhya of Fiji, whom I dare say you know at least by repute. He is 	staying at the Ashram with his wife. He is draw- ing regularly Rs. 	50, and he is allowed to incur extra expenses in connection with 	Fiji. All the expenses are kept and even accounts are published. I 	send you a copy herewith. Totaramji gives his spare time to teaching 	Hindi to the children in the Ashram.   I would like the Associationlibtech_576_footnotelibtech_577_footnoteto 	take   this burden off my shoulders.

I am managing all the expenses connected with  Ashram activities 	through the generosity of private friends, but I think that the 	expenses on account of activity in connection with the emigrants 	should be borne by the Association. I would therefore like you to 	consider this letter as if it was divided into two parts, the first 	with reference to the general expenses which in my books amount to 	roughly Rs. 5,000 to date. I could send you an extract from the 	Ashram ledger to show how the account is made up,—secondly, the 	expenses that I am now incurring regarding cables.  	I shall be thankful for whatever the Committee  of  the Association 	considers a legitimate charge upon its funds.  Yours 	sincerely,  From 	a microfilm: S.N. 12859      "

            MY 	DEAR JUGALKISHORE,    THE 	ASHRAM, 	SABARMATI,  April 	27, 1928 
  	I was glad to receive your letter after such a long absence. I was 	wondering how you were faring at the P. M. V.libtech_578_footnote  	My plan about the spinners’ register is not half as ambitious as 	you think, though we cannot be too accurate nor too insistent on 	every worker coming in the closest touch with the spinners and yet, 	strange as it may appear though we represent spinners  above 	everybody else, our workers are least in touch with them! But even 	if we do not come in such close contact with them and understand 	their lives as we understand our blood-sisters, we should at least 	know who and where they are, who are supplying us with their yarn. I 	have therefore said that we should trace the residence and names of 	every spinner whose yarn is received in the bazaar. Let us at least 	have that very rudimentary contact with them. This does not require 	the elaborate register mentioned by Satis Babu in his Manual. Even 	he is not able to enforce that register when he buys yarn at the 	Feni Bazaar. His register was and is in complete operation at his 	Atrai Dept. where he brought into being the spinners for the first 	time and kept touch with them. The largest quantity of yarn however 	received by him is at    
 the Feni Bazaar. My register therefore is really a census register to be taken once for all or periodically. You see therefore you do not require the staff suggested by you for my simple measure.
 Nobody has complained that the Gandhi Ashram will not give this list. I think I saw the argument advanced by Dhiren about the difficulty of tracing every spinner and I wrote combating that argument and showing a way out of the difficulty. The difficulty raised by Dhiren was not raised by him alone. It is a difficulty common to almost all and all are gradually getting over the difficulty.
 I quite agree with you that in order to establish a living contact with the spinners, we must have women workers. Tell Shanti Devi I would like her to make a start.
 Now about your scheme. I like the general idea. How far you can give effect to it there, I do not know. Because after all you want honest and able teachers who know their work. We have not too many as yet. But make out your scheme and send it to Jamnalalji unofficially in the first instance and see how it appeals to him.
 Tell me how Bharat is doing there and how spinning is going on among the students.
By this time you know about Maganlal’s death.

 BHAISHRI KALYANJI,
 You know I cannot attend the Conference. I am sorry I cannot, but just now I am helpless. The contribution of the Raniparaj men and women to the present movement is as much a matter  of satisfaction to us as it is worthy of them. I regard this move- ment as one for developing fearlessness and for self-purification. How can they who call themselves Raniparaj live in fear? In the sacrificial effort of self-purification, how could they afford to have vices like drinking, gambling and wearing foreign cloth? I trust, therefore, that the Raniparaj men and women will give increasing importance to the spinning-wheel, use more and more khadi and abstain from drinking and give up other vices.

540,,THE MEANING OF VOLUNTARY POVERTY libtech_583_footnote,"
         	Sjt. Chhaganlal Joshi is the Secretary to the  Managing Committee of 	the Satyagraha Ashram, Sabarmati. He had a university scholarship 	for post-graduate study in economics and ever since he gave up that 	scholarship to take part in the  non-co-operation movement he has 	been in the Ashram. About a fortnight ago he had  a summons from a 	first class magistrate to appear as witness in a criminal case. The 	policeman who came to serve the  summons behaved most carelessly. He 	came shouting for Chhaganlal Joshi. This I heard and directed him to 	Sjt. Chhaganlal Joshi. He gave him the summons. Sjt. Chhaganlal 	asked him to wait until he had read it, but “take it if you care” 	he said and went away.  	Sjt. Chhaganlal read out the summons to me. He seemed to be knowing 	nothing about the case, and he did not know what to do. He had no 	time of his own, nor had he any money for railway fare. For all his 	time and money belonged to the Ashram, as every member is    
 supposed to have given his all to the Ashram. The money in possession of the Ashram is all public money ear-marked by the donors for the purpose for which it exists, and could certainly not be utilized for railway fare to respond to a summons. And so Sjt. Chhaganlal Joshi was in the predicament of the pauper of Orissa, the only difference being that whilst the latter could receive and use for himself whatever others gave him the former could not use a donation except for the purpose of the Ashram. Herein lies the beauty as well as the restraint of voluntary poverty.
 What then would an Orissa pauper do if he was served with a sum-mons as in this case? The policeman had not cared to explain to him the meaning of the summons, nor to pay him the railway fare to enable him to go to the court. In the present case the magistrate’s court was some miles away from Ahmedabad near a station on the Prantij line. The Oris-sa pauper would be absolutely helpless and would not know what to do.
 So Sjt. Chhaganlal decided to sit still and suffer the consequences. Otherwise his voluntary poverty would have no meaning, nor could he serve the poor if he did not behave like them.
 This inevitable inability to respond to the summons was interpreted by the magistrate as contempt of court and he issued a warrant of arrest against Sjt. Joshi. The man serving the warrant said: “We will not arrest you, if you promise to attend on the due date.”
 “I would willingly promise,” said Sjt. Joshi, “provided I got the railway fare and allowance.”
 The man had no authority to make the payment and so he produced Sjt. Joshi before a first class magistrate in Ahmedabad. The latter had no time to go into the ase. Sjt. Joshi explained how he failed to obey the summons, but the magistrate trained in the traditions of the bureaucracy said :
 “I am afraid I can do nothing. I am prepared to release you on bail, and you may if you like agitate later on.”
 If he was prepared to give bail, without getting the fare and the allowance, why should he not have obeyed the original summons?
The sun was blazing overhead when Sjt. Joshi was ordered to
 proceed to the police station. He refused any longer to walk and the policemen in charge were compelled to hire a carriage. Ultimately Sjt. Joshi was taken to Talod under a full police escort and produced before the magistrate. The moment the magistrate saw Sjt. Joshi he
 realized his mistake, paid him the fare and allowance and released him on parole.
 It is reported that this simple act of courage had a very good effect on the people of Talod who were greatly delighted.
 Those who have accepted voluntary poverty can by acting in the manner of Chhaganlal Joshi easily hasten the end of the injustice and tyranny that seems today to be the lot of the poor.
 The thoughtless discourtesy of the magistrate in the case was remarkable. He issued summons without the least inquiry and having done so did nothing to provide the man summoned with the wherewithal to obey the summons. I am told that it is not  the  practice to pay the witnesses railway fare and allowance in advance. If that is the case, it means terrible hardship for the poor. The issue of warrant in the case betrayed the magistrate’s criminal negligence. He had no evidence of the proper service of the summons.
 He did not care to inquire whether Sjt. Joshi had at all received the summons. One can only imagine what terrible  injustice  lies  hidden in this Government’s department of “justice”.
 It is difficult to say what would have happened in Talod had Sjt. Chhaganlal been the dumb pauper of Orissa. What a shower of abuse he might have received and how fiercely the magistrate might have bullied him! The man who had been so much sinned against might have been branded as a sinner.
 Though the Government is responsible for this reckless and insolent behaviour towards the poor, one cannot help observing that the Indian officials who behave in this fashion have absolutely no excuse to do so. It is possible that this high-handedness was there even in pre-British days. But a wrong does not become right if it can be proved to be pre-British. And if even Indian officials do not mend their ways, those who have accepted voluntary poverty ought  to  correct them through satyagraha.

541,,SOUL OF THE ASHRAM,"
    
 When Shri Vallabhbhai received the news of Maganlal Gandhi’s death, he wired: “The soul of the Ashram has departed.” There was no exaggeration in this. I cannot imagine the existence of Satyagraha Ashram without Maganlal.   Many of my activities were started because  I knew that he was there. If ever there was a person with whom I identified myself, it was Maganlal. We often have to consider whether certain matters will hurt another person, even if that person be one’s own son or wife. I never had to entertain such fear with regard to Maganlal. I never hesitated to set him the most difficult tasks. I very often put him in embarrassing situations and he silently bore with them. He regarded no work as too mean.
 If I were fit to be anyone’s guru, I would have proclaimed him my first disciple.
 In all my life I gave only one person the freedom to regard me as his guru and I had my fill of it. The fault was not his, as I could see; only I had imperfections. Anyone who becomes a guru should possess the power of conferring on the pupil the capacity to carry out whatever task is assigned to him. I had not that power and still do not have it.
 But if Maganlal was not a disciple, he was certainly a servant. I am convinced that no master could possibly find a servant better or more loyal than Maganlal. This may be a conjecture, but I can assert from my experience that I have not found another servant like him. It has been my good fortune always to have found co-workers, or servants if you like, who were faithful, virtuous, intelligent and industrious. Still, Maganlal was the best of all these co-workers and servants.
 The three streams of knowledge, devotion and action continuously flowed within Maganlal and, by offering his knowledge and his devotion in the yajna of action, he demonstrated before everyone their true form. And because in this way each action of his was full of awareness, knowledge and faith, his life attained the very summit of sannyasa. Maganlal had renounced his all. I never saw an iota of self-interest in any of his actions. He showed—not once, not for a short time but time after time for twenty-four years incessantly— that true sannyasa lay in selfless action or action without desire for reward.
Maganlal’s father entrusted all his four sons to me one after
 another for serving the country. Maganlal was entrusted to me in 1903.  He accompanied me to South Africa to earn a living.  In 1904,  I invited him along with other friends to embrace poverty in order to serve the country. He heard me calmly and embraced poverty. From that time on until his death, his life was an un-interrupted flow.With  each day I realize more and more that my mahatmaship, which is a mere adornment, depends on others. I have shone with the glory borrowed from my innumerable co-workers. However, no one has done more to add to this glory than Maganlal. He co-operated with me fully and with intelligence in all my activities—physical or spiritual. I see no better instance than Maganlal of one who made a tremendous effort to act as he believed. Maganlal was awake all the twenty-four hours esta-blishing unity of thought and action. He used up all his energy in this.
 If I have not exaggerated, consciously or unconsciously, in this sketch, one can say that a country in which dharma can be  so embodied must triumph and so must its dharma. Hence I wish that every servant of the country should study Maganlal’s life and if it commends itself to him imitate it with deter-mination. What was possible for Maganlal is possible for every man who makes the effort. Maganlal could become a true leader because he was a true soldier and I find those who could put up with  his  fire  weeping around me now.
 This country, as also the world, is in need of true soldiers.  Service of the country, service of the world, self-realization, vision of God—these are not separate things but different aspects of the same thing. Maganlal realized the truth of this in his own life and made others do so. Those who are curious can study his life and find this out.

 I have your letter. I have never felt that you have taken up khadi work for the sake of money, and my question arose only from yours. Will you always be able to live contented doing khadi work? You certainly know there is no financial gain in this. It provides plain bread. I assume from your letter that you will not be able to live in the Ashram if a rule is adopted that only brahmacharis can do so. Even in that case I believe there will be no problem in employing you in khadi work.

  	I have your letter. I have told you the way I want you to assist me. 	You offer to come to the Ashram, and yet, at the end of your letter, 	you are obliged to say, “I am afraid for a long time, I won’t be 	physically fit.” No, your sadhana is to make yourself 	physically fit and, therefore, it is better for you to be where you 	are, and convalesce. I would even suggest your going to Giridih and 	be at the side of Nikhil.    
 The idea of burying yourself in a village in order to develop it makes a forcible appeal to me. There, perhaps, you can rest your limbs better than anywhere else, if you have a clean water supply and if you will use a mosquito-net.
I have heard that you do not use milk. If this is true, it is bad.
You won’t serve the cause by wearing away the body without cause.

                DEAR 	LALAJI,           THE 	ASHRAM, 	SABARMATI,  April 	29, 1928 
  	I have your characteristic letter. I am glad you had an ocular 	demonstration of what form untouchability takes in the south. I wish 	you could have been there longer to see the unapproachables and the 
 invisibles face to face, and to talk to them.
 And in this connection let me tell you what an important part khadi is playing in reaching even the unapproachables and invisibles, because it is khadi that makes it possible to establish contacts which before were impossible or unthinkable. However this is by the way and written not to influence you in favour of khadi through a side issue.
 I am therefore glad that yu are making a serious study of the subject. And I am glad, too, that you are determined not to come to any hasty decision. Whatever conclusions you may ultimately form, I would like you to feel about them as you feel about untouchability. No argument against untouchability from the so-called sanatana quarters or any quarter could possibly dislodge you from the position you hold. I would like you therefore to make a thorough study of the problem before coming to any conclusion whatsoever.
 I want you for khadi. I know what a gain it would be. But I do not want you as a patron on whose certificate I may trade. I want you as a fellow-worker who will not be dislodged from his position and who would be working for the cause of khadi to the best of his ability. For the present, therefore, I would like you, after you study, to discuss the subject with me if you have any doubts before you commit yourself. By all means carry on correspondence with me or those who may be hostile to khadi, but I would like you to promise that you will not commit yourself before discussing with me the criticism that may apear to you to be convincing and unanswerable. Let me assure you that there are in the khadi movement people who have made a thorough study of the subject and who will leave khadi without a moment’s hesitation if they found that the premises on which they proceeded were insupportable.
 Yes, indeed, Maganlal’s death is the heaviest blow I could have received. But in the battle for freedom, we have little time to shed tears over the departure of the dearest.

MY DEAR RAMANATHAN,
 
 THE ASHRAM, SABARMATI, May 1, 1928
  	I have your letter about . . . .libtech_588_footnotelibtech_589_footnoteI 	see your law is at fault. If you have no writing from . . . , I am 	sure that we cannot pay ourselves for any loss incurred owing to the 	negligence or fraud of workers, even though the latter may have 	furnished cash security. Do you not see that it is a dangerous 	doctrine? If such were the law, employees would be at the mercy of 	employers who would be judges and executioners combined. What may 	appear to an employer to be negligence or fraud, may not honestly 	appear to be that to  an  employee and may not be such even in law. 	A well-ordered society, therefore, requires unequivocal written 	documents, if securities furnished by employees are to be 	appropriated for patent negligence or fraud. Whatever, therefore, 	you do about . . . I suggest that you should take a written document 	from all the employees from whom you have taken securities.  	About . . . , I suggest that you state the facts that you may have 	in your possession in proof of his dishonesty, tell him that you 	hold the security as guarantee for the damage sustained in 	accordance with the custom of the association and in accordance with 	the verbal agreement between him and yourself and offer to take him 	to a court of law if he wishes or to submit it to arbitrators, one 	to be appointed by him and one by us.  	I promised to write to . . . after I had heard from you. I will 	await your answer before writing to him.libtech_590_footnote

 CHI. PRABHUDAS,
 I have your letter. I do not have the courage to let you come here. Nor is it necessary for you to come. I have suggested to Devdas that he should go and be with you. If you send me a specimen of your model of the spinning-wheel, I will ask someone here to work it.  I will obtain Keshu’s report. Lakshmidas, who also is here now, may also see it. I may suffer your coming here when the weather is colder. Do come in the winter. Besides, Chhaganlal is there, and even for his sake, it is essential that you remain there. I certainly cannot let Chhaganlal come here. When his health is completely restored, he will of course come. My proposed visit to Europe has been cancelled, and so that reason also for your coming here does not exist. Moreover, as it is, you have been doing some work there and so, you need have no scruples in staying on there.
 What can I write about Maganlal? Khushalbhai and Devbhabhi have arrived. They are bearing the loss with great fortitude. Some changes have been taking place in the Ashram these days. You must be getting an account of them.

553,"May 1, 1928","SPEECH  AT  OPENING
		 OF  CRECHE, 
AHMEDABADlibtech_596_footnote","
    
 May 1, 1928
 Perhaps it is quite appropriate that this creche is being opened by one who calls himself a labourer, though let me confess to you that it was not without some hesitation that I accepted the invitation when it was brought to me by Sheth Kasturbhai, not because I did not like the object, but because I was so preoccupied, and nothing would have pleased me better than that you should have got this function performed by someone more deserving than myself preferably a mill- owner. But my regard for Sheth Kasturbhai prevailed and I had to yield.
 When I established my Ashram in Ahmedabad the consideration which weighed with me was not merely that it was the capital of Gujarat, nor that it was a busy commercial centre but that it was a great centre of textile industry and I felt that I could reasonably count on the help of the mill-agents and be able to render some service to the city. Today I am glad to be able to say that these expectations of mine have not been altogether unfulfilled. Though I have a recollection of some bitter experiences I have also a number of sweet recollections of my relations with the mill-owners. I have not yet given up hope of Ahmedabad. I still expect great things of it. It has much to accomplish yet, and among other things, speaking as a labourer myself, and as one who has tried to enter into the innermost feelings of the working class I say that Ahmedabad has much to do yet towards the amelioration of the condition of the labouring class.
 My connection with the labour of this place is not of yesterday. It is as old as my first coming to this city, and so I make bold to tell you that you have not yet done your part towards your labouring population. In some cases the labourers have not been provided with even the primary amenities of life. There are exceptions, however. Some mill-owners have made some effort in the direction, and the present one is an instance in point.
 The sentiments about the welfare of the mill-hands that Sheth Kas-turbhai has just now uttered before you reflect credit on him and the city of Ahmedabad. Sheth Kasturbhai was delighted with Port Sunlight, and rightly. But Port Sunlight cannot be our ideal. Messrs Lever Bros. represent to my mind the minimum standard that an
 
 
 employer must do for his employees. To do less would be a discredit. But we cannot afford to rest content with that. We must think in terms of our own civilization, and if the picture presented to us in the Mahabharata and the Ramayana of the social conditions prevailing in the ancient times be correct, our ideal would seem to go much farther than Port Sunlight. I have read a lot of li-terature about Port Sunlight, and I am an ardent admirer of their welfare work, but I maintain  that   ours  is  a  higher  ideal.	In the West there is still a watertight division between the employer and the employees. I know it is impertinent to talk of our ideal, while the curse of untouchability still stalks through the land. But I should be untrue to myself and be failing in my duty to you if I did not place before you what I regard as the highest ideal. The relation between mill-agents and mill-hands ought to be one of father and childeren or as between blood-brothers.  I have often heard the mill-owners of Ahmedabad refer to themselves as ‘masters’ and their employees as their servants. Such loose talk should be out of fashion in a place like Ahmedabad which prides itself on its love of religion and love of ahimsa. For that attitude is a negation of ahimsa, inasmuch as our ideal demands that all our power, all our wealth and all our brains should be devoted solely to the welfare of those who through their own ignorance and our false notions of things are styled labourers or ‘servants’. What I expect of you therefore is that you should hold all your riches as a trust to be used solely in the interests of those who sweat for you, and to whose industry and labour you owe all your position and prosperity. I want you to make your labourers co-partners of your wealth. I do not mean to suggest that unless you legally bind yourselves to do all that, there should be a labour insurrection. The only sanction that I can think of in this connection is of mutual love and regard as between father and son, not of law. If only you make it a rule to respect these mutual obligations of love, there would be an end to all labour disputes, the workers would no longer feel the need for organizing themselves into unions. Under the ideal contemplated by me, there would be nothing left for our Anasuyabehns and Shankerlals to do; their occupation would be gone. But that cannot happen until there is  a single mill-hand who does not regard the mill in which he works as his own, who complains of sweating and overwork, and who therefore nurses in his breast nothing but ill will towards his employers.And where is the difficulty?
You have told us and it is recognized everywhere that the mill-
 owners stand only to gain by doing all this. Messrs Lever Bros. lost nothing by doing all that they did. They felt so encouraged that they even tried to create another Port Sunlight in Natal. As our experience gradually broadens we are beginning to see more and more clearly that the more we give to our workers the more we stand to gain. From the moment your men come to realize that the mills are theirs, no less than yours, they will begin to feel towards you as blood-brothers, there would be no question of their acting against the common interest and the need for having a heavy supervisory establishment over them.
 You have given me credit for keeping the city of Ahmedabad free from a labour upheaval such as Bombay is at present passing through. Well, I cannot quite disclaim that credit, for does anyone among you for a moment doubt that things would have been  otherwise here, but for the work that Shrimati Anasuyabehn and Sjt. Shankerlal have been doing? It is true perhaps that you the mill- owners of Ahmedabad are more tactful than the Bombay mill-owners. In case of an upheaval you do not employ hooligans to crush your men as some employers in the West do, and I fancy that you have deliberately abjured that weapon of suppressing the aspirations of labour. My critics tell me that this is all moonshine, and that you would not hesitate to resort to such means, if you could. But I believe that they are mistaken and I want you to prove by your conduct that they are mistaken. I hope you will help to bring near the time when the sort of work that Sjt. Banker Shrimati Anasuyabehn are doing would be rendered needless, and pending that consummation give them all the help, all the encouragement that they need in their work.
 Now perhaps you understand why I have dared to appropriate a little credit for the peace that prevails here today. It belongs not to me but to Shrimati Anasuyabehn and Sjt. Shankerlal Banker. They live, move and have their being among the labourers, which I am unable to do. If you aid the efforts of these friends you will find there will not be much need left for erecting creches like this one or for providing medical relief. I do not wish to detract from the merit of these efforts of yours, but I ask you whether any well-to-do man would care to send his children to a creche like this. Our endeavour should be to bring about a state of things under which there would be no occasion for a mill-hand’s baby to be torn from its mother, and when a factory hand’s child would receive the same opportunities for education that our own children have.

 APPENDIX I
 RESOLUTION ON HINDU-MUSLIM UNITYlibtech_597_footnote
 PART   A—POLITICAL RIGHTS
 This Congress resolves : (1) That in any future scheme of constitution, so far as representation in various legislatures is concerned, joint electorates in all the provinces and in the Central Legislature be constituted; (2) That, with a view to giving full assurances to the two great communities that their legitimate interests will be safeguarded in the Legislatures such representation of the communities should be secured for the present, and if desired, by the reservation of seats in joint electorates on the basis of population in  every  province  and  in  the  Cental Legislature :
 Provided that reciprocal concessions in favour of minorities may be made by mutual agreement so as to give them representation in excess of the proportion of the number of seats to which they would be entitled on the population basis in any province or provinces and the proportions so agreed upon for the provinces shall be maintained in the representation of the two communities in the Central Legislature from the provinces.
 In the  decision  of  the  reservation  of  seats  for  the  Punjab,  the   question   of the representation of Sikhs as an important minority will be given full consideration;
 3(a)	That the proposal made by the Muslim leaders that the reforms should
 be introduced in the N.W.F. Province and British Baluchistan on the same footing as in other provinces is, in the opinion of the Congress, a fair and reasonable one, and should be given effect to, care being taken that simultaneously with other measures of administrative reform an adequate system of judicial administration shall  be introduced in the said provinces;
 (b)(i) That with regard to the proposal that Sind should be constituted into a separate province, this Congress is of opinion that the time has come for the redistribution of provinces on a linguistic basis—a principle that has been adopted in the constitution of the Congress;
    This 			Congress is 			also of 			opinion that 			such readjustment of 			provinces be 			immediately taken in 			hand and that any 			province which demands such reconstitution 			on linguistic 			basis be dealt 			with accordingly;  This 			Congress is 			further of 			opinion that 			a beginning 			may be 			made by 			reconstituting Andhra, 			Utakl, Sind and 			Karnatak into separate provinces;   
 That, in the future constitution, liberty of conscience shall be guaranteed 
 
 and no legislature, Central or Provincial, shall have power to make any laws  interfering with liberty of conscience;
 ‘Liberty of conscience’ means liberty of belief and worship, freedom of religious observances and association and freedom to carry on religious education and propaganda with due regard to the feelings of others and without interfering with similar rights of others;
  That 	no bill, 	resolution, motion or 	amendment regarding 	intercommunal matters 	shall be moved, 	discussed or passed 	in any 	legislature, Central or 	Provincial, if 	a three-fourths 	majority of the 	members of 	either community affected 	thereby in that 	legislature oppose 	the introduction, 	discussion or 	passing of 	such  bill, resolution, 	motion or amendment. 
 “Intercommunal matters” means matters agreed upon by such a joint Standing Committee of both communities—of the Hindu and Muslim members  of  the legislature concerned appointed at the commencement of every session of the legislature.
 PART B—RELIGIOUS AND OTHER RIGHTS
 This Congress resolves that :
  Without 	prejudice to the 	rights Hindus and 	Mussalmans claim, the 	one to play 	music and 	conduct processions 	wherever they please 	and the other 	to slaughter 	cows for sacrifice 	or food 	wherever they 	please, the 	Mussalmans appeal to 	the Mussalmans 	to spare 	Hindu feelings as much 	as possible 	in the matter 	of the cow and 	the Hindus 	appeal to the 	Hindus to 	spare Mussalman feelings, 	as much 	as possible 	in the 	matter of music before mosques. 
 And therefore, this Congress calls upon both the Hindus and Mussal-mans not to have recourse to violence or to law to prevent the slaughter of a cow or the playing of music before a mosque.libtech_598_footnote
  This 	Congress further resolves that every individual or 	group is 	at liberty to 	convert or 	reconvert another by 	argument or 	persuasion but 	no individual 	or group 	shall attempt to 	do so, or 	prevent its 	being done by 	force, fraud or 	other unfair means 	such as 	the offering 	of material 	inducement. Persons under 	eighteen years 	of age 	should not 	be converted 	unless it 	be along with their 	parents or 	guardians. If 	any person 	under eighteen years of 	age is 	found stranded without 	his parents 	or guardian 	by persons 	of another 	faith he should 	be promptly 	handed over to persons 	of his 	own faith. There must 	be no secrecy 	as to the 	person, place, time 	and manner about any 	conversion or 	reconversion, nor 	should there 	be any 	demonstration of 	jubilation in 	support of 	any conversion 	or reconversion. 
 Whenever any complaint is made in respect of  any  conversion  or reconversion, that it was effected in secrecy or by force, fraud or other unfair means,
 
 or whenever any person under eighteen years of age is converted, the matter shall be enquired into and decided by arbitrators who shall be appointed by the Working Committee either by name or under general regulations.
 The resolution was moved by Mrs. Sarojini Naidu and was seconded by Mr.
 Abul Kalam Azad.
 The resolution was put and carried unanimously.

  APPENDIX II  LETTER FROM 	JAWAHARLAL NEHRUlibtech_599_footnote        MY 	DEAR BAPUJI,       ALLAHABAD,  January 	11, 1928 
  The 	Working Committee is now meeting in Banaras and so I cannot go to 	Bombay or Sabarmati for some time.  I 	am loath 	to  inflict 	 another  letter 	 on  you  so  soon 	 after  my  last 	 but  I   am  very  much  	troubled  by  your  criticisms 	 of  the  Congress 	 resolutions  and  I  	feel I 	must write to 	you again. 	You are always 	very careful with you 	words and 	your language 	is studiously 	restrained. It amazes 	me all 	the more to find 	you using language 	which appears to me 	wholly unjustified. You 	have condemned in 	general language 	the proceedings 	of the 	Subjects Committee and 	specially selected some 	resolutions for 	greater criticism and 	condemnation. May 	I point 	out that 	it is always 	unsafe to 	judge on 	hearsay evidence? You 	were not present yourself 	and it 	is quite conceivable 	that the 	opinions you 	may have formed 	after a personal 	visit to the 	Subjects Committee may 	have been different. Yet 	you have chosen to 	condemn and 	judge unfavourably the 	whole Committee, or 	at any rate 	a great 	majority of it, 	simply basing 	your judgment on the 	impressions of 	a few persons. Do 	you think this is 	quite fair 	to the 	Committee or 	the Congress? 	You have 	referred to 	discipline and 	to the 	Working Committee as 	the National 	Cabinet. May I 	remind you 	that you are a member 	of the 	Working Committee and 	it is an extraordinary 	thing for a 	memebr on 	the morrow 	of the 	Congress to 	criticize, and 	run down the 	Congress and 	its principal 	resolutions. There has 	been a general 	chorus of congratulation 	on the 	success of 	the Madras 	Congress. This 	may be 	wrong or 	without sufficient basis 	but undoubtedly 	there was this general 	impression in the 	country and 	atmosphere counts for 	a great 	deal in 	all public work. And 	now most people who 	thought so 	feel a 	bit dazed at 	your criticisms and wonder if their previous enthusiasm was not overdone or mistaken.    
 You have described the Independence Resolution as “hastily conceived and thoughtlessly passed”. I have already pointed out to you how the country has discussed and considered this question for years past, and how I have personally thought over it, discussed it, spoken about it in meetings, written about it and generally been full of it for the last five years or more. It seems to me that under the circumstances no stretch of language can justify the use of the words “hastily conceived”. As for “thoughtlessly passed” I wonder if you know that the resolution was discussed in the Subjects Committee for about three hours and more than a dozen speeches for and against were made. Ultimately as you know it was passed almost unanimously both in the Committee and the open Congress. Were all the people in the Committee and the Congress who voted for it “thoughtless”? Is this not rather a large assumption? And why should it not be said with greater truth that the small minority opposed to the resolution were mistaken? You mention that last year the resolution was rejected by the Committee. I do not know what inferene you draw from this but to me it seems obvious that this can only mean that the Committee and the Congress have been eager to pass it in the past as in the present but refrained from doing so out of regard for you. I hope will agree with me that it is not healthy politics for any organization to subordinate its own definite opinion on a public issue out of personal regard only.
 I  am not referring here to the merits of the resolution.  But I  shall  only say  this  that  after  prolonged and  careful  thought   a   demand  for   independence and  all  that  this  implies  has  come  to  mean  a  very  great  deal  for  me  and   I attach  more  importance  to  it  than  to  almost  anything   else.   I   have   thought over every word you said the other day in Madras on this question and it has merely confirmed me in my opinion. But I doubt if anyone outside a small circle understands your position in regard to this. I am sure that none of the others—liberals, etc.,— who want dominion status think in the same way with you. Yesterday Sir Ali Imam addressed a meeting here on the Simon boycott. I also spoke for a few minutes and like King Charles’ head independence cropped up and I laid stress on it. After the meeting Ali Imam told me that I did well in laying stress on this; he and his friends would probably come round to this position sooner or later but for the time being they had to be a little restrained as they wanted to carry many people with them. I am sure most liberals welcome the Independence Resolution, whatever they may say about it, as they feel that it strengthens their position. But whether they like it or not, it passes my comprehension how a national organization can have as its ideal and goal dominion status. The very idea suffocates and strangles me.
 I took no special interest in the resolution on the boycott of British goods chiefly because I felt that it would meet with your strong disapproval and the boycott could not succeed unless a more or less unanimous effort was made. But I have no doubt that it can be made into a partial success if there was some unanimity in our own ranks. You must have read about the wonderful effectiveness of the boycott in China.
 There was nothing special in China which we have not got and  there  is  no fundamental reason why we cannot succeed where they succeeded.  But granting that it  is not likely to succeed is it such a laughing matter after all? Has our boycott of foreign cloth by khaddar succeeded so remarkably? Has our spinning franchise succeeded? They have not but you do not hesitate to them on the country and the Congress because you felt, and rightly, that they would be good for the nation even if they did not wholly succeed.
 I remember how Kelkar, Aney and Co., even as members of the Working Committee, used to make fun of the Congress resolutions on khadi, and it is very painful for me to think that you are also ridiculing important Congress resolutions. The Kelkars and Aneys do not count and I do not care what they say or do. But I do care very much for what you say and do.
 Having singled out two resolutions for your  special condemnation you casually   refer  to   the   others   as   “several irresponsible  resolutions”.	Excepting the Unity Resolution every other resolution of the Congress may come under this heading.	And so the labours of the 200  and  odd  persons  in  the  Subjects Committee and the larger number in the Congress are summarily and rather contemptuously  disposed   of.	It  is  very  hard  luck  on  the  unhappy   persons who, though wanting perhaps in foresight and intelligence, did not spare themselves   and  tried   to   do their  best.	We have all sunk to the level of the schoolboys’  ‘debating  society’  and  you  chastize  us  like  an  angry   school- master, but a school-master who will not guide us or give us lessons but will only point out from time to time the error of our ways. Personally I very much wish  that we were more like real schoolboys, with the life and energy and daring of schoolboys, and a little less like the right honourable and honourable gentlemen who are for ever weighing the pros and cons and counting the cost.
 You know how intensely I have admired you and believed in you as a leader who can lead this country to victory and freedom. I have done so in spite of the fact that I hardly agreed with anything that some of your previous publications—Indian Home Rule, etc.,—contained. I felt and feel that you were and are infinitley greater than your little books. Above everything I admire action and daring and courage and I found them all in you in a superlative degree. And I felt instinctively that, however much I may disagree with you, your great personality and your possession of these qualities would carry us to our goal. During the N. C. O. period you were supreme; you were in your element and automatically you took the right step. But since you came out of prison something seems to have gone wrong and you  have  been  very  obviously ill at ease. You will remember how within a few months or even weeks you repeatedly changed your attitude—the Juhu statements, the A.I.C.C. meeting at Ahmedabad and after, etc.,—and most of us were left in utter bewilderment. That bewilderment has continued since then. I have asked you many times what you expected to do in the future and your answers have been far from satisfying. All you
 have said has been that within a year or eighteen months you expected the khadi movement to spread repidly and in a geometric ratio and then some direct action in the political field might be indulged in. Several years and eighteen months have passed since then and the miracle has not happened. It was difficult to believe that it would happen but faith in your amiazing capacity to bring off the improbable kept us in an expectant mood.  But such faith for an irreligious person like me is a poor reed  to reply on and I am beginning to think if we are to wait for freedom till khadi becomes universal in India we shall have to wait till the Greek Kalends. Khadi will grow slowly, and if war comes it will grow very fast, but I do not see how freedom is coming in its train. As I mentioned before you our khadi work is almost wholly divorced from politics and our khadi workers ae developing a mentality which does not concern itself with anything outside their limited sphere of work. This may be good  for  the  work  they do,  but  little  can  be  expected  from   them   in   the political field.
 What then can be done? You say nothing,—you only criticize and no helpful lead comes from you. You tell us that if the country will not even take to khadi how can we expect it to do anything more difficult or daring.  I do not think the reasoning  is correct.  If the country does not go ahead politically by one method, surely it is up  to our leaders to think of other or additional methods.
 Reading many of your articles in  Young India—your   autobiography,   etc.,
 —I have often felt how very different my ideals were from yours. And I have felt that you were very hasty in your judgments, or rather having arrived at certain conclusions you were over-eager to justify them by any scrap of evidence you might get. I remember how in an article on the “Two Ways” or some such title—you gave some newspaper cuttings from America about crimes and immorality and contrasted American civilization with Indian. I felt it was something like Katharine Mayo drawing conclusions from some unsavoury hospital statistics. Your long series of articles based on the French book—“Towards Moral Bankruptcy”—also made me feel the same way. You misjudge greatly, I think, the civilization of the West and attach too great an importance to its many failings. You have stated somewhere that India has nothing to learn from the West and that she had reached a pinnacle of wisdom in the past. I certainly disagree with this viewpoint and I neither think that the so- called Ramaraj was very good in the past, nor do I want it back. I think that western  or rather industrial civilization is bound to conquer India maybe with many changes and adaptations, but none the less, in the main, based on industrialism. You have criticized strongly the many obvious defects of industrialism and hardly paid any attention to its merits. Everybody knows these defects and the utopias and social theories are meant to remove them. It is the opinion of most thinkers in the West that these defects are not due to industrialism as such but to the capitalist system which is based on exploitation of others.  I believe you have stated that in your
 
 opinion there is no necessary conflict between capital and labour.  I think that under  the capitalist system this conflict is unavoidable.
 You have advocated very eloquently and forcefully the claims of the Daridranarayana—the poor in India. I do believe that the remedy you have suggested is very helpful to them and if adopted by them in large number will relieve to some extent their misery. But I doubt very much if the fundamental cause of poverty are touched by it. You do not say a word against the semi-feudal zamindari system which prevails in a great part of India or against the capitalist exploitation of both the workers and the consumers.
 But I must stop. I have already exceeded all reasonable limits and I hope you will forgive me. My only excuse is my mental agitation. I did not want to become the secretary of the A.I.C.C. as I wanted perfect freedom to say and do what I considered necessary. But Ansari pressed me on the ground that many of my resolutions and specially the Independence Resolution, had been passed by the Congress and I thus had full freedom to work on my own lines. I could not answer this argument and had to accept. Now I find that every effort is being made to belittle and ridicule these very Congress resolutions and it is a painful experience.
 Yours affectionately,
 JAWAHARLAL

 APPENDIX III
 FOREIGN PROPAGANDA
 BY    C.  RAJAGOPALACHARI
 Before the Non-co-operation movement, Indian political activity largely consisted of propaganda in Great Britain. A great deal of money, comparatively, was spent on it and was considered well spent. When Gandhiji took up the guidance of our national affairs there was a change of outlook. A grasp of the essentials of national strength was the first result of his programme and it marked all our political thought at the time. We understood the natural laws that governed the sanctions needed for the non-violent enforcement of national demands. An almost exclusive spirit of self- reliance was the natural consequence. The cultivation of favourable opinion in foreign parts including Great Britain was valued at its correct worth and distinct efforts to that end were practically given up, and opposed vigorously whenever the question was raised. So intense was the work in India and so marked were the results that the tables were soon turned, and instead of Indians going to do propaganda in Great Britain and foreign parts, India attracted numerous foreign visitors; and the British Government was forced to undertake counterpropaganda in foreign parts. In India itself the Government had to give up its self-confidence and organize its own propaganda among the people in order to resist or at least postpone the effects of the
 national upheaval.
 With the stoppage of aggressive non-co-operation, however, there has been a reversion in Indian thought. Slowly but steadily the cry for foreign propaganda is gaining in volume again. The internal situation also, namely, the difficulties in the way of united national action, has naturally led people to turn to easir outlets of activities abroad. To those who still hold to the creed of non-co-operation and who look to emancipation only from within, this turn of the national gaze and energy to East and West is a symptom of growing weakness and a cause for anxiety. The vision is bound to be cluded and constructive efforts are bound to be prejudicially affected by the growing tendency to this diversion. Not only does it divert attention but some of the best workers will be drawn bodily into this channel of pleasanter though futile work.
 Pre-non-co-operation foreign propaganda  was  mostly  propaganda  in Britain. But one of the permanent results of the efforts of these eight years is loss of faith in Britain. The last vestiges of faith that stuck to the British Labour Party have been also destroyed. The present harking back to foreign propaganda is therefore not for propaganda in England, but for the cultivation of contacts and friendship with other foreign nations. We are told that it is very desirable to develop intimate association with the German and Russian people. We are told that the Latin races of Europe present a favourable field for propaganda. France, Italy, Spain and Portugal are mentioned. Even Scandinavia is not forgotten, being important neutral soil. We are told, again, that the need of the hour is to link India up with other countries suffering under like imperialistic exploitation. We are asssured that the hope of India is a federated Asia rising against Western domination. This change of attitude in regard to foreign propaganda had naturally its echo in the proceedings of the All- India Congress Committee where foreign affairs dominated the atmosphere, and many resolutions were adopted calculated to form a basis for international friendships.
 It would be narrow-mindedness, indeed, and show us to be lacking the spirit of culture and humanity to refuse to have dealings with other nations if we were better circumstanced. But what would be civilization and culture and broad-mindedness under favourable circumstances would bee mere helplessness under existing conditions and would lead to nothing beneficial. Friendship with other nations can grow and be beneficial only if as in personal friendships it is not cultivated on the  mere  expectation of advantages, all on one side. If we seek honourable friendship with others there must be something for us to give them while we seek something from them. If we are in effect truly unable to help others and only ask for something at their hands it would not conduce mutual esteem; nor can a healthy alliance grow. If we are able really to help others, it must be by a supreme effort of national assertion which can and must, if well directed, produce far more marked results at home. The
 
 nations, whose friendship we go to  woo, must find something to learn or something  to gain from close association with us. If we have going on amidst us some movement of dynamic value, some revolutionary effort or some great constructive activity worthy of copy or study on others’ part, we would be seeking friendship on honourable, if not equal, terms. But we cannot be ever living either on the capital of our ancient culture or on the history of the Gandhian movement.
 The link of mere friendship of slavery is not likely to be a real or useful bond. Why do we turn to Russia, China or Turkey? It is to simply the greatness of the past history of these nations that attracts us. If that alone were offered we would hardly be interested. But it is because we believe that there are great movements now going on  in those countries which furnish matter for useful study or admiring observation, that some of our people go to those countries. Similarly if we seek international friendship with such nations, we should have something to offer to them of value. Otherwise we would only be beggars and should expect to be treated no better.
 But then, it may be said, this is to ignore world politics. There are wars coming on. The nations of the world are ever seeking to subvert one another’s plans, and India is an important piece on the board. We are not so helpless internationally as we may be internally in our own affairs. This needs clearing up and plain talking. Are we in for a war and the formation of alliances with those likely to fight England, or do we expect other countries to go to war over us? If the powers abroad go to war, they do it with gunpowder and ships. Are we ever likely usefull to participate as a nation in such war? Is it contemplated that India and other slave nations in the East may enter into a treaty, some time in the future, to rise in revolt helping each other against the common foe? Is India to expect, under  any  contingency arising in a world war, to render active assistance to a belligerent power against England? What, to put only one argument, is the chance of our  ever  achieving anything in this way? Is it practical politics of the remotest  kind, disarmed as we are?
 We do not want arms, it may said: we can do a great deal by passive resistance. The only weapon in our hand is non-co-operation with the British Government during a war or peace. Here we come back to the old position. The Indian fight against England if it is to be by non-violent means depends entirely on its own strength and can never be converted into an international affair. In a non-violent struggle it is not easy, if at all possible, to obtain any material help from abroad It must be conceived and organized and fought only on a basis of complete self-reliance.
 Non-material moral help we can get from foreign countries. This we shall do not by any propaganda, foreign or domestic, but exactly in the measure that we do solid constructive work and develop internal strength.

REGARDING INTRODUCTION OF 	FAMILIES, THE NUMBER OF ENTRANTS BEFORE 1914 STILL WITHOUT 	FAMILIES MUST BE SMALL. 	NOR IS THERE 	GOOD REASON WHY IF 	FRAUDULENT ENTRANTS AFTER 	1914 REMAIN WITHOUT FAMILIES, 	THOSE BEFORE 	1914 SHOULD BE EXEMPTED FROM THAT  DESIRABILITY.  DEPARTMENT  ASK 	WHY FRAUDULENT ENTRANTS 	IN NATAL 	AND CAPE 	BEFORE 1914 	SHOULD BE 	TREATED WORSE THAN 	SIMILAR PEOPLE IN  	TRANSVAAL.

BY EXPRESS  	PROVISION  PARTIES  ARE 	ALLOWED TO 	RETAIN THESE DOCUMENTS. 	TRUE THAT PROTECTION 
 CERTIFICATES WILL COME UNDER REGULATION UNDER SECTION 25 IMMIGRATION ACT  1913  WHICH  SANCTIONS  TEMPORARY  PERMITS.

DEPARTMENT CONTEND THAT THIS PROVISION MAKES THE CERTIFICATES PERMANENT IN REALITY. QUESTION OF FORM OF CERTIFICATE IS STILL UNDER DISCUSSION AND I HOPE TO GET SATISFACTION  FROM  DEPARTMENT  IN  CASE  LEGAL  OPINION  IS  ADVERSE  TO  PRESENT  FORM.  I HAVE POSTED LONG MEMORANDUM. PLEASE SUSPEND JUDGMENT UNTIL YOU READ IT. I AM UNABLE TO SEE HOW RESULTS OF PASSIVE RESISTANCE STRUGGLE ARE NULLIFIED BY PRESENT CONDONATION SCHEME. PLEASE POST COPY OF THIS CABLE TO  SIR  MAHOMED  HABIBULLAH.  ALSO  OF  SAIC’S  CABLE TO YOU AND THE CABLES BETWEEN YOU AND ME.
