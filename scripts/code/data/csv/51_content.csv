1,"January 5, 1931",LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI,"
          CHI. 	NARANDAS,     8 	p.m., January 1/6, 1931 
  	This week, too, I have not received your packet so far. It must have 	been posted as unregistered parcel and, if so, I shall probably get 	it tomorrow. But I started writing the Ashram letters today, or 	rather yes-terday.  	I had a letter last time from Danibehn from Bombay. My reply to her 	is enclosed. She is from Marwar, it seems. If you know, inform me 	whether that is so. I have given her address in the letter itself, 	thinking that you may not have it with you. Last week there were a 	few remarks in pencil by way of criticism of Anasakatiyoga by 	a Maratha friend; the remarks were unsigned. If you remember the 	name, let me know it.  	We were both weighed today. My weight came to 100 and Pyare-lal’s 	to 122. I have lost a pound; it is not worth taking note of. The 	wei-ght may increase or decrease by a pound or two even if the time 	of weigh-ing changes or according as one is weighed before or after 	passing stool. If a person gets himself weighed immediately after 	drinking water, his weight will be found to have increased. If he 	gets himself weighed after passing urine, there will be 	corresponding decrease in his weight. So long as I myself feel quite 	fit, pass stool without difficulty, have an appetite and eat well, 	there is no reason at all for concern. If I can carry on like this 	for six months, the experiment will have succeeded. I have made an 	inportant change, which I describe here for those of you who may be 	interested to know about it.  	Almonds are soaked in hot water and the peel is removed. They are 	then crushed into a paste. This is mixed with four ounces of water 	and the mixture is boiled till the water evaporates and a 	butter-like jelly is left behind. I eat it with vegetables. It not 	only tastes good but seems to be more easily digested than almond 	paste not boiled in water. It is possible that, even if the almonds 	are crushed into very fine paste but the latter is not boiled in 	water, the stuff remains undigested and passes out with stool. But I 	have no doubt that the jelly which I eat is digested. Even a person 	with very delicate stomach may be able to digest almonds cooked in 	this manner. The jelly may again be mixed with water and turned into 	milk. It will, of course, have no 
 taste. One can add a little jaggery or sugar, or even lime juice and salt, to the liquid. I don’t advise anyone just now to make this experiment. But the information which I have given may perhaps be useful to anyone who is interested in making such experiments or cannot digest milk. Apart from this change, my diet remains what it was. The quantity, too, remains unchanged.
 I hope to reach very high speed on the Gandiv spinning-wheel. I had never been able to reach 200, let alone 255, per hour before now. On the takli I have not been able to go beyond 75-80 rounds.  I cannot spin even 75 comfortable. I spin about 60 comfortably. But I can say that my hand has now set well on a bamboo takli. It still seems a hard task for me to spin 100 rounds.
 2 o’clock, Saturday
 I got your packet yesterday. Since it was a parcel and they do not carry packets during holidays, two days were wasted. But I see that it cost you only three annas to send the packet as a parcel, whereas, if it had been sent as a letter, the postage would possibly come to as much as a rupee. You may, therefore, follow whichever method you think right. I have mentally reconciled myself to getting the packet on Fridays and adjusted my programme accordingly. Here they are very careful in handing over the packet immediately to me after examining its contents. They are equally careful in dispatching the packets from here.
 Who is Palibehn? Her question is the same as Premabehn’s. I need not, therefore, write separately to her. Send her a copy of my letter to Premabehn, or show it to her if she is in the Ashram.
 As regards printing extracts from my letter, what I have written about yajna can certainly be given below Chapter II. Any other portions which seem useful can also be printed. But where and in what manner is for you to decide. You can include such material in the Gitabodh in footnotes at relevant places or as  independent extracts.
 Keep the Doctor informed about Ratilal and deal with the latter tactfully so that he may keep to the right path. Look upon him as an animal, uncultured and enslaved by passion. When he is overcome by passion, he goes mad. There are many kinds of passion; Ratilal is enslaved by three: for sex, for eating and for spending money extra- vagantly. He becomes when these passions are not satisfied. Running away from the Ashram has a beneficial effect on him  in  some measure. He calms down after a few days. God alone knows how he will end up. Sometimes such persons even attain  jnana.  He  is certainly not wholly wicked.
 The quantity of spinning which you are able to do seems much indeed to me. One can do with the left hand any work which the right hand does. Bhau can spin on the takli equally well with either hand.
 It will not be bad if Kanu goes to Wardha and learns Bhau’s skill, and also gets some experience of the place. If there is any other boy, besides Kanu, who can and wishes to go, I see no harm  in  sending him.
 Your body seems to have changed altogether. Personally, I am confident that ultimately it will become purer in its functioning.
 Will not Parnekar leave the Ashram for a while and go somewhere else to improve his health?
 The fact that the bull was brought back and the manner of its being found were a miracle indeed.
 Do you follow our method or some other method in preparing mava from milk? Do you experience any difficulty in selling it? If that is so, you may write to Ghanshyamdas, Mahavirprasad, Jivanlal and others and they will probably buy it up. If you can supply it regularly, even an advertisement in a newspaper will help.
 Do not give up walking. It is a practice worth clinging to at any cost. If you follow fixed rules in your work, you can include many things in the day’s programme.
 Devdas had written a letter to me; what has been done in regard to it? I have requested that he should recall the contents of the letter and write again to me. I have received no reply to this.
 6.45 p.m., Monday, January 5, 1931
 I have acknowledged having received the leather for sandals. The address of the lady to whom letter No. 82 is addressed is known to Ramnarayanlibtech_1_footnote(of  Ajmer).   If  you  send  the  letter  to  Martand  of somebody else, he will post it.
 Read my letter to Kashinath. I need not add to what I have written in it.
 Jivandas is in Sabarmati Jail. Does anyone visit him? If not, some-body should go and visit him. Tell him that I often remember him.

I started this letter on the first and I described the position with
 regard to my experiment in diet as it was on that day. I had a feeling of indigestion on Saturday night and on Sunday diarrhoea started. But this time I suffered no pain at all. There was no griping even. There were frequent motions. They continued even yesterday, but the number was less. I am writing this at 5 a.m., after prayer. I think the motions will be much fewer today. My work was not interrupted in any way. Yesterday I sat up for exactly ten and a half hours and finished all the work. This time there were a good number of other letters too. Of course eating has been stopped.  The  cause  of  diarrhoea seems to be jowar and bajra. I shall know it by and by. I have not decided how to resume eating. There is no cause at all for worry. I have informed you because I thought I must. At present I take lime juice with jaggery and soda bicarb. I will write again tomorrow.

 12 Noon, Wednesday, January [7]libtech_2_footnote1931
 CHI. NARANDAS,
 You must have received the packet dispatched yesterday. Today  I feel better. I started with diluted curds yesterday. Today I ate raisins and a little quantity, twice, of crushed, cooked almonds. These is no complaint about stools. That is, after 4 in the morning, I have felt no call. Don’t worry at all. Ba and Mirabehn must not worry. I will drop a postcard again tomorrow. I am able to do all my work.

 CHI. KASHINATH,
 
 I have your letter. What you say about Shanta is correct. Kuhne baths cannot but benefit her.
 I have written about Mother in my previous letters. Has she really given up the traditional notions of pollution? I have had no letter from Mama.
 I have read Babu Bhagwandas’s article. He has suggested the first two remedies ironically to show their impossibility. He believes in the third one. I have thought much about the problem and written about it and suggested every remedy I could. I don’t think unity will be brought about through artificial means. If either we or they display pure love, the problem would be solved immediately. It is difficult to say definitely in what form such love will express itself. What you say about the Maulana Saheb is correct. There is no doubt about his patriotism. He said what he believed. Even if we think someone’s views to be erroneous, how can we blame him for holding those views? It is on such occasions that tolerance is required. Leva Patidars in Gujarat do observe the purdah.  It is observed among other communities, too, in Kathiawar.

  	Yes, purdah is observed here and there in Gu[jarat] too. 	After all Gu[jarat] is a part of India! Hirabehn is in a pitiable 	plight.

  	Your letter. Your reply to Jairamdas is correct. But now that 	Vidya’s people will not take back the money, the immediate problem 	is solved. Your idea to treat it as a gift to the nation is quite 	good. The right course now is so to shape and simplify your life 	that you will not henceforth have to fall back upon either father 	for pecuniary help. For the past you need not think of returning 	debt to the nation in coin but return it in kind, i. e., through 	your joint labour. And when you dedicate yourselves wholly to the 	nation you have repaid the debt. Is this clear?  	There is no question of being physically near me whilst you are out. 	If you become a prisoner again, even then there is only a remote 	possibility. Your satisfaction must be derived from serving not me 	personally but what I stand for. Love 	to both of you.

I am writing this after the midday 	meal. I had a normal motion. In the morning I took almond paste 	mixed with water and dates. Just now, I had fenugreek leaves, liquid 	curds and dates. The diet tomorrow, God will decide. There is no 	cause for worry. The weight is bound to go down after four days of 	fasting. It came to 96. If things go well tomorrow, I shall recover 	some of the lost weight during the next week. Tell Mirabehn that I 	got yesterday the card she posted on Tuesday. I got your packet only 	today.

The grammar which you have sent will be useful to him. The Gita is not required. We have a good many editions here. You will know about my health from the general letter. Pyarelal’s is good.

 You should have no objection to drinking tea as a medicine. Bear the harmful effect which it may have. After all, one must learn to live with a delicate body. There would be pride or obstinacy in not taking tea even if it is necessary for one’s health. One must be humble and take it, as I take dates.
 Shirshasana can certainly be done in the presence of others. Why should a woman mind doing so, since she will have tucked up her skirt!
 Do not worry about me at all. It had become a religious duty to give up papaya. Giving it up has done me no harm. Friends can help each other best by practising self-denial in their own person.
 Are there any quarrels among the women inmates of the Ash- ram? There was a hint about them in Kalavati’s letter. I would not be surprised if that is so. We have not become perfect. As we strive to become so, we shall stumble and fall and rise again.

 You just cannot leave Sumitra alone. It will suffice it you do whatever work of public service you can, keeping her with you. It  should be enough for you that Ramdas has gone back to jail. I think all the requirements will be satisfied if you stay on in Vijapur. The atmosphere there is good for Sumitra and also you can do a lot of service from there.
If Sumitra’s nose continues to run, it probably means that she

  	I got your letter. I could once say which verse in the Gita I 	liked most. It was the one beginning, “The impressions of senses, 	O son of Kunti.” Today I cannot be positive about it. Different 	verses appeal at different times according to the state of mind at 	the moment. I feel no interest now in deciding which I like most. 	The entire Gita is dear to me. She is the mother. If anyone 	asks a child which limb of its mother is dear to it, the question 	would be meaningless. That is how I feel in regard to the Gita.  	It was quite cold here for two or three days. It is no longer so 	now. Probably that is because of the wall on the four sides. Of 	course both of us sleep in the open.  	Cannot Kashinath teach Hindi because he has left the Ashram? 	Dharmakumar  should  be   treated  for  his  cough  without  delay. And 	Nayan too.  I remember Kamalabehn.  Send my blessings to her.  I understand 	what you say about Dhiru.

         DEAR 	SISTER,     January 	11, 1931 
  	You seem to be very greedy. Where is the need to write long letters 	from here? You can write long ones. I can write long ones if I write 	about my speeches to the birds and the talks in silence with the 	stars. But how can I expose to the human race my lectures delivered 	to the birds? And my talks with the stars are after all secret. 	Hence I can write only short letters but must receive long ones from 	you. Perhaps they may not pass on to me the cutting carrying your 	speech. But don’t I know what you would say? I am glad you went to 	 see the Ashram.  Blessings from  MOHANDAS  From 	a photostat of the Gujarati : S.N. 116

31,"January 11, 1931",LETTER TO CHANDRAKANTA,"
  
 January 11, 1931
 
CHI. CHANDRAKANTA,
 It is now 5 o’clock in  the  morning.  It  is  all  right that  you wrote a long letter. I think it is your duty to go to your parents once for  a fixed period. It will be better if you go there to improve your health or after you have recovered. It is necessary to take Ganga-behn’s permission. If there is much pending work there, it would be better to go after finishing it. That will also be the way to save Brother from further reproaches. Your going will appease your parents’ anger. After all, are they not Sumangal’s elders too? We should put up with our elders’ anger and even their hostility. As your manner and behaviour towards them increase in humility, they will gradually calm down.
 As for your expenses, you should accept the money from them as long as they are willing and in a position to send it. But you should assure them and yourself that you can earn your expenses. You should now consider yourself a daughter of the Ashram. You may rest assured that you will be able to earn your livelihood even outside should such a necessity arise.
 I know that you still have a craving for literary knowledge. You may increase it as and when you get opportunities for it. But do not think that those who have more of literary knowledge serve better. The
 capacity for service depends solely on selflessness and character. How much service Gangabehn renders! And what is her store of literary knowledge—or Mithubehn’s, or Laxmidas’s, or Imam Saheb’s? If you go over such examples from present and ancient times, you will at once see the truth of what I am saying. On the other hand, there are hundreds of highly educated persons in the country. They lack either the ability or the will to make sacrifices, and therefore they live useless lives, if they are not actually a burden on others. All this argument certainly does not mean that I am against that type of knowledge, or that there is nothing more for you to acquire. Do increase your fund of knowledge when you get an oppor-tunity. But consider the present as a time to gain experience, to serve, and therefore, while cherishing the desire  to increase your knowledge, restrain it just now and cheerfully devote yourself to service.
 It was natural that Mother’s grief made you feel unhappy and you cried. But we do wish to train ourselves to control such crying too. Mother’s grief sprang from ignorant attachment.
 About your having been tempted to eat chillies it is not so much that you did something wrong, but that you weakened in your resolve and were therefore guilty of a lapse. We should never depart from our resolutions in matters big or small. But don’t worry. Forget the lapse and start again. No point now remains unanswered.
 Blessings from
 BAPU
[PS.]
I have destroyed your letter to respect your wish. Pyarelal has not
 read it. But you must give up being so sensitive. Let the world know all about us, good or bad. I have no secrets from Pyarelal. How can I have any ?

  	I received your letter. Your diet is all right. Be very careful how 	you behave towards Parvati. Never be alone with her and never allow 	impure feelings to come anywhere near you.

33,"January 12, 1931",LETTER TO MIRABEHN,"
         CHI. 	MIRA,     January 	7/12, 1931 
  	Though the Ashram post has not yet been received as it gene-rally 	is, in order to avoid pressure on my time I commence the letters 	now. Here is the fourth verselibtech_10_footnote:  	“O Goddess Earth, with the ocean for thy garment, mountains for 	thy breasts, thou consort of Vishnu (Preserver), I bow to thee; 	for-give the touch of my feet.”  	Bowing to the earth we learn or ought to learn t o be humble even as 	the earth is humble. She supports the beings that tread upon her. 	She is therefore rightly the consort of Vishnu. This conception in 	my opinion does no violence to truth. On the contrary it is beauti- 	ful and is wholly consistent with the idea that God is everywhere. 	There is nothing inanimate for Him. We are of the earth earthy. If 	earth is not, we are not. I feel nearer God by feeling Him through 	the earth. In bowing to the earth, I at once realize my indebtedness 	to Him and if I am a worthy child of that Mother, I shall at once 	reduce myself to dust and rejoice in establishing kinship with not 	only the lowliest of human beings, but also with lowest forms of 	creation whose    
 fate—reduction to dust—I have to share with them. And if considered as mere life without the earthy tabernacle, I regard myself as imperishable, the lowest form of creation is just as imperishable as my soul is.
This attack of diarrhoea is   a positive blessing   for  me.	It  has
 caused no pain, meant no interruption of my work. And it has taught me lessons. I feel a greedy eater. The bajari and juwari are new foods for me. I should have taken them sparingly and omitted them occasionally. Even one bhakhari per day was evidently too much for me. But I did not do it. I thought I would make up for lost weight quickly. I know no such thing as full satisfaction of hunger no matter how much I eat, i.e., within my limitations. I always rise with an empty stomach. I therefore learn my mistake after the event. And then everything practically is tasty for me. I went to bajari and juwari for feeling tangibly akin to the fellow- prisoners. But for  me  these bhakharis had a definitely pleasant taste. In these mixed circums-tances to practise not only moderation but spare eating is a difficult performance. An occasional fast and at least once per month is a good thing it seems even for light weight people. But I seem to have will control over this crisis, if it can be so called. I am not interrupting the experiment altogether but shall modify it from time to time as may be found necessary. I took curds, as you know, yesterday. Feeling quite well at 11 o’clock I took finely powdered twice cooked almonds and soaked raisins. This is how matters stand today (Wednesday). This will be posted six days after. You will have further developments either through this letter or through the general letter. I give you these details to put you and others at ease. The knowledge that the slightest derangement in my health upsets you all causes me more anxiety than the derangement itself. Complete abandonment of dietetic experiment will be for me the worst evil. It is part of my search.  But the evil is not  in the experiment, the evil is in me. I have not learnt the art of taking food as medicine pure and simple. That means complete mastery over the palate. I am far from it still. I believe that if I acquire it, the giving up of milk will be an easy job. That it is not a healthy human being’s food I have not a shadow of a doubt. In health, I have lived without it for six years. Through my folly that health was under-mined. To undo the effect of that folly, instead of paying with my life for it, I went to milk always hoping to struggle out of it again. The struggle must continue. Every defeat humbles me, chastens me and opens up newer outlooks.  The  urge  for  struggle  becomes  intenser  with   defeat.   The
 continuance gives one peace. Col. Steele the Civil Surgeon who comes to see me every fortnight and Major Martin came today. Their first remark was that I was looking exceptionally well. And this after practically three days’ fast! And they were right. I am not feeling any the worse for the ‘crisis’. Then and in any case be careful for nothing.
 January 12, 1931 I take up the letter where I left it on 7th. I seem to feel quite all right. The bowels are again quite regular. My food  is  almond  paste
dissolved in water and dates in the morning, curds and dates at noon,
 dissolved almond paste and dates in the evening. Hot water lemon and salt 7.30 a.m. Cold water lemon and soda 1.30 p.m. If all goes well and the bowels become constipated, I may take vegetables. So again there is nothing further to report. I would warn you against publishing anything about these interrup tions in health, as they will be magnified by the public and there will be unnecessary alarm and unwarranted reflections against the Government. In this case, at any rate, no blame of any kind can be cast on them.
 I have your letter and the postcard. Let us thank God that Rolland is quite out of the wood. The world needs him for many years yet. His work, so far as we can see, is not finished. Please send him my loving regards and say he must hold on for a while. Premabehn has described to me the prayer you had for his recovery. I do not know that these prayers add a single second to the life prayed for. But they elevate those who pray and comfort those for whom the prayers are offered. The comfort has the appearance of prolongation of life.
 I finished the translation of the preface two days ago and have taken  up nothing  further.  But I feel like taking up the original plan.  I am likely to come to a decision tomorrow, after the Ashram post is finished.
 Having taken up the news-sheet, you will give up  the formal editor ship if it can be without any disturbance. Not to take up a service is wisdom, but it is folly to give it up afterwards unless it is found to be demonstrably immoral. Such is the general principle of ethics. Of the particular  application you and those who are outside  are the only judges. As to secrecy, there seems to be some confusion  of thought as expressed by you. If a butcher asks  me  in  which direction a cow is gone, I am in no way bound to disclose the
 information to him. I may not mislead him but nor may I lead him to where the cow is. Not only that, I may even hide away the cow. Indeed, it would be my duty to do so. From this instance one may shape one’s conduct in given circumstances.
Love.

 Monday Morning, January 12, 1931
 CHI. NARANDAS,
 This time I take up your letter last for replying. I have started writing after the evening prayer. You must have received the postcards I wrote including Saturday’s. After that, my health has remained all
 
 right. You will find details in my letter libtech_13_footnoteto Mirabehn. It contains something else, too, which will interest you. It is desirable that the news about my health should not spread outside.
 Though Mahadev’s name was in your list, I believe that you carry the impression that there was a letter by Mahadev because Chandra- shankar’s handwriting is very much like Mahadev’s. Was there really a letter by Mahadev in his own handwriting? If there was, what were its contents? Durga would certainly know. There has been no special letter about her health, so I believe that she is all right. You must have got the letter in which I made a suggestion about  her. Champa  recovered even the lost ring! All this seems a miracle. Perhaps this is how God protects the fools. Champa had said in her letter that they might all go to Rajkot for some time. She said that that was the advice she was given by Nanalal’s wife. If she wishes to go, I certainly like the idea. You must have thought about the matter independently and done what you thought proper, or you will do what you think proper. I don’t remember to have encouraged Parasram to hope that we might give him some help. If, however, his work is efficient and clean, I would certainly be tempted to help him. Before you do anything, consult Shankerlal and follow his advice. You can send to me the small box received from Polak. If it is of a kind which you think should be preserved carefully, keep it there or put it in the Gujarat Vidyapith museum. If you don’t think that necessary, you can send it to me through Trivedi. A lady from as far away as Canada had sent to me a bag containing about two pounds of salt. The authorities passed it on to me.
 Take careful measures and help Kusum to get rid of her fever. Consult a doctor, if necessary. Chandrashankar has discovered a Punjabi vaid. He will probably give you some ordinary medicine.  If you think  it worth while, inquire about him.
 Have a quiet talk with Bhagwanji and draw his attention to his shortcomings.
I let you off with this today.

Two conclusions can be  drawn from my  experiment.	Perhaps
 three. One of them is as good as proved. Two require to be tested further. Those who suffer from constipation should live for some days only on fenugreek leaves, tandalja, tanko and spinach. That is how I overcame my constipation. Pyarelal, too, seems to have overcome his. For the past four days he has been eating only fenugreek leaves. The jelly of almonds which I have described, besides being nourishing, is free from the defects of milk and so does not cause constipation. The rotlas of jowar and bajra seem to have a laxative effect on those who are not used to them. Ghee should not be taken during this experiment. All the vegetables should be merely boiled. But I cannot say that the experiment of jowar and bajra has proved successful. I do not think, either, that it has failed. If I have had to suspend it just now, it is in order that people there may not feel worried.libtech_14_footnote

 CHI. CHHAGANLAL,
 It is good that you sent me . . . ’slibtech_15_footnoteletter.  He also may write to me direct. I agree with you that he should discuss the whole matter with Kakasaheb.
As far as I have been able to understand the situation, it seems to
 
 me that he should make . . .libtech_16_footnotelibtech_17_footnotefree.   It is unlikely that she will marry again, but in her heart of hearts she will welcome her freedom. If even now she is leading an immoral life, . . . will not be able to reform her, just as he cannot reform any other woman like her. He should not mind what effect his action, right in itself, produces on society. He should get rid of the idea that she belongs to him. And if he sincerely repents having married a second time, he should regard . . .libtech_18_footnotelibtech_19_footnotepurely as a friend and live with her accordingly. But one cannot force oneself to act in such a manner. If he cannot live thus, he should humbly  live with . . .  as her husband, exercising as much self-control as he can. There are many other issues which arise from this, but I do not wish to discuss them here.
 The criticism about camps in your letter is a painful story. Truth and non-violence have not yet found a place in the hearts of people. They are accepted only as policy. Hence, even public workers have not realized that truth and non-violence in social life depend upon their practice by individuals, that is, upon self-purification by them. The Ashram was established to demonstrate the truth of this idea through actual practice. Our duty is to go on serving, unaffected by the atmosphere round us no matter how polluted it is. This is true about women workers too. All of them should be as strong as Khurshedbehn, who will never fall in any atmosphere however evil it may be. It is true that we have not yet reached this level. We have got this golden opportu-nity of testing our strength. Maybe some of us, both men and women, will receive burns in this ordeal. Let that be so, if it cannot be helped. If on the whole our effort in the Ashram is sincere, God will protect us. The prayer-song of the turtle and his wife is worth meditating over in this connection.
 The second part of your letter also is interesting. What can I say in reply? Work as hard as you can but not at the cost of your health. We ought to preserve good health, and not merely refrain from sacrificing the body unnecessarily.

PRABHUDAS,  	You are fortunate to have Vallabhdas’s company. Without being 	impatient, do what you can with readily available means. Cultivate, 	the attitude of detachment even while doing such good work. It was a 	wise statement of Raychandbhai based on his own experience  that  	one should cultivate equimindedness even in one’s striving for  	moksha. To say that I have been trying to invent a new model 	of spinning-wheel is an exaggeration, if not an untruth. I know my 	limitations fully well. I have  no skill at all for inventing a new 	model  of the spinning-wheel. What I am trying to do is to effect 	some improvements in the Gandiva model. But even in that, 	there is some element of imitation of the Jivanchakra model. 	Even  so,  the information you give me will help me in effecting 	even the modest improvement I am trying to bring about. I see some 	difficulty in adopting the ‘V’ shape pulley. The one I have, has 	a shape between that of ‘V’ and ‘U’.  I   have felt  no 	neces-sity at all for a ball bearing.  I therefore like its design. 	The takli will be a child’s play for you if you wish to try 	the experiment. But you may forget about it. The one object of your 	devoted effort is your spinning-wheel. 
 Rambhau’s foot must have got all right. Do not get tired of him. Be content with what he does. Keep reminding him of his duty and that too by mero hints. What ‘You’ or ‘I’ cannot do, ‘He’ will do. Who is this ‘He’ ? ‘He’ means ‘Time’ which has arisen to destroy the peopleslibtech_31_footnotelibtech_32_footnote. Their destruction includes destruction of their bad habits, too. Good habits even Time cannot destroy, for they are satlibtech_33_footnote. That which is sat,  can never cease to exist. But let us leave alone such learned talk. In Rambhau’s case, forbearance is the only remedy. These forces are operative in everyone’s life—the tendencies acquired in one’s previous existence, the present environment and one’s own effort. The answer to your question why two persons of opposite characters are found born in the same family, is that we do not know all the good and bad qualities in the characters of Panditji and Lakshmibehn and their forbears, and therefore do not have sufficient material to base our decision on. We should not even wish to have such knowledge. We will have sufficient explanation if we accept the law of karma.
 You are unnecessarily making yourself unhappy regarding Chandradutta. It is not incumbent on you to give up anything. If an ant aspires to kill an elephant, it is a form of pride. You were impelled by your nature to do some service to Chandradutta. He accepted from you what he could. You may write to him if you can do so gently but  at the same time intelligently. Otherwise give up the thought of even writing to him. “What you have written to me is not proper. If it is proper God will make me see my error. It is not right for you to do what an unhealthy man like me does. But since you no longer have  the loving faith in me, I cannot guide you. God will make somebody else the instrument of guiding you. Meanwhile you do what you think proper. God is looking after you and me. We are but perishable creatures.” Write to Chandradutta this or something to this effect and then stop thinking about him. If you have not followed what I have written, ask me to explain. Devdas’s interpretation of the verse ‘Tena Tyakten   Bhunjithah’libtech_34_footnotelibtech_35_footnotecan   by   analogy      be   applied   to   this   case. ‘Renounce it and then enjoy it’. So, we can enjoy all this that belongs to God, can we? From the point of view of grammar, the meaning I have given to the verse will appeal to those whose knowledge is
 
 imperfect. After all we are concerned with the spirit of the verse, and that is observed by both readings of the verse."

  	There is no cause for you to be scared. Man is shaped by 	difficulties. One need not therefore be scared of them. And if we do 	feel scared we should remember what the Gita says. It teaches 	us to be equi-minded in happiness and suffering, We should not get 	elated by happiness and depressed by suffering. And what reason do 	you have to feel unhappy ? It is all a matter of the mind. If a 	person who gets food to eat and water to drink and a place to live 	and sleep in feels unhappy it may be said that he does so only 	because he wishes to be unhappy. It is surprising that your cough 	still persists. Take only milk and papaya. Drink warm water with 	soda bicarb. Take deep breaths. Consult a doctor if necessary. You 	can engage yourself in service even there. He who spins and cards in 	the spirit of yajna does serve.  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	a photostat of the Gujarati: Chandrakanta Papers.

Even the habit of evacuating the bowels immediately upon 	rising can be acquired by and by. During winter you can begin 
 studies after taking some exercises. The primary thing is to acquire the habit of rising early. If we cannot be firm even in such a small matter, the capacity to carry an important job to its conclusion will be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve.

 With Narandas’s permission, you can send to people any extracts from my letters which you wish to.
 “Hero” means one worthy of reverence, a god, so to say. In the political field, Gokhale holds that place for me. The persons who have influenced my life as a whole in a general way are Tolstoy, Ruskin, Thoreau and Raychandbhai. Perhaps I should drop Thoreau from this list.
 Great men seem to be the cause of revolutions in the world. In truth the people themselves are the cause. Revolutions do not take place by accident but obey laws as rigid as the law governing  the motions of the planets. Only we do not know those laws and causes and, therefore, regard revolutions as accidents.

 January 17, 1931
 CHI. KASHINATH,
 I think the more important reasons for your decision  to  live outside the Ashram were your own wish to do so and the facilities which you would enjoy thereby. I too do not believe Narandas to be a perfect man. But I believe that his mistakes are unintentional, and that  he makes fewer mistakes than others would. I, therefore, think that we should put up with his method of running the Ashram. You may take your own time to return to the Ashram, but if you really had  no  objection to showing your diary, you should show it even now, and ask to be admitted to the Ashram when you wish and are ready to go there. I have not been able to understand why the teaching of Hindi at the Ashram was discontinued. Did Narandas forbid it, or did you yourself stop teaching?
 I am glad that your father has joined you. But you should continue to maintain a firm attitude. I have no doubt that, no matter
 
 how much he insists, you should prevent her from going. I, however, hope that in the present circumstances she will not wish to go. If that man decides to marry again, we need not object.
 It seems that Mother’s health is improving. It will get even better  if she observes the restrictions on diet, remains in the open air and takes other precautions.
 I was satisfied with Kalavati’s answer. Just now at any rate she seems to be progressing.
 I know Gadreji. I have carefully gone through the extract quo-ted by you. I felt that it showed more emotion than calm reflection. It attributes to me something that I have never held or said. I have never asserted that the Pandavas, Krishna and other  characters  are  not historical persons. My view is that, though all of them might be historical persons, the Mahabharata is not a work of history in the modern sense of the term. Caesar, John, Henry, etc., were historical kings, but we know that Shakespeare’s plays named after them are not works of history. He used historical events and characters for his dramatic purpose in the plays. Further, I never thought or said that the Gita was composed for expound-ing non-violence. On the contrary, I have believed and have said, that at the time of the Gita, war  was  accepted as normal, though they believed in the dharma of non- violence. Nevertheless, I believe that the teaching of the Gita does not justify war, even if the author of the Gita had intended otherwise. I hold that physical warfare, armed warfare can never be non-violent. Those who perform animal sacrifice may, and do, say that belief in non- violence does not forbid such sacrifice. But whatever they say, animal sacrifice is a violence. And this also is true about armed warfare. To regard it as a necessity and not subject to the general rule, and then to regard it as sanctioned by religion is one thing, but it is quite another to say that it is non-violent. I feel that Gadreji’s article suffers from looseness and confusion of thought. Being a prisoner, I cannot make a public reply, but it is open to you to send my reply to Gadreji for his information.

        CHI. 	MIRA,     January 	14/18, 1931 
  	Again I commence the Ashram letters with yours and that just after 	the morning prayer.  	The 5th verselibtech_38_footnoteis 	: “May the Goddess Saraswati (of learning) the Destroyer 	completely of black ignorance, protect me, she who is white as the 	mogra flower, the moon and a garland of snow, who has worn 	white robes, whose hands are adorned with the beautiful bamboo of 	her veena (a kind of violin), who is seated on a white lotus 	and who is always adored by Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva and the other 	gods.”  January 18, 1931 To me the 	thought here is very beautiful. Learning of course means wisdom.	The 	emphasis on threefold whiteness-that of snow, moon, f lower-and the 	white dress and white seat is intended to show that uttermost purity 	is an indispensable part of wisdom or learning. As you explore the 	deeper meaning of these and kindred verses, you will find every 	virtue personified and made a living reality instead of a dead 	diction ary word. These imaginary gods are more real than the 	socalled real things we perceive with our five senses. When I recite 	this verse, for instance, I never think that I am addressing an 	imaginary     
 picture. The recitation is a mystical act. That when I analyse the act intellectually, I know that the goddess is an imaginary being, does not in any way affect the value of the recitation at prayer time. If all this is not clear to you, you must unhesitatingly tax me.
 So you are to be travelling again. I can only say ‘do not over-do it, do not strain yourself endurance.’
 I telegraphed about Surendralibtech_39_footnotelibtech_40_footnote. He must have given up his fast. For me, I am quite right. I have not yet gone back to vegetables or bread. Almonds, dates and a little milk or curds and lemons seem to keep me perfectly fit. To be able to keep standing at the takli for nearly two hours is not a bad feat for me and I sit at the wheel for nearly two  hours without any support to the back. Add to that nearly 45 minutes for carding and sliver making.

  	I hope that your experiment of eating oranges is going on. I also 	suppose that you are taking enemas regularly. The belching must 	stop. If you suffer from headaches, you may apply mud packs to the 	head.  	Tell Mahadev that I have not seen Hill’s translation of the Gita. 	I have written to Kaka and asked him to suggest any changes that he 	may wish to in Anasaktiyoga and ask me any question he may 	want in regard to it. I shall be glad if he does. I send to Mirabehn 	the transl-ation of one bhajan every week. If it is decided 	in future to publish them, Mahadev will certainly see them. Even 	otherwise, you may get the translations from Mirabehn. I have got 	with me translations of all bhajans except the Bengali ones. 	It would be a fine thing if Devdas turns out a Sanskrit scholar. It 	would be good if he improves his Urdu too. If Mahadev has not read 	what Mathuradas has written on the carding-bow, he should do so. It 	is necessary to make this science as exact, and introduce as much 	art in it, as possible. My love for the spinning-wheel increases as 	I take more and more interest in it. The    
 spinning-wheel means all the processes through which cotton passes. God is no doubt the sole help of the poor, but the spinning-wheel is His hands and feet, and, the poor man or woman who holds it holds God. We may not be able to live on simple fare as the poor do, but we ought to ply the spinning-wheel for their sake. And to ply the spinning-wheel means to examine its infinite capacity and reveal it to the world. This is  a study of no ordinary value. And to pursue it means  to  live  the teaching of the Gita. I need not say all this to Mahadev, but, at this hour of prayer, these deeper sentiments of my heart come out spontaneously as I think of him. Perhaps I would not be able to express them before others in the same manner.

 8 p.m., January 14/19, 1931
 CHI. NARANDAS,
 I got the post today at 8 in the morning. I found on the cover stamps worth eleven annas. On the packet, the stamps used to be three annas worth. I don’t feel, however, that paying the extra eight annas every time will be an extravagance.  This  time  at  any  rate  I  didn’t  feel that it was so, for your letter contained news of Surendra’s fast and I could send a wire to you to persuade him to give it up. These days the officials here are careful about the post received from and addressed to the Ashram. At both ends, therefore, we are likely to receive it regularly.
 Inform Surendra. Show this to Nathji or write to him. I see igno- rance and impatience in Surendra’s step. The ignorance is on two counts. There is ignorance in the belief that, when imprisoned, one is prevented from doing work of service and, secondly, in the belief that one does service by giving up one’s life in this manner. The duty of everyone in Surendra’s circumstances is to preserve his body carefully and use it for service. In jail one can spin and weave and do many other kinds of productive work. Upright conduct will have its effect on the masses. That is also part of service. I see cowardice and lack of understanding in ending one’s life by fasting. Surendra’s motive is noble, but the good-ness of the motive does not by itself condone the intrinsic badness of an action. Considered from every point of view, therefore, Surendra’s action 102 in embarking on a fast was blameworthy. Obtain Nathji’s opinion and let me know what he thinks. If Surendra has anything to say in defence of his action, let him. I don’t wish to suggest that one may not give up one’s life in any circumstances. All that I mean is that Surendra’s circumstances are not such as will justify his doing so.
 Madhavji has decided to follow my example in experimenting with jowar and bajra. Dissuade him from doing so. For one thing, my experiment, cannot be considered to have succeeded. Even if it is so considered, an experiment of this kind should not be imitated  too hastily. Milk and dates have agreed with him, and let him cling to them. I may say that I have earned the right to make experiments and play with my body after many years’ practice till it has become
 accustomed to such experiments. This can be said about few others. Moreover, this is not the time for such experiments.
 Let us not shed tears over your not having received my postcards regularly. After all, am I not a prisoner? What facilities are given should be accepted as a kindness. I have no complaint to make about my health now. At present my diet consists of dates, almonds, curds and lime juice. I am watching the effects of these. I do not take more than ten tolas of curds, whether in liquid or semi-liquid form. I take them only once. I don’t think I can digest more just now.  The total number of almonds at two meals comes to forty, and that of dates, at three meals, to seventy. I will not increase the number for some time. Perhaps I may reduce it. I am proceeding cautiously. This quantity of food contains plenty of ener-gy. It is yet six days before this letter will be posted. If I make any changes during this period, I will write about them. There is not the slightest cause for worry. The almonds are first soaked in water and peeled, they are then roasted and crushed into a jelly. I follow this method in order to save time. The other method of crushing the almonds without roasting them and then boiling the paste in water is of course an excellent one.
 We should realize that we can never do our yajna work too methodically. The  vigilance  which  we  exercise  in  such work  will keep us vigilant in all other matters, provided of course we are sincere at heart.
 If even now Keshu calms down and devotes himself to work, I will not believe that he has wasted his time so far. You took a very good step indeed.
 Tell Devdas that I agree with what he says. I would be ashamed to be released on the ground of illness. I would rather prefer to take milk and  curds and  preserve  my   health.That   is   actually   what  I am doing. The primary aim of my experiment  is  to  keep up my health here by exercising self-restraint. The experiment was started entirely for the sake of health, but, since it also satisfied my cons-cience, a spiritual motive has entered it.
 Do what is necessary to settle the affair of Nanibehn and Budha- bhai. When you think it necessary that I should write to anyone in the matter, let me know.
 Tell Sarja that I regard her as very fortunate. She should now pick up great courage and go forth and make good use  of every moment of her time.
Mathew should not be permitted to use the name of the Ashram
 for working outside. In any case he cannot be paid money for doing so. If he can, he may do some teaching work in the Ashram or the Vidyapith. But shouldn’t he first acquire sufficient proficiency in spinning, carding, etc., and obtain a certificate? And in Hindi, too? Till he has done this, he cannot be entrusted with responsibility for outside work. I will write to him also to this effect.
 I suppose Mirabehn’s paper has closed down completely. Did she issue any statement or let the public merely guess as much? What about the money received from people? Who was, or is, in charge of the financial affairs?
 Be firm in dealing with Sarojinidevi. If Padma herself wants to leave, I think it would be best to let her go. You should tell her plainly that if, after leaving once, she wants to return, you will have to consider then whether to re-admit her. If the mother or the daughter or both leave, they should understand just now that they will be leaving for ever.
 Ask Devdas to send my compliments to Lala Hansraj and tell him that every thread which he spins brings swaraj nearer. I hope that he will excel me in speed.
 Night, January 18, 1931
 Read my letter to Sarojinidevi. If she has calmed down and if you fear that she will be upset again by my letter, do not give it to her. There was a complaint in one of the letters (I forget whose) that the children have again started playing mischief among themselves and making noise at prayer meetings. Please look into the matter if there is any substance in this complaint.
 Night, January 19, 1931
 Prabhavati’s husband has gone  to  Delhi  and  may,  therefore, send for some inmate of  the  Ashram.  If  he  does  so,  send some-  one immediately to bring her to the Ashram. If she recovers, we shall have earned the merit of saving a cow from the slaughter-house. My health has remained very good. I continue the same diet and in the same quantity.

72,"January 20, 1931","COMMENTS ON GALLEY-PROOFS OF “HOW TO COMPETE WITH FOREIGN
	CLOTH” libtech_46_footnote","
  
 YERAVDA MANDIR,
 POONA,
 January 20, 1931 I have gone through the pages of your book in the form of proofs. You have presented some good statistics  in   the   book.  The
information given about mills is more than that of handlooms.
 After reading it, I feel that “How to compete with  Foreign Cloth” will be more appropriate as its name.
 You have not referred very minutely to the importance of hand-spinning in the achievement of boycott of foreign cloth. If you are convinced that hand-spinning is the master key, you ought to present that fact clearly. It is my growing conviction that a permanent boycott of foreign cloth is impossible without hand-spinning, and without hand-spinning, it is difficult for hand-weaving to exist. If you agree with this opinion, you must make this very clear. In spite of my partiality for hand-spinning I do not agree with the contention of Mr. Talcherkar that machine-spun yarn is weaker than hand-spun yarn. I consider this claim of superiority of hand-spun yarn unfounded and it is unproved by experience. But what does it matter? The machine-made bread, in spite of its being more round, smooth and attractive than hand-made bread, will always be considered unacceptable when compared to the hand-made bread.
 I visualise some difficulty in sending back your letter. You are at one with me in regard to hand-spinning. Therefore, what more can I wish? Make this point as clear as you can.
 Mills and handlooms are mutually antagonistic. Mills do have a place the national economy of India will surely continue for many
 
 book, vide “Preface to Pardeshi Kapadni same harifai kem karavi”, 25-2-1931.
 
 years to come, perhaps they may live for ever. My contention is that those who understand should not argue that they are mutually helpful. Mills are independent. They do get help from Swadeshi movement, and they should get it, but in saying that both handlooms and mills deserve help, the handlooms get less help.
 The import of artificial silk deserve to be objected to at all times. I personally believe that we can take necessary raw cotton from  other countries, but at the moment, I would not bother about
elaborating on this matter.
 What you have suggested for protection to  hand-weaving  is quite proper. Regarding the name of the book, I still feel that what I have suggested will be better. But you may keep whatever name you like.libtech_47_footnote

73,"January 	20, 1931",LETTER TO E. E. DOYLE,"
       January 	20, 1931  DEAR 	MAJOR DOYLE,  	I thank you for your prompt reply. The Times of India’s 	latest report says that Sjt. Appasaheb Patwardhan commenced his 	fast on 10th instant.  I know that he has not superfluous flesh on 	him and it is  a matter of great anxiety to me to feel that he may 	be still fasting. Could you please ascertain how he is doing and let 	me know also whether permission has been granted him to spin.  	Your reply raises what is to me a very big question. You call the 	labour of spinning a privilege. But to all who spin for sacrifice it 	is a sacred And why is it impossible for administrative reasons to 	have instruments of this labour all over the prison if it is not 	impossible to have instruments of labour? In 1922 all the prisoners 	who wished were allowed to spin in this prison and their work was 	used for the prison as may be done again. The wheels too were made 	in the prison.  I am not idly raising this question of spinning. It 	is, as you as well as the Government are aware, a matter of vital 	importance for me and some of my associates. It goes politics and 	economics. With some of    
 us life would not worth living if we could not serve God through this little labour. Evidently C class prisoners who have been spinning in Sabarmati, Nasik and perhaps other prisons have been doing  so without authority and with the unwarranted connivance of the local officials. But such a sacred duty cannot be performed in a precarious manner under connivance.Either the Government should recognize the right of prisoners to spin even as they recognize their right to pray and eat and perform the other necessary functions although their performance may, as it does, cause inconvenience or they should say they are not prepared to recognize this right in which case in justice it should be withdrawn from all classes of prisoners. In reality the discrimination in such a matter between A class and B class prisoners on the one hand and C class on the other shows clearly the absurdity and the injustice of the classification of prisoners. And I feel myself with all the conveniences given to me regarding spinning to be a much pampered and privileged prisoner. I have no desire to enjoy a single privilege that any other prisoner may not for similar reasons enjoy. I would ask youplease therefore to treat this matter of  sacrificial spinning as one of urgency. I am sorry again to put you and the Government to trouble but you and they will appreciate my position.libtech_48_footnote

       BHAISHRI 	MANMOHANDAS, I 	foresee a difficulty in returning your letter.  YERAVDA MANDIR,  January 	20, 1931 
   Since 		you agree 		with me about 		the importance 		of hand- 		spinning, please 		make it 		as clear as 		you can what more you 		expect from me.  The 		interests of 		the mill and 		handloom industries 		are mutually opposed. 		There is certainly 		a place 		for the mill industry. 		It will have a place for many more years to come, perhaps for ever. My     
 position is that those who understand the problem should not argue that the two industries are complementary to each other. The mills require no support. The swadeshi movement itself helps them, cannot but help them. If we plead, however, that both require help, the handloom industry will receive less help. Perhaps I am not able to explain my meaning clearly. Even if we do not plead for the mill industry, it does receive help. If we plead for it, we may possible harm it and will certainly harm the other.
  The 	manufacture of 	artificial silk should 	always  be opposed.  Personally, 	I believe 	that we can import 	the required 	cotton. But 	I would not 	bother to 	explain this just 	now.  The 	measures which you 	suggest for 	protecting the 	handloom industry seem 	quite all right. 
 The title which you have suggested does not appeal to me. I prefer the title which I have suggested. You may, however, give whichever you like.
I keep good health. I don’t eat fresh fruits these days.

That will last ten days. At present I require exactly four pounds every month. Please, therefore, send the balance before the end of this week. You need not put the cotton in a tin box.

With reference to your inquiry, sacrificial spinning means spinning 	in the name of God for the sake of the poor without any expectation 	of personal gain. I suggest that all those who wish to do 	sacrificial spinning should have permission to do so. Two more cases 	of fasting have occurred for prohibition to spin.

 As regards the oppression in the Badvani State, you may make due representation to the Kathiawar Political Agent and try to rouse public opinion against it, and then leave the matter. You may carry on such public agitation about it as you can. The remedy for every evil is self-purification. If there is but one self in all, you sould have faith that self-purification contributes to the welfare of  the  entire world. And through it we, too, immediately know our duty  in  particular circumstances. Self-purification is tapas. Think over what Tulsidasji says in “Bal Kand” in praise of tapas and its power.

 I heard about your request for permission to leave the Ashram. If you have made the request so that you may cultivate greater purity outside, what you have done is all right. But if you have asked for permission to leave the Ashram in despair, thinking that, since you have committed an error once, you are certain to commit more errors in future, then your action is wrong. No one in the world is totally free from shortcomings. We have come together in the Ashram not because we are perfect, but in order that we may know our shortcomings and overcome them. We should not feel unhappy if on some occasion we commit an error. We should feel unhappy only if in committing it we had willingly yielded to a weakness in us or had not been vigilant enough, if we had not struggled, or not sincerely enough, to overcome it. You should never lose heart.

  	It is again Wednesday morning after prayer. If I am fortunate like 	last week, I may get the post about 8 a.m. today. But it gives me 	pleasure to copy out the verses (this time they will be two) for you 	before I commence the weekly batch of letters. Here then are 6th and 	7th verseslibtech_57_footnotewith 	the notes made at the time:     				“O 				God with 				a curved 				mouth and big body, 				refulgent like 				ten million 				suns, keep me ever 				free from harm whilst doing beneficent 				acts.”     NOTE. 	This is addressed to God represented by the mystic letter pronounced 	‘Om’; mark its curved mouth and big body. Its mystic splendour 	has been sung by the Upanishads.     				“Guru 				(teacher) is Brahma, 				he is Vishnu, 				he is Mahadev, 				he is the great 				Brahman itself. I bow 				to that 				guru.”       
 NOTE. This refers of course to the spiritual teacher.  This is not  a mechanical or artificial relationship. The teacher is not all this in reality, but he is all that to the disciple who finds his full satisfaction in him and imputes perfection to him who gave him a living faith in a living God. Such a guru is a rarity at least nowadays. The best thing therefore is to think of God Himself as one’s Guru or await the Light in faith.
No further comment beyond the notes seems necessary.
 The decision as to further translation is made. For my own satis- faction, must embark upon the translation. Any short cut will be longer in the end. There will be no stopping after making the commencement. I seem, therefore, to be dreading the commencement whilst the present pressure continues. The dread is more mental than real. But mind supersedes reality.
 I see you are already in Sind. I hope the Sind cold has not worried you. It can be as cold as the Punjab in Sind. You must have met Jamshed Mehta—a noble type of man.

 I have your letter from Sind. The rendering of the 2nd chapter  is excellent. There are two correction I would suggest. Instead of ‘notion’, I should have ‘weakness’ at page 1 and at page 7 instead of ‘followers of Vedas’ I should have ‘the Vedic literalists’. The second correction is vital, not so the first. The followers of the Gita are also followers of the Vedas. But these follow the spirit. The literalists, as the very name implies, follow the letter. I do not know whether I was to return the notes you have sent. I shall not re-read your letter, but am preserving the notes till I hear further from you. They are no longer required for immediate publication, though this one is good enough any day for publication subject to the vital correction.
 What you say about rebirth is sound. It is nature’s kindness that we do not remember past births. Where is the good, either, of knowing in detail the numberless births we have gone through? Life would be  a burden if we carried such a tremendous load of memories. A wise man deliberately forgets many things even as a lawyer forgets the cases and their details as soon as they are disposed of. Yes, ‘Death is but a sleep and a forgetting.’
 My health is quite good. Energy sometimes astonishes me. I fancy that could not negotiate two hours’ continuous standing at the

 CHI. MAHALAKSHMI,
 
 Conditions are the same in every home. Since all of us try, consciously or unconsciously, to seem better than others, it  is necessary for us to be vigilant. You of course are. I have started eating cereals because I had always wanted to give up milk. If I could have lived, like the other prisoners here, on jowar and bajra, that would have made me happy, and served other purposes too. But jowar-bajra did not agree with me. Now I eat only wheat. Nobody else should copy me. As for you, the diet which you have adopted is the right one. If I succeed in my experiment, I shall advise others. Till then, milk and fruits remain the best diet.  I keep well.  At present, I eat dates once, bread and boiled vegetable twice, and twice or thrice almonds crushed into paste.

  	What you heard in Palanpur is true. A Muslim weaver from a village 	named Kanodar, near Palanpur, had come to the Ashram to teach 	weaving. He was sent by the late Nawab Saheb.

 I see that Satisbabu is utilizing his time very well. How nice it would be if he improves his health too? Do send the Hindi translation of the primer. I wish I could read it in Bengali itself but it seems difficult to attain proficiency in Bengali to that extent.
 Your desires, being pure, will gradually be transformed into tranq-uility. There is no harm in a desire provided it is accompanied by detachment. For example we may desire an increase in the sale of khadi but no harm will come from so desiring if there is no dejection in case the sales do not increase.

 CHI. NARANDAS,
 I handed over the post this morning and am writing again at night. I am doing this in order to write about something which I have been forgetting to mention in the letters for the past several weeks.
 Ba had glasses. There were three pairs. Please inquire who has them now. Perhaps Premabehn may have them. If you find them send all the three pairs. I cannot explain from here which pair I require. The one which I have with me gives me a little trouble when I spin on the takli. It is intended to serve two purposes, and, therefore, I have to strain the eyes when spinning on the takli. Send them with any intending visitor or by parcel.

 I got your packet yesterday evening at seven. I had done my best to see that you got my postcards regularly. But after all  a  prisoner is a prisoner. That you got them is ganimat. Do you know this word? It is a very good one. It is much in use in Urdu. It means “enough”, “thank God”.
 Surendra’s problem seems to have been solved for the present. His power of thinking has become weak. That has happened with many others who, instead of working, get caught in idle thinking. But Surendra’s heart is pure and so I believe that he will ultimately come out safe from this. His faith in Nathji will also help to save him. Meet Khurshedbehn. If she requires anything, send it to her.
 Inquire about Madhavji’s diet and inform me about it. I think he should stick to milk and dates.
 When you find a serial number omitted in my letters,  you should certainly inform me. I leave it to Pyarelal to check the numbers and trust that he does so. Last time, however, I myself had checked the letters and put them into the envelope. I had corrected two errors. The numbers on Kaka’s and Maganlal’s letters were repeated. As I did the checking in a hurry, I may have overlooked some other error. I will be more careful in future. Do what you think best about Keshu. Ask yourself what your duty is, rather than what I would wish, and take the reply to that question as my own wish and act accordingly. If I permit myself at this distance to have my own wish in the matter, I would be guilty on two counts. In the fiirst place, having handed over the reins to you, I should have no wish of my own. Secondly, at this distance I would not have sufficient data to decide what would be desirable. Hence, from either point of view, it would be attachment or ignorance of blind desire on my part to have any inclination in such matters. Yes, I can come to certain tentative conclusions from this distance. These should be intended merely to guide you. You may act on them only if they find an echo in your heart.
 This rule should be applied to the business of theland in  Vijapur. I have written to the same effect to Chhaganlal too. If you deal firmly with Sarojinidevi, everything will be all right. this manner once. I have already written to you what I felt in regard to Padma.
 In a general way I approve of your reading my letter to all and the letters addressed by others to me. It will be good if you now tell
 
 everyone this: ‘I read, with Bapu’s consent and at my leisure, all letters received from and addressed to him, except those which Bapu himself of the individual concerned may ask me not to  read.  Everyone, therefore, may rest assured that, if he does not wish me to read letters by or to him, I will not read them. If anyone feels embarrassed to tell me this personally, he may write to me and that will suffice. I see again and again that such secrecy does much harm. But we cannot get rid of the evil through compulsion. Hence we have no choice but to endure it.
 Mathuradas’s affair is a painful one. You must have read the letter which I wrote to him last week. If his having  got  himself released is the result of greater self-knowledge and self-examination, it is all right.  I am doing something from here about Appa.libtech_63_footnote
 I was happy that Lilavati had to suffer. That is, it is always better that, instead of some other woman, a woman of the Ashram should have to suffer. An inmate of the Ashram should  have  more endurance and the spirit of ahimsa in her
Did Shankarbhai finally get a takli?
 I have written to Hariyomal. He must have got the letter with the last mail.
 Evening, January 22, 1931 I had raised here the issue of Appa and others. I am informed today that they will be permitted to spin. The general problem, too,
 will be solved. This news, that is, the information about my intervention, should not be published.
 I told Kashinath in my last letter to him about my opinion regar-ding him to which you refer. You may now do what you think best.
 Write to Swami and inform him that I have not received The Prophets of New India.
 By the time you get this, Prabhavati will have been there for quite some days.
 I suppose I wrote to you, didn’t I, suggesting that you should try the treatment of one Punjabi vaid for Prabhavati.
What you say about Mathew is correct.
 Night, January 25, 1931 As I have given the information about my health in the letter to Mirabehn, I do not repeat it here. There is no cause for alarm; on the
 contrary, I think my health is excellent. I don’t require enemas at all.  I had a wire from Prabhavati today saying that she had started. The wire was dispatched from Mugalsarai and was dated yesterday. Hence, by the time you get this letter, she will have settled down there. If necessary, get her examined by Dr. Haribhai. If you prefer Dr. Talwalkar, consult him. My own hope is that it will not now be necessary to consult any doctor and that she will recover by herself.
 Afternoon, Monday [January 26, 1931] We were informed this morning that Pyarelal and I are to be released.  When, therefore,  you  get   this  letter,  we  shall  have  been
 released, but I don’t know where I shall be.  My present feeling is that
 I shall be leaving peace and quiet and going into the midst of turmoil.

I make this statement in deference to  the  urgent  wish expressed in a cable sent to me from London by some  of the delegates.
 When asked whether he had any statement to make regarding Mr. Ramsay Mac Donald’s speech, he said he had studied it carefully, but was not yet prepared at that stage to make any comment whatsoever especially owing to the appeal of Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru.
 Questioned as regards his movements in the near future, he said:
 I have no plan and no policy mapped out. I am proceeding to Bombay to talk over things wigh some friends but I do not know just where I shall go from there or how long I shall stay in Bombay.
 Q.	What is your opinion regarding the immediate release of all political prisoners?
A.	I most sincerely believe that every political prisoner now in
 jail for being connected with my civil disobedience movement should be liberated immediately, and none of us as leaders should be happy as long as any of our brethren or sisters are in jail.
 Q.	What will you do if the Government do not see eye to eye with you in this matter?
A.	I cannot say at this juncture as I have made no plans.
 Asked if he was happy at being free once again, he replied:
I really do not know.
 Mr. Gandhi expressed great appreciation of the treatment he received in jail, and when . . . asked . . . if he expected to go back again in the near future, Mr. Gandhi

 BHAI TRIVEDI,
 I was not happy that I had to come away without meeting you or seeing Manu, but I was not free to decide my own plans. I did receive your gift. I gave the vegetables to co-workers and I am taking with me the tomatoes, dates and almonds. I write this letter in the train. I am writing it for the sake of an English prisoner named Wheeler. He served me in many ways while I was in jail. He is an intelligent man and has great love for animals. I liked him. He has  no teeth, though he is only middle-aged. I wish to help him to get a denture. I have obtained Major Martin’s permission for this. If you know any person in Poona who makes good dentures, persuade him to do this act of service. Or you yourself may bear the expense and get a denture made for him. Perhaps Major Martin will not send him there. In that case, take the doctor in your car to Yeravda. Meet Quinn or the Major and do what is needed. Let me know afterwards what you did. Ask Manu to write to me.
I got the books which you gave to Pyarelal."
108,"January 27, 1931",INTERVIEW TO THE PRESS,"
      From 	a photostat of the Gujarati : G.N. 1002         Blessings 	from  BAPU        BOMBAY, 
  January 27, 1931 I 	personally feel that the mere release of the  Working Committee   	members   makes   a   difficult   situation   infinitely   more difficult 	and makes any action on  the part of  the members,  if   not altogether 	impossible, almost impossible.  	The authorities evidently have not yet perceived that the movement 	has so much affected the mass mind that the leaders, however eminent 	they may be, will be utterly unable to dictate to the masses a 	particular course of action.  	This, in my opinion, is a very healthy condition, because 	independent thinking is the very essence of the spirit of democracy. 	The thousands therefore who are in different prisons of India are 
 better able to deliver the goods than all the released leaders combined. In my opinion, therefore, if the release of leaders is to be effective, the release of all the satyagrahi prisoners is a necessary
condition and this release will, in its turn, be ineffective if repression is
not stopped altogether.
 I would like to draw the distinction which is very vital between civil disobedience and the action of those thousands who are now in prison. Civil disobedience is deliberate disobedience of non-moral laws by way of protest not necessarily against the laws covered by disobedience but any general grievance. In the present case, however, the men and women have not in the vast majority of case resorted to civil disobedience, but a wholly artificial condition has been produced by the Viceregal ordinances. The satyagrahis have not resisted any natural or moral laws, nor have they resisted the common law of the country, nor yet the statute law of the country; but they have been forced to resist autocratic ordinances which were designed to interfere with common law rights such as the right of persuading addicts to the drink or drug habit to give it up, of persuanding the drink and drug dealers to give up that calling or the dealers in, or purchasers of, foreign cloth to give up the sale and purchase of such cloth.
 It may be said that a breach of the salt law  is  undoubtedly  civil disobedience. I hold, however, that even in connection with the salt law the people have merely exercised a natural right that  millions posses of manufacturing salt out of the waters in their neigh- bourhood. The only instance, therefore, of civil resistance that I can just now recall is in connection with the salt raids and possibly the forest laws. The raids have a history into which I do not wish to go at the present moment.
 What I am anxious to clear is that, even if, after conference with the friends who are coming from the Round Table Conference, it is found that the Premier’s statement affords sufficient ground for the Congress to tender co-operation, the right of picketing cannot be given up, nor the right of the starving millions to manufacture salt; and, if these elementary rights are recognized, most of the ordinances will naturally have to be withdrawn.
 It is, therefore, highly necessary for the public, as also the Govern-ment, to understand the fundamental Congress position.
 Manufacture of salt and boycott of foreign cloth and of liquor are not intended to register the resistance of the nation to the existing
 misrule, but they are intended to achieve these three things for all time. No amount of goodwill established between Great Britain and India, so far as I can see, will reconcile the public to the drink evil, the foreign cloth evil or the prohibition to manufacture salt. Speaking for myself, I am hankering for peace, if it can be had with honour; but, even if I stood alone, I could be no party to any peace which does not satisfactorily solve the three questions that I have mentioned.
 I should, therefore, judge the Round Table Conference tree by its fruit. I have given the three tests that are in operation, but, as the public   knows,  there   are   eight   more.libtech_68_footnoteI   want   the   substance   of independence—no shadow—and, even as a doctor names the disease of his patient after a proper diagnosis so will I name the tree of the Round Table Conference after I have examined the fruit in the light of the eleven points which are conceived in terms of the man in the street.
 Replying to a further question as regards his treatment in the Yeravda Jail, Mr. Gandhi said :
I was a pampered prisoner, in one sense. So far as physical
 comforts were concerned, the prison authorities left no stone unturned to supply them. I have, therefore, so far as I am concerned, nothing but good to say of the authorities regarding my food. Of course, I was strictly isolated from the fellow-satyagrahis and conditions were imposed which made it impossible for me to see those who were near and dear to me.
 But the general treatment of the C class prisoners leaves much to be desired. The Superintendent of the Yeravda Prison, Major Martin,  I think, is a good man. He is anxious to make the prisoners in his charge happy; but he is hidebound by rules and regulations which make it impossible for him to make the prisoners comfortable even so far as their daily meals are concerned.
 To give one instance, there is a rigid rule to the effect that the ordinary prisoner can have only jowar or bajra roti, and of these he must have that grain which is the cheapest at the time.
 Here there is no consideration whatsoever of the bodily wants of the prisoner.
 To quote another instance, these prisoners cannot have even a grain of salt extra. They must be content with what is put in their dal or vegetable. I can multiply such instances. In a sentence, I can sum
 
 up my impression by saying that there is no human touch generally between the officials and the prisoners.
 I have appreciated The Times of India’s efforts to better the lot of the numberous C class prisoners. If there was any human touch, the very simple suggestion made by Mr. David would have been acted upon long ago. Up to the time of leaving the jail, I saw no such sign. I am convin-ced that C class prisoners have to undergo much avoidable suffering. The classification into A, B and C, I regard to be highly irritating and wholly unjustified. What is wanted is real relief for the vast majority of prisoners and that cannot come through classification but through humane considerations.
 Answering a question as to what he meant by the statement that he was a “pampered prisoner”, Mr. Gandhi explained that, while all his physical wants, by way of food, etc., were provided, he was mentally and spiritually tortured by being kept in splendid isolation and by way of compensating him for such isolation he was provided with all the food that he wanted.
 Mr. Gandhi was reminded of the passage in the Viceroy’s recent statement that there was little difference between the goal which the Government had before them and that of the Congress and that the difference was only with reference to the method of reaching that goal. Speaking on this point Mr. Gandhi said:
 In the first instance, I am not at all satisfied that a common term has been used to mean the same thing. Secondly, the Congress has pursued nothing that the situation did not render absolutely necessary. In my opinion when the history of the last decade comes to be written the palm will be given to the women of India. They have brought swaraj nearer. They have added several inches to their own height and that of the nation.
 Mr. Gandhi was next referred to the report from Yeravda to the effect that he had handed some mysterious document in sealed envelope to the Superintendent of the jail before his departure. He denied having given any such document to the Superintendent. libtech_69_footnote
 In the course of further conversation Mr. Gandhi said he was unable to say anything about his future plans at present. He was proceeding to Allahabad to see Pandit Motilal and his programme would depend upon Pandit’s state of health. He had suspended his judgment on the Premier’s speech in response to the Rt. Hon. Mr. Sastri’s cable pending consultation with Mr. Sastri and his fellow-delegates.

But this time that could not be.  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	a photostat of the Gujarati: G.N. 9057           January 31, 1931 I would never give up my demand even 	if I stood alone and the whole of India were against me. Still, I 	seek your advice also in the matter. After receiving the telegram 	from Sapru and Sastri, I decided that we should not consider 	MacDonald’s statement. Even so, I have    
 explained on what terms we might consider the statement of enter into negotiations on the basis of it. They are truce terms. For myself I am bound by my declaration in Bombay that I continued to adhere to the condition which I had laid down in Yeravda. I have now added one more condition. Why should we not demand an inquiry into the incident the memory of which brought tears to the eyes of a person like Sardar Sardul Singh? What we have suffered so far is nothing in comparison with what we shall be made to suffer in future. We are, therefore, justified in demanding that a tribunal should be set up for an independent inquiry into such incidents, that a  report  of the inquiry be published and the officers found  guilty be removed. Though we do speak of forgetting and forgiving the misdeeds of others, it would be a sin to forget certain things. We may forgive Dyer and O’Dwyer for the Jallianwala massacre, but we cannot afford to forget it. We may also forgive the authors of the  atrocities  here, though some of the incidents here have been more cruel than the massacre at Jallianwala Bagh. History offers no parallel to the atrocities committed on women in the Kaira District. The papers  could not even report what cruelty was inflicted on women—mere women—who were never guilty and could never be guilty of any violence. Under the present conditions, how could any such reports appear in the papers? An independent court should go into all these incidents, and in future also there should always be an inquiry into incidents such as the arrest and beating up of advocates, of a person like Sunnab.
 Mention was made of the prisoners. Those under a death sentence should not be hanged. My personal religion tells me not only that they should not be hanged but also that they should not even be kept in prison. However, that is my personal opinion, and we cannot make their release a condition. The death sentence on the Sholapur men was executed in spite of the doubt expressed by the judge and in spite of so many earnest appeals from the public. Shall we say that, if such death sentences continue to be executed, we shall not enter  into  negotiations  with t he Government?  There  is a risk  in making any such condition. We can with justice demand only the release of those who had joined the present struggle. We should not, therefore, include in the truce terms the release of others. Hence I adhere to my statement. Yes, those who have not been regularly tried in a court should of course be released. We can decide even today to enter into talks with the British Government, but only on the condition that I have laid down. That condition holds good also for a truce.
 Who would describe the breaking of the salt law as civil disobedience? Breaking of a law would be civil disobedience only if we intended to obey it after peace was concluded.
 We cannot give up even one of the demands put forward in the negotiations carried on from Yeravda. Ido not believe that Mac Donald’sstatement grants us anything.However, even a consideration of it can be undertaken only if the Government concedes our demands. As for myself, I felt even when I started on the Dandi march that I had done my part, and I left it to the Congress to act as it wished or to stop the movement.  If you tell me that my work is over and that  I should return to the Ashram, I would immediately do so. How shall  I describe to you the shock that I feel on coming out of jail? You have played your part so well that I was lost in admiration and felt no need to make any suggestion. I have no shadow of doubt in my mind that I could lead the people  better.  They have taken up the fight.  It  is God who conducts it.  I do not know who will lead it to success, but  I do know that God will take us across.
 You may say what you wish about your Province, and say it frankly. What do we have to hide from the Government? It gets all the information somehow, I do not know whether through radio messages or in some other way. But there can be no question of the people yielding. After all these sacrifices, are they likely to yield? I have no doubt that we can carry on this fight for any length of time. But the Government’s capacity for brutality is so great that we must gird up our loins to face more of it. We have still  to  free the  oppressed millions in the world, to free the entire world. It waits for a miracle from India. For my part, I should like you to go from here with the firm determination that you will give up your life, to do whatever is yet necessary for winning swaraj. I fear that yet more beastliness will be let loose on us—I say “fear” because we can never wish that man may become still more beastly; but if he does, how can we help it?

 ALLAHABAD,
 February 1, 1931
 In renewing your acquaintance after so many months, I feel within me a glow of pleasure that under the greatest difficulty the paper has con-tinued publication.libtech_72_footnotelibtech_73_footnoteI had told my co-workers that, in the event of suppre-ssion by the authorities, the paper  were  to  continue publication even though it was a hand-written sheet multiplied to the extent of volunteers coming up to make copies. Where there is perfect coordina-tion and will-ingness, copies can be thus multiplied without end and no printing press in the world an compete with such an effort. But I know that this is true in theory. In practice, one does not find that willing ness.But nothing is impossible for ahimsa or active, unadulterated love. It surmounts all diffi-culties. My companions have chosen an effective though in my opinion a method less in keeping with the spirit of ahimsa and truth which know no secrecy. But I do not judge them. On the  contrary,  their  organizing ability has commanded my admiration and respect. I do not yet know how over seven thousand copies are being issued with such regularity. I must content myself with thanking the invisible helpers and the numerous readers who have  continued  their association with Young India. In renewing contact with the readers through these sheets, let me redeclare my faith.
 Over eight months’ contemplation in solitude has, if possible, increased my faith in truth and ahimsa. At the risk of incurring ridicule, I repeat what I have said so often that voluntary universal adoption of khaddar with all its vast implications means purna swaraj and that civil disobedience becomes a necessary duty only because khaddar has not yet obtained the hold it should. But of all this hereafter.

RESOLUTIONlibtech_74_footnote","
    
 ALLAHABAD,
 February 1, 1931 The Working Committee having, out of regard for the wishes of Srijuts Sastri Sapru and Jayakar, suspended the publication of its reso-
lution passed on January 21, 1931, an impression got abroad that the
 movement of civil disobedience has been suspended. It is, therefore, necessary to reiterate the decision of  the  Committee  that  the movement is to continue unabated until explicit instructions are issued to the contrary. This meeting reminds the public that picketing of foreign cloth and drink and drug shops, in itself is no part of the civil disobedience campaign, but that it is the exercise of ordinary right of  a citizen, so long as it remains strictly peaceful and causes no obstruction to the public.
 This meeting further reminds the sellers of foreign cloth, including foreign yarn, and Congress workers that the boycott of foreign cloth, being a vital necessity in the interest of the masses, is a permanent feature of national activity and will remain so till the nation has acquired the power to exclude foreign cloth and foreign yarn from India, whether by total prohibition or prohibitive tariff.
 Whilst appreciating the response made by dealers in foreign cloth and foreign yarn to the appeal of the Congress to bring about a boycott of foreign cloth, this meeting reminds them that it is not open to any Congress organization to hold out hopes of their being able to dispose of their existing stock in India.

       H.E. 	THE VICEROY, 	DELHI  DEAR 	FRIEND,  ANAND 	 BHAWAN, 	  ALLAHABAD,  February 	1, 1931 
  	You  have  made  a  public  appeallibtech_75_footnotelibtech_76_footnoteto 	 me  for  co-operation  in connec-tion with the further work of the 	recently held Conference in London and ascribed to me a belief in 	the  sincerity  of British promises and declara-tions. I wish that I 	could endorse your ascription. I told you on the 23rd December 1929, 	that subject to honourable exceptions I had found to my great sorrow 	that British declarations and promises were insincere. Had I not 	found them so, the active voluntary co-operation that I had tendered 	 to  British officials in India and outside would never have been 	with drawn.  	But I assure you that I am simply waiting for a sign in order to 	enable me to respond to your appeal. I confess, however, that some 	of the signs are highly ominous. In Borsad, in the district of 	Kaira, on the 21st January, a cruel, uncalled for and unchivalrous 	lathi-charge was   made upon wholly innocent women and girls who 	were forming a procession which was marching to a women’s meeting 	that was to be held in order to protest against the brutal treatment 	a of girllibtech_77_footnotelibtech_78_footnote17 years old by a police official. Neither the 	procession nor the meeting was prohibited. The injuries were severe 	in several cases. Some of those who were assaulted belong to the 	Satyagraha Ashram at Sabarmati. One of them, an old widowlibtech_79_footnotelibtech_80_footnote, a member of the Managing Board of the Ashram, was 	drenched in blood. To give you some idea of the nature of the police 	barbarity, I give you a free translation of her letterlibtech_81_footnoteto 	me. The facts stated in that letter are capable of easy proof. The 	Collector himself was in Borsad on this date. At the time of writing 	this, I cannot recall anything in modern history to parallel this 	official inhumanity against wholly defenceless and innocent women. I 	may complete the outline of this picture by stating that there were 	no men       
 in this meeting or proce-ssion except a few volunteer guides.
 On the 26th at Calcutta, as you may be aware, the meetings advertised to be held for the purpose of re-declaring the  Independence Day Resolution were put under the ban and the procession marching to the principal meeting and headed by the Mayor of Calcutta, Syt. Subhas Chandra Bose, was dispersed by a cruel lathi-charge.
 In Begusarai (Bihar) on the same date a party of men returning from a similar meeting was fired upon by the police resulting in six killed and several wounded. The police are reported to have fired even into a school. You have probably read the official defence of the police proceeding. My informants deny the main part of the official defence, and if their version is correct, the firing was wholly uncalled for.
 On the top of these three events comes the news that Sjt. Bha- shyam, a member of the Madras Bar Council, and  Sjt.  V.  A. Sundaram, a well-known worker, were, whilst they were picketing foreign-cloth shops, with the concurrence of their owners, assaulted and treated in a manner unworthy of a civilized State. They were taken, after the assault, to an out of the way place and out of reach of medical or other assistance. Had it not been for the chance passing of  a car, it is difficult to say what would have happened to these gentlemen.
 I do not ask you to accept the versions given here, but I do ask you to fell with me that it is not possible for those like me who believe in them to tender co-operation with any confidence, much less enthusiasm. Whether, however, such co-operation, for which many other things are necessary, comes forth in the end or not, it is, I hope you will agree, highly necessary to have an unbiased judgment over happenings like those I have narrated. Such an enquiry is necessary because I assume that the Government of India do not want to countenance methods such as I have described. The four cases I have cited are but recent examples. I invite you, therefore, to appoint an impartial and representative committee of enquiry acceptable to the Congress to investigate the allegations of excesses against officials in different parts of India since the inauguration of the  civil disobedience campaign. If such a committee is appointed I am sure that the Congress will lead evidence before it to show that in very many cases the conduct of officials has been contrary to the expectations raised in the preambles to your ordinances and in your repeated declarations.
 Till I hear from you and know your wish in the matterlibtech_82_footnoteI am not sending this letter to the Press. I am in Allahabad till Tuesday. I expect to leave Allahabad on Tuesday evening for Bombay where I expect to be till the 6th instant."

     Enclosure : 	Translation of a letter  Bombay 	Secret Abstracts 750(14)0 Pt-A, pp. 159-63         I 	remain,  Your 	faithful friend,             ALLAHABAD,  February 	1, 1931 
  Interviewed 	by Reuter’s special correspondent, Gandhiji said :  	All speculation regarding split among the members of the Working 	Committee is pure myth. On the contrary the proceedings yesterday 	and today were perfectly unanimous, and the behaviour of the members 	cordial. All were of one mind that the movement cannot be withdrawn 	or suspended unless truce is declared. It should be obvious to 	everybody that a mass movement like the one now going on cannot be 	suddenly and without a reasonable hope of a final settlement 	stopped, nor can it be called off unless the hope of a settlement is 	shared by the vast mass of the people; and this can never happen so 	long as repression in its virulent form continues, as witness, the 	latest example in the shape of wanton assaults upon Srijuts Bhashyam 	and Sundaram. I have been daily receiving reports from men and women 	of unimpeachable character giving me details of repression not 	confined to any particular part of India. A friend has handed me a 	letter containing harrowing details of atrocities said to have been 	committed by the police in the district of Midnapore (Bengal).    
 In my opinion nothing short of an absolutely impartial and thorough going enquiry into these charges can satisfy  either  the public mind or the requirements of justice. I do not see how it is possible to conduct negotiations for peace with repression fouling the atmosphere hour after hour.
 The Hindu, 2-2-1931
 "
119,"February 1, 1931","SPEECH AT PUBLIC MEETING, ALLAHABAD","
    
 February 1, 1931 Speaking in Hindi while seated on the dais, Mahatma Gandhi said that it afforded him great pleasure in seeing an assembly of such a large crowd as
 had gathered at the meeting and he offered his thanks to God and congratulations  to the people for the great deeds of bravery and sacrifices done by the people during the period of eight months. He said that whenever he thought of those brave deeds and sacrifices he was at once reminded of his sisters. The whole world was surprised, said Mahatma Gandhi, at the considerable sacrifices made by people in the national struggle, especially at the share taken by the women of India.
 The women who were considered absolutely ignorant and always lived in purdah gave up their purdah forthwith at the nation’s call, they sacrificed their children, offered for the struggle even their little girls and did not put any obstacles in the way of  their husbands participating in  the fight.   And, he said, the women’s
 sacrifices were not confined to that alone but they themselves discarded the purdah
 and went out to participate in the fight.
 Proceeding, Mahatma Gandhi said that any number of families would be found in the country, which would have given every one of its members for the national struggle. In a fight with guns, old men, women, boys and girls were exempted, but India’s fight for freedom was such that everybody could participate in it.
 Resuming the speech, which Mr. Shiva Prasad Gupta repeatedlibtech_83_footnote, Mahatma Gandhi, while busy at his takli, said that the women of the country had been lifted high on account of their sacrifices, by three or four inches and consequently the height of the whole country was also raised by three or four inches which naturally provided an occasion for the Indians to feel proud.
 Young children had also given proofs of their bravery, said Mahatma Gandhi. When he heard in the jail the name of vanarasena he could not think that that sena would include children aged six and eight also. And when he heard, Mahatma Gandhi added, an account of their brave deeds and sacrifices, it at once struck him that in this
 
 national struggle God was also with them. It was a heavenly precept that victory was bound to come if they remained on the path of truth and non-violence, and in such a victory there would be the share of not one individual but of all people and all the communities. There could be no considerations of superiority and inferiority in the case of people participating in such a struggle and it was Mahatma  Gandhi’s conviction that if they really remained on the path of righteousness and peace the danger of communal quarrels with which they were faced frequently, would altogether disappear.
 Mahatma Gandhi, therefore, appealed to the people that whether there be war against the Government or disputes among themselves, they should never leave the path of peace and righteousness, the result of which would be that they would never suffer defeat.
 He realized that sufficient observance of the principle of non-violence had been made but at the same time he wished to warn the public that the least mistake on their part in that matter would ruin them as they had taken a pledge before God and the whole world that they would carry on the fight peacefully and with firm devotion to the motherland. So long as that pledge stood, if they deliberately made a departure from it they would be regarded, said Mahatma Gandhi, as cheats before God and the world.libtech_84_footnote
 Resuming, Mahatma Gandhi said that he would reiterate what he had been saying all along, namely, that every man, woman, boy, and girl  should  start  spinning at the charkha and use khaddar made of the yarn spun by him or her and throw away foreign clothes. They should also give up drinking and gambling and everything that was bad, for Indians wanted to govern the country themselves and if the government went into hands polluted with misdeeds, the country would be ruined.
 As the noise continued on account of the inability of the audience to hear, in spite of Mr. Gupta’s repeating the speech at the top of his voice, Mahatma Gandhi said that he did not want to take much of the time of the people on account of the noise, and with blessing to the people he concluded his speech abruptly to the utter disappointment of those who expected some pronouncement from Mahatma Gandhi with regard to the situation arising out of the declaration of the British policy, it being the first public speech delivered by him after his release from the Yeravda Jail.

 I have made myself acquainted with your condition to the extent it was possible without a local visit. I tender my congratulations for your courage and patience with which you have borne your suffer- ings. Out of such sufferings will be born a new nation pulsating with life.  Earthly possessions are no compensation for loss of liberty. It is a matter of joy that you have preferred deprivations of these to that of your liberty. I hope you will not neglect the duty of manufac-turing free salt.

 I got all your letters. But I have had no rest after leaving the rest-house. Today is my silence day and so I have got some time, though the stream of visitors continues.
 I simply cannot forget the Borsad incident. The people have not yet realized its significance. I am taking up the matter.
 The Ashram women have immortalized themselves and the Ash- ram. Our prayers and the vows of self-discipline have borne fruit. Other women also have shown such courage. There were some in this procession too. But I have formed the impression that the  special merit of the sacrifice made by the Ashram women lies in the religious spirit which inspired it.
 My future movements are uncertain. Probably I shall reach Bombay on the 4th. Panditji’s ship is in mid-ocean, so that even for his sake I may have to stay on here. I keep good health. About other developments, you will read in the papers. I am trying for the release of the other prisoners, but only within limits proper for us. Those who are released by the Government on the expiry of their sentences try to return to the jails immediately. Write to me wherever I am. For the ensuing official year of the Congress, Sardar has been elected Presi- dent. This increases the responsibility of Gujarat. It may have been necessary for women from outside Kaira District to go there. Who took the lead in showing this discourtesy?

 February 2, 1931
 CHI. NARANDAS,
 I am writing this at about 10 p.m. on silence day. I started observing silence at 11.30 p.m. yesterday and so a little more time must pass before I can give it up. After my release it is only today that I may say I had some time for rest, though of course even today I had to listen to many people and hear their stories. All the same, I have certainly been able to write, for the first time after my release, the letters enclosed with this and some others. See if you can pass on their letters to Surendralibtech_87_footnotelibtech_88_footnote, Gangabehnlibtech_89_footnotelibtech_90_footnoteand Vasumatilibtech_91_footnotelibtech_92_footnote, or inform them of their substance. How is Durgabehn’s  health? I have not asked Mahadev about it. I don’t know where he is at present. What is the position about Madhavji’s diet? Tell him that he cannot insist on being supplied milk and dates and that he should be satisfied if they agree to provide them at his own cost. Though I have been released, I feel as if I had not been released. If others are not released and if the situation does not improve, I shall have no choice but to court imprisonment. My programme in general is as follows :
 I intend to start from here tomorrow evening so as to reach Bombay on Wednesday evening. I shall be there up to Friday at any rate. If, however, Panditji’s health deteriorates, I may not be able to leave even tomorrow. Or it may also happen that, after meeting Sastriji and others, I may have to leave on Friday to return here. Address the post accordingly. That is, address it to me at Bombay till I inform you otherwise. I am yearning to visit Kaira district. I intend to go there if I am free on Friday.
 God alone knows when and where we shall meet. Unless some reason connected with the struggle brings me to the Ashram. I wish to visit neither the Ashram nor Ahmedabad.For permanent headquarters, I should naturally choose Karadi, but I see no possibility at present of my wish being fulfilled. I feel unhappy at the thought that I shall no
 
 longer be able to send discourses for Gitabodh. If you come to know more about Kaira, let me know.

         CHI. 	KANTA,       February 	2, 1931 
  	Your question is all right You can find the answer only in my 	letters. Happiness and unhappiness are states of mind. But how can 	we perceive that they are so? Certainly not by reading. We can do so 	only by experience. That is why suffering is necessary. Here by 	suffering I mean what is regarded as such by the world. Illness of 	the body, phy- sical assault, hunger, getting robbed, being 	insulted, etc.,—it is the mind which experiences all these forms 	of suffering. A devotee of God, a yogi, one who has merged in the 	Brahman, has become a sthitaprajna, —these are not affected 	by such sufferings but remain content even in their presence as they 	do in so called happiness. When one becomes equi-minded in this way 	one will attain self-knowledge. Is this clear?

 Gandhiji received an address today from the representatives of the Allahabad Boatmen’s Association in the “Swaraj Bhawan”.
 Speaking to the boatmen’s representative and some Congressmen, Gandhiji referred to the no-rent campaign, and advised the people not to use force against cultivators who were not disposed to stop payment of their rents. He also referred to Sunday’s incident of the villagers travelling without tickets,libtech_96_footnoteand deprecated their action as the Congress had not launched a campaign of travelling without tickets. He added that even when they attained swaraj, some fare would have to be charged for railway service.

 For anything to be achieved five factors have to co-operate. Among them, fate has been placed the last, but it is in effect the first. What can we do when fate itself is against us? Panditji suffered no inconvenience during the journey. It is like the kettle calling the pot black. Last night I sat down to spin after ten o’clock and could go to bed only at half past one.

 I have your letter. I have come to Lucknow on account of Pan- ditji’s illness and I shall stay here for the time being. It will do no harm if Satisbabu fasts once every month. Those who join the Ashram on condition that they will observe its rules must observe them. But old inmates should not be turned out if they do not follow new rules. But the rules formulated for the sake of good management must be followed at all cost. The point is that rules should be such that no one can say that they are something new, that is, they should be in keeping with local conditions.

       From 	a photostat of the Hindi : G.N. 1684         Blessings 	from  BAPU         ALLAHABAD, 
  February 	5, 1931  	I am a man of peace, but circumstances have made my life one of 	struggle. I shall, however, leave no stone unturned to attain peace. 	It is no joy to me to submit thousands who have a childlike faith in 	me to suffering.  In 	answer to a question whether he found the Prime Minister’s 	declarationlibtech_99_footnotesatisfactory, he 	said that he had resolutely refrained from coming to definite 	conclu- sions on the subject. Mr. 	  Sastri,  Mr.   Jayakar,   and   Sir   Tej   Bahadur   Sapru have  	cabled to me to suspend judgment and I have  the  highest  esteem  	for these patriots who love their country as intensely as I claim to 	do.They may be able to explain to me satisfactorily that Mr. Ramsay 	MacDonald’s declaration conveys something beyond what  I  have 	been able to make out on a cursory reading, and, if in the light of 	my eleven points, I see that a settlement is possible, I   shall 	readily advise    
 the calling off of the civil disobedience movement.
 Mr. Gandhi proceeded to discuss the allegations made against the police and said he had a large file on the subject containing evidence from men upon whose word  he relied. When reminded that his version was one-sided, he added :
I do not ask you to accept my allegations against the police. Let
 us have an impartial investigation and I am quite prepared to lead evidence and abide by the verdict of the tribunal.
 On its being pointed out that the police had generally conducted themselves with the utmost forbearance under the most difficult conditions, he replied :
I do not complain about ordinary repression. If I violate the
 law, I expect to be arrested. The Government may want to maintain order but there must be some relation between offence and punish- ment. Departure from this rule has been much more general than you suppose.
 Responding to a question whether it was not inevitable that there should, in extraordinary times, be a certain amount of severity as it must be impossible exactly  to measure action, Mr. Gandhi interjected :
Why should it be inevitable? It was not so in South Africa
 and the reason for that was that they had a national  Government there.
 Explaining himself further, Mr. Gandhi made a specific grievance of confis- cations said to have taken place in Gujarat and Bengal.
 Many have lost their homes. The sufferers may have been guilty of non-payment of taxes or not, but if property worth, say, Rs. 50 lakhs has been appropriated for dues, say, of about a lakh, it must be restored. The Government have nothing to gain by refusing to restore the property and my suggestion is not without precedent.
 He insisted that the matter should not be left to Local Governments, but should go before an entirely impartial tribunal.
The presentation of an inventory does not, however, establish a
 claim, and I quite see that confiscations must be satisfactorily proved by the complainants.
 Mr. Gandhi referred also to the release of political prisoners. On attention being drawn to the promise of the Government to release prisoners on the termi- nation of the civil disobedience movement, he remarked :
I know that they will be released.  But I have difficulties, though
not insuperable, facing me. Some of our people are already perturbed
 at my conciliatory statements. But when I am convinced that I should call off the movement, I hope also to convince them. When I called off the last non-co-operation movement at Bardoli, I had only to act on my own and not wait for any indication from the Government. The circumstances today are different.
 Dealing with the proposed Constitution, Mr. Gandhi said that with 80 per cent of the budget placed beyond the purview of the legislature and only 20 per cent left which would be inadequate for “nation-building” purposes, there was not much satisfaction to be gained.
If our co-operation is wanted, it will not do to tell us simply to
 adhere to a consideration of the unsettled questions. We must have the freedom to reopen the discussions on the so-called safeguards.
 Mr. Gandhi also said that, in regard to the Indian States, there seemed to be no protection for the people of the States.
The Congress would be untrue to itself if it did not seek it, and I
 cannot bring myself to believe that Mr. Ramsay Mac-Donald would deny in his dealings in the matter all the teachings of a lifetime.
 Mr. Gandhi, however, felt hopeful that the States and communal questions could be adjusted. But he was clearly of opinion that the Congress participation depended on two things: first, satisfactory adjustment of the preliminaries of suspension of the civil disobedience movement; and secondly, satisfaction regarding the Conference. He concluded :
I am doing everything to terminate civil disobedience which will
 be done if I am sure that full restoration will be made, prisoners are released, an impartial inquiry is held into the alleged police excesses led to, in many cases, by action taken for offences created by the pro- clamation of new regulations, and generally certain other necessary adjustments are made.

151,"February 	5, 1931",INTERVIEW TO THE PRESS,"
         LUCKNOW, 
  February 	5, 1931  Asked 	by the Free Press representative at Lucknow about some message for 	the country, Mahatma Gandhi said : I 	 have no message to give. I  can only emphasize what I  have  	been saying, that continuous repression about which evidences are 	daily  accumulating  makes  it  well  nigh   impossible   to  	contemplate 
 peace. From all over the country I am getting reports that the autho- rities are ruthless and sometimes even devoid of all decency. And that, on the top of this, they do not hesitate to deny the truth of the allegations made on behalf of the suffering public.
 The most painful part of the whole affair is that the Political Departments at the top defend the conduct of the police and wilfully—that is the only expression I can use—shut their eyes to everything said on behalf of the public, no matter how well supported the allegations might be. I have not a shadow of doubt in my mind that the allegations about the unchivalrous and cruel conduct of the police in respect of women’s processions in Borsad are true, and yet the Director of Public Information has made what reads like  an oracular statement incapable of being contradicted. I am sure that if a really impartial enquiry is made, it would be found that the Director of Public Information had become a tool in the hands of unscrupu- lous officials who have not hesitated to add falsehood to their barbarity.
 I know that I am using strong language, but anything less strong will be untruthful on my part. I would like to be proved wrong in having believed the reports I have received, in which case I should tender my apology to the officials concerned.
 When asked by another Press representative about his future programme, he said that it depended upon the health of Pandit Motilal Nehru.

  	I have your letter. If children do not like milk, the fault lies 	with the mother. If milk is good and is kept in a clean vessel 	children will readily drink it. Flavouring must not be added. Do not 	be put out if the infant does not accept milk for a day or two. If 	we show the firmness to give only milk when she is hungry, she will 	come to accept it. It is only a matter of habit. Tea of course must 	not be given. Start teaching Sumitra from today to breathe properly. 	If she learns to do it her nose will not run.  	I should no doubt be happy if you could stay at the Ashram At 	suggested Bijapur because I felt that with Kashi there it might suit 	you better and you would also not suffer from constipation there. At 	present I eat only wheat rotis. I feel all right. Jaggery and 	sugar are certainly harmful. If the infant asks and if you feel that 	you must give her something, you may give larged ried red raisins 	after washing and removing the seeds and teach her to suck them. 	Juice of black grapes may certainly be given. It can be given warm 	or cold. But it will be better if she forms the habit of sucking the 	grapes. Do not let her swallow them whole. Give one grape at a time.  	There is no harm in applying kohl to the eyes. On the contrary, it 	is beneficial. The grease in it is useful. I do not know if the soot 	itself has any beneficial property. Possibly it helps the grease to 	stick 
 well to the eyelids. The eyes should be swabbed daily with warm water. The pad should be of clean cotton. Letting the infant’s hair grow, up to a certain age, protects it. It does become necessary to cut the hair after the age of, say, three. oil should be rubbed daily to the roots of the hair. Never apply so much of it that it drips from the hair. After massaging the oil should be wiped off with a dry cloth.

 February 6, 1931
 Though a great leader of India has passed away today, I see on your faces not grief but elation. That should be so. When leaders leave us, it does not behove us to shed tears. For, what is happening here is not consigning to the flames the lifeless flesh of a devotee, but our witnessing great sacrifice that the nation has made. This is not the first such occasion in my life. At the time of the Lokamanya’s death also we had such a vast crowd. I see before me a scene similar to the one I had seen then. The people had been praying and singing songs. They were filled with a certain kind of exaltation. At first I could not realize that, but as soon as I recovered from the grief which had momentarily clouded my reason, I understood how the people had felt that the Lokamanya’s death was the crowning glory of his life- long sacrifices. I witnessed similar scenes at the time of Deshbandhu’s death and of Lalaji’s, Hakimji’s, Mahomed Ali’s. What a great effect on the world and on Londoners had Mahomed Ali’s death made! The reason was that he had gone to England to serve the country’s cause and that he sacrificed his life in it. I am happy that today also the people have displayed the same feeling. If you have fully understood the significance of this, it is well that you have thus observed the occasion. Otherwise, the world would call us fools and say that a crowd of unfeeling people had collected at a fair. What we see before us is a national sacrifice. On this occasion, I ask of you that you disperse only after taking some definite vow to do whatever little you can for the country. You will indeed deserve praise if you do this.
Now, on this occasion, I will narrate to you an interesting story.
 Panditji was a huge lion and he had fought big battles in his life. And similarly he fought the god of death. You may say that  he  was defeated, but I do not believe that it is true. During this last illness of his, I visited him daily and occasionally he sent for me too. He did that yesterday. I joked with him. I have no words to praise the doctors. They had done their very best, and would have given their lives if that would have saved his life. It is because they had such faith that they had taken him to Lucknow for treatment. Their faith was the result not of Panditji’s physical condition, but of his courage.  I told Panditji
 that, if he recovered, I would believe that swaraj was won. He smiled and said that it had been won already. Though he could not speak distinctly, he had enough peace of mind to be able to say this. Why did he believe that swaraj had already been won? Could anyone say that swaraj was not won when sixty thousand people had gone to jail, when people had faced numerous lathi-charges and made so many sacrifices? I did not visit him last night, but I tell you what Panditji’s wife told me. During his life he had not followed the practice of praying with Ramanama, and used to make fun of religion, because he abhorred hypocrisy and false show and was angered by  men practising irreligion in the name of religion. But I know his heart and knew that he believed in God. Last night he  had  been  uttering  Rama’s name aloud. Panditji’s tongue had never uttered a word of grief or despair—only a weak man like me would do that. But he never uttered Rama’s name either. However, yesterday he remembered that name. He also used to say that he had forgotten gayatri—he had given up the practice of reciting it because of the irreligion he saw around him. But, as he told his wife, he had recollected the gayatri verse that day. This means  that  Panditji departed a pure man. May his pure self-sacrifice result in making us purer too. Before leaving here, resolve what you will do for the cause for which this great man sacrificed his son, daughter and son-in-law.
 The pledge which has stirred you is to win swaraj with the twin means of non-violence and truth. Keeping these two means in your mind, take whatever vow you wish to before you leave. In your enthusiasm today, you forgot yourselves and used thoughtless words. We are here today to serve the cause of peace, and it behoves us to be peaceful. Even soldiers, the men who work with weapons of steel, remain disciplined and peaceful, though of course outwardly. Leave this place with that peace in your mind and that discipline in your outward behaviour. Take, with this fire as witness, whatever sincere pledge you can fulfil. May God inspire you to take that pledge.

I would love to see you and hear all you have to say to me,libtech_106_footnotefor I am not at all sanguine of fruitful result. The atmosphere in India does not seem to me to support your and other friends’ jubilation. I would like however to feel that there was no foundation for my fears. You may come whenever you are free.

172,"February 	9, 1931",STATEMENT TO THE PRESS,"
           ALLAHABAD, 
  February 	9, 1931  Mahatma 	Gandhi has issued a statement to the Press today at 11 a.m., asking 	that the fifteenth of February, the Shraddha 	Day, should be 	observed all over India as “Motilal Day”. The following is the 	full text of the statement : Next 	Sunday (15th instant) is the first day of the shraddha  	ceremony for the soul of the late Panditji Motilal Nehru. I suggest 	that as a mark of respect for his memory and to commemorate his 	unexampled sacrifice for the country, all work should be suspended 	and the day observed by the nation as one of greater dedication to 	the cause he loved and for which he lived. Those who believe in 	puri- ficatory fast will fast for the day breaking it in the 	evening. I 	suggest the following programme :   Meetings 		all over 		the country 		at 3 		p.m. so 		far as 		possible and so as to enable the peasantry to return to their homes in due time.  People 		should march in silent 		procession to 		the meetings 		with national flags. Perfect 		silence should be 		observed at 		the meetings.  The 		following declaration 		may be 		made by 		the assembly 		speaking word 		for word after the 		chairman: “We 		assembled in 		this meeting 		for commemorating 		the great 		and noble 		sacrifice of 		the late 		revered Pandit Motilal 		Nehru hereby 		solemnly resolve 		to dedicate ourselves 		more fully 		than hitherto 		to the 		cause of 		the country 		so as to 		hasten the 		advent of 		purna swaraj.”  Dedication 	may be in any of the following ways, for instance :   giving 		up intoxicating 		drink or 		drugs and persuading 		 others to 		do so,  undertaking 		to picket 		peacefully and 		without obstruction 		such drink and drug 		shops till such time as 		total prohibition 		becomes the 		law of the 		land or 		for a 		period, treatment 		similar to (a) 		and (b) regarding 		foreign  cloth, resolution to spin a minimum quantity of yarn per day,   	N.B. Spinning includes a knowledge of carding and so far as possible 	preparing one’s own slivers.  resolution 		to wear 		nothing but 		hand-spun and 		hand-woven khadi,  
  buying 	or selling 	such khadi on the 	memorial day,  giving 	to the national 	cause whatever is within 	one’s capacity 	or at least 	the day’s earnings,  doing 	any service 	or any 	act of self-denial 	not covered 	by the 	preceding clauses. 
 He further says :
  It 	is of the utmost 	importance that 	all suspension 	of work 	and every other act 	should be 	absolutely voluntary. 	There should 	be no 	compulsion of 	any kind whatsoever.  To 	make the 	demonstration impressive 	perfect discipline is 	essential.  Men, 	women and children 	belonging to 	all classes and 	communities are 	expected, in 	their tens of 	thousands, to 	take part in 	the demonstration.  If 	the people 	at large 	will it, complete 	boycott of 	foreign cloth 	can be 	accomplished on 	the memorial 	day. It 	would be 	the noblest 	monument that is 	within the 	power of 	the nation 	to raise 	in one 	day to a 	patriot who 	himself at 	one time was given to 	all sorts of foreign luxuries and 	who when he 	realized his 	duty discarded 	and burnt his costliest clothes as we generally discard worn out clothings.  So 	far as 	possible people should 	declare their individual act 	of self-denial 	or resolution 	at the 	meeting and 	in every 	case to 	the Congress 	sub-committee of his 	or her 	taluk or 	firka. 	An abstract 	of results 	should be sent 	to headquarters.

  	Your letter of the 25th reached me only today after a long, round 	about journey.  	For showing your diary [to Narandas], do not wait till you have gone 	back to live in the Ashram.  	When the path of dharma is clear, you should not be deterred from 	following it by Father’s or Mother’s threat to commit suicide or 	the former’s threat to leave the home and become a mendicant. Such 	threats are rarely carried out but even when they are carried out we 	may rest assured that that is for our good. In my view, Mother’s 	health has improved considerably. ‘Non-violent 	violence’ is certainly a meaningless phrase. Do 	not enlarge the field of your work beyond your capa- city. We 	should never seek work and, when new work comes to us unsought, 	we should think about our capacity before accepting it.  It 
 should be enough if we improve what we are doing and put it on firmer foundation. If we do that, we shall be able to produce all the results we aim at.

Mr. Gandhi made it quite clear that it was no question of repudiation, but what he wanted was the matter should be placed before an impartial tribunal, who would judge whether the loan was raised in the interests of India or not; and if not, the loan should be charged to the British revenues.

 MY DEAR GANGADHARRAO,
 Your letter. Confusion is worse confounded. Motilalji’s death has upset my apple cart. What cruel fate has in store for me I do not know.“One step enough for me.” I am here till 15th perhaps. Every- thing uncertain then. If ever a truce is declared, restoration of pro- perty like yours is a certainty. Meanwhile it is well that we become houseless, landless and luckless. Under organized despotism luckless- ness is luck, poverty a blessing, riches a curse, evil is enthroned, good- ness nowhere, in one clause all values are transposed. We have only felt from afar the heat of the fire we must pass through. Let us be ready for the plunge. That is my reading just now. And it fills me with joy. A halting peace will be dangerous and I can see no sign of real peace coming.

 Tuesday Morning, February 10, 1931
 CHI. NARANDAS,
 It seems you have started forwarding my post. I suppose I shall know by and by how you came to have an attack of fever.
 Kanta has asked me about the land revenue dues payable by the Ashram.
 I am still not in a position to give a considered opinion from here. We should carefully read the notice, etc. We should ascertain the law in regard to gift-lands. I have, however, just asked Mahadev and he tells me that a decision has already been taken not to pay the land revenue. It is, therefore, not necessary for me to express any opinion. I suppose the decision is, not to pay the land revenue, let the Government do what it will. Yes, I think that is the only proper course. It will test us. Or, rather, how do we know what will test us?
 Though Prabhavati does not wish to be examined by a doctor, for our satisfaction it is necessary that Haribhai should examine her.
 I suppose Mahadev keeps you informed about my programme. It is, however, likely to go on changing for some time. The only certain thing in a war is that nothing is certain. I shall know only on the 15th where I shall have to proceed on or after that date. We cannot, therefore, know for certain where and when we shall meet. If you have anything to ask me, write to me about it. If we meet, we shall discuss the matter further. I say “if we meet” deliberately. I see no signs of a settlement, and, if there is none, I think they are bound to arrest me. In these circumstances, I think it would be advisable to pro- ceed in every matter as if I were in prison. If the Lord of Janaki did not know what was to happen the next morning, how can we possibly know what the future holds in store for us?"

  	I have your letter. You should not get tired so soon. If we are 	imprisoned, we should welcome that. If they beat us, we should 	suffer the beating with Ramanama on our lips. A person who is out to 	serve, what choice can he or she have? How do we know that we shall 	escape with beating? We may even have to face bullets. We should 	show patience and be ready to pass through any test God may ordain 	for us.  	If, while doing service, we go to bed late and get up late, we need 	not feel unhappy about that. However, there should be no self- 	deception in this matter.  	Write to Vimu and ask her how, after hearing that in Borsad women 	were dragged by their hair, she still wants to have long hair. After 	this incident, the right course for all women engaged in service 
 is to get their hair cut short. But how can I convince women about this?
 I am here up to the 15th. Where I shall be after that, God alone knows. But it seems to me that we shall meet now.

            DEAR 	FRIEND,       ANAND 	BHAWAN, ALLAHABAD,  February 	14, 1931 
  	As  a  rule  I  neither  wait  for  outward  prompting  nor  stand  	on ceremony, but straightway seek personal contact with officials 	whenever I feel such contact is needed in the  interest  of  a  	cause.  But somehow or other, in the present case, I have missed the 	guidance of the inner voice. But I have received suggestions from 	friends whose advice I value that I should seek an interview with 	you before coming to any decision. I can no longer resist this 	advice. I am aware of the responsibility resting on my shoulders. It 	is heightened by the death of Pandit Motilal Nehru. I feel that 	without personal contact and heart to heart talk with you, the 	advice I may give my co-workers may not be right. The friends I have 	referred to read into the proceedings of the London Conference a 	meaning and a hope I would like to share. There are other 	difficulties to be overcome before I can advise sus- pension of 	civil disobedience and co-operation in the remaining work of the 	Conference. It was felt that, before the Working Com-mittee took any 	final decision, it might be better for me to meet you and discuss 	our difficulties with you. I therefore ask you, if you are willing, 	to send me an appointment as early as may be possible.libtech_117_footnotelibtech_118_footnoteI 	would like to meet not so much the Viceroy of India as the man in 	you.  	Could I expect a reply by Monday next ? In the absence of a reply I 	propose to leave Allahabad on Tuesday for Bombay, where I am 	expected to pass four days. My address in Bombay is Laburnum Road.

  	I got your letter. I don’t require any more details about your 	health now. If you give up all worries, your health will improve 	very rapidly. Let there be no weight on your mind. It is I who have 	to worry for you; why, then, do you worry? As you give up worrying, 	the body will become free from tensions and the fainting fits will 	gradually disappear. For your headaches, you should bandage your 	head with a mud pack be-fore going to bed, as I used to do. Twice or 	thrice every day, you should lie down flat on a bed, and rest. Even 	if you don’t get sleep, you should lie down. And see that you 	don’t suffer from constipation. Your diet is all right. I 	certainly cannot wish that you should eat beyond your appetite.  	Father came and stayed here for four days. On the whole, I found his 	health good just now. Rajendrababu was of course there, and with 	them was Anugrahababu.

 February 15, 1931
 At 3 p.m. Mr. Gandhi arrived at the meeting with, among others, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and took his seat on the rostrum . . .
 After the . . . flag song by a few ladies, Mr. Purushottam Das Tandon requested, at the suggestion of Mahatma Gandhi, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad to preside at the meeting.libtech_121_footnote
 Mr. Gandhi, who sat on the rostrum spinning on the takli, then addressed the audience. It was a belief, he said, entertained in all religions that a person’s soul never dies and the shraddha ceremony was performed with a view to giving peace to
 the deceased soul. A person generally does not leave his body without a single desire. Some desire is always left in him unfulfilled. Pandit Motilal Nehru, said Mr. Gandhi, died with a longing for swaraj. It was his constant wish that the entire country should be free and the reins of her government should be in the hands of her own representatives, and that justice should be done to the poorest in this land, be they Hindus, Moslems, Christians, Parsis, or Sikhs. It, therefore, struck him, said Mr.Gandhi, that some such things should be done that day as would real shraddha for giving peace to the soul of Pandit Motilal Nehru. He, therefore, issued an appeal for the celebration of the memorial day.
 Proceeding, Mr. Gandhi said that a bath in the Ganges was no shraddha. It certainly cleansed the body but purification of the inner selves could only be done by inward act.  Such act was the pledge which they had just then taken.   But it was useless  if they did not act up to it. They had to do something that would hasten the advent of swaraj and that they knew would give peace to the soul of Pandit Motilal Nehru. He knew of thousands of people giving their lives simply because of their anxiety not to break their pledges. Mr. Gandhi hoped that the people who had taken the vow to work for the attainment of complete swaraj would abide by their pledges.
 In the course of his observations Mr. Gandhi also appealed to the people to continue their efforts for bringing about Hindu-Muslim unity of which he was reminded by the recent disturbances in sacred Kashi. He added that the attainment of Hindu-Muslim unity was also the mission of Pandit Motilal Nehru’s life and it was Mr. Gandhi’s conviction that if the people combined to bring about that unity and attained it, other work for the attainment of swaraj would become very easy. He had learned, said Mr. Gandhi, that Hindus and Muslims in Kashi were cutting each other’s

 throats. He did not want swaraj at the expense of a single party. Neither he nor Pandit Motilal Nehru cared for swaraj exclusively for Hindus or Muslims. Swaraj under which Hindus and Muslims and others could live together was the aim of his life. It was, therefore, a matter for great shame if either community committed ex- cesses against the other. It would be appropriate if everyone in the audience took the pledge to promote communal unity.
 He added that in the course of the struggle they had lost Lokamanya Tilak, Hakim Saheb Ajmal Khan, Lala Lajpat Rai and Deshbandhu Das; and now Pandit Motilal Nehru was gone. It was time, therefore, that they did their duty and attained the good for which their leaders had died.

 DEAR SISTER,
 Under the impulse of pure affection and contrary to my wont, I ate your bread without inquiring how it was prepared. In order to be able to copy it, I asked for the recipe. Now that I know it I must tell you that it is forbidden food for me. I do not eat eggs nor cow’s or buffalo’s milk and at present no milk at all. Nor do I take sugar as a rule. I may not therefore take the loaf you have so kindly sent again. Let this discovery cause you no distress. That the loaf was forbidden food for me causes me none. The remembrance I have of your affection for me, I shall treasure.  If I have given you the information,  I have done so to tell you why I may not eat the second loaf and also to appear before you as I am with my limitations.

 SUJNA BHAISHRI,
 I got your letter and wire. I sent a wire in reply to your wire. One need not advise the teeth to take care not to hurt the tongue. I feel like that real mother in the story. Was she not ready to let go her claim to her son so that he may remain alive? Surely, women being dgged by their hair and boys being whipped for no crime cannot
 
 make me happy. I am, therefore, eager to go to any length to secure peace. If, however, that peace would be like the peace between the wolf and the lamb, rather than accept it I would let women be dishonoured, backs of innocent boys stained with blood, people’s homes looted and innocent people hanged. I always pray to God that  I, who am standing at Death’s door, may not put my signature to anything which might
 prove a trap for the country. I am going to Delhi today with this prayer in my heart. I do not feel presumptuous like the dog in the story who was walking under the cart. I know the limits  of my strength. I am but a particle of dust. Even such particle has a place in God’s creation, provided it submits to being trodden on. Everything is done by that Supreme Potter. He may use me as He wills. Whether it  is victory or defeat, it will be His. There is, therefore, no question of defeat, or, say, rather, that it is ever defeat for us. I think I have written enough. I have been able to write even as much as I have done because today is my silence day. But all this is by way of preface. My intention in writing this letter was to request you to persuade the princes to acknowledge the rights of their subjects. They wish to be partners; will they not, then, agree to give an account of their actions to the other partners?
 How much did Lady Pattani spin and how much khadi did she sell? What have you done for cow-protection?"

  CHI. 	NARANDAS,  	If you have not received from Swami the yarn which I spun in jail, 	write to him and obtain it from him; after giving to the All India 	Spinners’ Association and the Cow-protection Society such quantity 	from it as may have to be given to them, I should like you to use 	the rest to get a sari woven for Ba. Whether this can or should be 	done, 
 you may think over.
 A good many people  seem  to  be  ill  there.  Since  you  are there I don’t worry on this account. It is surprising how we invite illness the moment bread and other starchy foods are included  in  our diet. I have been able to keep away illness from me for many years by living only on fruits and nuts. If possible, exclude bread from   your diet unless you find it necessary for your health.   Ratalulibtech_125_footnoteand other vegetables are as good as bread. I wish that you should take whatever measure may be necessary so as not to fall ill. Have Krishna and Kanu returned from Wardha?

 What can be more uncertain in its time of coming than death? A person lying on his death-bed may survive and live to a ripe old age, and a robust young man may die suddenly in a moment. Still, we go on doing our work as if we shall never die. What right, then, do we have to expect certainty in any other matter.
It will be enough if we resolve about one thing :
 Abandon all duties and come to Me, the only Refuge.
If we can do this, what more do we require?
 Whatever thou dost, whatever thou eatest, Whatever thou offerest as sacrifice or gift, Whatever austerity thou dost perform, O Kaunteya, Dedicate all to Me.2

  At 	about 9 a.m., as Mahatmaji came out into the park, he was received 	with vociferous cheers by the crowd.  Addressing 	the people gathered there, Mahatma Gandhi said he was sorry that he 	saw no takli in 	Delhi, everywhere else he had seen taklis 	being plied by men 	and women.  Continuing, 	he said, because he was going to see the Viceroy today, it did not 	mean that they should go to sleep. They must continue to do 	something for winning swaraj.  Gandhiji 	laid great stress on the need of using pure khaddar.  The 	Hindustan Times, 19-2-1931         February 	17, 1931  There 	was no one present except Gandhi and myself. We began with general 	talk, in the course of which I dwelt upon the change in British 	opinion, which I hoped India would not make of no avail.    Future procedure. I sketched the ideas as they at present stand.  Scope 				of further 				discussions. I said 				there were 				three main 				principles in 				the Conference 				structure : 				Federation; Indian 				responsibility; reservations and 				safeguards. These 				were fundamental, but 				the detailed 				application of these 				principles was open 				to further 				examination and 				discussion. It 				would be 				as unprofitable for 				his friends to 				try  to pull 				out the linchpins 				of federation 				and safeguards 				as it would 				be, say, 				for my 				Conservative friends to go back on the principle of responsibility.  He 				said that Congress 				could not give 				an undertaking 				in no circumstances 				to resume civil 				disobedience. I said 				that I could 				not bind them to 				any such pledge; 				but that 				the whole 				point was whether 				he and 				his friends had 				in mind 				a temporary 				and grudging 				truce or a genuine 				attempt to make 				a permanent 				peace. He said 				: “Certainly 				the latter”, but 				that he only 				wished to 				guard himself against 				imputations of bad 				faith if, as he trusted would not be, they found themselves wholly mistaken in the spirit of    
 the later discussions.

I said 			that I regarded 			the question 			as academic, 			but presumed 			he could 			discuss it if he so 			desired.

He 			attached no 			importance to 			proportions, provided 			they could 			get enough 			to have 			their various elements 			represented and to 			enable them to 			pull their due 			weight on 			Committees, etc. 			If necessary, 			other sections 			of opinion 			could be 			increased too. He 			said he 			thought it 			might be 			necessary to 			ask the Working 			Committee for 			a few 			more key men. I told 			him that I had 			contemplated a 			Congress representation 			of about 			12, and 15 			or 20 were larger 			figures than I 			could think necessary. 			He agreed 			to keep 			the numbers 			as low 			as he could; 			and said 			he would 			consider a 			suggestion I 			made about 			working on the 			plan of “substitute” 			delegates, to bring 			others in without 			swelling the official numbers.  We 			then got 			on the 			practical points, 			if, as 			he said civil 			disobedience was 			suspended. I 			at once took him 			upon the 			word ‘suspended’ 			and said 			that what I had 			in mind 			was effective 			abandonment. He said 			he did 			not attach importance 			to the 			word, but wished to protect the position defined in paragraph 3 above.   
 Practical points were :
  Release 	of satyagrahis, 	including some sentenced under martial law 	in Sholapur. 	I said 	that my distinction 	of principle 	was violence 	and inciters 	to violence 	on the 	one side, about whom I 	could do 	nothing, and 	non-violent satyagrahis 	on the other.  Meerut 	prisoners. He 	argued for 	their discharge, 	but not, 	as I 	under- stood, 	as a 	condition. I 	said that they had 	nothing to 	do with civil 	disobedience, but 	I was 	as much 	disturbed as 	he was at 	the protracted 	proceedings, and would examine the case with a view to seeing whether 
 
 anything could be done to accelerate the conclusion of the trial. More than that I could not say, as I could recognize no association between Communists and non-violent satyagrahis.
  He 	raised the 	question of 	the Bengal 	detenus, not, as I 	understood, as 	a condition, but 	in order 	to inform 	me that 	a great 	many people had been 	locked up 	who in 	no way deserved 	it. I 	omitted to 	make the obvious 	point that 	each case was submitted 	to two 	Judges, but 	told him that, if 	he wished 	to submit 	any evidence 	of a 	case in 	which the 	police had 	dropped on the 	wrong man, 	I would 	pass it 	on to the Governor 	of Bengal 	who would look into it 	personally. He 	did not seem to 	attach great 	importance to the question.  Land 	and property. 	I said 	that third  parties 	 who  had  bought 	 could not 	be disturbed. 	Any adjustment 	that was 	requisite for 	settlement would have to be   through 	 unofficial  agency. 	  He  brought 	 forward  a good 	many technical points, 	on which 	I said 	little beyond adher- 	ing to 	the main principle 	that Government 	could be 	generous with 	what was 	still in 	its own possession, 	but not with 	what third parties had 	acquired. He promised to submit a note.  Remission 	of fines. 	Those that were uncollected I 	said could probably 	be remitted. 	But I 	could not 	press local Governments 	to entertain 	the suggestion of 	restoring fines 	already collected. This 	was a matter 	on which 	local Governments would exercise their own 	discretion. He 	did not 	press this very hard.  Restoration 	of presses 	and securities. 	I said 	the same 	principle must 	apply, i.e., what was 	in Government’s 	possession could be 	restored, but 	securities that 	had been forefeited fell 	into same category as 	fines paid.  Reinstatement 	of officials 	resigned or dismissed. 	I said 	that I could 	not press any 	local Government to 	reinstate any 	officials whose places 	had been 	filled; and 	that the utmost I 	could do 	would be 	to invite local 	Governments to 	examine all 	cases on 	their merits with the 	object of 	acting as 	generously as 	circumstances permitted 	towards those who had 	resigned, whether out 	of pressure 	or because 	they had been swept off 	their feet by 	the civil disobedience 	movement. Dismissals stood 	in a 	somewhat different 	category, and I 	anticipated Governments 	would feel greater 	difficulty about 	this class of case 	inasmuch as 	officials had 	presumably not 	been dismissed without 	cause; but I was ready 	to invite 	local Governments to 	examine these cases also 	on their merits. Repressive ordinances. I said these could go, except the Burma Terro- 
 rist Ordinance, adding that, if the Press reverted to encouragement of violence, it would be necessary for Government to take action against it.
  Punitive 	Police, he asked, 	should be withdrawn. 	I said 	it was 	a new 	point to 	me, but would if 	necessary invite 	local Governments 	to consider it. 
    Enquiries 			into police excesses. He 			dropped the 			idea of 			a general enquiry, but 			pressed very 			hard for special 			enquiries, if necessary 			in camera. 			I put 			the counter- arguments, 			and said that I 			could not go 			further than 			promise investigation 			by local 			Governments and 			if desired 			by myself 			of specific 			complaints. This he 			said was not 			much, as the 			truth could only be 			ascertained by 			cross-examination of 			evidence on 			both sides. I 			told him 			that there was 			so much 			on the 			other side that I 			did not think 			he was entitled 			to press 			for enquiries 			that could only have 			the purpose 			of placing 			the police 			in a position 			of defendants, 			and to this 			I was not able 			to agree. 			I would 			see any 			matter he 			chose to 			submit and 			he must 			trust to 			my assurance that 			local Governments 			would examine 			it fairly. 			I had 			also no objection 			to publicly 			exonerating those who 			had brought charges from any imputation of bad faith. He was not satisfied with this.  He 			read over to 			me other points on 			which he 			proposes to 			speak tomorrow. 			Salt; Peaceful 			picketing and there 			may have 			been something else.  I 			told him 			that I 			thought it 			was of 			great importance, if 			we were to 			succeed in 			our peace 			efforts, that 			the temperature 			should be 			lowered, and 			asked him 			to get 			Bombay to go slow in picketing, etc. He promised to do so.  We 			agreed to 			meet again alone 			tomorrow with 			possibly a 			larger meeting 			with others 			in to follow.  Although 			I made 			the point 			in Paragraphs 			3 and 			8 that 			I drew 			a clear distinction 			between action by 			Congress on 			the basis 			of a 			temporary truce 			with the intention 			of resuming the 			campaign, and 			a genuine desire 			to co-operate  in 			constructive work, 			it is important 			to leave 			him in 			no doubt when 			we meet 			again (though 			I don’t 			think there is any) 			that the various 			items of action 			by Government 			are dependent 			on effective 			abandonment of the movement.libtech_128_footnote

208,"February 17, 1931",INTERVIEW WITH VICEROY (GANDHIJI’S REPORT),"
    
 [February 17, 1931]libtech_129_footnote
 The Viceroy had impressed me very well. He had impressed me as much as Lord Reading had done, except that Lord Reading was clever and he took undue advantage of my discussions with him. Lord Irwin talked to me in a friendly way and frankly admitted that it was his mistake that we had not met so far. The second thing he admitted was that the British public had been aroused the most by my move- ment. This attitude of his shows that he wants to make peace. He desires peace because he has been touched by the struggle. He is wondering how long he can allow the struggle to continue and feels that now he would be obliged to rely on the gun alone.
I took out the resolution at the very outset.
 MAHADEV DESAI. Was there no talk about your letter ?
 GANDHIJI. No, there was no specific mention of that but I felt that he liked the letter. I certainly told him that I was ready for a settlement and  in the  mean  time  Shuaib  had  come  and  asked me whether I would not write a letter in this manner, that I had placed that matter before the Working Committee and they approved of it, and so I had written. I went on reading the resolution. About the initial portion regarding the constitution, he said: “There is no diffi- culty about discussing anything, but I can’t say how much you will gain out of it. But you can certainly open the discussion.” I did not make any attempt to know what his views were. But he said if we wanted to discuss the clause regarding secession we should do that only in the Conference. But no one was going to listen to it and if I pressed the point too much, persons like him who wanted to help me would be put in an awkward position.
 Then immediately he came to the truce terms. We discussed which of the conditions could be dropped. And the discussion on the inquiry itself took up half the time. The greatest difficulty is about the issue of the inquiry. He is not against it but he said that it made his position very delicate.“Will you be satisfied if  I  conduct  the inquiry?” Thus by asking this question he had given up his case. I
 
 asked him: “How will you conduct the inquiry? Have you ever heard of a person having dis-pensed justice without hearing both the sides? You have our unsifted account and a similar account given by the police. What will you make out of it?” He agreed that nothing could be achieved. “The position today is that you have declared us liars before the whole world. How will it behove you to negotiate with liars like us? Have a look at the whole communique. Should we swallow the allegations that everything we said was fabricated?” He had no reply to give to all this (At this point Ansari came, so some things had to be repeated.) One thing was clear from his talk that those people are also tired just as some of us are. “I shall certa-inly send a cable that you want the clause regarding secession to be inclu-ded but the position of people like me who want to help you will become very awkward.” I can understand that. He apologized about the matter of the public debt. He said, “So far I thought you wanted repudiation of the debts, but you have certainly every right to demand distribution of the war expenses. We shall see how we can examine the question of fair distribution. I also desire the same thing as you do regarding the Native States, but you have to persuade the States themselves. We shall not prevent you from doing so. I wish to give you as much help as I can.”
 He  admits  that  all  our  demands  are  just.  He  did  not   say that even one of them was unjust but only put forward his diffi- culties. At the very beginning I explained to him  whatever  I  had  to say about our conditions. He said it would be difficult to release the Meerut prisoners and he wondered how much pressure he could bring to bear upon the Governor of Bengal regarding the release of detenus there. Moreover, all these things might be done but he asked, “How can we do them if you want to make that a condition prece- dent? We have collected fines from many; how can we refund them all? How can we pay compensation for property burnt down or destroyed? The proceeds of property sold, however, can be refunded.” I said : “Can you say this even in those cases where the market value has not been taken into acount and you have got rupees ten for a property worth rupees one thousand? Is there equity in this?” He saw the point and asked us to give him a list of the losses incurred. He saw the point regarding taxes also. “How can you exact taxes from people who have been ruined?”
 About the fairness of taxation, I told him the story of Mah- mood. Once a woman went to him to seek justice. Mahmood told her
 : “You live so far away that I cannot carry justice there.” She said : “Stop ruling over us.” Mahmood said, “Yes, that region should be excluded from the empire.” Irwin laughed and  said  that  justice should be done.
 (While speaking of my keenness for peace, I casually told him : “I wrote to you a letter even from Yeravda but you did not reply to it.
 I do not complain but I want to show you how keen I am on a settlement.”)
 He asked me, “How can we throw the police to the wolves?” I said, “We do not want that. We want the enquiry only to establish whether the police have committed any atrocities.”
 The discussion about the inquiry alone took half the time. That means they consider the condition to be very difficult. Only for that reason will it be an acid test for us.
 The Governor of Bombay was sitting outside. I was introduced to him. I could not talk to him because I was in a hurry for my meal and the A.D.C. came and told me that my car had arrived.  The  Viceroy had also asked me whether it would do if the Governor conducted an independent enquiry. I asked him “In what way is the Governor in a better position than you to do so? Why should we submit to the excesses of the police? Why shouldn’t they, over whom we are going to rule one day, consider themselves our servants right from today itself ?”
 The gist of the whole talk is that he very much wants a settle- ment and the other thing is that if  we  give  up  a  single  point  of ours, our whole case will be ruined. I on my part told the Viceroy that if he granted that the Congress was something to reckon with, he must accede to our reasonable demands.
 The reference to Mirabehn came up in the beginning and in the end. At the end, I said, “She must have cooked my meal and must be waiting for me.” In the beginning I had said, “How can I sever my connection with you? I have so many English friends. Take for ins- tance Mirabehn. I don’t know her family and her father and yet she has completely lost herself in me. Andrews keeps sending me cables from Cape Town asking me to arrive at a settlement. How can I give up this Andrews? Horace Alexander also writes to me and he advises me not to arrive at a settlement. Having written that he apologizes!  Is it possible for me to sever all these relations? And yet if co-operation  is not possible, I shall have to do so.
 “If both of us desire not to quarrel, we shall not quarrel. I have come with a determination not to fight as far as possible.” I had assured him that “I do not want to tell you anything except the truth. I do not want to conceal anything from you, I do not want to have a single mental reservation. Hence you can tell me whatever you wish to. You can say whatver you have heard about my associates and tell me whatever you want, can question me about them.”
 Talking about the release of the Meerut prisoners, he expressed his difficulty but he described the sentence passed on the Sholapur Martial Law prisoners as preposterous.libtech_130_footnote

210,,MESSAGE TO VISITORS,"
           DELHI, "
211,"February 	18, 1931",INTERVIEW WITH VICEROY (VICEROY’S VERSION),"
  February 	18, 1931  Mahatmaji 	came outlibtech_133_footnoteat 	1.40 p.m. and was cheered by hundreds of visitors, including a large 	number of ladies, who were anxious to have his darshan.  Mahatmaji 	put two questions to the crowd assembled. He first asked : How 	many of you are dressed in  khaddar?  Everybody 	raised his hand.   Then Mahatmaji asked  :  	I want only those to raise hands who are dressed in hand-spun and 	hand-made khaddar.  Nearly 	thirty per cent of the assembled raised their hands. Then he asked 	them how many were dressed in foreign clothes. Only three hands were 	raised. He told them : Use 	khaddar. This is my message. Now go home, all of you.  Then 	with a smile he hurried to his car which drove him to the Viceregal 	Lodge. The crowd raised shouts of “Mahatma 	Gandhi ki Jai” and 	melted away.  The 	Hindustan Times, 20-2-1931         February 	18, 1931  I 	had a 	further talk 	with Mr. Gandhi this 	afternoon. He 	began by 	telling me 	that he had, as requested 	by me yesterday, sent a telegramlibtech_134_footnoteto Bombay 	saying that he had 	been informed 	that picketing 	was taking 	a serious 	form and was in 	danger of 	leading to 	violence, and 	that that kind of thing 	must be 	stopped. He 	promised to 	let me 	know the result.  He 	then proceeded to develop the points left over from yesterday 	beginning  with 	:  Punitive Police. I told him that, as I had said yesterday, it was a new point   to 	me and that I 	imagined the 	action of 	local Governments would 	be dictated 	by the 	circumstances of 	each case. I 	could imagine cases in 	which local Governments 	might be 	willing to 	withdraw them as 	also others in 	which such withdrawal 	would have to be postponed. We left it at the point that I said in the event of a settlement being     
 reached I would draw local Governments’ attention to the matter.
  He 	developed an 	argument of 	which this was the gist. 	In districts 	where resort 	has been 	had to 	coercive processes for 	collection of 	taxes due, such further 	collection shall be 	suspended pending 	examination of cases 	by an officer 	through an enquiry, 	in which 	the people 	will be afforded 	an opportunity 	of stating 	their case. His point 	was that 	many of the 	coercive processes have 	been extra legal, 	and have 	imposed far 	greater material damage 	on the 	people than the 	value of 	the tax due to 	be collected. 	He was 	only asking for 	the right of 	proving such a 	case as 	would lead 	Government to 	redress real injustice. 
 I said that without fuller knowledge of the facts and the issues involved I could express no opinion beyond telling him that it seemed the kind of thing in which serious difficulty would be likely to arise. I told him that in my view, as in the case we were discussing yesterday of enquiries into police excesses, I regarded the whole state in which we now found ourselves as that of something very like a state of war. Under such conditions no doubt great hardship was unavoidable, but it had by no means been confined to one side. His presentment of the case seemed to me to suggest that we were dealing with unjustifiable departures from a state of affairs which had in other respects been normal, and appeared to rest on the assumption that Government was in the dock and under the necessity of justifying its action to people who had themselves been wholly free from blame. He would not expect me to accept that kind of interpretation of the present position.
 He answered this by reverting to his original arugment that he was pleading for no more than redress of what he believed he could show to be a manifest excess of administrative action leading to real injustice.
  Salt. 	Here he developed 	the romantic 	side of 	the salt campaign, 	dwelling much 	on the inhumanity 	of depriving 	families who had natural 	opportunities of doing 	so, of 	taking advantage of 	them to 	manufacture salt. 	(I am not 	sure whether it confined 	to salt 	for their own 	use or not.) 	What he 	desired was 	that Government should 	either alter the law or 	acquiesce in 	its breach, 	by way 	of not 	prohibiting such 	private action. He 	instanced the Sarda Act and the Age of Consent Act as examples of 	Government looking the 	other way 	in matters 	of administration. 
 I told him that there was a wide distinction in my view between Government administering a particular law with discretion, through instructions communicated to its own officers, and Government advertising to the world that it was prepared to condone such breaches. The latter really amounted to an invitation to all and sundry  to commit them. If, as he said, such informal breaches of the Salt Law had been in the habit of taking place before, I had no reason to suppose that Government would wish to administer the Salt Law any more or any less strictly than had been the case hitherto.
 He said that he was not asking for any public declaration, but for a private assurance that Government would not interfere with private breaches of the law; he had not in mind raids on salt depots or anything on that scale.
 I told him that I felt considerable difficulty about his propositon having regard to the fact that the circumstances surrounding private breaches of the law had greatly altered since his salt campaign.
  Peaceful 	picketing. He 	asked me 	whether I 	took any objection 	to its 	continuance. I 	told him that peaceful 	picketing appeared to me 	a misnomer. 	I had 	a long 	list of cases 	on my table 	showing the 	violent results that 	had flowed from 	so- called 	peaceful picketing, and I 	found it 	impossible to 	believe that peaceful 	picketing could 	fail to produce similar results in future. I quoted Benares, 	Amritsar, etc. I further said that 	I could not 	tolerate interference 	with legitimate trade, 	as  evinced  by  Congress 	intimidation in the 	matter by 	way of 	sealing foreign cloth, 	mock funerals 	and all the rest. 	Lastly, I said 	that picketing as a 	political weapon was 	objectionable and its 	continuance was 	quite incompatible with 	Congress coming into 	Conference discussions. 	He was 	really setting about his 	principal purposes 	of swadeshi 	and temperance 	in the 	wrong way 	by pursuing 	a policy 	at once 	negative and belligerent; 	why could 	he not 	apply himself to 	the positive 	and pacific 	programme of preaching 	swadeshi and temperance 	without interference with personal liberty? 
 To all this he said he had no wish to  do  more  than  peacefully  persuade;   he only attached importance to it as a social and economic  business,  not  pri- marily political. He and the Congress would prohibit violence, mock funerals
 and all such forms of pressure; but he could not see why people might not stand near a grog-shop in the endeavour to reform the drunkard; if violence or molestation occurred, it could be dealt with under the ordinary law I told him that experience was against him in this matter, and that I feared it would not be easily possible for him to get the subtle distinction present to his own mind observed in practical action by many different people in different parts of the country.
 2.I then took up a few general matters. First of all I explained to him that in everything I had said I was only speaking personally for myself, and that on many matters it would be necessary to consult local Governments or the Secretary of State, and on all matters it would be necessary for me to consult my own council. This he recognized. I then told him that I had heard of the probability of himself and Vallabhbhai Patel visiting Gujarat. I could have little doubt that, if they went there, they would stimulate the civil disobedience movement, in which the Government of Bombay could evidently not acquiesce. I asked him therefore to keep himself and Vallabhbhai away for the present at all events. He told me that he had just summoned Vallabhbhai to come here and went on to say that, if our negotiations succeeded, no difficulty would arise; if they failed, I understood him to say that he and his friends
 had decided, or might decide, to offer themselves for re-arrest. It would then be for Government to do what they wished, but he would certainly when his work was finished here wish to go to Gujarat and could not do otherwise.
 3.I finally told him that everything I had said about possibilities of reciprocal action by Government was dependent upon the effective abandonment of the civil disobedience campaign.  He asked me what this meant; it would be impossible for him  to agree to a period of ten days or fifteen days before reciprocal action was taken by Government. I said I had not that in mind; what I was rather concerned with was that before Government [took] reciprocal action they should be satisfied that the Working Committee’s instructions had in fact reached local organizations and that they were being loyally carried out. There was no question of impugning the trustworthiness of the Working Committee, who might reach an agreement with Government here; on the other hand, it was not unreasonable that Government should be satisfied that the agreement honourably reached by the Working Committee was in fact being honourably given effect to by the local organizations.
 He appeared to accept this.
 4.I then recurred to the question we had discussed yesterday as  to  the contingent resumption by Congress of civil disobedience. I said that it would be an impossible position for me to recommend to His Majesty’s Government to take all the steps we had been discussing if they were at any moment in the course of subsequent discussions liable to be told by Congress that the provisional conclu- sions arrived at, at any stage, were unpalatable and they therefore broke up and went back to their campaign. Could he give me any assurance on the point?
 He said that, as he had explained yesterday and as I had accepted, Congress could not pledge themselves, either for all time or in this particular matter, not again to have resort to civil disobedience; but if they went into the Conference he would be prepared to say that they went in meaning to strain every nerve to make it a success. He did not however wish to conceal from me that, if, when the discussions had concluded, the scheme was still unsatisfactory to them, they must reserve their liberty to return to civil disobedience. He could not anticipate what their decision might be; circumstances might alter, they might desire to wait and see what happened in Parliament; but in no case would he anticipate recurrence to civil disobedience while the discussions were proceeding; and he hoped that it would never be necessary at all.
 5.I asked him whether he thought, in spite of the attitude I had felt necessary to adopt as regards salt, peaceful picketing, enquiries into excesses and other matters on which I had been unable to meet him, it would be desirable to have a somewhat more formal discussion? In such event I should contemplate that we might have invited Sastri, Sapru, Jayakar, Shafi, Chhatari, possibly a non-official European from the Assembly, another non-official Moslem, Malaviya, Ansari, Bikaner and Bhopal. He appeared to welcome the idea rather warmly, saying that he thought Malaviya was
 
 indispensable, but added that he might like to bring one or two of his own and instanced Jawaharlal, Vallabhbhai and Sen Gupta. He might have liked, he added, to have had Subhas Bose, but he was at present in prison. I said that in such case I should propose to reinforce myself by representatives of my Government.
 I told him that I would consider this and let him know, if I could, tomorrow, adding that I thought, if such further talks were held, a formal communique should be issued after each meeting to avoid public misunderstanding. He agreed and said that he would hold himself at my disposal.
 6.The general impression I gathered was that, though there are a good many snags still in the road, he is disposed to co-operate. The principal snags evidently are the question of the scope of further discussions and of contingent resumption of the campaign. On the latter however I believed it to be impracticable to get any greater measure of assurance than he was willing to give me in our final interview this evening.
 In conclusion and not connected with the above, he mentioned the case of Bhagat Singh. He did not plead for  commutation,  although  he  would,  being opposed to all taking of life, take that course himself. He also thought it would have an influence for peace. But he did ask for postponement in present circums- tances. I contented myself with saying that, whatever might be the decision as to exact dates, I could not think there was any case for commutation which might not be made with equal force in the case of any other violent crime. The   Viceroy’s   powers of  commutation were designed for   use   on  well-known  grounds of clemency,  and I could not feel that they ought to be invoked on grounds that were admittedly political.libtech_135_footnote

212,"February 18, 1931",INTERVIEW TO ASSOCIATED PRESS OF INDIA,"
  
 DELHI,
 February 18, 1931
 Mahatma Gandhi unlike yesterday had taken leave of the Viceroy inside the room and went straight to his car. He was met by the Associated Press correspondent who asked him whether the talks were over. He looked thoughtful and with his usual smile said :
All I can say is I am not coming tomorrow.
 Will you consult the Working Committee before coming back ?
I cannot say yet but am not coming tomorrow.
 Replying to another question, he said humorously :
 You can say, it is all hanging up in the clouds.
 Are you issuing an official statement?
No.
 The Hindustan Times, 20-2-1931
 "
213,"February 18, 1931",INTERVIEW WITH VICEROY (GANDHIJI’S REPORT),"
  
 February 18, 1931 Today we were with the Viceroy for slightly less time than yesterday, and so reached home at 5.30 p.m. Today’s talk was more concentrated and the man was more
 cautious than yesterday. It was a most strenuous fight today, but it left no unplea- santness in the mouth at the end. Once or twice we felt that the hope of a settlement was dwindling but thereafter did not feel like that. Today the salt tax, suspension of collection of land revenue and picketing alone were discussed. When I explained to him the whole position about salt, the Viceroy said : “You think any Government in the world can tolerate disobedience of its laws?”
GANDHIJI.	I may enunciate a counter-proposition to it: No
Government in the world can enforce all its laws.
 I then cited the example of the Sarda Act and mentioned Act III of 1885 of South Africa and the Gold Law, and told him that the Government was supporting the demand for the protection of those who were guilty of their breach. I talked about the Age of Consent Act and asked him why the Government tolerated the breach of all those laws. “I know that you have issued a circular that no action should he taken under the Sarda Act.”
 VICEROY. That is a confidential circular.
 
 G. I do not want you to issue a public circular. We shall tell  our people quietly that they can make and collect salt without any fear.
 V. I am seized of your position.
 He used these words repeatedly. About the Salt Act, he even said that when we would have our own Government, we could repeal it.
G. How can I betray the thousands of people whom I advised to
break this law?
 About the land tax also, the Viceroy had administrative difficulties.
 G. Our case is that the Government has taken more coercive steps than were necessary and the officers have exceeded the instructions given to them. In such cases the tax ought not to be collected.
 V. Who is to decide that?
 G. You may appoint an officer for the purpose, but he should have our approval. He should only inquire whether there have or have not been excesses as alleged by us.
 The Viceroy opposed picketing strongly. I explained to him that it had been going on all the time. “It is being done for many years now and there is nothing against it in the Common Law. You can take action under the Common Law if there is breach of peace or violence.”
 V. But you have made picketing a political weapon.
 G. It may have a political result, but essentially, it is an economic, social and moral weapon. Even if Lancashire stops itstextile business, we would still have to declare boycott of foreign cloth and also continue picketing. Even if you forgo the revenue from the sale of liquor, we would still have to take steps against those who drink.
 In short, the Viceroy was convinced of the justice of all our demands, but he talked of administrative difficulties. I reminded him : “There is no just grievance in law without a remedy.” After this he asked me many questions.
 V. If you attend the Round Table Conference and the results are not to your satisfaction, must you resume civil disobedience?
G. I will have to unless we feel that we shall get something from
 the changes proposed. Otherwise I shall have no choice but to resume the movement.
 V. On further thought, I find this position dangerous for the Government. How can we stultify ourselves like that? In that case, would it not be better that you do not attend the Round Table Conference?
 Then there was again some discussion about safeguards. Regarding defence,
 the Viceroy said : Suppose a committee of military experts  proves  to  your satisfaction that India cannot defend herself without British troops, even then would you wish that that safegurd should be removed?
 G. What do you mean by “proving to my satisfaction”? I would invite German, American and other experts and confront your mili- tary experts with them. If, after their discussions, I feel that we must retain the British army for some time, I would definitely agree to do so.
 The Viceroy found this whole discussion embarrassing.
 V. Now I am fully seized of your position. I shall discuss the whole thing with my advisers and we shall then resume our discussions if necessary. Meanwhile those three friendslibtech_136_footnotedesire an informal committee to be set up, consisting of my advisers, the Maharaja of Bikaner, Malaviya and the Nawab of Chhatari. You also may ask some members of the Working Committee to join it.
G. All right, we are prepared to place all our cards on the table.
 During the evening walk, Bapu made some more remarks about these discussions.
G. The suggestion regarding informal talks came from those
 three friends. They had it in their mind right from Allahabad.  I  believe that their intention is honourable, but the thing may also be the Viceroy’s diplomacy. But that does not matter. He may invite as many persons as he likes. I did not suggest any name.  It will serve as  a means of propaganda for us.
 BIRLA. Did today’s discussions give any cause for disappointment?
 G. No, he was as sweet as before. We had a few sharp exchanges, but they were of little moment. There were one or two small but rich titbits which cannot be made public, but which will give you an idea of how cordial the talks had been. Once he told me that it was his dream to take me to England and introduce me to members of all the parties there. He appealed to me to forget about civil disobedience and to have faith in their sincerity and proceed accordingly. Then as  I was going to his bathroom, he accompanied me and said : “Now tell me whether I did not do well in not arresting you in your Ashram?”  I said : “How do we know it? A crowd of thousands had assembled in the Ashram, and I heard that a special was waiting for me and that I would be arrested at 12 o’clock. So I peacefully went to sleep.” At this, the Viceroy had a hearty laugh. I continued: “Many friends had
 
 thought that this salt movement would fizzle out, and said  that Mahatma Gandhi would get tired in 20 days or so and that the Government would not take any notice of the movement. But who knew what was going to happen?” The Viceroy said : “You planned  a fine strategy round the issue of salt.”
 These two titbits are not worth narrating anywhere. Now the third one. I talked about Bhagat Singh. I told him : “This has no connection with our discussion, and it may even be inappropriate on my part to mention it. But if you want to make the present atmosphere more favourable, you should suspend Bhagat Singh’s execution.” The Viceroy liked this very much. He said : “I am very greateful to you that you have put this thing before me in this manner. Commutation of sentence is a difficult thing, but suspension is certainly word considering.”
I said about Bhagat Singh: “He is undoubtedly a brave man but
 I would certainly say that he is not in his right mind. However, this is the evil of capital punishment, that it gives no opportunity to such a man to reform himself. I am putting this matter before you as a humanitarian issue and desire suspension of sentence in order that there may not be unnecessary turmoil in the country. I myself would release him, but I cannot expect any Government to do so. I would not take it ill even if you do not give any reply on this issue.”
 When they were talking about members of the Working Committee, Bapu mentioned Subhas Bose too.
 V. Subhas is not a member of the Working Committee.
 G. No, he is not. And he is my opponent and will denounce me; still, if he wants to attend, we must give him a chance to do so.
 The Viceroy said that he would think about this suggestion too.
 Last eveninglibtech_137_footnotewe walked for about 11/2 hours. During that time we dis- cussed the proposal to hold informal talks and talked about those pleasant titbits. The question was why we should join these informal talks.
G. It behoves satyagrahis to do so.  The suggestion for  informal
 talks was not the Viceroy’s, but of those three friends. If we join the talks afterwards and break them, that would be  deceiving  them. Instead, we should discuss the matter right now and state our demands. We would then be able to decide whether we should join the talks or not. I did not demand that all of us should join the talks, but merely said that anyone who wanted to attend might do so. I even said that probably no  one would like to  join.   For me, it would provide an
 
 excellent opportunity for propaganda.
 JAWAHARLAL. The Viceroy has the virtues and weaknesses of the average Englishman.
 G. Yes.
 PATTABHI. He has got the weaknesses of an Englishman.
 G. No. These two days’ talks have not given me the impression that he is a weak man. He is a strong man and a thoroughly capable man. He is also a democrat.  I know, he says, “I can do the thing but  I will not do the thing myself.” I have read some of his speeches wherein I have observed his firmness with admiration and despair. I remember his reply to a deputation of the Ahmediya community. They wanted him to do according to the Muslims’ wishes in  the  matter of Palestine. He said the British Government had always adhered to certain fundamental principles of justice and they would never swerve from them. They would not do so in this instance as they have not done up to now. He did not give them any empty promises, he did not use any vague phrases, but was as firm as he could be. That is his strength.
 In the titbits I mentioned yesterday, I forgot one. The Viceroy had received a telegram about picketing. He asked me : “Do you approve of such picketing?” I said that I had already sent a telegram that I did not approve of it. He also mentioned another telegram. He said that there was a telegram from Gujarat saying that Gandhiji and Vallabhbhai would now visit Gujarat and that their presence was likely to prove very dangerous. He wanted me to call away Vallabhbhai here! Gandhiji laughed and said : “I have called him here.” So the Viceroy said : “That’s capital.”

215,,MY NOTEBOOK,"
  
 MOTILALJI’S DEATH
 Pandit Motilalji’s death means to me more even than to the brave widow whose sorrow it is my privilege during these days to share. I take the blow as an additional test of my faith in God’s greatness and goodness. Panditji has died a true warrior’s death. It is therefore well with him. He lives more amply and more truly by dying. I pray to God that he may endow me with greater consecration to the service of the cause for which alone life is worth living in these days of purification through sacrifice and suffering.
 MEMORIAL
 Friends have asked me to advise a memorial subscription such as was raised to the memory of the late Hakim Saheb Ajmal Khan, Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das and Lala Lajpat Rai. I have resisted the temptation because (1) I personally cannot shoulder the burden; (2) I may any day be summoned to Yeravda or some such place of recreation; and (3) the only true memorial that can just now be raised to the memory of the deceased patriot is by intenser dedication to hasten the advent of swaraj.
 MAULANA MAHOMED ALI
 I was privileged to offer my tribute to the memory of Maulana Mahomed Ali by sending from Yeravda a cable message to Maulana Shaukat Ali. But I cannot resume the Editorship of Young India without publicly declaring that in him I have lost one whom I rejoiced to call brother and friend and the nation has lost a fearless patriot. We had differences of opinion between us, but love that cannot stand the strain of differences is like “a sounding brass and tinkling cymbal”.
 PEACE NEGOTIATIONS
 It is not for the soldier to worry about peace. For him both struggle and peace are alike. He has to do with the utmost joy the task that comes to him without counting the costs or the consequence. The consequence he knows. The cost is never too high for him.
 PICKETING
 Picketing is a dharma only when it is absolutely non-violent. Those who have no faith in non-violence had better give it up altogether. I can find out ways and means of combating the inroads
 of foreign cloth even though there be no picketing, but I know for certain that boycott brought about by violent picketing is bound to fail in the end. It was this knowledge that induced me last March to entrust picketing of foreign-cloth shops and drink and drug shops to women who are instinctively non-violent.
 Violence in picketing can be both active and passive.  The passive type can be more dangerous than the active. Both must be shunned.
 KHADI
 Without   khadi   there   is  no  boycott.	Therefore we must concentrate on khadi.

219,"February 	19, 1931",INTERVIEW WITH VICEROY (VICEROY’S VERSION),"
       February 	19, 1931  Mr. 	Gandhi came to see me at 2.45 p.m. this afternoon.  I 	explained to him that, before any further conference of a more 	extended character was possible, I felt it would be necessary to 	make a referencelibtech_142_footnoteto 	the Secretary of State as to the scope of the discussions and also 	to local Governments on the specific matters raised. I said that I 	supposed His Majesty’s Government would want a few days for 	consideration, and that in the mean time I was exploring with my 	Council the idea of a wider conference. I said I thought it was 	unlikely that this could take place before next Thursday or Friday.  Mr. 	Gandhi replied that he 	was in 	general agreement 	with what I 	had said, 	though he was disposed to 	regret the delay suggested. He said he would naturally have desired 	to go to Gujarat, 	but would 	defer to my 	representations that 	for himself and 	Vallabhbhai to 	go there at 	this juncture 	would create new 	difficulties, and 	would accordingly not do so. I understood this to apply to Vallabhbhai also.  I 	said I 	would do 	my best to 	expedite matters and 	would warn Shafi and 	Sapru that it might be necessary to call them earlier than Thursday next week.  I 	pressed him 	again on 	the question 	of resuming 	civil disobedience 	if they 	came in, and he 	said firmly 	that he 	would certainly not 	resume in 	any circumstances 	till the 	conference discussions 	were concluded. He hoped 	it would 	never be necessary  to resume at all, but at the present stage could not give me an undertaking beyond the     
  
 end of the conference discussions.
 He said in everything he had said he had expressed his personal view only, but that I could rely upon him to do his best to get the Working Committee’s concurrence in any arrangements he made.
 I told him I would communicate with him as soon as I could as to whether I thought a further conference would be profitable, and in the light of what I might be able to tell him as to the scope of discussions and the particular matters on which I might be unable to meet him, he could then consider whether from his point of view a further conference as suggested yesterday would be useful. He agreed.
 He concurred in the issue of a brief communique in the following terms :
 “His Excellency the Viceroy granted  a  further  interview  to  Mr.  Gandhi today. It is understood that various matters  emerging  from  the  discussions  are now under examination, and it is possible that some days may elapse before further stage of discussions is reached.”libtech_143_footnote

220,"February 19, 1931",INTERVIEW WITH VICEROY (GANDHIJI’S REPORT),"
       [February 19, 1931] In the 	afternoon an 	invitation was 	received from 	Cunningham to meet the Viceroy. Bapu replied that he would meet him at 2.45 p.m. The interview lasted half  an 	hour and 	thereafter, to 	use Bapu’s 	words, he met 	the sub-Viceroys, i.e., 	Sapru and Jayakar. 	The interview 	with the Viceroy was very satisfactory. The  Viceroy  recounted 	for him the gist 	of the previous interviews.  VICEROY 	: I shall repeat this in 	your presence so that you can correct me if I make a mistake 	anywhere : You have promised that even though the conference were to 	break up as a result of your being dissatisfied with the progress, 	you would not resume civil disobedience until after the conclusion 	of the conference.  GANDHIJI 	: Yes, 	I have.  V. 	I am very glad; now could 	I have a further promise from you that you would not resume civil 	disobedience until after the conclusion of the proceedings in the 	Parliament? G. 	I am afraid I cannot promise that.  V. 	What you have promised is 	enough for me. I will cable all this to the    
 Secretary of State.libtech_144_footnoteI must request you to stay here till I receive the reply to it. Sir Tej and Jayakar have got engagements, so they cannot come until next Saturday.
G. I cannot do that. Both of us, Sardar and I, are here and the
 people are expecting us. I have to go to Bardoli as also to Borsad. Even today we have asked our associates to go slow and so the pace of the struggle has somewhat slowed down and if this continues it will harm the movement.
 Along with Rajaji, I asked the Viceroy : “Can’t you ask those friends to stay back?” He promised to me that he would try to persuade them to do so.
 V. Just as you have given instructions to your co-workers, I have also asked the Governors to send orders everywhere to go slow. I have spoken to the two Governors who are here and have also intimated the other Governors.
 Bapu talked also about the Pratapgarh firing.
 G. Our position in this respect is the same as in regard to Borsad. How can we rest without an inquiry? I have already sent a telegram regarding the picketing excesses in Bombay.
 The Viceroy was pleased at this and said that a cable had been sent to the Secretary of State. On receipt of his reply, an informal conference would be held by Tuesday.

226,"February 20, 1931",SPEECH AT DELHI,"
  
 February 20, 1931
 Mahatma Gandhi began by offering Id felicitation to his Muslim brothers and sisters. He said on such an occasion and in the presence of such an un-  precedented  gathering,  his  thoughts  went  to  Maulana   Mahomed   Ali   whose  death had  pained  him  a  great  deal.  Ever  since  he  had  returned  to  India  from South Africa he had thought of Delhi  as  the  Delhi  of  Maulana  Mahomed  Ali,  Swami  Shraddhanand  and   Hakim   Ajmal   Khan    so    much    so    that    even now, though their physical presence was to be missed their unseen presence could still be felt. He was equally pained to miss at such a critical juncture as the present Pandit Motilal Nehru whose death was so recent that their eyes were yet wet with tears. Mahatmaji, continuing, said :
 I know you are all anxious to hear something from me of the talks I am having with His Excellency the Viceroy. I am afraid I may not take the public into confidence about what happened between His Excellency and me. For one thing I am pledged not to do so and secondly it is not going to help us. But I may say this much, that these talks have been conducted in a most friendly manner and with much sweetness. What will be the result I cannot say. The result is in the hands of God. It is His will that will prevail. Your duty is that you must continue to do what India expects of you.
 Dr. Ansari belonging as he does to Delhi has naturally spoken highly of the part played by Delhi; but I am a witness to the great sacrifices that have been made throughout India and I can say how Delhi stands in comparison with any other province. For that you deserve my congratulation.libtech_146_footnote
 Resuming his speech, Mahatmaji said :
 Here as elsewhere the part played by women is indescribable. When the history of this movement comes to be written, the sacrifices made by the women of India will occupy the foremost place and just as with women so also with children. Their wonderful awakening has fortified me in my faith that God is with us in this struggle. These young folk had never been organized for such work, never been trained for it. How they came to achieve all this I have not been able
 
 to divine nor has anyone else whom I have consulted been able to enlighten [me] as to who guided them; only God could have done so. But remember that, in the sacred battle, whatever sacrifices you have made are trifling. Let them not puff you up with pride, what we want for India is purna swaraj. And who can calculate what further sacrifices India will have to make to achieve that goal? I assure you that I am doing as much as is humanly possible to bring about peace so that the people may not have to go through further suffering and sacrifices but everything is in God’s hands and if it be not His will that any understanding be arrived at, then I will have to tell the people that they must be ready for much further suffering.
 The sacrifices that we have made are as nothing before the sacrifices other nations have made for the sake of freedom. But there is a reason why we have not had to suffer as much as other nations. It  is as clear to me as daylight. The reason is that when we pledged ourselves to achieve purna swaraj we also took the vow that whatever we do in furtherance of the goal would be in consonance with truth and non-violence. And when I think of the part played by the whole of India, especially by the rural population, I think we have substantially fulfilled the pledge of truth and non-violence. But I cannot deceive myself nor will I permit you to deceive yourselves. We have followed truth and non-violence, but we have not made them an article of faith. They have been to some a matter of policy, but even if you have accepted it as a policy, you may not act or think in terms of violence so long as you adhere to the policy. The very thought of untruth or violence is a breach of the pledge. You will remember that at the Ahmedabad Congresslibtech_147_footnotelibtech_148_footnotethis matter was thoroughly thrashed out in the presence of leaders like Hakim Ajmal Khan and Dr. Ansari and, after full deliberation, it was decided that so long as we  bound ourselves to adhere to our policy of truth and  non-violence  in thought, word and deed, the slightest breach of that pledge meant a breach of faith.
 I may tolerate the allegation that Indians are not fit for swaraj, but I cannot for a moment tolerate the allegation, if it were true, that my countrymen were untrue or dishonest. There can be no greater tragedy than this, that Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs and Christians who believe in God were ungodly and guilty of a breach of faith. Such people are not fit for freedom. They are fit for slavery and worse.
 
 For this reason, I have always laid the greatest stress on the point that it was open to you to abandon the policy and adopt a different one but so long as you pin your faith to truth and non-violence, do  not  deceive yourself or the world. Therefore when I heard that there has been some excesses on the part of our people in the picketing of foreign cloth, I was deeply pained. I have not been able to investigate into the allegations but you know that in 1921-22 I expiated for the excesses by suspending the movement. That sort of expiation is today out of the question but I must say that wherever these excesses are going on, they must stop.
 It is better that  dealers  in  foreign  cloth  continue  to  sell  it  and those addicted to drink continue to do  so, than that  we  resort to excesses in picketing. But there is another danger I wish to warn you against. If we take to these excesses, we shall be opening the door for self-destruction, when we have swaraj, for there will then be no third power with machine-guns to intervene and restore peace. We shall be fighting one another and fratricidal war will spell destruction. If, there-fore, you have the slightest apprehension in your mind that picketing cannot be done without resorting to excesses, you had better give it up. I want you to remember that I am an expert in these matters. I am sure we have in the past done considerable picketing without the slightest resort to violence. Do not be afraid that the moment we eschew the excesses our work will fall through. I would ask you not to worry. Rest assured that the man who is asking you today to keep to your moorings must have some  alternatives  to  suggest but I shall not dwell on it today.
 I have received letters of complaint and I am making enquiries. It is possible that we have committed mistakes. I will ask all Congress workers to consider these carefully and correct whatever mistakes we may have been guilty of. I appeal to you to eschew all excesses. You may like to know what I mean by ‘excesses’. I invite the curious to come to me for the explanation.
 And now a word to the foreign-cloth dealers. Do not deceive your-selves or the country by thinking that you have done your duty by refra-ining from selling foreign cloth for a few months. This foreign-cloth trade must stop for ever, because it is only by this means that we can promote the well-being of millions of our countrymen. I will respectfully submit to the foreign-cloth dealers that a complete boycott of foreign clo-th is their dharma. Sacrifices they will have to
 make but what are those sacrifices compared to the greater sacrifices that are being made by other sections of the public? I believe that through the charkha and khaddar, the boycott can be made a success and I am working according to my belief.
 Cloth merchants are arriving here the day after tomorrow. I want the pressmen to convey my message to them. Thus they will be able to realize their duty.
 Citizens of Delhi, I do not flatter myself that you have gathered here in your thousands to do honour to me; you have come to proclaim to the world that you are all determined to achieve purna swaraj. Let not my talks with the Viceroy worry you for a moment. Do not think of them. But go on with your work. Only remember that the result is not in my hands, not in the hands of Dr. Ansari of Pandit Malaviya, but in your hands. I am but an instrument, and I am acting only as your humble ambassador. Everything will depend upon what you do and what you will fail to do. May God give you strength to keep the pledge of truth and non-violence.
 Gandhiji delivered his speech in Hindi and it was not wholly audible to large sections of the vast throng and Gandhiji made a special request to newspaper correspondents to publish only authorized text or summary of the speech and announced that the Press report of the speech would be looked through by him.

  February 	21, 1931  HEARTY	ID	GREETINGS		TO	ALL	OUR	COMPANIONS	MUSLIMS 	HINDUS	SIKHS	AND	CHRISTIANS.  The 	Hindustan Times, 	23-2-1931       [February 	21, 1931]libtech_150_footnoteMahatama Gandhi in 	an interview to a representative of the News 	Chronicle of London, 	described the prospects of a settlement negatively as less hopeful 	than     
 before but declined to make any statement at the present stage.
 Questioned as to whether he would still retain his first impression created by the Viceroy which Gandhiji had described in his previous interview, he replied that he must revise that opinion now. Personally, in the course of the conversations he had found Lord Irwin to be frank, cordial and friendly.
 Replying to the last question as to whether he would expiate by calling off the movement if there was a recrudescence of violence by Congressmen, as in 1922, Gandhiji said :
Last time when I did expiate, the method of non-violence in
 politics was a new one and people were unused  to  what  I  call absolute, downright plain-speaking on the part  of  leaders.  There-  fore I said  with  regard  to  myself  that  people  very  often  thought  as if  I  spoke  with  mental  reservations  and  even  said  what  I  did not mean. And that only hurt me but I at once realized that it would injure the cause itself and so I felt it necessary, in order to drive home the truth to the masses, that they must take me literally in all I spoke and that there was no conscious mental reservation. This I could only do by some definite drastic action which even millions could understand in a moment and hence I deliberately adopted the method of public expiation by open fasting and I saw that the very first experiment along this line had produced effective and startling results and I continued that till the Chauri Chaura culmination in 1922.
 That having been brought home and I having declared myself only responsible for the initiative of the campaign and not for the further conduct of it or its stoppage, it would be improper on my part now to interfere through the method of fasting. It is the Working Committee which is responsible for the campaign now and it alone can interfere with or shape is conduct. This, however, should not be taken to mean that I disown my moral responsibility for the violence done by a single Congressman, and if some violence is done by Congressmen it produces such a sore on my system that I cannot bear it. I cannot say what I shall then do, for in all such things I am not guided by reason, but by instinct or in other words by the inner voice and one never knows where that voice would lead you to.

229,,TO READERS,"
  
 You should not be misled or confused if I approach the Viceroy or if the Congress Working Committee holds talks regarding a
 settlement. Your dharma is to carry on the task which lies before you, viz., that of serving the nation.
 If you do so, there will be an honourable settlement, if one is at all possible. But if as soon as you hear of negotiations for a settlement, you either fall asleep or start enjoying yourselves or become even slightly slack, the settlement will fall through. You should know that the Con-gress would never accept a dishonourable settlement. A satyagrahi can neither add to nor subtract from [his demands]. Just as an honest business man maintains fixed prices, similar is the case with the satyagrahi. A soldier’s demands are not reduced just because he becomes slack; similarly, soldiers cannot add to their demands when they deep advancing and getting more daring. Hence, neither I nor any other Congressman can accept anything which is even slightly less than our demand. Therefore if the nation becomes lax, there will be no settlement and the struggle will drag on. The settlement will be reached early if the people keep up  their fervour.
 You should realize that at present the most important task is the boycott of foreign cloth. This boycott can be made to succeed only by convincing the people through reason and not through force. This requires intelligence and organization and constitutes the test of our sacrifice.
 MILL-OWNERS
 If these mill-owners so desire, they can make a success of the boycott. The following is the plan of action :
  They 	should prepare a 	list of 	those who 	trade in 	foreign goods.  They 	should give 	their own 	goods in 	exchange for 	foreign cloth 	with traders 	who are prepared 	for this 	exchange. Dealers 	in foreign cloth should 	let go 	a certain percentage in 	valuing their stocks 	of foreign cloth. Mills should put the minimum prices of their goods. The 	mill-owners can 	sell the 	above-mentioned foreign 	cloth outside 	the country 	or they 	may set fire 	to it, 	or they 	may seal 	it up 	and set it 	aside for 	being dealt with after 	swaraj has been 	won or, in 	other words, 	they can 	ask for some 	compensation from the 	new Government in 	case they have to 	suffer a 	heavy loss. 
 This requires the following—some intelligence, some sacrifice, some order, some self-confidence, some foresight, some faith in the people and whole-hearted determination to boycott foreign cloth. Just
 as this is something that can be readily suggested, it can  also  be readily put into practice.
 No one should look for guidance to anyone else; instead, those who are convinced should begin to act and plead with other mill- owners to follow suit. A good beginning can be made even if a few mill-owners get together and act jointly.
 CONGRESS
 The contribution which the Congress can make in this regard depends upon the beginning which the mill-owners make. The contribution of the former can be secured through picketing.
 DEALERS IN FOREIGN CLOTH
  You 	must give up 	the temptation 	of trading 	in foreign 	cloth; it 	is poison.  Do 	not entertain 	the false notion 	that this trade 	can be  resumed 	under swaraj or within 	 a  short 	 time.  There  is  no  	swaraj  for the poor, at any rate, if this trade is not stopped in India.  No 	one asks 	you to 	lay down 	your lives, no 	one asks 	you even 	to sacrifice 	all you have. 	However, everyone asks 	you to 	rid yourselves 	of the filth 	which you have 	gathered. You must 	realize that it 	is not as 	if you cannot 	trade in 	anything except 	foreign cloth. 	People cannot do without 	cloth; hence there is no 	alternative for 	them but 	to buy 	cloth which is 	made in India.  If 	only you 	can see it, your true 	interest lies in this 	boycott.

 It seems to me that we shall be able to meet only if there is a settlement. If the negotiations break down, we shall not be allowed to remain free, and that would be the only right course for the Government to adopt. Only God knows whether or not there will be a settlement. A satyagrahi should remain unconcerned whether there will be any. He will strive for peace, but will always keep himself ready for a fight.
 I do not wish to advise you just now with regard to the work there. You should go on doing it to the best of your ability and judgment, and, as you do so, you will learn from experience.  Even if  I cannot write to you, you should go on writing to me.

     MR. 	PRESIDENT AND BROTHERS OF MY COUNTRY,  February 	22, 1931 
  	You all know, I am physically so weak that I am unable to make a 	speech while standing; when I try to do so, every part of my body 	trembles.  	Maulvi Mohammad Yaqub has said that my coming here meant the coming 	of 21 crores of Indian brethren. I 	am a Bania, and there is no limit to my greed.  	It has always been my heart’s desire to speak, not only for 21 	crores but for 30 crores of Indians.  	Today you may not accept that position of mine but my early 	upbringing, my childhood and youth, has been to strive for Hindu- 	Muslim unity. No one may dismiss it today as merely a craze of my 	old age. My heart is confident that God will grant me that position 	to speak for the whole of India one day, and even if I die striving 	for it, I 
 shall achieve peace of mind.
 I do not know what the result of my talks with the Viceroy would be, nor can I say when the talks will result in something, but if God wishes that Congress should participate in the Conference and if there is a settlement between the Government and the Congress, the question of Hindu-Muslim unity will be one which will engage our first attention. And I give you all the assurance at my command that what I can do to achieve that end we will be always willing to do.
 Hindu-Muslim unity is not a question of bargain—that we should continue fighting for one, two or five seats. Unity can be achieved by giving up mutual fears and mistrust. Unless our hearts are purified and we regard Hindus and Muslims as one, unity cannot be established.
 Rest assured that it is not a matter  of  loaves  and  fishes,  but  of trust and love. If Hindus and Muslims  are  two  eyes  of  the country, as Sir Syed Ahmed said, there should be no occasion for quarrel or distrust—no one can say that one eye is better than the other. It is quite conceivable that two brothers may have different faith and yet both may live in harmony and peace. I wonder why the people fight in the name of religion and for the sake of religion.
 I am ready to serve you in the matter of establishing Hindu- Muslim unity and now since you have made a way for me into your heart, I shall try to enter it. It is a question of lover and beloved.  I am in search of it; I was anxiously waiting for it. If Hindu-Muslim unity  is achieved, the mission of my life would be fulfilled.
 Thanking the League for the invitation, Mahatmaji said :
 I wish you may continue to invite me as you have invited me today and you shall have no occasion to repent. (Laughter  and  cheers)

 My daily programme has become most uncertain these days. I have to keep awake till late at night. All the same I get up at four, and so the body is put to considerable strain. However, I manage to take some rest during the day and keep fit.
 I have suggested to Sitla Sahay that he should call Sarojinidevi to Allahabad. She should forget the attraction of the Ashram for some time. Rukmini is with me at present and keeps cheerful. Her health, too, is good on the whole. No one can say what will happen here. I spare no effort. But, at the same time, I will not give in on any matter of principle.

 MY DEAR REGINALD,
 
 I honour you for your long, frank and emphatic letter. It will help me to remain firm where firmness is required. Having said this, let me tell you that I do not at all agree with you that I was wrong in suspending judgment or action pending the arrival of the three friends. Satyagraha can afford to wait. It can be gentle, and should  be gentle, where gentleness is a duty. However mistaken  their  judgment may be found to be, I regard these friends as equal lovers of their country with me. I have no business to judge them as I would not have them judge me and by waiting I assure you that the cause has not suffered a bit. It may be that the friends there who are whole- hoggers may feel embarrassed to find me acting contrary to their expectation. But, as time goes by, you and they may discover many such shocks. I regard myself as a seasoned soldier in satyagraha. I have acted before, as I have acted now, at similar critical junctures and I cannot recall a single occasion when the cause espoused had lost by waiting. On the contrary I can recall many an occa-sion when the waiting had proved fruitful. Let my assurance there-fore be sufficient for you that so far as I am concerned there will be absolutely no surrender on principle, i.e., on the substantial part of the demand and I doubt not that there will be none on the part of the Congress. Remember too that satyagraha is a method of carrying convic-tion and of converting by an appeal to reason and to the sympathetic chord in human beings. It relies upon the ultimate good in every
 
 human being, no matter how debased he may be for the time being. If this does not satisfy you, do by all means strive with me. You are entitled to do so and demand satisfaction from me. I need not say a word about the brave manner in which you are fighting there. May God bless you and give you strength. Of the doings in Delhi I need say nothing because the talks are still going on and I have no doubt that the cablegrams are keeping you informed of the doings from day to day. Anything, therefore, that I can say today would be out of date when this letter reaches you.
What about your marriage?
With love.

 DEAR FRIEND,
 As I am now at least temporarily out of jail, I have an oppor- tunity of writing to you more fully than I could from Yeravda. I have followed with gratefulness all the efforts that you have been good enough to make on behalf of India. I feel more and more convinced that if India comes to her own, it will be perhaps the largest contribution to the world peace which we are all praying for. It is too early to give you any idea of the negotiations that are now going on. All I can say is that I am leaving no stone unturned to attain peace with honour. But in the last resort peace or war is the same thing for the satyagrahi He strives always for peace and has to hold himself in readiness for war. In either case he follows the path that truth dictates  to him.

  	I have just enough time, or can spare it, to answer your ques- 	tions. I had got your long letter. Coercion should have no room  at  	all in the picketing of foreign cloth. It does not matter if without 	coercion picketing does not succeed. I certainly do not believe that 	fasting is always a form of coercion. I have written on this subject 	for the next issue of  Navajivan.libtech_166_footnotelibtech_167_footnoteRead 	that article and,   if you have any questions to ask me, ask them. 	If we have resolved not to tolerate coer- cion in any circumstances, 	we shall con-tinually discover new methods of picketing and new 	means of bring- ing about complete boycott. In consequence of the 	picketing of liquor booths, drink addicts will make illicit liquor 	in their homes and some of them will even sell it. This evil may be 	tolerated if we have taken the necessary measures to make it 	bearable. Most of the addicts, however, will have stopped drinking. 	My impression is that, in picketing liquor booths, our main, or 	only, aim, has been to deprive the Government of the revenue which 	it receives from the sale of liquor, whereas our real duty is to 	stop drink addicts from drinking. If we realize this clearly and if 	we get workers, we can visit each addict in his home and persuade 	him to give up his habit, and we can also teach him to enjoy 	harmless drinks in place of liquor. Wherever the workers act in a 	manner contrary to truth, persons like you should stop them from 	doing so and, if they fail, break off relations with them.

It was 	in the 	fitness of 	things, that 	at a 	 time when India’s 	fight  for 	freedom was 	on, the portrait of 	a great 	patriot should be 	unveiled. But 	mere unveiling 	of his 	portrait was 	not sufficient, they must 	resolve in their 	minds that they shall 	install in their 	hearts the noble 	qualities of Lala 	Lajpat Rai. He was also 	grateful to 	them for 	the purses they had 	presented then. He 	said he 	always felt great 	pleasure  in 	sitting among 	students, chatting with 	them, playing with 	them, flattering them, 	and snubbing 	them, because 	he had a self-interest 	and that 	was “complete 	independence” and 	that could not 	be achieved 	unless he had 	attracted every student’s 	heart and 	won over his 	power of 	sacrifice for 	balidan (sacrifice) 	in the 	yajna (fight) 	which was 	going on 	in the country.  The 	whole world was looking towards the students and he would feel much 	pain and sorrow, 	if they 	did not come out successful 	in their 	trial. He 	was sorry that the 	students had 	not taken their 	legitimate share in the 	fight for 	freedom. No 	doubt they 	did shout 	“inquilab” 	loudly, but 	he wanted 	them to cultivate 	three things 	: (1) maryada 	(discipline), (2) 	sanyam (self-control) 	and (3) charitrabal 	(power of character). 	 Where else could we find these three things?  The fight for swaraj was a  yajna of self-purification and he expected the students to contribute the largest share  in 	that yajna.  But, 	he was sorry that they had not fulfilled his expectations in the 	matter.    
 They had lagged in making the sacrifice that was expected of them. Mother India expected much more sacrifice from them and he was sorry that they had not offered that. The Mahatma said :
I am an optimist and will not give up. I still fell hopeful that
you would fulfil the expectations of the country.
 It was with these hopes that he had come to address them.
 Mahatmaji said, there were three tasks before them. (1) Hindu-Muslim unity. Let the old men (Hindus and Muslims) fight, because they had in them mistrust arising out of cowardice, which was inevitable for men nearing death. But youth should not entertain mistrust and should work whole-heartedly for Hindu-Muslim unity because they were the best messengers of the cause. What, if they had different religions? Like the five fingers of one hand, they should protect and help each other. It was a pity that we people were doing unreligious things in the name of religion. He wanted students to promise to live like brothers in perfect harmony and establish goodwill and cordiality between Hindus and Muslims. The second task before them, said Mahatmaji, was doing away with the curse of untouchability which did not mean simply touching the so-called untouchables, but it meant regarding the humblest and the poorest in the land as our equal. Thirdly, they must use khaddar and promote the use of charkha, which in itself was a great science. Sir C. W. Raman and Sir J. C. Bose deserved praise for their scientific discoveries but the charkha too was a powerful science, which would bring salvation to crores of our countrymen.
 Concluding, he said if crores of people were his followers today and called him
 a Mahatma, it was not because he had given up practice at the Bar, but because he regarded the poorest among the poor as his brother and he believed that the salvation of the country lay in charkha and Hindu-Muslim unity. He was devoting every minute  for the achievement of these ideals.
 Mahatmaji smilingly added :
 If you follow me you can all become Mahatmas (Laughter) and then I will have many companions to help me in the attainment of our object. (Laughter)
 Mahatmaji concluded with a prayer to God to inspire the students with the will and power to sacrifice.

252,,PICKETING,"
  
 It is an unshakable faith with me that a cause suffers exactly to the extent that it is supported by violence. I say this in spite of appearances to the contrary. If I kill a man who obstructs me, I may experience a sense of false security. But the security will be short-
 lived. For I shall not have dealt with the root cause. In due course other men will surely rise to obstruct me. My business therefore is not to kill the man or men who obstruct me but to discover the cause that impels them to obstruct me and deal with it. Even so must one deal with the cause of people selling foreign cloth and not lay violent hands on those who happened to be the dealers for the time being. The cause lies on the surface. So long as there are buyers of foreign cloth, there will be sellers. I must, therefore, gain the ear of the buying public. If we would but recognize this cardinal fact we would lay the greatest stress upon work in the villages which send their millions to the foreign-cloth market. But I must not be understood to mean that we may neglect the cities and the merchants. Only under the plan suggested by me need there be neither despair, nor the slightest trace of violence. Moreover my plan if fully executed contains within itself the surest chances of success and need never degenerate into rowdyism. Let us not forget that we are wedded to non-violence and truth. The strictest and closest striving towards these two beacon- lights would certainly bring us ashore; and whilst reaching us there in the quickest possible time it would enable us in difficult circumstances to discover effective ways out. Those who have faith would not be disheartened if they found that some dealers have defied Congress instructions and demands. Such disappointments should be used for perfecting our own internal organization and discovering our defects, never for losing faith.

    MY 	DEAR REHANA,  February 	26, 1931 
  	I have your letter. I wrote only two days ago for Navajivan on 	picketinglibtech_169_footnotelibtech_170_footnoteand  there  pointed  out  that  your  fasting   was  	ideal   and appropriate picketing. The reasoning is simple. There 	must be a bond of affection between the parties. In your case there 	was that bond. They knew you as a member of the family which the 	people of Patan knew had served them in common with the people of 	the whole State. That bond had never snapped. You had therefore a 	perfect right to    
 entreat them and, if your entreaty was lost upon them, to fast even as you would be entitled to fast against father and mother if, in your opinion, they were going wrong and they did not listen to your entreaty. That the Patan dealers in sealing their stock were actuated not so much by their regard for you as by the fear of an enraged populace may be quite true and is highly probable. But that need not be considered in weighing the merits of a particular action. In the language of the Gita ours is but to do and not to mind the result. If the motive and the action are pure, the doer is not responsible for the manifold consequences that may arise from it. I hope this is clear. Write again if necessary.
 Things here are still indefinite, but for a satyagrahi is not one step enough? We must not seek “to see the distant scene”.

255,"February 26, 1931","SPEECH  AT SISGUNJ GURDWARA,
DELHIlibtech_172_footnote","
  
 February 26, 1931
 I have followed with painful interest the details of police firinglibtech_173_footnoteinto the sacred precincts of this Gurdwara that have been narrated by the previous figurelibtech_174_footnotelibtech_175_footnoteand I assure you that my grief and resentment at the outrage are not les than yours. But as I told my Sikh brethren at the time of Nankana Sahib tragedy when I visited Nankana Sahib in company with Abul Kalam Azad in 1921, we are today fighting not for one Gurdwara but for the bigger Gurdwara, which is the common sacred possession of all of us, viz., purna swaraj. Purna—complete— because it is as much for the prince as for the peasant, as much for the rich landowner as for the landless tiller of the soil, as much for the Hindus as for the Mussalmans, as much for the Parsis and Christians as for the Jains, Jews and Sikhs, irrespective of any distinction of caste or creed or status in life. The very connotation of the word and the means of its attainment to which we are pledged—truth and non- violence—preclude all possibility of that swaraj being more for someone than for the other, being partial to someone and prejudicial to the other. Truth and non-violence leave no room for fraud or falsehood. The Congress has attracted the attention of the world for the simple reason that it is pledged to win freedom by means un- employed by nations heretofore. The world has so far been familiar with only one method of achieving freedom and that by the use of physical force. But luckily for itself and the world, India has launched on  the method of  non-violence and truth for the attainment of  its
 
 independence. It is a unique thing in history and the world which began by regarding it with scepticism is today watching India’s great non-violent experi- ment with bated breath. In physical warfare even chicanery and fraud have a place but non-violence precludes the use of all other weapons except that of truth and justice. Swaraj under this method, therefore, can never be achieved by usurping the rights of any community big or small but by ensuring even-handed justice and fair treatment to all—even the poorest and the weakest in the land. That being so how can the Congress want to keep even a child out of its own.
The beauty of non-violence is that it carries within it its own
security.
 I venture to suggest that the non-violence creed of the Congress is the surest guarantee of its good faith and our Sikh friends have no reason to fear betrayal at its hands. For the moment it did so, the Congress would not only thereby seal its own doom but that of the country too. Moreover the Sikhs are a brave people. They will know how to safeguard their rights by the exercise of arms if it should ever come to that.
 Sardar Madhusudan Singh in his speech has asked for an assurance that the Congress would do nothing that might alienate the sympathies of the Sikhs from the Congress. Well, the Congress in its Lahore Session a resolution that it would not endorse any settlement with regard to the minority question that failed to satisfy any of the minorities concerned. What further assurance can the Congress give you to set you at ease I really fail to understand.
 Then there is the controversy about the inclusion of the Sikh colour in the national flag. No blame can possibly attach to the Congress in this respect. The present design was suggested by me. The Congress has not even formally adopted it. I had offered to the Sikh friends to place before the A.I.C.C. their viewpoint if they could apprise me of it. But as it turned out, the A.I.C.C. could not meet after that and no one knows as to when it would be able to meet at all. Even the Working Committee is out today on sufferance. To raise this controversy at this time—a time when the Congress is fighting for its very existence—would be, to say the least, unseemly act. You may not obstruct if you cannot help.
 The Sikhs have given their loyal and unstinted co-operation to the Congress in many parts in India like Bombay and Delhi, etc. But these brave people have never bothered themselves about the flag
 question. The flag controversy is being conducted mostly by those who have held aloof from the present movement. A brave man always gives credit to the other party for its bona fides. Why can you have not faith? If the Congress should play false afterwards you can well settle surely with it, for you hold the sword. I would ask you therefore to cast out suspicion and distrust from you and to plunge into this sacred yajna of freedom whole-heartedly. You will find that when you are ready to make the extre-me sacrifice you will disdain to ask for guarantees. It will be for others who will look up to you as the champions of their rights as it will be for you to fulfil their expectations. I hold Granth Sahib in high reverence.  Several parts of  it have passed into our daily speech. So far as my reading of it goes it inculcates faith, valour and an invincible belief in the ultimate triumph of right and justice. I would like you to derive your inspiration and guidance from it.
 I ask you to accept my word and the resolution of the Congress that it will not betray a single individual much less a community. If it ever thinks of doing so, it will only hasten its own doom. No nation determined to immolate itself at the altar of freedom can be guilty of breach of faith. My life has been an open book. I have no secrets and I encourage no secrets. I pray you therefore to unbosom your- selves of all your doubts and apprehensions and I shall try to meet you as best I can. What more shall I say? What more can I say then this that let God be witness of the bond that binds me  and  the Congress with you.

 "
256,"February 27, 1931",INTERVIEW WITH VICEROY,"
  
 February 27, 1931 I saw Mr. Gandhi again today. I began by reference to the scope of the further constitutional   discussions—in   regard   to   which   I   said—“The    object   of  future
 discussions is to consider further the scheme for the constitutional government of India discussed at the Round Table Conference. Of the scheme there outlined, Federa- tion is an essential part; so also are Indian responsibility, and safeguards, explained by the Prime Minister, as being needed to secure such matters as Crown control of defence and external affairs; the position of minorities; the financial credit of India, and the discharge of obligations. The character and form of the arrangements, by which   effect   should   be   given   to   these   fundamental   principles   of  Federation,
 responsibility and safeguards, are matters for discussion.” To this he assented.
 I then referred to the question he had raised as to an examination into debt charges. I told him that the position of His Majesty’s Government was that, for reasons of Indian credit, it was impossible for them to assent to an investigation into the Indian debt, and as to any particular charges it was impossible for His Majesty’s Government to express an opinion without knowing more precisely to what these might relate.
 In reply to this he said that he would wish  to  raise  particular  subjects,  though these he was not willing or able precisely to define. He instanced however the £ 100 million gift in the war. I told him that I could only make His Majesty’s Government acquainted with what he had said, and that in any event I  had no  doubt that His Majesty’s Government must reserve to themselves complete liberty of decision as to how they dealt with particular subjects if raised. To this he replied that, while appreciating the position of His Majesty’s Government, he must make it clear that, in the event of the attitude of His Majesty’s Government on questions raised being such as Congress could not accept, he must reserve to Congress the right to withdraw from participation in the Conference proceedings.
 He said that he did not contemplate or desire any public pronouncement on this subject.
 The next matter to which I referred was secession, on which I told him that, as   I had made plain at our first interview, I regarded the question in present circumstances  as academic, and that, though I presumed he could raise it if he so desired, public expression of any intention to do so would have the worst possible effect and could hardly fail to damage his own cause. To this he assented.
 We then turned to the practical questions arising in the event of peace restored.
 I made it plain to him that any reciprocal action by Government depended on the effective discontinuance of the civil disobedience movement, of which I detailed the various activities set out in the memorandum I had before me, and of which I promised  to send him a copy.
 He raised a variety of points on particular issues, which were not of great importance, and, after much discussion, the position emerged that apart from these, three matters appeared to present great—and in his phrase, insurmountable— difficulty. These were picketing; enquiries into police excesses; and salt.
 On each of these I developed the attitude of Government as defined in the memorandum, and said that I could not hold out any hope of Government going further.
 He argued all three points on lines which after several hours’ discussion have
 now become familiar, and promised to send me a notelibtech_176_footnotetomorrow, showing precisely what he had in mind as regards picketing. I told him that I would consider this when I received it, but that I scarcely thought it could affect my view. This was that whatever might be the logical arguments in favour of peaceful persuasion, by way of picketing, the whole experience of the last month showed that it was a conception that had no relation to practical facts, and that it inevitably led to abuses and violence, of which we had had examples in plenty. As regards the points of police enquiry and salt, he was frankly dissatisfied.
 I promised to send him a note on all the points discussed, in which I would state clearly the position of Government. He could then consider whether any further meeting would be useful. He said he would leave this to me. I concluded by again urging him to  exert  his influence on the side of  peaceto which he replied by saying that he desired peace, but that when in doubt he fell back on “Lead Kindly Light” and “One step enough for me”.	libtech_177_footnote

 February 28, 1931
 In the event of peace being established picketing of foreign cloth and drink and drug shops will be unaggressive and though, to the extent that it is successful, it must produce political consequen- ces, it will be predominantly for social and moral ends as it was before the political consequence was thought of, or intended. It  will, therefore, be largely confined to villages, and even in cities attention will be directed not so much to the sellers as to the buyers. It will thus be predominantly educative. There will be no cordons, and no crowds, such as now are the special feature of picketing. There will be no hostile demonstrations against those who in- sist on selling foreign cloth in defiance of public opinion. Naturally it will be absolutely peaceful and conducted so as to cause no public obstruction, and will not be in defiance of the common law.

261,,WHAT SHOULD ONE NOT DO?,"
  
 Let me note down what, in my opinion, are the things one ought not to do while picketing liquor shops and foreign-cloth shops.
  We 	should not 	abuse either the 	seller or 	the buyer 	and should 	never be 	discourteous in 	our behaviour. We 	should not 	lie down before a 	shop or 	a vehicle. We 	should not 	cry out “shame! shame!” We 	should not 	take out effigies for 	burning or burying.  Even 	while ostracizing 	people, we 	should not 	obstruct their 	obtaining food or 	any other 	service. But we 	should not 	take meals in 	their homes or 	accept any 	service from 	them. How 	far service should 	be rendered, 	however, requires careful consideration.  We 	should not 	fast in protest 	against them in 	any-circumstan- ces. The commonly 	accepted rule regarding 	fasting is 	as follows : 	Where there is 	a bond between two 	parties, one 	of them may 	fast if 	the other 	violates a condition 	or a 	moral law, 	just as Raihana 	fasted in Patan. 
 Some may say that the boycott of liquor shops or foreign-cloth shops cannot succeed through such limited picketing; I would then say that the boycott had better fail in that case. Those who raise such doubts, it may be said, do not have full faith in the unfailing success
 of non-violence. Observance of non-violence was the object behind entrusting both these tasks to women. I am convinced that we can achieve both these boycotts within a short period of time if a non- violent atmosphere is maintained. On the contrary, if we transgress our limits, however welcome the immediate results may appear to be, bitterness will spread among us in the end and the atmosphere of internecine strife will prevail. And if we become victims of family feuds, the boycott will end and, swaraj itself will remain a mere dream. Hence my advice and hope is that everyone will accept this prescrip- tion as that of an experienced vaid and put it into practice.
 If despite people following my advice—regarding what should be done and what should not be done—the boycott does not succeed, I am aware that the burden of the failure will rest on me. I am prepared to shoulder it.
 KHADI AND BOYCOTT OF FOREIGN CLOTH
 As I continue to examine the activities of the past six months, I find that, to some extent, we have deviated from our path. Of late, I have been hearing from many quarters voices of swadeshi which are opposed to khadi. Some regard themselves as having fulfilled their objective by claiming that they wear swadeshi, i.e., mill-made cloth. But, from the long-range point of view, it will be seen that those who wear Indian mill-made cloth and disdain khadi are in the long run harming both khadi and the Indian mills. The reason is that without khadi boycott is impossible. Here is the proof. About 50 per cent of India’s requirements of cloth are imported from abroad. Our Indian mills cannot meet this requirement within a short period. This task can be accomplished by khadi alone, since our capacity to produce it depends solely on our keenness. Just as we insist on making bhakharis (or cooking rice) ourselves and do not get them made or cooked in Indian or foreign factories, like-wise, if we desire it, we can produce as much khadi as we need. If this much is understood, it is easy to show why a disregard for khadi harms the cause of Indian (textile) mills. The latter by themselves cannot make a success of the boycott. Hence foreign cloth would enter into such fierce competition with Indian mills, that the latter could not but suffer a set-back. We have had this experience on many occasions be-fore now. Hence those who rest satisfied with thoughtlessly wearing Indian mill-made cloth deceive themselves and harm the boycott move-ment. I hope, therefore, that
 those who respond to the message of the Congress will use nothing but khadi. Swadeshi for them means pure khadi.

263,"March 1, 1931",INTERVIEW WITH VICEROY,"
    
 March 1, 1931
 Mr. Gandhi came to see me this afternoon, and before he came I had, after very careful examination of the various points raised, come to the conclusion that, apart from minor and technical points, there were three main matters of principle on which, so far as I could judge, accommodation was impossible. These were : Picketing and boycott; enquiries into police excesses; and salt. I accordingly began the interview with a firm determination on one point, which was that on no account must I allow the break which I anticipated to come, as I felt certain Mr. Gandhi would try to engineer it, on Police alone. I accordingly began by taking Mr. Gandhi through the memorandum I had sent him the previous day inviting him to let me know on what points he was unable to agree with the Government attitude. We soon came to a stoppage over the question of boycott, and on this matter I, with his concurrence, brought in the Home Secretary, Emerson, to deal more fully than I could with some technical points. After rather a wandering discussion the position emerged that Mr. Gandhi was apparently willing to concentrate his claim and his energy upon the business of substitution of Indian cloth and goods for foreign, giving up boycott of British goods, and giving up boycott as a political weapon. Merchants would be at liberty to abrogate restrictive agreements, and no element of coercion would be applied to them.
 On picketing we had also a long talk in which we respectively re-stated our position, he saying that all he meant to do was perfectly peaceful picketing, which was entirely permissible under the common law, I maintaining the view  that, whatever his common-law rights and the persuasiveness of his logic, peaceful picke- ting was a thing that in present circumstances just would not happen. People were in too excitable a temper for so simple and speedy a transition as he contemplated from one sort of picketing to another to be possible. He was very frank and said that he had been discussing with the Congress Committee, and they were going to stop picketing where it was not working smoothly, and was very emphatic that they could get their orders obeyed in these matters. We left the point at this stage for further discussion in order to see how we got on on other things.
 We then came to Police, in regard to which he said the formula in the memo- randum was quite unsatisfactory, and he could not possibly accept it. I said that I appreciated that because, as I presumed, he would feel that however good the evidence  he might have to bring about particular cases, my formula left it open for local
 Governments to refuse  to  enquire  any further on the ground that they already had  the facts. On the other hand, were I to admit his very justifiable point, it would mean that I must either open the floodgates to enquiry, or something like it, in innumerable cases all over India, wherever anybody wished to get back on the Police, or must adopt the line of saying that he could select, say, three cases, which would inevitably have the effect of suggesting to the world that these were three selected instances typical of a generally prevailing state of police savagery. I therefore told him that, inasmuch as I could do neither of these things and inasmuch as we really wanted peace, would not it be better to drop it altogether? No formula that the wit of man could devise would really be much good, or was indeed possible. I should in fact be pretending to give him something that I knew local Governments did not intend. He seemed a good deal impressed with this kind of line and, after some talk, said that he had himself been thinking of dropping it. We accordingly, after some further talk, drafted a formula to the effect that he had had brought certain allegations to the notice of Government, but that Government were unwilling to institute specific enquiries because they didn’t think that this would help peace, and that, having regard to those considerations, Mr. Gandhi did not press his demand. He took the formula away, but I  am not without hope that we shall eventually get settled in that fashion.
 We then passed to Salt, on which we covered ground over which we had been before. He attached far greater importance to it than I had expected, and I imagine it is mainly vanity. I told him that we could not condone publicly the breaches of law; that would be to give too great encouragement to evil influences; nor could we in present finanical circumstances sacrifice revenue by repealing it. I was quite willing  to consider the question of making some alteration in the executive administration of the law, if this could be done by regular order, with the object of extending privileges already enjoyed by the inhabitants of some areas to others, but the matter demanded fuller knowledge than I possessed and I suggested he should see Schuster. This he said  he would be very glad to do, and is to see him on Tuesday. One of the possible ways  of dealing with it that I put to him was that the terms of reference of the existing Salt Committee should be enlarged so as to bring in the points in which he is particularly interested and on which he might give evidence to the Committee. If this were done, I assured him that the Government would be willing to give sympathetic consideration to recommendations that the Committee might make. I think it may be necessary to do something to meet him on Salt. I fully recognize the psychological objection to doing anything on a matter so publicly identified with his inauguration of the civil disobedience campaign. A good deal will turn on how it can be done, but I do not
 believe that we ought to allow settlement to wreck on the abstract principle that Salt is the inviolable ark on which no hand must be laid.
 The discussion up to this point therefore left us with :
 Police—very promising; picketing and salt—unsettled, but with a good deal of manoeuvre-room if desired.
 I accordingly suggested that he should come again after dinner and discuss the actual details of any proposals he might wish to make about picketing with Emerson.  I would join them if I could.
 Second Interview : 9·30 p.m., March 1, 1931
 I joined Mr. Gandhi and Mr. Emerson at 9.30 p.m. and found that by that time Emerson had got Mr. Gandhi hitched to the point of abandonment of the boycott as a political weapon and an assurance of complete freedom for cloth merchants to do what they liked. These seem pretty substantial gains. We discussed Picketing for a long time, and I eventually said to him, in pursuance of what we had said earlier in the day, that I would press him to accept this sort of solution, i.e., that the statement should record the common-law right as it stood of peaceful picketing; that Government did not challenge this common-law right, but that Mr. Gandhi and Congress, realizing the circumstances of the country, did not intend to make any use of their common-law rights for a period of two months, or six weeks, in order definitely to dissociate the peaceful picketing they want liberty to employ, from peaceful picketing as it has been employed during the last 12 months. Mr. Gandhi made it plain that, if Congress did not succeed in maintaining the peaceful character of the picketing he desired, he could have no objection to Government taking any steps they wished to deal with it, that we should be entitled to tell him he must call it off. This he would almost certainly himself desire to do. He promised to think over my suggestion and said that  he did not think it would be difficult to find a formula on which we could both meet. I  am inclined to agree with him and, although I should like to get rid of picketing for ever, I have very little doubt that, if you can get rid of the political-weapon drive of it and have it purely as an economic and social thing, it will be dead in three weeks. This is the very strong view of all the Indians who come and talk to me about it.
 After saying that I would put him in touch with Schuster about Salt tomorrow, he ran over various points of smaller importance that some of his people had put to him on the other matters in the note. He produced difficulties on the subject of Additional Police, which I think may be obstinate, but we shall not break on this.
 Vallabhbhai Patel had produced a few particular difficulties from Gujarat, but these too I think can be surmounted. The position therefore left is that :
  we 	have got 	to find 	the right 	settlement of 	picketing, which 	I believe 	can be done;  we 	have got to 	persuade him 	to be satisfied 	with including 	his salt 	points in 	the reference 	to the 	existing Committee, or 	see whether 	we can 	satisfy him 	about this in 	some other way;  he 	has got to make up 	his mind to 	accept our 	wash-out on 	police in 	some form 	that fits with our position. 	I think 	it is permissible 	to hope 	that we shall 	suc- ceed 	in resolving 	these points and, if we 	do so, we will be 	pretty clear for 	the question of 	his attitude 	about debts on 	which I 	must telegraph 	to the 	Secretary of 	State. I 	believe this 	question will 	prove, when 	it comes 	to the point, 	not to 	be at all impracticable. 	Sapru is 	very emphatic 	that, when they actually 	get round the table 	discussing it, 	they will be 	able to 	knock it 	out, or 	at least knock out 	any objec- tionable 	developments of it. There 	remain “the scope of 	the discussion”, on 	which he 	has accepted 	His Majesty’s 	Government’s formula, and 	the question of 	secession, on 	which he 	also accepted 	the formula 	that I 	read to 	him and which 	has already 	been reported 	to the 	Secretary of 	State. On 	both these points of 	debts and 	secession he 	does not 	want any 	public statement to 	be made.

 [March 3, 1931]libtech_184_footnote
 I saw Mr. Gandhi again yesterday. Emerson was present at our discussions at Mr. Gandhi’s request.
 We began with a few of the less important points, working up to the question of return of the land that had been sold to third parties. He accepted the position of Government that if this was to be recovered for the original owners it must be a question of third parties doing it. At the same time he said that it would be difficult in fact for this to get done unless Government officials were sympathetic. I adhered to the position that the Government of India was debarred from putting pressure of any kind on the Government of Bombay, that the Government of Bombay would be very sticky about doing anything, but that they would be neutral in the matter, leaving third parties to do what they could. He wasn’t at all happy about this, and said that Vallabhbhai Patel was frankly doubtful whether he could carry the settlement in Gujarat unless they got some accommodation of this question. I told him however that it was not in my power to vary my position.
 After clearing up  the  question  of  Additional  Police  in  which  we  even- tually agreed to treat the money question on the same logical basis as remission of fines (i.e., that moneys collected should not be refunded unless they were in excess of the amount required, but that moneys not collected should be washed out), we came on  to boycott and picketing. I pressed him very hard either (a) to give up picketing altogether on his own on the ground of disturbance and communal feeling; or (b) to accept an agreement with Government that there would be no picketing for a specified period. He would not hear of either, assuring me with the utmost conviction that, if I would only trust his honour in this matter and the honour of Congress, there would be no picketing to which anybody could take objection. All he desired to do was to return to the status quo before the civil disobedience movement was started. There might be a little more picketing than was done before that movement began, because people had begun to think more constructively about swadeshi, but he could guarantee that there would be no interference or intimidation or the rest. After much wrangling we came down to the boycott and picketing formula of the agreement. I think it is not too  bad.  It ties it up pretty tight, and pledges Congress at once to suspend it if there  is any abuse.
 We had no trouble about the Police formula. He had made one or two verbal alterations that on the whole improved it from my point of view. In the course of a short discussion we had about this, he revealed what I have by now discovered as the right method of dealing with him. He said : “When you or Mr. Emerson use your best arguments it does not always have much effect on me, but, when you tell me that
 
 Government is in a difficulty and cannot do what I want, then I am inclined to capitulate to you”! This was exactly the history of the Police discussion.
 The last subject we tackled was Salt, on which he had had a discussion with Schuster in the morning and on which they had arrived at a working formula. While our talks were proceeding the afternoon had been getting on, and it looked as if he was again going to have a race for his evening meal, which he cannot take after the sun has set. I accordingly asked him what he would wish done about it. It was eventually decided that Mirabai (Miss Slade) should bring it up here, which was done. I was greatly interested in meeting her, of whom I had heard much. She evidently venerates him very profoundly, and one felt one had suddenly been switched into a rather different world.
 We could not finish all the matters for discussion, and I accordingly asked Gandhi to come back at 9 o’clock to get on with them as far as he could with Emerson, and I promised to look in and see how matters were progressing after finishing a dinner-party.
 Later Interview : 9 p.m.
 I joined them again at 10.30 and found they had pretty well agreed to the statement in the form in which it now stands. A good deal  of  verbal  redrafting  had to be done which took time, but the back of it was broken when we got the Police enquiry off and got agreement about withdrawal of the boycott of British goods.
 We have given more than I like about  Salt,  but  I  don’t  think  we  could  have got away with much less. We concluded, with the old man telling me that he was going to throw his whole heart and soul into trying to co-operate in cons-titution- building, and that, while he felt greatly oppressed  with  the  responsibility  of decision, he prayed with all his heart that it might be successful. I was impressed, as I have been throughout, with his sincerity. He told me, in reply to a question, that he was quite firm about not re-starting civil disobedience till the end of the conference discussions anyhow, and hoped never.libtech_185_footnote

             DEAR 	FRIEND,       1  DARYAGANJ, 	 DELHI,  March 	4, 1931 
  	I write this letter in connection with the lands of civil resisters 	sold in Gujarat in respect of revenue dues.  Overworked as you are, 	it     vide 	“Viceroy’s cable 	to secretary of state”,4-3-1931. 
 is distressful to me to have to write to you on a matter which may appear to be trivial. But I fear that on it hangs the successful working  of the settlement just made. With all the desire to give the fullest effect to the settlement, Sardar Vallabhbhai tells me that he will find it utterly impossible to implement the Congress obligation of the settlement unless the lands can be restored to the rightful holders. I am well aware that as head of the Government of India you cannot by reason of a previous undertaking intervene in the matter, but as an English- man interested in the successful working of a settlement built up by your patient and unwearied toil you can perhaps exercise your influence to see justice done and thereby assist its smooth working. Shrimati Gangabehn, whose name I have already introduced to you in  a previous communication and who has been working in the taluk of Borsad in Kaira District, tells me that the land in Ras, where or near which her social work was being done, was sold to the Dharalas for a song, and that it was bought by them at the instigation of the previous Mamlatdar and in collusion with him. If there was proper enquiry I should undertake to prove  the  alleged  collusion. But I know that at the present moment I must not, so far as possible, whisper a word about the past.  That  all  the  lands  sold  were  sold  for  a  song will,  I think, be readily admitted. To  say  the  least  it  will  be  conceded that it was the height of unwisdom, on the part of local authorities, thus practically to give away the lands.
 I therefore ask your assistance so far as it can be given in surmounting the difficulty. It is in the confidence that you will do all that is possible to obtain the co-operation of the Bombay Government in finding a solution which will restore peace that Sardar Vallabhbhai and I can allow the settlement to go through.libtech_186_footnote

 March 4, 1931
 Mr. Gandhi came up and had two or three hours’ talk with Emerson at 12 o’clock mainly about the detailed draft of the agreement we had reached and about the methods to be employed for its implementation.  I   did  not   participate   in   these
 
 discussions, but saw him for a short time in the afternoon about a letterlibtech_187_footnotehe had written to me concerning the land in Gujarat.
 The point of the letter was that unless I could give him an assurance that the land sold would at some time unspecified be returned to their original owners he could not go on with the settlement. It had unhappily in his mind attained the importance  of a moral scruple which outweighed everything else. His trouble was that according to his information some land at Ras had been sold by a dishonest Mamlatdar improperly and unjustly to Dharalas. This had been deliberately done according to his information in order to have revenge upon the Patidars, of whom the Dharalas are the natural enemies. I told him, as I had repeatedly told him before, that I was under the most strict obligation to the Bombay Government to accept the position, as stated in our note that these transactions must, so far as the Government were concer- ned, be regarded as final. It was impossible for me, in justice to these undertakings, to put pressure on the Bombay Government in a matter on which I had assured them my support. He recognized the force of this, but said that his difficulty must in some way be met. I told him that I could not vary the position as stated above, nor could I agree, as he suggested, to omit any reference to land that had been sold from the statement of settlement. To do this would  inevitably  carry  the  implication  that the question was left open, and that Government had no  fixed  attitude  in   regard to it. The utmost that I could do would be to write to Sir Frederick Sykes drawing
 his attention to any statement on the matter that Mr. Gandhi cared to make to me, and ask him to give his personal attention to the task of finding an equitable solution. This I was willing to do, though I was not sanguine of Sir Frederick Sykes being able to find a solution that would meet the case. In any event it was highly unlikely that anything could be done at once. What might be possible under different conditions when things had quieted down, might be another matter. Mr. Gandhi said that he did not care about the time that elapsed before the question could be settled, but he felt so strongly that, without some settlement, the thing would remain an open sore in the Kaira District that he could never reconcile himself to it.
 At this point we left it and I went to a Garden Party where I met Sapru, Jayakar, Sastri, Purshotamdas and Rahimtullah.  I told them of the difficulty and exhorted them   to put their full pressure on Gandhi to save the settlement from being wrecked.
 Sapru, Sastri and Jayakar came to see me at 10.30 p.m. with alternative suggestions :
 that 	we should 	omit the paragraph 	from the statement;  that 	we should insert 	the words “justly 	and lawfully sold” as a  conditional limitation on 	non-return of 	land sold. 
 I told them both these things were impossible, and finally after much discussion we came to the suggestion of the addition of a notelibtech_188_footnotein the form it appears
 
 in the statement as published. This seemed comparatively innocuous and they went off at 12.30 a.m. to get Gandhi to accept it. This he later did.
 The impressions left on my mind by this incident were
  that 	it is essential 	to give 	no more 	time for moral scruples 	to develop. 	Clearly, though 	imponderable, they are 	very weighty;  that 	there may be 	a real grievance in 	the methods 	adopted for the sale 	of some 	land and, whether this is 	so or not, the 	position of 	the Dharalas 	owning coveted land 	in the 	midst of 	Patidar villages is 	not going 	to be a 	very happy one. I 	should have 	supposed it 	might after two 	or three 	months have been possible 	for friendly 	arrangements to be made 	by which 	the Dharalas 	might be 	either bought 	out at satisfactory 	profit, or possibly 	assisted to buy 	land somewhere else, 	where it would 	not give 	rise to these 	acute difficulties.libtech_189_footnote

 DEAR MR. CUNNINGHAM,
 I have had a full discussion with the Working Committee on the moral issue raised by me at the interview with His Excellency the Viceroy this afternoon. The responsibility for the final decision rests upon my shoulders. I must apologize to His Excellency for  my obvious limitations.
 As to the issue, I repeat the alternative I suggested to Mr. Emer- son, viz., that words “justly and lawfully” be added after “sold”. I am sure the Government of India do not seek to protect unjust or unlawful transactions.
 If, however, this amendment does not commend itself to His Excellency, I would be prepared to consider any alternative amend- ment along the same lines.
 I understand that Sjts. Sastri, Sapru and Jayakar are to see His Excellency on this matter. Pending settlement of the issue raised, I am not sending the letterlibtech_190_footnoteI handed to His Excellency this morning and which has to be somewhat reshaped.
 Yours sincerely,

 SWARAJ IS SELF-PURIFICATION
 It is a matter of great joy to me as it is I hope to the readers  of Young India that numerous men and women took on the Motilal Shraddha Daylibtech_191_footnotevows leading to self-purification for the purpose of swaraj. My faith in self-purification tells me  that  these  vows  if  carried out to the full will bring us many steps nearer our goal. From the letters and information otherwise received  I  know  that those  who have taken vows include men and women, boys  and girls  drawn from all classes and all religious groups. Of these Hindu, Mahomedan and Christian names have already come under my observa-tions. The vows are varied. Some have vowed to observe brahmacharya, some to abstain from smoking, some to refrain from using any cloth but khadi. The reader will not ask me or himself how these vows can possibly advance swaraj. It is not a matter for demons- tration through reason. The experience of the world shows that wherever people have taken to purity of life there has been self-rule, in other words swaraj. And self-rule by millions is swaraj of millions. Any other is not swaraj but mirage. The history of past twelve months is a progressive realiza-tion of the fact that purification undertaken not merely for the purpose of individual peace but for the purpose of national happiness does result in promoting such happiness. Happi- ness here means an enlightened realiza-tion of human dignity and a craving for human liberty which prizes itself above mere selfish satisfaction of personal comforts and material wants and would readily and joyfully sacrifice these for self-preservation.
 AM  I SELF-DELUDED?
 A friend writes saying that I delude myself in believing that the boycott of foreign cloth has been attained largely through non- violence. I must deny the charge. For I am not unaware of the violent spirit that has crept into our picketing. In my opinion any contri- bution made by violent picketing will be found to be not only transi- tory but is likely to lead to reactions which we will all deplore. There shall be no compulsion in matters of trade and the like’ is a sound maxim of conduct. Picketing is valuable, even indispensable, aid to
 
 conviction and conversion. But a man who yields to threat or physical coercion resents it and simply awaits a suitable opportunity to revert to his original ways and resorts to reprisals when he is able to exact them.  I wish therefore that I could induce the reader to share my belief that every form of violence is harmful in the end and that we shall be able to assimilate only that much result of the past sufferings which was obtained without violence, i.e., through the voluntary sufferings of the people.
 KUMARAPPA
 The reader I know will feel proud of the statement made by J. C. Kumarappa before the court. Who that has read it can say that he did not deserve the punishment he received? His was a pure and full sacrifice in more ways than one.

272,"March 5, 1931",STATEMENT TO THE PRESSlibtech_195_footnote,"
    
 DELHI,
 March 5, 1931
 In the first place, I would like to state that this settlement, such as  it is, would have been impossible without the Viceroy’s inexhaustible patience and equally inexhaustible industry and unfailing courtesy. I am aware that I must have, though quite unconsciously, given him causes for irritation. I must have also tried his patience but I cannot recall an occasion when he allowed himself to be betrayed into irrita- tion or impatience. I must add that he was frank throughout these very delicate negotiations and I believe he was determined, if it was at all possible, to have a settlement. I must confess that I approached the negotiations in fear and trembling. I was also filled with distrust but  at the very outset he disarmed my suspicions and put me at ease. For myself, I can say without fear of contradiction that when I wrote my letter inviting the invitation to see him, I was determined not to be outdone in the race for reaching a settlement, if it could be reached at all honourably. I am, therefore, thankful to the Almighty that the settlement was reached and the country has been spared, at least for the time being, and I hope for all time, the suffer-ings which in the event of a breakdown would have been intensified a hundred fold.
 For a settlement of this character, it is not possible nor wise to say which is the victorious party. If there is any victory, I should say  it belongs to both. The Congress has never made any bid for victory.
 In the very nature of things the Congress has a definite goal to reach and there can be no question of victory without reaching the goal. I would, therefore, urge all my countrymen and all my sisters instead of feeling elated, if they find in the terms any cause for ela- tion, to humble themselves before God and ask Him to give them strength and wisdom to pursue the course that their mission demands for the time being, whether it is by way of suffering or by way of patient negotiation, consultation and conference.
 I hope, therefore, that the millions who have taken part in this struggle of suffering during the past twelve months will now, during
 
 the period of conference and construction, show the same willingness, the same cohesion, the same effort and the same wisdom that they have in an eminent degree shown during what I would describe as a heroic period in the modern history of India.
 But I know that, if there would be men and women who will feel elated by the settlement, there are, also those who will be, and are, keenly disappointed.
 Heroic suffering is like the breath of their nostrils. They rejoice in it as in nothing else. They will endure unendurable sufferings, be they ever so prolonged, but when suffering ceases they feel their occupation gone and feel also that the goal has receded from the view. To them I would only say, ‘Wait, watch, pray and hope.’
 Suffering has its well-defined limits. Suffering can be both wise and unwise, and when the limit is reached, to prolong it would be not unwise but the height of folly.
 It would be folly to go on suffering when the opponent makes it easy for you to enter into a discussion with him upon your long- ings. If a real opening is made, it is one’s duty to take advantage of it and, in my humble opinion, the settlement has made a real opening. Such a settlement has necessarily to be provisional as this is. The peace arrived at is conditional upon many other things happening. The largest part of the written word is taken up with what may be called ‘Terms of Truce’. This had to be naturally so. Many things had to happen before the Congress could participate in the delibe- rations of the Conference. A recital of these was absolutely necessary. But the goal of the Congress is not to get a redress of past wrongs important though they are: its goal is purna swaraj which, indiffe- rently rendered in English, has been described as complete indepen- dence.
 It is India’s birthright, as it is of any other nation worthy of that name, and India cannot be satisfied with anything less and throughout the settlement one misses that enchanting word. The clause which carefully hides that word is capable, and intentionally capable, of a double meaning.
 Federation may be a mirage or it may mean a vital organic state in which the two limbs might work so as to strengthen the whole. Responsibility, which is the second girder, may be a mere shadow or it may be tall, majestic, unbending and unbendable oak. Safeguards in the interests of India may be purely illusory and so many ropes tying
 the country hand and foot and strangling her by the neck, or they may be like so many fences protecting a tender plant requiring delicate care and attention.
 One party may give one meaning and another may give the three girders the other meaning. It is open under that clause to either party to work along its own lines and the Congress if it has shown readiness to take part in the deliberation of the Conference, it is  because it seeks to make Federation, Responsibility, Safeguards, reser- vations, or whatever other names they may be known by, such as would promote the real growth of the country along political, social, economic and moral lines.
 If the Congress succeeds in making its position acceptable to the Conference, then, I claim that the fruit of that effort will be complete independence. But I know that the way to it is weary. There are many rocks, many pitfalls, to be found across the way. But if Congressmen will approach the new task to which they are called, with confidence and courage, I have no misgivings about the result. It is, therefore, in their hands either to make something noble and worth looking at out of the new opportunity that has come to them or, by lack of self- confidence and want of courage, to fritter away the opportunity.
 But I know that in this task Congressmen will require the aid of the other parties, the aid of the great Princes of India, and last  but  by no means the least the aid of Englishmen. I need not make any appeal at the present juncture to the different parties. I have little doubt that they are no less eager than Congressmen for the real freedom of their country.
 But the Princes are a different proposition. Their acceptance of the idea of Federation was certainly for me a surprise, but if they will become equal partners in Federated India, I venture to suggest that of their own free will they should advance towards the position that what is called British India has been all these long years seeking to occupy.
 An undiluted autocracy, however benevolent it may be, and an undiluted democracy are an incompatible mixture bound to result in an explosion. It is, therefore, I think, necessary for them not to take up an uncompromising attitude and impatiently refuse to listen to an appeal from or on behalf of the would-be partner. If they refused any such appeal they would make the position of the Congress untenable and, indeed, most awkward. The Congress represents, or endeavours to represent, the whole of the people of India. It recognizes no dis-
 tinction between those who reside in British India or in Indian States. The Congress has, with great wisdom and equally great restraint,
refrained from interfering with the doings and affairs of the States and
 it has done so in order, not to unnecessarily wound the susceptibilities of the States, but, also, by reason of the self-imposed restraint, to make its voice heard by the States on a suitable occasion. I think that, that occasion has now arrived. May I then hope that the great Princes will not shut their ears to the Congress appeal on behalf of the people of the States?
 I would like to make a similar appeal to the English. If India is to come to her own through conference and consultation, the goodwill and active help of Englishmen are absolutely necessary. I must con - fess, that what seems to have been yielded by them at the Conference in London is not even half enough—no approach to the goal that India has in view. If they will render real help, they must be prepared to let India feel the same glow of freedom which they themselves would die in order to possess. Theselibtech_196_footnotelibtech_197_footnoteEnglish statesmen would have to dare to let India wander away into the woods through errors. Free- dom is not worth having if it does not connote freedom to err and even to sin. If God Almighty has given the humblest of His creatures the freedom to err, it passes my comprehension how human beings, be they ever so experienced and able, can delight in depriving other human beings of that precious right.
 Anyway, the implication of inviting the Congress to join the Conference is most decidedly that the Congress may not be deterred from any consideration, save that of incapacity, from pressing for the fullest freedom. And the Congress does not consider India to be a sickly child requiring nursing, outside help, and other props.
 I would like also to register my appeal to the people of the great American Republic and the other nations of earth. I know that this strug-gle based as it is on truth and non-violence from which, alas, we the votaries have on occasion undoubtedly strayed, has fired their imagination and excited their curiosity. From curiosity they, and spe- cially America, has progressed to tangible help in the way of sym- pathy. And I can say on behalf of the Congress and myself that we are all truly grateful for all that sympathy. I hope that in the difficult mission in which the Congress is now about to embark, we shall not only retain their sympathy but that it will grow from day to day. I
 
 venture to suggest, in all humility, that if India reaches her destiny through truth and non-violence, she will have made no small contribution to the world peace for which all the nations of the earth are thirsting and she would also have, in that case, made some slight return for the help that those nations have been freely giving to her.
 My last appeal is to the Police and the Civil Service departments. The settlement contains a clause which indicates that I had asked for an inquiry into some of the police excesses which are alleged to have taken place. The reason for waiving that inquiry is stated in the settlement it-self. The Civil Service is an integral part of the machinery which is kept going by the police department. If they really feel that India is soon to become mistress in her own household and they are to serve her loyally and faithfully as her servants, it behoves them, even now, to make the people feel that when they have to deal with the members of the Civil Service and the police department, they are  really dealing with their servants, honoured and wise undoubtedly, but nevertheless servants and not masters.
 I owe a word to hundreds, if not thousands, of my erstwhile fellow-prisoners on whose behalf I have been receiving  wires  and who will still be languishing in jails when satyagrahi prisoners who were jailed during the past 12 months will have been discharged. Personally, I do not believe in imprisoning, by way of punish- ment, even those who commit violence. I know that those who have done violence through political motives are entitled to claim, if not the same wisdom, certainly the same spirit of love and self-sacrifice that I would claim for myself. And, therefore, if I could have justly sec- ured their liberty in preference to my own or that of fellow-satya- grahis I should truthfully have secured it.
 But I trust they will realize that I could not in justice ask for their discharge. But that does not mean that I or the members of the Working Committee have not them in mind.
 The Congress has embarked deliberately, though provisionally, on a career of co-operation. If congressmen honourably and fully implement the conditions applicable to them of the settlement, the Congress will obtain an irresistible prestige and would have inspired Government with confidence in its ability to ensure peace, as I think it has proved its ability to conduct disobedience.
 And if the people in general will clothe the Congress with that power and prestige, I promise that it will not be long before every one of these political prisoners is discharged including the detenus, the Meerut prisoners and all the rest.
 
 There is, no doubt, a small but active organization in  India which would secure India’s liberty through violent action. I appeal to that organization, as I have done before, to desist from its activities, if not yet out of conviction, then out of expedience. They have perhaps somewhat realized what great power non-violence has. They will not deny that the almost miraculous mass awakening was possible only because of the mysterious and yet unfailing effect of non-violence. I want them to be patient, and give the Congress, or if they will, me, a chance to work out the plan of truth and non-violence. After all it is hardly yet a full year since the Dandi march. One year in the life of an experiment affecting 300 millions of human beings is but a second in the cycle of time. Let them wait yet awhile. Let them preserve their precious lives for the service of the Motherland to which all will be presently called and let them give to the Congress an opportunity of securing the release of all the other political prisoners and maybe even rescuing from the gallows those who are condemned to them as being guilty of murder.
 But I want to raise no false hopes. I can only state publicly what is my own and the Congress aspiration. It is for us to make the effort. The result is always in God’s hands.
 One personal note and I have done. I believe that I put my whole soul into the effort to secure  an  honourable  settlement. I  have pledged my word to Lord  Irwin  that  in  making  good  the terms of the settlement in so far as they bind the Congress, I should devote myself heart and soul to the task. I worked for  the  settle- ment, not in order to break it  to  pieces  at  the  very  first  oppor- tunity, but in order to strain every nerve to make absolutely final what today is provisional and to make it a precursor of the goal to attain which the Congress exists.
 Lastly, I tender my thanks to all those who have been unceasing in their efforts in making the settlement possible.

His Excellency jokingly remarked 	that, if I went there, perhaps things might settle down. What I 	understood to have been said in joke has now been said in all 	seriousness by three friends from the Province. They tell me that 	accompanied by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and Maulana Abul Kalam Azad 	and Dr. Syed Mahmud and Mrs. Naidu, I should proceed to the Province 	and they promised that, with the willing help of the authorities,  	things  can return to the normal, not only in the Province, but 	among the frontier     
 tribes living on the border. As my purpose now can only be to see peace restored everywhere and to assist in the process wherever possible, I do not want to go anywhere, for the time being, without His Excellency’s approval. It may not be possible for him to give me the reply without consulting local authorities, and therefore, it may not be possible for him to send me the answer today. But I would appreciate an early reply, and I shall hope that the local authorities will not reject my advance.
 I am in Delhi up to Sunday next and hope to leave for Ahmedabad Sunday night. If His Excellency favours the idea of my going to the Frontier Province, it is my intention to do so immediately after the Karachi Congress.

 DEAR WALCHAND,
 I thank you for your letter. In my opinion the meaning of the clause relating to boycott is absolutely clear. The word boycott may be omitted for its origin, when it was first coined, or for its recent memories. Let me then say that the exclusion of British in favour of Indian goods, Indian companies, shipping, insurance, etc., is not only permitted but favoured by the clause. What is however a taboo under the clause is preference to non-Indian foreign goods and foreign services over the British even irrespective of merits, a weapon the country used as a political lever with terrible effect during the civil
 
 “To make my point clear, I will cite shipping and insurance on the coast. There is only British shipping against Indian shipping. I take it that the Indian shippers can not only boycott British shipping interests but you will expect them to boycott these in order to encourage Indian shipping. The same can be said about Indian insurance companies and Indian cloth.

 disobedience campaign. If a permanent settlement is the aim of the provisional settlement, as it undoubtedly is, boycott or exclusion, by whatever name we call it, should cease whilst an attempt at perpetual friendship continues. But preference for swadeshi over non-swadeshi is, apart from political consequence which it may not have, a perma- nent obligation which no nation can ignore without hurting  its interests.

 March 6, 1931
 In the course of the interview Mr. S. Hasan Ali Khan put a number of questions  to which Mr. Gandhi gave prompt and satisfactory replies.
 The first question naturally related to the settlement just arrived at between the Viceroy and Congress, and Mr. Gandhi expressed himself perfectly satisfied with the compact as it stands.
 Q.	What would be the position of zamindars in the coming Constitution?
 A. They will have the same privileges and the same rights as at present. Every justice will be extended both to the zamindars and the tenants, provided they go hand in hand with us.
 You know the welfare of the country depends on agriculture and the agricul- turists form the great bulk of the country. In the course of the recent movement some of the young Congress workers have attempted to set the tenants against the land- lords. Further, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, in his presidential address at Lahore, expli- citly expressed his views against the landlords of the country. May I know what the significance of that statement is? May I also know how Congress views the question concerning this important class of people?
Yes, I know that the country entirely depends on agriculture,
 which in turn depends on zamindars and tenants, the two chief factors of the country. No such instruction was sent by the Working Committee. We do not want that the tenants should stand against the zamindars. I was present at the Lahore Congress session. The late Pandit Motilal, myself and Pandit Jawaharlal drafted the resolution concerning the zamindars and ruling chiefs, which was only meant to establish democracy. We never meant that there would be no room for the zamindars or for the so-termed relics of the past. As a matter of fact, we have every sympathy for the zamindars if they show a fair attitude towards the peasantry. We assure the zamindars that their  rights will be given due consideration in a swaraj constitution. I appeal to them to be generous to the Congress.

I 	told Mahatmaji 	that minority 	communities were 	clamouring for 	special rights and 	protection and 	that although there 	were three Parsis on 	the Round Table 	Conference none had 	pleaded the 	rights of 	Parsis; and 	I asked 	Mahatmaji whether he 	would advocate their rights as 	the Congress 	had decided 	to give 	all consideration to 	the rights 	of minorities. 	Mahatmaji said that 	Parsis were 	so strong 	that they could 	take care of 	themselves, that 	if he said 	that he would 	champion their cause it 	would look 	like egotism.

 At exactly 11.30 this morning Mahatma Gandhi invited the various journalists, Indian as well as foreign, who have . . . been . . . reporting the peace negotiations, to interview him for approximately an hour . . .
 Q.	You say that complete independence is an indifferent rendering for
 purna swaraj. What then is the real meaning of purna swaraj?
 A. Proper translation I cannot give you. I do not know any word or phrase to answer it in the English language—I can, there- fore, only give an explanation. The root meaning of swaraj is self- rule.‘Swaraj’ may, therefore, be rendered as disciplined rule from within and purna means ‘complete’.‘Independence’ has no such limitation. Independence may mean licence to do as you like. Swaraj  is positive. Independence is negative. Purna swaraj does not exclude association with any nation, much less with England. But it can only mean association for mutual benefit and at will. Thus, there are countries which are said to be independent but which have no purna swaraj, e.g., Nepal. The word swaraj is a sacred word, a Vedic word, meaning self-rule and self-restraint, and not freedom from all restraint which ‘independence’ often means.
 Is the settlement consistent with the Lahore resolution?
 It is, most decidedly. There is nothing to prevent the Congress at Karachi from reaffirming the Lahore resolution, and there is  nothing to prevent Congressmen from taking up that position at the forthcoming Round Table Conference. In fact, I do not think I am betraying any confidence, when I say that I took good care to ascer- tain that point and make the Congress position clear before approac- hing the question of settlement. I should feel bound to press for  purna swaraj at the Conference and we should deny our very exis- tence if we did not press for it.
 What did you mean by ‘swaraj without the Empire if necessary’, as you used to
 say?
 
 The Empire no longer remains, it having turned into a Commonwealth, and swaraj within the Commonwealth is perfectly possible. We may be an independent state and yet form part of a Commonwealth, as the U.S.A.
 Do you think the coming Federation will be like the U.S.A.? Have you received any guarantee as regards the composition of the Federation?
No guarantees. But it can in no case be less than Dominion
Status.
 But how can you say that, having agreed to the safeguards?
 I have agreed to no safeguards that are not in the interest of India.  The word has a bad odour, I know; it is a dangerous word.  But  I can quite conceive of safeguards essentially in the interests of India. The principle of safeguards in the Indian interest has undoubtedly been accepted but no specific safeguard has been accepted. The safeguards of my conception are of a totally different character. You will, therefore, see no mention even of transition in the clause. They can never be burdens imposed from without. They should be protec- tive, that is, in the real interest of the country. I cannot endorse safe- guards which compromise the interests of India.
 But you had the same thing presented to you in December 1929. Why should we have gone in for this terrible suffering to get no further than the position of 1929? You are making a great mistake. It is not the same position.
Lord Irwin could or would then promise nothing.  He simply reitera-
 ted the goal of Dominion Status. Today Dominion Status is in words a certainty and it is within our power to make it as compre- hensive as possible so as to mean complete independence. In 1929 we had no knowledge of the attitude of the Indian members. Today we know.
 There seems to be a gulf of difference between the position at Lahore affirming complete independence and the present parleys leading on to a settlement.
Even when I moved the Lahore resolution, I made it quite clear
 that independence need not mean complete dissociation from British connection. If we had been fighting a violent war there might have been ruin for one or the other party. But ours has been a non-violent war presupposing compromise. We have all the while assumed it, desired it. My letter to Lord Irwin was conceived in that spirit. The provisional compromise now makes an opening for us to go and ask for what we want.  As a satyagrahi it was my duty to seek for such an
 
 opening.
 You have said that you can conceive of safeguards which may be in the interest  of India. Are the present safeguards such?
They are not. They are an intolerable burden. Englishmen
 may say they are in India’s interest. But they have yet to convince me.
 Would you be prepared to admit any safeguards in the future constitution?
 Yes, those that may be reasonable and wise. Take, for example, the question of minorities. I can understand that we cannot achieve our purpose as a great nation if we do not regard the right of minorities as a sacred trust. I should regard it as a legitimate safe- guard. Then, as regards Finance, if we have a public debt, it may need to be safeguarded. The nature of such safeguard, I have not yet thought the thing out for myself. As regards the army and the ser- vices, I admit that we should guarantee the pay and fulfilment of any other condition that we may have undertaken, in connection with British officers and soldiers. But we must determine whose services are necessary for the welfare of India and under what conditions as to pay, etc.
 Will you repudiate India’s debts?
 I will not repudiate one single farthing that can be legitimately debited to us. But, unfortunately, there has been a great deal of con- fusion about this talk of repudiation. The Congress has never sought to repudiate a single rupee of the national obligation. But what the Congress has asked for, and will insist upon, is proof of the justness of the obligation that might be sought to be imposed on the incoming Government, even as a buyer would like to know what obligation he has to undertake when entering on a new purchase. The Congress has suggested that in case there can be no agreed adjustments, an inde- pendent tribunal should be appointed.
 Do you think the League of Nations a proper tribunal?
 So far as I can say off-hand, the League of Nations may be a proper tribunal, but, I do not know whether England would agree to get the question examined by the League, and I can well understand that hesitation. Besides, the League of Nations may not undertake such a responsibility. There should be no difficulty in securing an acceptable tribunal.
 Will you press this question at the Round Table Conference?
 It will be necessary to do so when the question of examination and acceptance of national obligations comes up. We would express our views as to the items that should be borne by us. But if England holds another view then the question of arbitration would arise and would be necessary. What, therefore, we want is a proper audit.
 Does this provisional settlement represent the practical application of the Sermon on the Mount as suggested by the Hindustan Times this morning?
 I do not think I can judge. It is for the critics to judge which principles have been applied by either party to the settlement.
 What is your idea of ‘purna swaraj?’ Would it be possible within the British Empire?
It would be possible but on terms of absolute equality. Com-
 plete independence may mean separation and popular imagination does understand it in that light. But, if we remain part of the Commonwealth, on terms of absolute equality, instead of Downing Street being the centre of the Empire Delhi should be the centre. India has a population of 300 millions and that is a factor that cannot be ignored. Friends suggest that England will never be able to recon- cile itself to that position. But I do not despair.
 The British  are  a  practical  people  and  as  they  love  liberty for themselves, it is only a step  further  to  desire  the  same  liberty for others.
 I know if the time comes to concede equality to India, they will say that that was what they had all along meant. The British people have a faculty of self-delusion as no other people have. Yes, to my mind equality means the right to secede.
 Would you like to have purna swaraj under the British flag?
There may be common flag or each party may have its own.

 March 7, 1931
 Before I begin, I must tell you how much I miss Maulana Shau- kat Ali here. He arrived this morning and it is a matter of inex- pressible sorrow to me that he should not be here, and I have no doubt you also will share my sorrow. But I may assure you that I shall miss no opportunity, leave no stone unturned, to persuade the Maulana and other Mussalmans to work with us on the same platform. It is a matter for shame that the ‘Big Brother’ with whom I travelled through the country for over two years and whom I took particular pleasure in describing as capable of carrying me in his pocket should not be here with me today. But if it is a matter for shame, I do not know how far I am responsible for it. I have spared no effort to remove that shame, but I have not succeeded. In this there is nothing surprising, inasmuch as we find even blood-brothers divided by sharp differences of opinion. But our differences have not in the least affected our friendship. I regard him, even today, as my friend and brother, and I have no doubt that he also has the same regard for me. But that affords me little consolation, for I want him to work shoulder to shoulder with me for the welfare of India, and I want his co-operation on my terms, as indeed he once used to give me. But that work ceased to appeal to him at a certain stage and he left the Congress platform.
 That preamble will give you an inkling of what I am about to say today. The settlement that has been just arrived at will fail of effect without a real heart-unity between Hindus and Mussalmans. Without that unity our going to the Conference will be of no avail. No one will pretend that the Conference can help us to achieve that unity. A heart- unity can be achieved between pure hearts purged of distrust and that can be achieved only outside the Conference. In this I seek your co- operation and ask you to count on my doing my utmost.
In a letter I received yesterday the correspondent asks me why I
 should not make the same advances to the Mussalmans as I did to the Viceroy. Why, he asks, should I not wait on esteemed Mussalman friends who are desirous of unity and beg on bended knees for their
 
 co-operation? I like the suggestion and the correspondent may be sure that I shall leave nothing undone to plead with my Mussalman friends. But you must understand that there are limits to the capacity of an individual, and the moment he flatters himself that he can undertake all tasks, God is there to humble his pride. For myself, I am gifted with enough humility to look even to babes and sucklings for help. And that reminds me that in this mission of mine I can count on the hearty and active co-operation of my sisters who beat all previous records of suffering and sacrifice during the last heroic campaign. To them I say : If you are convinced that Hindu-Muslim unity is a sine qua non I ask you to use against your own countrymen the same weapon of satyagraha that you used so effectively against Govern- ment. Tell your men that you will non-co-operate with them, you will not cook for them, you will starve yourselves and them so long as they do not wash their hands of these dirty communal squabbles. Assure me of your co-operation, and you will add tremendously to my strength and to my power of pleading.
 We Hindus are described, to a certain extent rightly, as the majority  community.  Well,  to  them  I  would  say  the  same  thing  as I used to do in 1921, viz., that voluntary surrender on  the  part  of either community—preferably by the majority community—of all rights and privileges would immediately effect this unity. It would be  a great thing, a brave thing, for the Hindus to achieve this act of self- denial. Let them say to the Mussalmans: ‘Have as big a share of the spoils as you want; we will be content to serve you.’ What after all are the things you are quarrelling for? Not indeed for air and water. It is for seats on legislatures and local bodies. What has the vast majority of you got to do with them? How many of you can go there? And what can you do there? Outside the legislatures you did wonderful things; you defied the ordinances, you defied lathi-charges  and ‘firing’ orders, because you were conscious of your strength. If you retain the same consciousness, what would it matter to you if your Parliament had all Mussalmans in it and no Hindu? I am sick of these squabbles for seats, this scramble for the shadow of power. How  I wish I could bring home to all Congressmen that they should have nothing to do with these legislatures? The very act of voluntary surrender will clothe you with a power undreamt of before.
 And you my sisters, what would you do by going to the Parliament? Do you aspire after collectorships, commissionerships or even the Viceroyalty? And what would you do if one of you were to
 be the Viceroy of India? I know you would not care to, for the Viceroy has got to order executions and hangings—a  thing  you would heartily detest. Supposing we, the ‘leaders’, were to run a race for getting the Viceroyalty, we would simply strangle ourselves. That is not the prize we have set our hearts on. We crave to be humble servants of the country. It is this spirit of service which I want to permeate the atmosphere. I want you to join me and share this aspira-- tion. But if it does not appeal to you, you had better give me up, for that is the condition on which I tender my service. I have no other secret but that of voluntary surrender.libtech_209_footnote
 ‘Where is peace?’ asks the nameless writer of this leaflet.‘The late Pandit Motilal thought of the Garhwalis on his death-bed. what have you done for them?’ that is another question that has been put to me. Well, I may tell you that when on the last day of his presence on earth he referred to the Garhwalis only I was by his side, no one else, not even Jawaharlal. I consider that as his last will and testament to me, as those were the last words I heard from him. But I know, much better than you, what he was thinking of. The writer  subscribes  himself ‘Young India’, but I may tell him that I am still the editor of Young India. Let him who would oust me from the editorship come to me and I will tell him what Pandit Motilal was referring to. You must remember that there were no ‘peace talks’ at that time, the peace ambassadors had not even arrived then, and the question of the freedom of Garhwalis could not be in the late Panditji’s mind. He was asking whether the relations and dependants of the Garhwalis were being properly looked after.
 The next question is about Bhagat Singh and others who are under sentence to death. How can there be peace, I am asked, when a sentence of death is hanging over the heads of these patriots? It is unfortunate that the young men distributing these pamphlets should not understand such a simple thing. They ought to understand that we have entered into no peace treaty. It is a provisional, temporary settle- ment we have arrived at. I beseech the young men not to bid good- bye to common sense, to cool courage, to patience, to reason. I have claimed to be a young man of 62. But even if I were to be labelled as  a dilapidated old fogey, I have a right to appeal to your good sense. I do not want you to take for granted all that old men say to you, but I
 
 him.
 want you to consider it and weigh it, and if you find that we ‘old’ men have bungled, that we have been guilty of weakness get us to abdicate, and assume the reins yourselves. But that presupposes cool courage and solid common sense.
 But let me tell you why Bhagat Singh and the rest have not been released. Maybe, if you had been negotiating you might have secured better terms from the Viceroy, but we the Working Committee would secure no more than what we have. I may tell you that throughout the negotiations I was not acting on my own, I was backed by the whole Working Committee. We brought all the presssure we could to bear on our negotiations and satisfied ourselves with what in justice we could have under the provisional settlement. We could not as negotiators of the provisional truce forget our pledge of truth and non-violence, forget the bounds of justice.
 But it is still open to us to secure the release of all you have named—and that can be done if you will implement the settlement. Let ‘Young India’ stand by the settlement and fulfil all its conditions, and if, God willing, Bhagat Singh and others are alive when we have arrived at the proper stage, they would not only be saved from the gallows but released.
 But I will address to ‘Young India’ a word of warning. These things are sooner asked for than obtained. You want to secure the freedom of those condemned of violence. There is nothing wrong about it. My creed of non-violence does not favour the punishment of thieves and dacoits and even murderers. I cannot in all conscience agree to anyone being sent to the gallows, much less a brave man like Bhagat Singh. But I tell you, even you could not save them unless you fulfil the condi-tions of the settlement. You cannot do so by violent means. If you pin your faith to violence, take it from me that you will not only not secure Bhagat Singh’s release but will have to sacrifice thousands of Bhagat Singhs. I was not prepared to do so, and hence I preferred the way of peace, of non-violence. The way that you have adopted has been on trial for centuries and history records numerous instances of the truth that those who use the sword shall perish by the sword. You will not stop at using  the  violent weapon against your rulers, you will use it against your brothers and sisters too, and others of your way of thinking will use it against you.
 I beseech you then, if you want the release of the prisoners, to change your methods, to accept the settlement, and then come and ask
 me about the Garhwalis and Bhagat Singh. Come to me six months hence, after you have implemented the settlement and gained in strength, and ask me the question you are asking today and I promise to satisfy you.
 Having suspended civil disobedience we now enter a period of disciplined obedience. We are now pledged to eschew all passive and active violence, direct and indirect violence in picketing foreign-cloth and liquor shops, but we are further pledged to relax our boycott of British goods minus British cloth. The settlement is an attempt at re- establishing friendly relations and it therefore means that we must lay down all weapons of punishment. Boycott of British goods was conceived, essentially, as a weapon of punishment and has, therefore, to be suspended. But we have to go ahead, even more energetically with the constructive programme, i.e., boycott of foreign cloth and liquor, the programme which means the economic and moral salvation of our poor starving millions.
 I must also explain that the relaxation of the boycott of British goods does not mean that we should prefer British goods to Indian goods. Indian goods you will prefer to all foreign goods for all time. Under the settlement you are pledged not to direct the weapon of punishment against the Britisher and accord a favoured treatment to other foreigners. And even that condition does not bind you to prefer British goods to other foreign goods; it binds you not to pursue the policy of aggressive boycott that you did heretofore.
 The boycott of foreign cloth and liquor, as I have said before, should not be relaxed, cannot be relaxed. It is our permanent progra- mme; but it should be purged of all its aggressive forms, e.g., social boycott, and persecution of the seller and the consumer. If you say boycott without these elements will lose all its edge, I will tell you that it argues want of faith in the efficacy of non-violence. Work achieved through aggressive picketing will be of doubtful worth, work achieved through loving persuasive pressure will be lasting. I ask you therefore to plead with the foreign-cloth seller and liquor seller to give up dealing in foreign cloth and liquor and take to some more honourable and cleaner calling. As to the constructive part of foreign-cloth boycott I want you to understand that it is impossible to achieve it without khadi. Mill-cloth is for those whom the Congress has not been able to reach; for Congressmen there can be no cloth other than khadi. It is a pity that where a few months ago there were thousands
 of taklis working, they should now be conspicuous by their absence. The period that follows should be one entirely devoted to constructive efforts.
 In conclusion, I would beseech you to realize the supreme importance of discipline. It is open to you to press for a different policy and different programme at Karachi. But let it not be said that we are a people incapable of maintaining discipline. Indiscipline wil mean disaster, and make one like me who is pining to see swaraj in his lifetime perish in sorrow and grief.
 It is my earnest prayer that God may give you the power to appreciate what I have said and to attain swaraj by pursuing the path of truth, justice and non-violence.

I must say that the Congress position is unequivocal and quite 	simple. The Congress is out to win purna swaraj at the 	earliest possible moment. It will, therefore, look with grave 	suspicion upon  any  dilatory tactics The Conservative fears about 	the so-called safeguards are justified. The Congress would accept no 	safeguard which is not clearly proved to be in the interest of 	India, and those that were discussed in London were certainly not in 	India’s interest.  	On questions of vital importance to India equivocation would be a 	dangerous pastime.  	If the Congress is represented at the Round Table Conference it will 	do so with the clearest conscience and with all cards laid on the 	table I therefore welcome Mr. Baldwin’s statement of Conservative 	policy. It will lead the Congress to understand the forces that will 	be arrayed against it.  The 	Times of India, 	12-3-1931          "

 March 11, 1931 Addressing a small gathering of men and women volunteers this morning, Gandhiji   explained  the   principles  of   the  new  programme.	At the outset, he congratulated the volunteers on their work and said that though the lady volunteers were less in number, their share was greater. Very few believed and the outside world did not at all believe that so many lady volunteers would come forward to go to jail cheerfully and undergo beating. The world was greatly impressed. It was not to be supposed that they (volun-teers) made no mistakes. No man was perfect, but on the
 whole Gandhiji felt that their virtues outnumbered their defects.
 Speaking about the future programme, Gandhiji said it involved greater responsi-bility and had to be prosecuted in a calmer atmosphere. Those who needed external enthusiasm would find it dry. Peaceful picketing meant that even a harsh word could not be used. Such great work could not be expected to yield fruit instantaneously like the magician’s mango tree. They should not lose interest in the future work of picketing. They should decide how far that work should be done by men and women together. Mahatma Gandhi desired that women alone should do that work. The atmosphere would thereby be elevated. Women might take the help of men in the work of organization, etc., but picketing should be their special work. The rest of the men should take to production of khaddar without which the boycott of foreign cloth was impossible. Concluding, Gandhiji said that volunteers might be paid a subsistence allowance, but their dignity should be greater than that of the Indian Civil Service.
 Searching questions were then put to Gandhiji regarding the boycott of British goods. Gandhiji said they could not whip a man for all time. They should lay aside the whip, when they were carrying on negotiations for settlement. Boycott of British goods was a form of punishing the British people, but if the British  befriended them and gave them complete swaraj, they might prefer British goods. One should buy goods from a friend.
 Asked what those who had taken pledges of boycott of British goods should do, Gandhiji replied that they could not take a pledge to give two stripes to an individual every day.
 Questioned if they could enter Government colleges, Gandhiji replied in the negative and said they could do so after the final settlement.
 In reply to a question regarding the discipline that volunteers should follow in camps, Gandhiji said they should not tell lies, abuse, smoke or eat sweets. When asked if they could drink tea Gandhiji humorously replied that they could drink tea from the river Sabarmati.

 As I think of you may heart goes out for you and I pray to God that the bond of affection between us may be stronger and that you may realize that there is no difference of any kind between you and me. I go about among mill-owners, I accept their hospitality, but my heart is always with you. It is my fervent prayer to God that He may never separate me from you, and that I may lay down my life in the service of the poor.
 You have in your statement rightly said that the swaraj of my dream is the poor man’s swaraj. The necessaries of life should be enjoyed by you in common with those enjoyed by the princes and moneyed men. But that does not mean that you should have palaces like theirs. They are not necessary for happiness, you or I would be lost in them. But, you ought to get all the ordinary amenities of life that a rich man enjoys. I have not the slightest doubt that swaraj is not purna swaraj until these amenities are guaranteed to you under it. I do not know when we will win it but we have all to strive for it. . . .
 Your work is making you known throughout the world. Students from the West marvel at the beauty of your organization and try to make a study of it. Your Union strikes them as unique. The members of your Union are jealous of their rights, and are prepared to lay down their lives for them, but their leaders, who guide them, have no ill will against the capitalists. In their welfare and their power you see your own welfare and power. That is the secret of your strength. Outside people cannot understand your position. They have thought of capitalists and working men as exploiters and exploited. All capitalists, according to some, are born ogres. But there need be no such inherent antipathy between the two. It is an erroneous notion. If the capitalists are apt to be proud of their wealth, the working men are apt to be proud of their numerical strength. We are liable to be swayed and intoxicated by the same passion as the capitalists, and it must be our prayer that both may be free from that passion. I feel that no class war poisons the relations between the mill-owners and the working men in Ahmedabad. I hope and pray, that the present cordial relations may be maintained between them.
 
 But the secret of your success is that the men and women, who guide you, have no axes to grind. They have no base interest to serve.
 It is the beauty of this organization, moreover, that made it possi-ble for the Union to take an active part in the civil disobedience move-ment.165 members of the Union took part as volunteers in the Dharasana Raid, and 191 went to jail as volunteers or pickets. It is a record of which any union may be proud.

304,,HOW TO DO IT,"
    
 The reader will find in this week’s issue the text of the provisional settlementlibtech_224_footnotelibtech_225_footnote, my Press statementlibtech_226_footnotelibtech_227_footnote, the reprint of my cross- examination by the Press correspondentslibtech_228_footnotelibtech_229_footnoteand some of my speecheslibtech_230_footnotewhich I hold to be important for the sake of understanding the settlement. I am sure, the reader will appreciate the reprint, if only, for the sake of ready reference. My statement,cross-examination and speeches have been carefully revised by Mahadev Desai.
 Those who will read the reprints with attention will not fail to discover that, if the last twelve months’ heroic and  hurricane campaign has brought us the hope of early attainment of swaraj, the cent per cent observance of the conditions of the settlement to be fulfilled by the nation will make the Congress an irresistible power for vindicating the national position. By our future conduct shall our immediate past be judged. Even if we have understood non-violence as the best policy, we shall now realize that whilst the truce lasts, it is obligatory on us meti-culously to respect the laws and orders thereunder. I dare say, we shall find it sometimes difficult to carry out orders which to us may appear capricious. We need not expect a change of heart in the official world all of a sudden. If, therefore, we are conscious of our strength and our ability to resume civil disobedience, whenever it becomes necessary, we should find no difficulty in obeying even irksome orders.
 The greatest difficulty, however, consists in duly observing the limits of picketing. I would like all Congress organizations to bear in mind that it is profitable for foreign cloth or liquor and drugs to be sold, now that picketing has to be unaggressive, rather then that there
 
 should be any aggressive picketing smelling of violence in any shape or form. Picketing under the settlement has to confine itself to pure educative effort. Every conversion brought about by educative effort must lead to permanent result. I have no doubt that in the long run unaggressive picketing will be found to be far more effective and the shorter method. Such picketing should not mean any undue restraint upon the seller or the consumer. After the picketer’s appeal, the seller or the consumer must be free to sell or buy, as the case may be. There should be no social boycott, such as, stopping barber’s services,  cutting off the water or food supply. But we are not obliged to deal with or receive services from those whose conduct we may disapprove. Thus, we may refuse to attend the social functions of one who has turned a deaf ear to public opinion or to have dealings with him even in matters other than his business of a seller of foreign cloth or drink and drugs. The golden rule is to err on the safe side, i.e., not to do the thing about which there is the slightest doubt. It should be borne in mind that whenever there is a clash between the dealer and the pickets, picketing has to be suspended. This clash can be avoided if we are gentle in our dealings with the sellers or consumers.
 It will be found on experience that unaggressive picketing will have to be done more in respect of the consumer than the seller. In other words, it means Congress penetration into villages. After all real service has to be rendered there than in the cities.
 The other most important thing is communal unity. It demands urgent attention. Without it, it would be vain at least for the Congress to attend the Conference and expect great results. How this unity is to be achieved I have shown in the Delhi speech printed elsewhere. The tangle can be loosened only by Hindus daring to trust and being content with the remainder left over after the minority have satisfied themselves.

305,,“YOUNG INDIA”,"
    
 It is possible again to resume publication of Young India under the law. The typed sheets were issued t show that possible to distri- bute several thousand copies among the readers even in spite of the prohibitive law called Ordinances.The moment however was decl aredthese sheets were discontinued.Fortunately discontinuance only meant a delay of a couple of days in bringing out the printed issue. The reader did not know how it was possible to distribute seven thousand copies of Young India sheets and ten thousand of Navajivan
 week after week. But he will be proud to know that this was possible only because of the willing, brave and self-sacrificing help of the old Young India and Navajivan staff who worked for less pay and numerous other volunteers. Both the publications cost over two thousand rupees monthly. The sheets were sent free of charge as owing to the Ordinance the subs-criptions might be confiscated. This was done in the hope that when the papers resumed normal publication the generous subscribers would make it a point of honour to pay their arrears of subscriptions. This hope, I doubt not, will be realized and from now the arrears will pour in. For a few weeks the paper will continue to be sent to the subscribers after which  the despatch will discontinue in respect of those who may be in arrears.
 Here I take thankful note of the fact that many subscribers, whom it was impossible to serve, never, in spite of the offer made by the management,asked for a refund of the balance of their paid subscrip-tions. These will now receive their paper without further payment till the balance is exhausted.
 Last, but not least, to be thanked is J. C. Kumarappa, who, after my imprisonment, added to his ordinary duty the onerous one of editing the paper. To him and all the staff and volunteers my thanks are due. I hope that the public will join me in the tangible manner they can, namely, by patronizing Young India and what is more fulfilling the mission for which Young India stands. The readers know that Young India and Navajivan do not exist for a commercial purpose. They are published for the sole purpose of educating the nation to win purna swaraj through truthful and non-violent means.

So long as you are not convinced about the spiritual reason for giving up non-vegetarian food, there is no need to give it up at the cost of your health.
 I insist that you should not leave Bombay till you have regained your health. You can continue to serve the country even from there.
 Write letters to me regularly. Get the statistics about the mill workers. And explain to everyone the significance of the struggle in Kheda. Do not worry that you will miss the experience here.

307,"March 12, 1931",SPEECH  AT  BORSAD,"
    
 March 12, 1931
 Instead of killing and getting killed, we have accepted the principle of seeking justice by laying down our lives and you, it may be said, have observed that principle to a large extent. It is not that there was no anger in you. But you Patidars of Kheda and others who are well known for their fiery tempers, who are given to drawing their swords at the slightest provocation and who are a fervent, vigorous people, deserve to be congratulated on having courageously put up with everything. The fact that you young men sat quiet while in the by-lanes of Borsad women were being beaten with sticks, kicked and subjected to indignities is something that is incredible. But you allowed the women to be beaten and did not raise your little finger even in their defence. If this had happened in other circumstances, those who had allowed women to be beaten would have been called cowards. However, who would use this word with reference to the young men of Borsad? The reason was that all of you were bound by your pledge. It was your pledge not to use violence on the Government’s men who had harassed you in various ways. You were pledge-bound like Bhima and Arjuna. At the time when Draupadi’s hair was b eing pulled, Bhima was boiling with rage, his eyes were red, but he did not raise his club; the other brothers too were passive spectators the entire scene. Would anyone, however, refer to
 those five husbands as cowards? On the contrary, we congratulate them, regard them as having attained spiritual merit; history sings their praises. History will sing your praises also, my heart is doing so now and I am expressing it here. If I have been guilty of exaggeration in saying that there was a Thermopylae at various places in Kheda, you yourselves should correct that mistake. My task is not that of a professional pane-gyrist, I wish to make you worthy of that fame. Hence, accept praise to the extent you deserve it.
 I was merely an instrument used for the settlement which has been reached. That settlement has taken place between the Congress and the Government despite the fact that it may have been called the Gandhi-Irwin Settlement. It is the dharma of the Sardar and myself to explain this settlement. Some persons have been disappointed by it and ask whether this is to be called a settlement or a disgrace? It seems that some persons have a doubt that a person like me has become tired of carrying on a struggle, has become despondent and hence has thrown away his self-respect. It is said that this taluk has suffered a loss of Rs. 13 lakhs. People must be wondering what kind  of a settlement this is in which there is no mention whatsoever of making good this loss. I ask you to point out to me if I had at any time promised to make good this loss. If I had ever done so, it would be tantamount to breach of a pledge. I am also not aware of the Sardar having given any such promise. Your servants, your leaders, can be called traitors if they do not keep their promise after having given it. And, if that happens, how will you have faith in us in future? You would come to the conclusion that since these people betray you in this manner, why should you support them any longer? In this case, however, no pledge given to you has been broken.
 This settlement is not the end of the struggle. That will come only after securing swaraj. And perhaps it may not come even after swaraj has been secured, because an occasion may arise when satyagraha may have to be offered against the swaraj Government. The settlement which has been made now is a step forward in our journey towards swaraj. The settlement has been made in the hope that what has now to be secured will be done through talks, discussions and  negotiations.  I do not recall having said anything,  or the Sardar having said anything, about compen-sating you for your losses. If any volunteer had given you such hopes,  I must  admit that he had done so thoughtlessly. You must not hold the [Congress] Committee the Sardar or me responsible for it. After the Dandi pilgrimage, I have all along been saying that this is a do-or-die struggle, you may be ruined in it and how can those who are prepared
 
 to be ruined ask for compensation for loss? You have been told by beat of drum that your homes will be robbed, you along with your family will become destitute—you were told that you should join the struggle if you were prepared to suffer this, otherwise, not. Hence you and I will have to differ if you hold that a settlement has not been reach-ed so long as you have not been compensated for your losses amounting to Rs. 13 lakhs. If this amount is to be forthcoming, where is it going to come from? It will be taken out of your own money— that loss will be compensated with the tax of which the greater amount comes from the pockets of the poor rather than the rich. Even if we had the power to empty out the entire treasury, I would still not agree to do so and would ask you to choose another trustee. This is not the occasion to calculate the amount which we have borrowed or lent out. Whether this settlement should have been concluded or not is another question, but did it involve any lowering of our self-respect? I say to you that it did not involve that in the least. How can you ask for any compensation? Even if we lose our life and  property,  the compensation indeed will be there—compensation in the form of swaraj. If you are not prepared to suffer even this loss, it will be said that the people of Kheda were misers, they were not prepared to be robbed. Even when we have won swaraj, even if we have the capacity to make good this loss, you will be undoing swaraj if you ask for compensation.
 Of course, there is one thing that the Sardar and I would regard as a slap in our faces. The land which belongs to you and which has been given away to someone else is surely something which you cannot afford to lose. We cannot ask for compensation for any loss which has been incurred because we do not ask for the dead to be restored to life or ask for compensation for a period of imprisonment undergone. But this land must be recovered.  If Durbar Gopaldas was  a fool, he would believe that he had lost Dhasa, but he is no fool. He believes that if he is alive, he will regain many Dhasas. If we were to be satisfied with recovering Dhasa alone, we would have included it even in this settlement. But where was the need to do so? Whoever had heard of the Durbar when he lived at Dhasa? Kalyanji did not write his biography when the Durbar was staying there. By leaving Dhasa and coming over here, the latter gained fifty Dhasas. Even if he gets back that Dhasa today, what would he do with it without swaraj?
 Likewise, this land is yours, and will continue to remain yours— unless water submerges the land and the latter becomes an island, that
 is, if God swallows it up, then that is a different matter. Although the Sardar had agreed to have your land restored to you, I had not. But there is no doubt that that land will be restored to you; it cannot be said when and how this will be done, but you will certainly get it back. Just this one thing is sufficient to test the Sardar and me, viz., the land which has been lost must be restored. And until this is done, you must believe that swaraj has not been won, that we are not your true servants. In order to do so, we shall ruin ourselves and not spare you either.
 How can we say that we shall take that land back from the Baraias by fighting? How can I speak of fighting in this manner? The responsibility of getting that land back rests with me and the Sardar.

 Not only have the Dharalas not joined you, but they have taken up your land as well. In appropriating your ancestral land, they have defiled our tradition and dishonoured our country. You apprehend a quarrel with the Dharalas while entering the village. If you want to win swaraj, how can you bypass the Dharalas? You cannot put up with it if the village headmanship which was held by Patidars for ages passes to the Dharalas. But that should not be so. A Mukhi is not your leader, he is your servant. How then can you fear a servant? If you have thoroughly grasped the idea that right from the Mukhis and the Ravanias up to the Collector and the Governor all are servants of the people, there is nothing to be afraid of. You do such a lot for us because the Sardar and I are your servants. If we were to act as your masters, you would not have cared for us. At the moment let a Dharala be the Mukhi. As long as he conducts himself properly, you may carry out his orders. At  the appropriate moment, he will resign of his own accord. If my words reach the Thakore of Dahevan, I request him not to take your land, because he will not be able to hold it for long. For one thing, he has not paid its full price, and for another, even if he had done so,  the land could not become his own.  He  will have merely taken advantage of the plight of the people who are fighting the Government. I urge all those who have appropriated the land to return it to those from whom it was taken.  A time is coming
 
 when even the most backward community will not remain out of the scope of swaraj. Under swaraj, there will be no such divisions as Dharalas, Patidars and others but all alike will be Indians. Despite 30 crores of names, they will all be one. Under Ramarajya, even a dog should receive a fair deal; why then talk of men? Since we want to establish such a rule, I have asked you not to fear the Dharalas and the Headmen. Have self-confidence and go and live in your homes from the morning of the 16th. If everyone who stole anything goes back and quietly replaces it in those houses, we shall be having Ramarajya. When you start for your homes, I shall inform the Government too. A satyagrahi entertains neither ill will nor  fear.  When the women have faced lathi-charges, what can the men fear?

 This last paragraphlibtech_235_footnoteseems to wash out all the heroic suffering that you have gone through. The proportion of losses to the revenue that you have worked out is unfair to you and to your suffering. Revenue amounting to Rs. 69,000 was in question here, but supposing it was a single rupee even then I would have called upon you to go through the same suffering and the same losses. The amount of the revenue was not the issue. The issue was the refusal to pay and to take the consequences. You say you have suffered so much that now you will have to borrow if you are to pay the revenue dues. If you cannot pay, as I know many of you cannot, there is provision for suspension. But do not give the impression that you are unwilling to pay. Ask for suspension wherever necessary and promise to pay up as soon as you are on your legs, and let your word be your bond.

 March 14, 1931
 Addressing a large public meeting, Mr. Gandhi said he was glad they continued their work, and made Gujarat known to the world after his arrest. Now they should apply themselves to the work that was to be prosecuted.
 Proceeding, Mr. Gandhi said now they had not to practise civil disobedience of laws, but to do constructive work. He emphasized what he had said in 1922 that if they prosecuted constructive work for six months, swaraj would be won. But constructive work, which they had to prosecute now, was of a different type. Those who could pay should pay up land revenue. If there was occasion to renew the fight, they could stop payment of land revenue, which was paid every year.
 Mr. Gandhi added that they had also not to manufacture salt with a view to court jail. Those people living near the seashore might manufacture salt for their own consum-ption. They might even sell among themselves such salt but they could not sell it in distant towns and cities. Salt was being manufactured for consumption by the poor and not for trade. They could manufacture salt for trade when they had secured political power.
 Continuing, Mr. Gandhi said they had to carry on peaceful picketing of liquor and foreign-cloth shops. They had to approach drunkards in their homes and persuade them to give up drink. They might similarly picket foreign-cloth shops if there were still any in their villages, but they must take to production of khadi. The speaker felt satisfied that they had established a panch in their village and urged the panch to  
 manage all their affairs from settlement of disputes to sanitation and policing. If such panches were established in all villages it was easy to win swaraj.

 This function appears to me to be to a great extent out of place and uncalled for. The association of merchants, dealers as they are in foreign cloth, ought not to have thought of presenting the address to me or the Sardar. The presentation, if it must be made, ought to be accompanied by a pledge that they would never in future have anything to do with foreign cloth and also the intimation that they have either burnt their present stock or sealed it.  How can we, whose
 
 daily prayer is for the entire extinction of this trade, accept an address and a purse from dealers in it? I would, therefore, plead with the friends to take back their purse and their address. The address affords no information about the associa-tion and reads as though it was a citizens’ address. That smacks some-what of a bogus translation, as I said to the Sardar. Satyagraha eschews all make-believe. I have no relish for the title of the Mahatma given me by the people, if only because I am unworthy of it, but I have given myself a title of which I am proud. I call myself a satyagrahi, and as I must live up to it. I cannot but utter the bitter truth, whenever there is an occasion for it. The acceptance of the purse and the address would be a bitter dose for me, as its presentation should be for you too. But, if I cannot convince you, I must ask you to take both of them back. I have had occasions in my life when I have practised satyagraha against my brother and my wife, and today’s occasion can be no exception. I would have to return the address and the purse, as I would return a title from a government with which I non-co-operate or a gift from a liquor seller. I want you to understand that I would compromise myself to the cause if I agreed to accept your address. I would, however, spare you a sudden shock, hold the address and the purse in trust for you. You can ponder over what I have said and decide whether you will present them on my terms or take them back because you will not give up foreign-cloth trade.

312,,MY NOTES,"
    
 TO WORKERS
 You may be tempted to go to Karachi for the Congress session. Resist the temptation. A Congress session is not a show, not a picnic.  It is intended for drawing up the next year’s programme; hence the rule is that only that worker goes there who has to go in order to serve. One should not delude oneself that one can learn a lot there. He who goes there at the call of duty would surely learn something. Ordinary people who can spare time, who have no work to do at their places, have a right, and some may even have the duty to attend the Congress. The duty of the worker who serves is the opposite of this. If his leader sends him there, it is incumbent on him to stick to his duty. This duty at the present time particularly holds good  for  Gujarat. When the refugees go back to their villages, it is the duty of every worker to stay with them.
 SOME PICKETING RULESlibtech_238_footnote
 In picketing foreign cloth or intoxicating drinks and drugs, let it be remembered, that the aim is to convert the addict or the buyer. Our object is moral and economic reform. The political consequence is but a by-product. If Lancashire ceased to send us its cloth and the Government ceased to use the abkari revenue for any purpose save that of weaning the drunkard or opium eater from his vice, we should still be engaged in picketing work and allied propaganda. The following rules therefore must be read in that light :
  In 	picketing shops your 	attention must 	be riveted 	on the 	buyer. You 	should never be 	rude to 	the buyer 	or the seller. You 	may not attract crowds 	or form cordons. Yours 	must be a silent effort.  You 	must seek to 	win over 	the buyer 	or the 	seller by 	your gentleness, 	not by the awe of numbers. You 	may not obstruct traffic.  You 	may not 	cry hai 	hai or use 	other  expressions 	 of shame.  You 	should know 	every buyer and 	his address and 	occupa- tion 	and penetrate 	his or 	her home 	and heart. 	This presupposes 	continuity of 	same picketers.  You 	should try 	to understand 	the difficulties 	of buyers 	and sellers, 	and where 	you cannot 	remove them you should 	report them to your superiors.  If 	you are picketing 	foreign cloth, you 	should have 	some khadi 	or at least 	sample book with prices and 	should know the 	nearest khadi 	shop to which 	you could 	take the buyer. 	If the 	buyer does not 	wish to 	buy khadi 	and insists 	on mill-cloth, 	you should 	direct the 	buyer to 	an indigenous mill-cloth seller.  You 	should have relevant 	literature upon your 	person for distribution 	among the buyers.  You 	should join or 	organize processions, 	lectures with or 	without magic lantern, 	bhajan parties, etc. You 	should keep 	an accurate 	diary of your 	day’s work.  If 	you find your effort 	failing do not 	be disheartened 	but rely 	upon the universal law 	of cause 	and effect 	and be 	assured that 	no good thought, word or deed goes fruitless. To think well, to speak 
 
 well is ours, reward is in the hands of God.
NOTE.	If you think of any other rule please forward it to me.
 APPEAL TO FOREIGN-CLOTH MERCHANTS
  Remember 	that you 	hold in 	your hands the 	economic independence 	of India.  Remember 	that a 	potent cause of 	India’s slavery is 	your involvement 	in the 	dirty foreign-cloth trade.  If 	you get ruined 	for the purpose 	of atoning 	for this 	sin committed 	by you 	knowingly or 	unknowingly, that 	atonement will 	be regarded 	as none 	too great.  Remember 	that you are responsible 	for the impoverishment 	of India, 	the destruction 	of its 	extensive industry and 	the continuing loss.  Remember 	that it 	is the people’s 	dharma always to boycott 	foreign cloth.  Remember 	that even under swaraj, there will be 	no trade in 	foreign cloth.  If 	you sell the goods 	you have with you 	clandestinely, that 	is a different 	thing, however 	regrettable and 	shameful. But the Congress can never give you permission to sell those goods in India.  If 	you decide 	not to 	engage in 	this trade, 	you can certainly export 	at a loss 	the goods 	lying with you.  You 	know that efforts are 	afoot to 	extend to 	you such help 	as can be given.  You 	cannot certainly 	say that you 	had not 	received an adequate 	warning. The Congress 	has made 	great efforts since 1920 to 	wake you up.

313,,313. TRAGEDY OF THE ELEVENTH,"
 We can see that the present awakening among the people has goneday byday out of our control.We got its sad proo on the eleventh at the massive women’s meeting in Ahmedabad. After I left, there was such a stampede that seven sisters got crushed in it and received injuries. Among them was the wife of shri Moolchand Asharam. She survived for a few hours and then died. Another sister whose name I
 do not know was injured seriously and, until I left Ahmedabad, her life was in danger. The remaining five sisters received some injuries. Who is to console and how can anyone console all these and the husband of the departed sister? How can one condole such deaths? Who can be blamed for this? Even such tragedies are like offerings at the altar of the swaraj yajna. Until we culti-vate the ability to regulate, until we learn to organize such mam-moth gatherings, accidents will certainly occur. Only through them shall we learn discipline and order. None can block awakening; meet-ings cannot be abandoned and police men cannot be engaged to maintain order. No-where are they engaged for this purpose. Only volunteers maintain order at such meetings and many have already acquired the ability to keep order.
 At the present moment we have been maintaining such order as there is in meetings through a corps of volunteers. But the sad and shameful thing is that no rules as to how to maintain order at meetings have been framed for the benefit of the volunteer corps. The latter should draw up such rules and train volunteers, and should make these rules widely known among the people too. I give herewith some by way of suggestion.libtech_239_footnote
  The 	meeting should be 	always held 	in the 	open when thou- sands 	are expected 	to attend. 	It should 	be circular 	in shape, 	the centre 	containing the 	dais to 	be reached by 	ways protected by 	strong wooden 	fences, running 	radius-like to the centre.  The 	dais should be 	made up 	of planks, and 	strong enough 	to support 	several people.  The 	ways to 	the dais 	should be 	clear of spectators 	and guarded 	at each 	end by volunteers.  The 	fence should be 	so constructed as 	to leave no 	room for 	ingress through the fencing.  The 	leaders when they enter 	should not be 	surrounded by 	cordons of volunteers. The volunteers should stick to their posts firm as a rock.  The 	way should 	be absolutely 	clear before 	leaders  are  taken 	to the dais.  Volunteers 	should be posted 	at fixed 	places in the 	meeting. They 	should not stand, 	but their 	presence should be 	indicated by 	flags held 	in their hands. 
 
 
  Volunteers 	ought to know 	flag signalling.  If 	the meeting 	is held 	in an enclosed 	space, it should 	have a sufficient number 	of exits, 	and the 	attendance should 	 be  strictly limited 	to the capacity 	of the space.  Leaflets 	of instructions 	should be 	distributed at 	every meeting.  The 	organizer should read 	aloud to 	the meeting these 	instructions before the 	proceedings begin.  Water 	and other emergency 	accessories ought 	to be available whenever needed.  If 	there is 	a large 	attendance and 	people arrive long 	before the 	hour of 	the meeting, 	there should be 	arrangement for 	Ramdhun (repeti-tion 	en masse by 	the meeting 	of God’s name) 	and for preliminary lectures.  Proper 	care should 	be taken 	to prevent 	people from rushing 	to the dais. 	They should not be 	allowed to 	push in 	to get a nearer seat, 	but should 	be asked 	to stay 	where they are. 
 These rules are given merely by way of sample. I have jotted down those that struck me while writing. I know that many important rules many have been left out, that some may even be useless. It is the task of the volunteer corps to study them and to modify them.
 Lady volunteers ought to be very vigilant. They  ought  to prepare themselves to tackle the sudden awakening among women. Even if at the moment they need to take the help of men volunteers, they should do that. Let none say that accidents took place on account of want of possible care on our part.

314,,TO “NAVAJIVAN” SUBSCRIBERS,"
    
 I congratulate the subscribers to Navajivan on the help given by them and those co-workers who by self-effacement very cleverly ensured that the journal reached about ten thousand subscribers, when it was being published illegally. We had been able to supply it to almost all subscribers at that time. Despite the fact that those who did not want Navajivan during that period were requested to ask for a refund of the balance of their subscription, hardly anyone must have done so. Navaj-ivan will continue to be sent every week to those whose subscriptions are still running. Those who were receiving the issues that were being publi-shed illegally are requested to send in
 their outstanding subscriptions. If they do not send in their subscriptions within about a month, the management will assume that they wish no longer to remain subscribers to Navajivan. Nevertheless, as they used to receive the illegal issues of Navajivan, I hope they will send in their subscription to cover those issues.

 "
315,,TO PROUD GUJARAT,"
    
 Gujarat has immortalized its name and at the same time added to India’s glory.The whole world has come to know Bardoli and Borsad. Europe celebrated one Thermopylae, but Tod has recorded that a Thermo pylae was staged in every street in Rajputana. Those Thermo pylaes were sanguinary. It is no exaggeration to say that in Gujarat, nay in India, non-violent Thermopylaes have been enacted almost every-where. Only men took part in those other Thermopylaes. In these non-violent Thermopylaes women have played an important role.
But that is not enough.
 We have to do more yet and what is more difficult. What is required for this is quiet strength, not fiery force. What a man can do when excited, he cannot do when he quietens down.We like excitement, not industry and constructive work. Now industry and constructive work are implicit in action. However, if we wish to develop our capacity for swaraj, we must build up both our desructive and constructive capa-cities. We must clear our field of weeds; but he who lets his field lie fallow after weeding it wastes his effort and unwanted grass grows in it again. However, he who sows his field after weeding it is a wise farmer and becomes prosperous. In exactly the same way, if we do not sow seeds in the form of  constructive activity, the weeding in the form of the past twelve months’ non-violent movement will go waste.
 Some people hold that this settlement is no settlement but that we have committed a serious mistake and have lost everythings. I hope that no Gujarati will entertain such a doubt. But I do know that just as there are doubting Thomases elsewhere, Gujarat too has its share of them. It is Navajivan’s duty to allay their fears.
Here is a doubt :
 Has any great change occurred in the circumstances to warrant my attending the Round Table Conference without those guarantees
 
 which we had demanded in December 1929 and again from Yeravda Jail?
 Let us consider this question.  We did not know in 1929 or while I was in Yeravda what stand the British parties and our people would take at the Round Table Conference. Today we have to decide the matter after knowing that the Conference has made some headway. That makes a lot of difference. On those two occasions, we knew nothing of the set-up of the Round Table Conference. Today we  know it somewhat. Today we know that the leaders of India have asked for a fully responsible government. The British parties have accepted the demand. It is true that all those who attended the Round Table Conference have agreed to retain the Empire  link. We  of course are asking for the right to snap that link at our discretion. We have complete freedom to demand this right at the Round Table Conference. We shall be guilty if we do not attend the Conference, despite getting the right to demand complete independence.
 Moreover, on those two occasions, we did not have a complete measure of our strength. Today we have some idea of it. If a weak person undertakes negotiations, he is a beggar. A strong man is always ready for parleys. If a strong party declines  to  negotiate,  it  is  regarded as arrogant and blameworthy.
 Therefore, by effecting a settlement, the Congress has shown its wisdom and has enhanced its prestige.
 There are other criticisms too. The answers to them are covered by my statementlibtech_240_footnotelibtech_241_footnoteafter the settlement and by my interviewlibtech_242_footnoteto Press reporters thereafter. And since they will certainly appear in  Navajivan, I do not refer to them here.
 Readers whose doubts have been laid at rest can  easily understand that if we observe in full the conditions of the settlement which we have to honour, the prestige of the Congress will rise high. And if we do not observe them or observe them half-heartedly, we shall forfeit the prestige already gained.
 In addition to observing these conditions, we must do three things : boycott of foreign cloth, prohibition of intoxicants and khadi production and propaganda. I have already explained these matters thoroughly. Hence I content myself only with mentioning them here. These topics will be discussed occasionally in Navajivan. At the  present moment through its first issue to be legally published again, I should like merely to request Gujaratis to make their full contribution to this programme.

		 MEETING,  PARELlibtech_247_footnote","
    
 March 16, 1931
 I knew that there were Communists in India, but I had not met them outside the Meerut Jail, nor even heard their speeches. I made a point of interviewing the Meerut prisoners two years ago during my tour in the U.P. and thus managed to know them somewhat. I have heard one of them this evening, and I may tell them that such as they claim to win swaraj for the working men, I have my doubts about their ability to do so. I had made the working men’s cause my own long before any of the young Communists here were born. I spent the best part of my time in South Africa working for them, I used to live with them, and shared their joys and sorrows. You must therefore understand why I claim to speak for labour. I expect at least courtesy from you if nothing else. I invite you to come to me and discuss things with me as frankly as you can.
 You claim to be Communists, but you do not seem to live the life  of  communism.  I  may  tell  you  that  I  am  trying  my  best  to live up to the ideal of communism in the best sense of the term. And communism does not, I fancy, exclude courtesy. I am amongst you today, within a few minutes I will leave you. But if you want to carry the country with you, you ought to be able to react on it by reasoning with it. You cannot do so by coercion. You may deal destruction to bring the country round to your view. But how many will you destroy? Not tens of millions. You may kill a few thousands  if you had millions with you. But today you are no more than a handful. I ask you to convert the Congress if you can and to take charge of it. But you cannot do so by bidding goodbye to the elementary rules of courtesy. And there is no reason why you should be lacking in ordinary courtesy, when it is open to you to give the fullest vent to your views, when India is tolerant enough to listen patiently to anyone who can talk coherently.
 The truce has done no harm to the labourers. I claim that none of my activities has ever harmed the workers, can ever harm them. If the Congress sends its representatives to the Conference, they will
 
 press for no swaraj other than the swaraj for workers and peasants. Long before the Communist Party came into existence the Congress had decided that that swaraj would have no meaning which was not the swaraj for workers and peasants. Perhaps, none of you workers here gets less than a monthly wage of Rs. 20, but, I am  working  for winning swaraj not only for you but for those toiling and unemployed millions who do not get even a square meal a day and have to scratch along with a piece of stale roti and a pinch of salt. But I do not want to deceive you, I must warn you that I do not bear any ill [will] to the capitalists, I can think of doing them no harm.  But I wantlibtech_248_footnotelibtech_249_footnote, by means of suffering, to awaken them to their sense of duty, I want to melt their hearts and get them to render justice to their less fortunate brethren. They are human beings, and my appeal to them will not go in vain. The history of Japan reveals many an instance of self-sacrificing capitalists. During the last satyagraha, quite a number of capitalists went in for considerable sacrifice, went to jail and suffered. Do you want to estrange them? Don’t you want them to work with you for the common end?
 You have asked me about the Meerut prisoners. I want you to know that I would release every convict from our prisons, if I had the power. But I could not in justice make their release a condition prece- dent for the settlement. I may tell you that I am striving my utmost  to get them released, and if only you will decide to cooperate with me by creating a calm atmosphere we may be able to get all of them released, including even the  Garhwalis.Youare  talkingof independence. Do not I want it as much as you? (Cries of “substance of independence”.) Yes, I want substance and not shadow. For the present, I want you to cultivate a little patience and see what the Congress puts forward as its minimum when the time comes. I assure you we will repeat the Lahore resolution at Karachi and if we chance to go to the Round Table Conference we will either return with what we want or with nothing at all.
 ‘What about the eleven points?’ you have asked me. They contain the substance of independence to my mind. Peasants and working men are well protected under them. But I could not repeat the points at the time of the settlement for the simple reason that they were submitted as an alternative to the launching of civil disobedience. We have now been through civil disobedience and if we are invited we have to go to the Round Table Conference to press our national
 
 demand. If we succeed there all the eleven points are secured. You may be sure that no swaraj which does not satisfy the eleven points can be acceptable to me.
 God has given you intellect and talent. Turn them to proper account. I beseech you not to lay an embargo on your reason. God help you.

 March 16, 1931
 I am returning from a meetinglibtech_250_footnoteof workers at Parel.  I have very little time to spare, but I am confident that the workers do not need any lengthy speeches. I have just received a letter asking me several ques-tions. I shall not deal with them here. If the writer is here he should note that replies to his questions will appear in Young India and Navajivan.
 To me and to the Congress, swaraj means freedom to the masses. It means that Congress will never agree to any scheme which does not protect the rights of the workers and peasants. Rest assured that the truce has not in any way affected adversely the rights of the workers. It has not given us swaraj.
 We have not called off the movement because we are cowards. I have been receiving letters not to go ahead. Such letters did not influence me in the least. I do not think there is anything in the truce for which we need be ashamed. Unwittingly, I must have erred, but it is only human to err. In my opinion there is nothing in this truce which I can call a mistake. It might be that I was in a position to ask a few things more which I did not. But that was because I did not want to be unfair. The question of Meerut and Bengal prisoners was in my mind but I could not press for it to the extent of breaking off the negotiations.
 The workers have not yet sufficiently realized their strength. They are not properly organized. If they do it they can rule India. But they must improve themselves before they are able to do it. They must clean themselves of the many vices that are a curse to them. They must give up drinking and gambling. If they do so and understand the message of peace and non-violence we can  attain swaraj even with the strength of the workers. If you read the history
 
 of the South African struggle you will see that the success was due to the workers. When 60,000 workers out of the total population of 1,00,000 organized themselves for satya-graha they could attain in six months what they had not been able to do in several years.
 Do not be misled that the movement is finally stopped. It is only a temporary suspension. We are pledged to the Lahore resolution of independence and if that demand is not satisfied there will be no other way for us but to continue the fight and next time I feel we will have to do it much more intensively. May God give you the strength to continue the fight.

319,,INTERVIEW TO SUBHAS CHANDRA BOSE,"
    
 BOMBAY,
 March 16/17, 1931
 At 10 p.m. Gandhiji received Mr. Subhas Bose who kept him engaged till 2.30
 a.m. I understand Mr. Subhas presented his case for the release of all Bengal political prisoners and the right to carry on propaganda in favour of independence.
 Gandhiji explained to him that the Delhi Truce Pact had only  suspended hostile activities and the civil disobedience programme, and  did  not  prevent anybody from carrying on propaganda for independence for India. As a matter of fact, the Congress could present its case for independence at the R.T.C. As  regards  the release of political prisoners convicted of violence and Bengal Ordinance detenus, Gandhiji is reported to have said he could not place it as a condition precedent to truce, as he was not in a position to give an undertaking to the Government that prisoners convicted of violence would not again resort to it during the truce period if released. He was sure their detention was only a question of six months at the most, and at the time of concluding peace finally the Congress would be justified in making release of all political prisoners a condition precedent.

 I would surely see to it that the Government observes the truce terms just as the Congress does. It is natural that the Government would take more time as it has to function officially according to all the rules. But if we ultimately come to know that the truce terms have been violated, we too are not bound to observe them. Volunteers should spin regularly.  If I were your captain I would strictly enforce
 
 that rule on you. I would not enrol you as volunteers as long as you do not agree to spin regularly. If our demand for complete independence is not accepted, then you will have to join the struggle again and that fight would be fiercer than the present one.

         BOMBAY, 
  March 	17, 1931  	I have said nothing publicly yet and I have not yet complain- ed but 	I am daily receiving evidence that in certain parts things are not 	going on as well as they might. I am certain Lord Irwin and the 	Central Government are playing the game, and doing their utmost to 	fulfil the letter and spirit of the settlement. But it appears to be 	very different with some of the provincial Governments. It is the 	old question of the district officer, who is really powerful enough 	to set Viceroys and Governors at nought. Again and again it has been 	my experience that the district officer has the power  of  making  	or marring the policy of the Govern-ment. In some places there was 	reason and common sense, in some others there was unreason, 	fierceness and brutality; and in between, there was mere caution and 	hesitancy. Lord Irwin’s spirit has not yet perco-lated down to the 	districts.  	I do not think there should be any difficulty about people who are 	said to be guilty of a violent speech under Section 124. No one was 	more violently seditious in this sense than I was, and yet I am out 	and others are still in jail. I am hoping that, within the next few 	days, most of these people will be released. But at the present 	moment I am receiving far too many complaints to be entirely happy 	about the situation. I am afraid in far too many cases the line 	between sedition and violence was not drawn in the proper spirit.  The 	Hindu, 18-3-1931

322,"March 17, 1931",INTERVIEW TO MERCHANTS’ DEPUTATION,"
    
 BOMBAY,
 March 17, 1931 The members of the Indian Merchants’ Chamber, Bombay, headed by the President, Sir Chunilal Mehta, waited in a deputationlibtech_252_footnoteon  Gandhiji last  evening at his
 residence.
 The question of trading rights was discussed. It is understood Sir Chunilal Mehta and Mr. Walchand Hirachand drew Gandhiji’s attention that, from the last London Conference report, it was clear that there would be no discrimination between Indian and British industries and trades. They argued that, in the present unorganized and undeveloped state of indigenous industries, absence of discrimination would militate very strongly against the development of the latter in competition with British and foreign interests. They urged on Gandhiji the necessity of demanding protection for Indian industries at the next Conference quoting the Nehru Report in support of their argument.
 Gandhiji told the deputationists that they ought to have approached Sir Tej Bahadur in the first instance, and asked him how he proposed protection to Indian industries without discrimination. The Congress had to overcome other difficulties affecting more vital issues, but he assured them that the Congress for its part would see what could be done to support them. In the mean while, he  asked  the  deputationists to carry on an agitation for what they were demanding.libtech_253_footnote

 26-3-1931.
 
 Whatever other countries might have done or not done, India should take such steps to protect and develop her industries as it might suit best her own interests.
 That the right of the future Indian Parliament to discriminate between Nationals and non-Nationals, whenever  Indian  interests require it, shall remain intact and unimpaired.
 The claim of Europeans to be treated as minority community needing protection is untenable.
 No one has any right to pick up a paragraph from Nehru Report and fling it in our face when other parts of the Report are discarded.
 I would advise you to carry on propaganda in connection with this important matter.
 As regards the report of the statement said to have been made by Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru about the paragraph appearing in Nehru Report of the definition of citizenship, it should be read together with the inter-pretation given by Pandit Motilal Nehru on the floor of the Assembly and the decision taken by the All-Parties Convention at Calcutta on the subject of the definition of a ‘citizen’.

		 MAIDAN,  BOMBAYlibtech_254_footnote","
    
 March 17, 1931
 An age has passed since I appeared before you on my release and the impossible size of the meeting prevented me from delivering my message to you. A new age has begun and I appear before you this evening to deliver again my message which however is far different from the one on the previous occasion. That day’s message was simple, today’s is comparatively complex. For full twelve months we have developed a war mentality, we thought of war, we talked of war and nothing but war. Now we have to sing a completely different tune. We are in the midst of truce. With some of us, I know the very mention of the word ‘truce’ sends a shiver through their body. That is because we had thought of nothing but war and had believed that there could be no compromise. But that was not a position becoming  a true satyagrahi. The satyagrahi whilst he is ever ready for fight must be equally eager for peace. He must welcome any honourable opportunity for peace. The Working Committee of the Congress saw such an opportunity and availed itself of it. The essential condition of  a compromise is that there should be nothing humiliating, nothing panicky about it. You may be sure that whilst I was being inundated with telegrams to make peace at any price, I was absolutely unmoved by them. I am inured to such things and I was absolutely firm that I must not allow any of these telegrams to make me flinch from whatever decision my inner voice gave me. Whilst however a satya- grahi never yields to panic or hesitancy, neither does he think of humiliating the other party, of reducing it to an abject surrender. He may not swerve from the path of justice and may not dictate impossi- ble terms. He may not pitch his demands too high, neither may he pitch them too low. The present settlement, I submit, satisfies all these conditions. One of the terms of the settlement seems to have caused some  disappointment  in  certain  quarters  and  some   have   rushed in to condemn the settlement on that account. They complain that we ought not to have entered into the settlement until we had secured the release of all political prisoners. I may tell you that we could not in justice make this demand.  Not that there was any lack of will on our
 
 
 part, but the power to make the demand irresistible was lacking. That power will come as soon as we fulfil in letter and in spirit all the terms of the settlement that apply to us.
 I may inform you that local Governments have been remiss in ful-filling their part of the contract. Some prisoners who ought to have been released are still in jail, some prosecutions—like the Chirner firing case—that ought to have been withdrawn are still going on. It is a matter for sorrow. If the remissness or failure is deliberate it would be culpable. But it would add to our power and make our case for swaraj more irresisti-ble than ever. One would like to think however that such remissness would not be deliberate in view of the stupendous machinery of Govern-ment. There is likely to be unintentional delay and inadvertence. But if there is deliberate breach of faith, we have our sovereign remedy. If you look at the settlement the last clause empowers Government to set its machinery of law and order in  motion in the event of failure on the part of the Congress to fulfil its part of the settlement. Need I tell you that the clause necessarily includes its converse? Even as it would be open to Government to set its machinery in motion, it is open to us also to resort to our infallible weapon as soon as we find that there is a deliberate breach.
 But the present delays need not agitate or irritate you. For there is no occasion for it. A satyagrahi has infinite patience, abundant faith in others, ample hope.
 And now a word of warning. The settlement is obviously provi- sional. But it necessitates a change in our method of work. Whilst civil disobedience and jail-going, or direct action was the method to be followed before the settlement, the way of argument and negotia- tion takes its place. But let no one forget that the settlement is provisional and the negotiations may break down at any stage. Let us therefore keep our powder ever dry and our armour ever bright. Failure should not find us napping, but ready to mobilize at the first command. In the mean while let us carry on the process of self- purification with greater vigour and greater faith, so that we may grow in strength day by day.
 And now a word of explanation. The  settlement  does  in  no way  commit  us  to  a  position  less  than the  Lahore  resolution.   It is of course open to us to revise the position taken at Lahore but nothing in the settlement would oblige us to do so. And you may be sure that we are going to ask for nothing less than independence. Whether we will get it is another matter. It depends upon what power
 we can exert on the delegates belonging to the other parties in India, on what conviction we carry with them. But the fact is there that we may go the whole hog and there is nothing in  the  settlement  to prevent us. There is the matter of the much-talked-of  safeguards. Now my position is this, that it is open to us to ask for a revision in toto of the safeguards as suggested by Mr. Mac-Donald. How far we shall be able to achieve what we want will depend on the extent to which we fulfil the constructive programme which has its own three girders—communal heart-unity, complete boycott of foreign cloth and prohibition of drink and drugs. Let us strain every nerve to fulfil our programme and thus make our demand irresistible.

 I am grateful to you for the purse and the address, which are rendered more welcome by the fact that the president today is my friend Sjt. Natarajan, that the welcome address was read by Mrs. Lukamani, a well-known member of the Tyabji family with whom I am bound by unaccountable ties of affection, that the purse was presented to me by Kamalabehn, a prominent lady who has not only helped the movement by most liberal contributions, but also by going to jail. I am happy to think that I am going to Delhi loaded with all  this wealth of affection.
 I thank you for the reference in the address to the  sacred  memory of the late Pandit Motilal Nehru. His death meant to me a personal loss of an irreparable character. I was not at all exaggerating, when on the day of his death, in a message to a newspaper,libtech_258_footnotelibtech_259_footnoteI said that I felt more widowed than Mrs. Motilal Nehru. For her the sacred memory of her husband, coupled with a pious life, would be some compensation, but all my piety and self-restraint cannot give me the warmth of his wise counsel that I need so much today. I missed it so sorely during my conversations with the Viceroy and my conference with the members of the Working Committee. His presence would have meant a heavy load off my head and your touching reference to him recalls sacred memories of my friend and counsel.
 It is needless to congratulate you on the great record of work that has been briefly described in your statement. My  joy  knows  no  bounds  when  I  recollect  that  the  work  here was  inaugurated by some of my nearest and most faithful co-workers. But now, we are  entering on  a  stage  which  will  try our   patience   and   our skill to the untmost. Civil disobedience was difficult enough, but once it is understood, it is easy.

 fully and the  vanaras also covered themselves with glory.libtech_260_footnoteThe spirit of revolution makes the difficult easy. But scrupulous obedience to irksome rules and constant work are a much more difficult process. There will be occasions of irritation and grave annoyance, but, even on those occasions, the tendering of obedience may be duty. For that obedience will in itself be a preparation for a future struggle, if it becomes necessary.
 I am being blamed for having surrendered too much. We might have won much more, it is said, if we had kept on fighting. This is easier said than done. Certain things could be done in a fit of enthusiasm, but the constructive work in front of us will necessitate patient, ceaseless toil.   That will be a preparation of swaraj.   Governing a sub-continent like India is no easy task. It will need not only patient toil, but cool-headed statesmanship.
 Complaints pour in about the dilatory methods of local Govern- ments in implementing the settlement.
 Some delay is unavoidable. I would plead for patience. If we find that there is a deliberate, continuing breach of the settlement, we have our remedy, as the Government have theirs if we break it. The last clause in the agreement implies its obvious converse. But we  cannot at any and every moment unsheathe our sword. We cannot make our unfailing instrument so cheap. It is, therefore, my obvious duty to urge my co-workers to be patient. One has to consider the difficulties of a stupendous machinery like Government. It is not possible for them to reach their local Government as quickly as it is for us. It is because the system is so rotten and so top-heavy that we had to make war against it. It takes some time for an order to reach Bombay from Delhi; then it has to be sent to the district officer who in turn passes it on to his subordinates. The vicious process is hardly complete, when some local official takes it into his head not to respect the order. We have to take all these factors into consideration, and then, if we find that the breach or the dilatoriness is deliberate or inten-tional, we resume hostilities. But the present interlude necessi- tates a good deal of precaution and patience.
 You have told me about the liquor-shop picketing done in your suburbs. When you have put out 150 women in the field the work is half done. Both, foreign-cloth picketing and liquor-shop picketing, are things for which women are particularly suited. And unless you
 
 put forth your best effort, the work of those who go to the Conference will be of no avail. Argument and negotiation may go on there, but it will be meaningless without constructive effort here to back it.
 Let there be, therefore, no slackening of effort, no fatigue or weariness in our ranks. Foreign-cloth boycott is a stupendous business requiring the harnessing of all our resources and sacrifice of  the  purest type. Swaraj is close at hand, if only we exert all our powers to the utmost to grasp it. May God give you the strength and will for the task.

326,,THE CONGRESS,"
    
 The Congress will be upon us in a few days from now. The broken-up organizations will hardly have been put together by that time. The delegates, half of whom will be ex-prisoners, will hardly have had time to collect themselves. And yet, it will meet with a greater prestige than ever before, and with a consciousness of its new strength born of a knowledge of sufferings undergone by tens of thousands of men, women and children, and perhaps unparalleled in history in the sense that the sufferers suffered without retaliation.
 But it would be wrong to brood over the sufferings, to exagge- rate them, or to be puffed up with pride. True suffering does not know itself and never calculates. It brings its own joy which surpasses all other joys. We shall, therefore, be guilty of suicide if we live upon the capital amassed during the past twelve months. Whilst we must try always to avoid occasions for needless suffering, we must ever be ready for them. Somehow or other, those who will walk along the right path cannot avoid suffering notwithstanding the attempt to avoid it. It is the privilege of the patriot, the reformer and, still greater, of the satyagrahi.
 The settlement, provisional though it is, has  come through God’s grace. During the negotiations there were times when break- down seemed a certainty. Beyond doubt, the suffering would have been ten times multiplied if a breakdown had taken place. And yet, I would have been obliged to ask the nation to go through it, had an honourable peace proved impossible. But I am not sure that it will be possible to reach the goal without further wider and deeper suffering. The measure of our purification seems hardly equal to the prize to be won. We have not yet consciously, and on a national scale, got rid of
 the curse of untouchability, we have not shed distrust of one another. Great though the awakening has been among the rich, they have not yet made common cause with the poor; their life bears no resem- blance to that of the poor. Though much progress has been made in the case of drink and drugs, much more yet remains to be done; the progress made is still uncertain. The drunkard has yielded to pressure of public opinion. He has not yet definitely given up the habit. He knows the evil but has not been taught to shun it as poison. The word ‘taught’ has been used advisedly. The workers have confined their attention to the drink and drug shops, they have not made a serious attempt to touch the heart of the addict. We have not shed the desire for foreign cloth and fineries, nor have the cloth merchants fully realized magnitude of the wrong they have done to the nation by their trade. Many of them still parade the doctrine of individual freedom. These and several other evils that can be easily recalled show how much still remains to be done in the matter of self-purification. And so, it is little wonder if we do not find the atmosphere of purna swaraj pervading us. How far, therefore, the method of consultation and conference will succeed, it is difficult to forecast. This much is certain that argument is not what will carry conviction. The British conviction will be in exact proportion to the strength we have developed. And since the nation has decided that we will acquire strength only through self-purification, if we have not attained the wisdom during these good months of grace to rid ourselves of the evils I have enumerated, then we must go through a fiercer fire of suffering than ever before. Let us, therefore, approach the Congress with a humbled spirit and with a will bent on removing every form of weakness from our midst. We must not give undue weight to conferences and the like.The past twelve months have made it clear for us that swaraj will come when it does, from within, by internal effort, not as a free gift from above or by simple argument.

327,,NOTES,"
    
 THEIR PART OF THE OBLIGATION
 Reports continue to pour in upon me from Tamil Nad, Andhra, Bihar, the Punjab, Bengal and other places to the effect that the local authorities are not carrying out the terms of the settlement or are illiberal in giving effect to it. Even prisoners convicted under Section
 124A of the I.P.C. have not yet been discharged. The fact is, that civil resisters were convicted under many sections, even those dealing with violence, although they had never done or meant any violence. The Sholapur prisoners, numbering about 150, are also not yet discharged. The majority, if not all of them, are no more guilty of violence than I am. They were to be discharged. I cannot understand why they are being still detained. In Contai, things are reported to be still worse. There the punitive tax is said still to be realized. A procession too is reported to have been broken up. I have drawn attention to these cases in proper quarters and I hope that the settlement will be given effect to by the local authorities. Some delay on the part of the local Governments in giving effect to the settlement was inevitable. But there must be a limit to it. And the continuing exaction of the tax, if the report be true, is an unpardonable and manifest breach of the settlement. So much for the cases covered by the settlement.
 There are also the Bengal detenus and other political prisoners. It was not possible to press for their discharge as condition of the settlement. But I can assure the public that they were not forgotten. And I am not without hope that they will be discharged in due course.  I can only urge patience and in spite of reported laxity on the part of the local authorities a due discharge by us of our part of the obli- gation. That will enable us more effectively to secure the discharge of those not covered in name by the settlement. In any case, let the public understand that for the Congress it is only  a  question  of months when either the power must pass into the hands of the nation or it must, God forbid, reembark, if no other course is left open, upon the well-trodden course of suffering. Those, therefore, who have faith in the national awakening will not be over-hasty or anxious about many things that need to be set right.
 
 FOREIGN-CLOTH DEALERS
 Foreign-cloth dealers seem to think that the settlement gives them the licence to carry on their business just as they please. It is true that picketing is to be robbed of every element of compulsion and that those who feel they have sealed their stock through coercion, are free without the slightest molestation to unseal their packages. But they must realize that neither will picketing stop altogether nor will public opinion against foreign cloth wane. Complete banishment of foreign cloth is a vital necessity for the nation for all time, so far as we
 can foresee the future. If these merchants have any  faith  in  the country they must know that swaraj is not far off. But, whether it is far or near, the agitation against the foreign cloth as against intoxi- cating drink and drugs will continue. And when swaraj is attained, among the first measures of such government must be prohibition of foreign cloth and drugs. One impoverishes the nation, the other destroys the very soul.

328,"March 19, 1931",INTERVIEW WITH VICEROY,"
    
 March 19, 1931
 Mr. Gandhi came to see me today on his return from Bombay. The first point  to which he drew my attention was the statement of the Secretary of State during the debate in the House of Commons, in which he had emphasized that in the considered view of His Majesty’s Government there could be no abatement of the financial safeguards proposed in the Federal Structure Committee. He put the point, as I had expected, that if the attitude of the Government was unalterable on the particular proposals in this field, as distinct from the broad necessity of ensuring the general purpose of safeguarding India’s credit, he was very doubtful whether it would be useful for Congress to participate.
 I told him that I did not  see  the  need  for  any  complaint  on  the  ground that the Secretary of State had explicitly stated the position of His Majesty’s Government.  His own friends and he  himself  were  constantly  stating  in  terms  no less explicit the position of Congress. I had, for example, seen only this morning a speech of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru in which he had said that Congress could agree to nothing, unless the last British soldier was withdrawn from India. It might  no doubt be that Mr. Gandhi and his friends would find difficulty in accepting the statement of the considered position of His Majesty’s Government, just as His Majesty’s Government would find great difficulty in accepting the position laid down by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, but surely it was unnecessary to despair of reconciliation of views by full discussion, in which it would be the duty of all those participating to bring forward arguments and reasons in defence of their position. I had no hesitation in saying that the fundamental purpose of His Majesty’s Government in this matter was simply to make India’s financial credit and stability as sure as it could be made.  In the view of the Secretary of State and of His Majesty’s Government the particular methods suggested were the best for achieving this result; but I should not suppose that if anybody could bring forward better methods, not less effective, on which greater agreement might be reached, there would be any reluctance on the part of His Majesty’s Government to give them careful consideration. He said he would consider the position with his friends; and his attitude on this point, as well as his subsequent conversation, led me to feel that he would not run out over it.
 
 I then referred briefly to the matters that he was going to discuss with Mr. Emerson.libtech_261_footnoteThese were, first of all, the complaints that I understood him to have made on the subject of particular failures on the part of Government to implement the agreement in individual cases of release. As to this, I told him that I had naturally not been able to inform myself of individual cases, but that from communications I had from Governors I was quite satisfied that local Governments were playing the game very fairly, and that it was a remarkable achievement to have got rid of something like fourteen thousand prisoners in a few days.  There were no doubt a number of cases  in which the element of doubt arose. These were now being examined as expeditiously  as possible, but it must be recognized this examination took more time than the treatment of cases in regard to which there was no doubt, and that the discretion in doubtful cases was vested with local Governments. I told him that I thought his people were very impatient and with this view he seemed not to disagree.
 We then had a good deal of discussion about the methods being employed by Congress for the encouragement of swadeshi production, and I told him that the method of blacklisting particular mills, which did not conform to terms laid down by Congress, seemed to me wholly outside the spirit of our agreement, in that it seemed to impose severe economic coercion of individual liberty. His line of defence in reply was to say that no objection could be taken to exhortation to buyers to purchase only Indian cloth; that in pursuance of this Congress were clearly entitled to make information available as to what were the mills which made Indian cloth; and that this automatically led to other mills wishing to ascertain the conditions that had to be fulfilled by them in order to qualify for inclusion in the approved list. He strenuously denied  that this  was  either  outside  the  letter   or   the   spirit   of   an   agreement that gave full latitude for the encouragement of Indian industry. He added that their action was purely economic, and that they had expressly withdrawn by circular any injunction against the purchase of British goods as compared with foreign in  branches of goods which India could not supply; and also added that many of his people had told him that without effective picketing, which in their view was impossible under the agreement, his plans could not succeed. I left this subject saying that I would have all the facts examined, and asked him to discuss the matter in greater detail with Mr. Emerson.
 The last subject we discussed was the future procedure of the Round Table Conference. On this he said that it would make it very difficult for Congress to participate if no British delegation came to India before the resumption of the full Round Table Conference in England. Already there was suspicion, consequent upon the abandonment of the original idea of a British delegation visiting India. It would not be expected that a delegation coming to India would be in a position to take
 
 decisions, and the final stages could well be taken in London. But he did attach very great importance to a British delegation coming out to India in june or July for the purpose of making contact, getting into touch with Indian feeling and thought and, if this were done, he saw no great difficulties about the subsequent assembly of the full Conference in London.
 I told him that Jawaharlal’s attitude, as reported in the Press, seemed to me impossible.  Frankly, he appeared to have no spirit of peace and all his utterances left   a clear impression on my mind that he certainly regarded the present arrangement merely as an uneasy truce, which had to be used only for the purpose of strengthening Congress for the next encounter. He said that Jawaharlal was very mercurial, but was already beginning to come down. Of this, however, I told him I saw no sign.
 In conclusion, he told me that he anticipated no great difficulty at Karachi and said that he proposed to attend my informal meetinglibtech_262_footnoteon Saturday and hoped to accept my invitation to bring two or three others with him.
 His general attitude was friendly and he seemed not less anxious than he was last week to tread the path of peace.
 As he was leaving, he asked if he might mention the case of Bhagat Singh, saying that he had seen in the Press the intimation of his execution for March 24th. This was an unfortunate day, as it coincided with the arrival of the new President of the Congress at Karachi and there would be much popular excitement.
 I told him I had considered the case with most anxious care, but could find no grounds on which I could justify to my conscience commuting the sentence. As to the date, I had considered the possibility of postponement till after the Congress, but had deliberately rejected it on various grounds :
  that 	postponement of 	execution, merely 	on political 	grounds, when 	orders had been passed seemed to me improper;  that 	postponement was 	inhuman in 	that it 	would suggest 	to the 	friends and 	relatives that I 	was considering 	commutation; and  that 	Congress would 	have been able legitimately 	to complain 	that they 	had been 	tricked by Government. 
 He appeared to appreciate the force of these arguments, and said no more.

 DEAR MR. EMERSON,
 I send you two telegrams onelibtech_264_footnotelibtech_265_footnotefrom Ranpur regarding salt and the other from Patna regarding satyagrahi prisoners. The latter is from one of the best and the most cultured of co-workers who is most careful in making statements. The wire about salt is from one who has been a member of the Legislative Council, Bombay, and is the Editor of an influential, widely-read weekly newspaper. The arbitrary limit of one mile practically nullifies the relief clauselibtech_266_footnotelibtech_267_footnoteof the settlement and has been evidently fixed without knowledge of the actual condition of the villages in relation to the salt areas.  In my opinion there cannot be a mileage limit. The limit, as I suggested at our conversations, can be easily and justly fixed by issuing instructions that the villagers, so long as they walk from their villages to the salt areas, should not be interfered with. The relief clause was intended to give substantial help to the poor, which it can never do under the one-mile formula. I hope that both the matters will receive prompt attention. I shall thank you to return the telegrams after use.libtech_268_footnote

  "
332,"March 21, 1931",INTERVIEW TO THE PRESS,"
           DELHI, 
  March 21, 1931 If Lord 	Sankey and Mr. Wedgwood Benn regard the safeguards evolved by the 	Round Table Conference as final  in  substance  and form, 	then there is  no  use of  our going to  London and the Second  	Round Table Conference, as far as the Indian masses are concerned, 	must fail.  Gandhiji 	pointed out that, under the terms of the recent truce with Lord 	Irwin scope is allowed not only for a full and free discussion of 	the whole question of safeguards, but it is expressly stipulated 	that safeguards are to be considered in the interests of India. I 	feel therefore that the statements in Parliament made by Mr.  	Wedgwood Benn and Lord Sankey that the safeguards must be in the 	interests of England as well as of India are not strictly in 	conformity with the spirit of the truce.  Concerning 	the Hindu-Muslim question, Gandhiji expressed grave doubts as to 	whether unity could be achieved before the National Congress at 	Karachi. He hoped however that some measure of accord would be 	reached which might save the way for an eventual agreement between 	these two groups, whose dissensions had torn India for centuries.  Asked 	if he would favour Geneva for the Second Round Table Conference, 	Gandhiji, replied : Geneva 	would be desirable if the British delegation were sitting  	as an impartial judge over India’s future status, but it is not. 	The British are, in a sense, our opponents. Therefore the procedure 	must be by direct negotiation. In such negotiations the atmosphere, 	sur- roundings, and local influences play a vital part. I am sure 	England would never agree to Geneva. If I had my way I would hold 	two con- ferences, the first in India and the second in England. 	That would make for fairness all around. But wherever the Conference 	is held, it is of the utmost importance that it should be convened 	without loss of time.  Q.	Do 	you expect 	to hold 	the National Congress to 	the terms of 	the truce 	with Lord Irwin? A.	Yes, 	but if Bhagat Singh is hanged, as it now seems almost certain, 	 it  may  have  highly  unfavourable  repercussions  upon  the 
 younger element in the Congress who may attempt to split the Con- gress.
 Q.	Do you entertain any hope that Bhagat Singh may be saved at the last minute?
A.	Yes, but it is a very distant hope.
 Gandhiji laughed over the speculation in the London Press as to whether he would bring Mirabai to London.
 If I go to the Second Round Table Conference why should not I bring her? She is a most useful assistant and besides she is anxious to see her mother who lives in England.
 Turning from politics to general subjects, Gandhiji answered a number of questions.
 Q.	Do you think the League of Nations will succeed in exterminating war?
 A. War will never be exterminated by any agency until men  and the nations become more spiritual, and adopt the principle of brother- hood and concord rather than antagonism, competition, and brute force. Those in the West do not recognize the power of spiritual things, but some day they will and then they will be free from war, crimes of violence and things that go with these evils. The West is too materialistic, selfish and narrowly nationalistic. What we want is an international mind, embracing the welfare and spiritual advancement of all mankind.
 Q.	How would you cure the evil of armaments?
 A. By non-violence, which will eventually be the weapon of all nations. I say ‘eventually’ deliberately, because we shall have wars and armaments for a very long time. It is two thousand years since Christ preached His Sermon on the Mount and the world has adopted only a fragment of the imperishable lofty precepts therein enunciated for the conduct of man toward man. Until we take all Christ’s prin- ciples to our hearts, war, hatred and violence will continue.
 Q.	What is your remedy for the prevailing crimes of violence, divorce, and drink in the United States?
A.	I would cure them all by self-purification and non-
violence.
 Q.	Why did you refuse to allow the Ahmedabad Municipality to erect a monument to you?
A.	Because man’s best monument is not a thing of stone, but
 consists in living deeds and in memory which survives in the minds of those he served.  Such funds should be used for the uplift of the poor
 and not to glorify or immortalize in marble a man who merely served his brother man.
 Q.	How long do you expect to live?
A.	Until eternity.
 Q.	Do you believe in immortality?
 A.	Yes, reincarnation and transmigration of souls are funda- mentals of the Hindu religion.
 Q.	If all men adopted your simple mode of living, fasting and exercising, do you think they should live to be hundred?
A.	Yes, but that can he determind better after I die.
 Q.	Which Government most nearly approaches your idea of an ideal Govern-ment?
A.	None. It should be government wherein man reaches his
 full stature in every phase of life, and where his interests are para- mount over all others.
 Q.	Will socialism accomplish that?
A.	Not socialism, as it is practised politically today.
 Asked if he would favour the retention of American and other foreign missionaries when India secured self-government, Gandhiji replied :
 If instead of confining themselves purely to humanitarian work and material service to the poor, they do proselytizing by means of medical aid, education, etc., then I would certainly ask them to with- draw. Every nation’s religion is as good as any other. Certainly India’s religions are adequate for her people. We need no converting spiritually.libtech_269_footnote

 "
333,"March 21, 1931","DISCUSSION AT MEETING OF R.T.C. DELEGATED,  DELHIlibtech_270_footnote","
    
 March 21, 1931 His Excellency met this morning (21st March, 1931) at 11 a.m. the Ruling Princes and the delegates to the Round Table Conference who are at present in Delhi.
 Mr. Gandhi, Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya and Sir Hugh Cooke also attended.
 
 His Excellency opened the proceedings by welcoming the gentlemen who were present and by describing the rough heads to which, it seemed to him, discussion might profitably be directed.
 These heads were five in number, namely :
  The 	statement made 	by the 	Secretary of 	State in 	Parliament “about the 	practical programme which we hope to pursue”. Special 	investigations recommended by 	the Round Table Conference.  What 	may we suppose 	is happening 	in India 	itself, for 	instance as 	re- gards communal settlement and the discussions in States regarding Federation?  How 	do people see 	the work of the Federal Structure Committee developing and when will the time be ready for its further discussions?  Would 	it be useful for the Indian side of the Round Table Conference with 	additions to meet in India during the summer? 
 HEAD I. Under the first head His Excellency enquired what people thought of the general plan described by the Secretary of State so far as it related, in particular, to  no British delegation coming to India. His Excellency put to the Conference the
 direct question whether it was the general view that it is desirable to get out a British delegation to India. Many of the delegates answered ‘Yes’. . . .
 Mr. Gandhi expressed the view that, at this stage, nothing useful could be done by bringing out a delegation (though from what he said later, it might be inferred that he merely meant to convey that it was useless at present, i.e., until the communal position was more clear.) . . .
 His Excellency closed the discussion on this head by remarking that the problem was whether a delegation of whatever kind to India could do useful work in clearing ground so that the Round Table Conference in autumn could get to work more quickly in London.
 HEAD II. His Excellency then turned to the special enquiries recommended by  the Round Table Conference. The first of these was the Franchise Enquiry. The Government of India favoured the appointment of a Commission by the Secretary of State and thought that it might tour and be  employed, say, for six months.  But the problem which immediately arose was whether an enquiry into the franchise must not await a settlement of the communal problem. . . . Mr. Gandhi,  being asked if there were prospects of a communal settlement being reached at an early date, stated that every endeavour was being made to reach a solution from the Congress standpoint and apart from everything else that was happening here and outside. The Congress, he said, will be hard put to it to take a share in the deliberations of the Round Table Conference in India or in England unless the communal question is settled. The Congress is driven more and more to these
 conclusions. So he will leave no stone unturned to reach a settlement. They had found help in making their explorations in the assurances first given by Begum Shah Nawaz and then by Sir Muhammad Shafi and by others who are  not  here.  The main position, he said, was that the Congress will entertain no solution of the communal question which does not satisfy the parties concerned. Mr. Gandhi mentioned this point in order to show that it is the bounden duty of Congress to find a settlement. If Congress unhappily should fail in that duty, it will inform His Excellency and the country. Mr. Gandhi could not say if he had a hope of immediate solution but he found no grounds for despair as things were now proceeding. If Congress succeeded, it would make an announcement in the near future. If Congress failed, its failure would be a discredit to it, and others must take up the task. Congress will approach everyone. Difficulties are very great but not insurmountable. Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya agreed with the expression of opinion made by Mr. Gandhi. Sir Muhammad  Shafi  approved  of  the  admirable  summary  made  by  Mr.  Gandhi and had nothing to add to it. His Excellency remarked that, as one standing outside,  he could only lend all his prayers and good wishes to those slaving in the cause of peace.
 It was concluded unanimously that it is no use setting up the Franchise Commission while the communal question is still pending.
 His Excellency then propounded the question, “If this question is not settled, what would this conference advise His Majesty’s Government to do? In these circumstances, should His Majesty’s Government itself make an award?” Sir Muhammad Shafi, Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru, Sir. A. P. Patro and Sir B. N. Mitra said that  in these circumstances Government must make a decision. Mr. Gandhi, however, remarked :
If   we   have   in   our   helplessness   to   say    to    His Majesty’s
 Government that we had failed, I should not like to live to make that announcement. On the domestic solution of this problem lies the future happiness of this much distressed country. I would not like to say off-hand that His Majesty’s Government should arbitrate between us, for that is what it comes to; but as we proceed in our talks with Muslims and Sikhs we are fast approaching the conclusion that it will be an indispensable condition of any solution that there should be adult franchise. In the peculiar conditions of India adult franchise may appear a hard task, but it would be harder still not to have an adequate solution of our communal problems. Muslims and Sikhs feel the same. Muslims may not be unanimous, but there is a large body of Muslim opinion which feels that adult suffrage is the real solution.  Let no one be frightened by the strength with which I put
 this proposition. Adult suffrage will not be so unwieldy as it may appear at first sight. We must consider fully the scheme which is now being evolved. At the proper time I shall be prepared to discuss this scheme. Meanwhile I have wished to let people know in what way Congress mind is working. Adult suffrage may prove to be an indis- pensable condition of the communal solution.
 Sir Akbar Hydari pointed out that a Franchise Committee cannot get to work on the franchise and the constituencies for the Federal Legislature until we know what the strength of the two Houses will be. His Excellency remarked that this shows how closely all questions are joined up, but you must begin somewhere, either with the fowl or with the egg. People charged with particular tasks must draw alternative pictures.
 HEAD II (b). His Excellency then referred to the two enquiries in the North West Frontier Provinces which the Round Table Conference had recommended. He explained the action which the Government of India had in contemplation. The conference approved. His Excellency made a similar explanation in regard to Sind with a like result. The conference also approved of departmental examination of the classification of subjects but expressed no opinion about the enquiries regarding separate railway authority.
 Mr. Gandhi was understood to remark that the idea of separating Orissa had the support of Congress. . . .
 HEAD V. Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru asked the question “if a British delegation comes out, what then?” His Excellency expressed the opinion that the whole Conference must then meet. Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru wanted to know what Mr.
 Gandhi’s views were.
 Mr. Gandhi said that when he and his friends were considering this question they had built on three things that the Secretary of State had repeatedly said. The Secretary of State held out a prospect of a delegation to India, which Mr. Gandhi and his friends had thought was a good idea, because it afforded them an opportunity of discussing matters with the degree of freedom, which they could not take in full Conference in London. They had also welcomed the idea of a preliminary conference being held in India, and of the Round Table Conference then assembling in London, to wind up the business and to declare its considered opinion. He and his friends still adhered to that opinion. Accordingly, Mr. Gandhi was glad to hear today expre- ssions of opinion that the idea of a delegation to India which had been abandoned by His Majesty’s Government should be revived and that a delegation should come out. But the Congress did not yet fully know its own mind because of internal difficulties, such as the possibility of a failure to find a solution of the communal problem. Just  as Congress would welcome the coming of a delegation to India and might indeed
 
 consider it almost indispensable, in order that Congress might have  its  mind informed, so it was true of British Parties or so many as might elect to come to India that their minds should be informed in this way. The third consideration leading Congress to welcome, or indeed consider indispensable, the holding of a Conference in India did not overlook the disadvantages of which Mr. Gandhi was aware. Some persons thought that it was a handicap to meet and conduct negotiations in an Indian atmosphere. But Mr.  Gandhi  felt  that  distrust  still  persists.  There  is  distrust between Indians and Europeans. There is still greater distrust of the bureau- cracy, that is, of officials. He and his friends thought that impediments were being placed in the way of reaching an honourable settlement. He himself did not dread these things. He felt that if India is to take over its own Government, it will have to  deal with this very bureaucracy under altered conditions. He asked himself  the question if officials did not help, what will India have to face if it embarked on the serious responsibility of self-government. So far as Congress was concerned, it seemed desirable, and even necessary, to have a Conference in India. Such a  Conference would not act as judges or arbitrators.  If it did that, he  felt that logically   it should do so in a neutral place and deliver its verdict. He did not feel that these were precisely the conditions. By its sittings the Conference will both affect its surrounding atmosphere and be affected by it. It seemed to him to follow that the Conference must meet in India. If there are disadvantages of sitting in India, there are also disadvantages in sitting in London. The Conference would be incomplete if it did not face the full consequences and sit in India as well as in London. So far as time goes, Congress was impatient to reach a decision. He felt three things. First, the earlier the British delegation comes out the better; second, the earlier the Round Table Conference meets the better; third, the earlier the Round Table Conference winds up its proceedings in London the better. Referring to the various Sub-Committees which had been mentioned, Mr. Gandhi expressed himself as ignorant of their probable internal working and proceedings. But he felt that it will be necessary that all should hear the Congress view before the Committees proceed to their discussions. If these committees went on with their work now, it would be a handicap to Congress. The tentative conclusions reached in London were conclusions to which the Congress cannot at present subscribe. Congress must submit its considered view on  the problems on which provisional views had been reached there. Mr. Gandhi, therefore, urged that no further steps should be taken before the Congress was fully heard. The Maharaja of Alwar asked whether Mr. Gandhi would be satisfied with a weak British delegation, Mr. Gandhi said ‘Yes’. He could well understand the inability of His Majesty’s Government to send the very best representatives to a Conference in India. He said he did not mind that. He felt that we should break the ground and arrive at some unanimous conclusions. We need not be always thinking of producing an effect on first-class politicians in England. That is desirable, but we are equally concerned
 in converting ourselves to unanimous conclusions and in concentrating upon ourselves. There are officials and communal communities here. They will remain here. They will not be transported to  London.  So, all things considered, it appeared  to him to be necessary that a Conference should be held in India. Indians themselves have to come together and they could not come together under better auspices than those of Congress. Indians should find themselves and find where they are before going to London. Addressing Their Highnesses, he said that, if to his horror he found that they were divided among themselves, he would say let us not go to London. But if they agreed and were of one mind, he would proceed to London in the greatest hope and confidence and absolutely certain of making their own position felt and appreciated by Englishmen. Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya endorsed all that Mr. Gandhi had said. He said that England had never been faced with a greater problem and that it was necessary that the work already undertaken should be carried on with the least delay possible. English statesmen owed it to India that they should find or make time to come out to India. All parties should be represented. Let English statesmen so arrange their work in England that the best men could come to India. His Excellency should, he thought, make an appeal to English statesmen to that effect. The ultimate work of the Round Table Conference would, he thought, become easier if discussions first took place with the British delegation in India. An Indian delegation to London would be necessary only to give the thing its final shape. . . .
 His Excellency referred to two arguments—one used by Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya and one by Mr. Gandhi. As regards the former, he pointed out that the formulation of the united wish of India and its presentation to His Majesty’s Govern- ment did not necessitate the presence of British delegation in India and that such an idea was inconsistent with the general Conference idea of reaching agree- ments through discussion between British and Indian representatives. Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya explained that that had not been the intention of his remarks. As regards the point taken by Mr. Gandhi that until Congress had been fully heard no further steps should be taken, His Excellency enquired whether that referred to those special and expert investigations recommended by the Round Table Conference of which His Excellency had given a detailed account earlier. Mr. Gandhi explained that he did not object to these separate enquiries being carried on at once, but his objection was to the Federal Structure Committee meeting and continuing its explorations, until Congress had explored and declared its mind upon the general recommendations already made.
 His Excellency thanked the gentlemen present for  coming  to  the  con- ference and for expressing their views. In the light of the statement recently made by the Secretary of State on behalf of His Majesty’s Government, he himself at this stage expressed no opinion about the coming of a British delegation from England,  or on the situation which might arise if that did or did not happen. There might
 
 indeed be insurmountable difficulties in the way of such a procedure. But His Excellency hoped that if the best could not be attained, everyone would feel that we must be content with the next best method if we really meant to proceed by way of searching for agreement.

 A  TERRIBLE ACCIDENT
Shri Chhaganlal Joshi writes :libtech_271_footnote
 Such accidents awaken us for a moment and later we fall into stupor again. As nature alone is responsible for this accident, we do not even get the satisfaction of blaming anyone for it.
 In the event of such accidents, whom should we condole with? It is not one family alone but the entire nation that has been bereaved.
 Such accidents will continue to occur. In a great struggle they are like drops in the ocean. Both the migrants and the neighbours seem to have made good use of this accident. The neighbours have rendered all possible help, the migrants have not given way to the least despair. In this manner, they have transformed a calamity into an occasion for purification and given us a reminder that death should be neither feared nor grieved over.
 The Sardar and I salute the migrants and their neighbours.  “What God, World Teacher and Master has willed for the day, it
 is futile to grieve over.”

  	sentence in his review especially in order to draw  my  attention  	to  it. In the so-called national schools there, untouchables do not 	yet find a place.

It   may be said that the higher classes in the suburbs,  	after  having  done  much, have washed it all off. Despite their 	contributing funds, going     
 to prison and running other risks, if they do not wash off the dirt in the form of untouchability, all else that they have accom-plished may perhaps become barren. Under swaraj, public tem-ples, public schools and public wells will be used equally by Brahmins and Bhangis. If this does not happen, it cannot be regarded as swaraj. Rather than win swaraj in name only, let us not get swaraj so long as untouchability persists. The victory of one who fights battle in the way of satyagraha consists in fighting itself, so that such a person will never compromise the rights of the untouchable in his impatience to grasp the fruit of swaraj.

 Where Gandhi is the guide, and Vallabhbhai the fighter there will always be victory, wisdom and prosperity.libtech_274_footnote
 For the Sardar and me, this couplet is not something by way of praise, but is a form of blessing. We are setting out at a difficult time. May these blessings bear fruit at such a time. They have been given by the aged Shri Narsinhraobhai. The programme at Vile Parle had commenced with these symbolic blessings. I pointed out to Narsinh - raobhai that there was something comic too in it. He rejected this and said that the poem was the sincere outpouring of his heart, that there was no room in it for humour. God alone knows what we are. But in this country we should certainly wish for victory and prosperity, through whatever instrument it may come.

 "
335,,OF PRINCES AND PAUPERS,"
    
 The following questionlibtech_275_footnotewas asked at the meeting of the Con- gress workers which took place in Vile Parle.
 I have slightly enlarged the question, but I have not altered its sense. It is a good question and must occur to many minds. Let us consider it now.
If there was anything like Ramarajya in the world once, it
 
 well as of the have-nots which in itself sounds contradictory. Their conflict is eternal. This may be the order of nature which you are seemingly opposing in vain.”
 should be established again. I believe  that  Ramarajya  did  exist.  Rama means the Panch; the Panch implies God, implies public opinion. When public opinion is not artificially created, it is pure. A government founded on public opinion is Ramarajya for that parti- cular place. We find such a government in some places even today. Nowadays some landlords are competing with their tenants in the matter of simpli-city, and are trying to become one with them. It is not as if all rulers are robbers. In my tours I have come across good ones as well as wicked ones. All owners are not heartless. It is true that I have not come across many instances of the wealthy acting as friends and protectors of the poor. It is also true that even in the instances that I have noticed, there is room for improvement. I have had these experiences under a government which I regard as demo- niac. But is it surprising that even in Lanka there was an exception in the person of Vibhishana? Where there is one such person, we can certainly hope for many more. When an exception is multiplied, it becomes the general rule. I have spoken here of what is possible, but the person who has posed the question would not be satisfied with this.
 Satyagraha is an attempt to make the possible real. Truth implies justice. A just administration implies an era of truth or swaraj, dharmaraj, Ramarajya or the people’s raj (democracy). Under such a government the ruler would be the protector and friend  of  his subjects. Between his way of life and that of the poorest of his subjects, there would not be such a gulf as there is today. There would be an appropriate similarity between the King’s palace and the hut of his subject. The difference between the needs of the two would be slight. Both would enjoy pure air and water. The subjects would get sufficient food. The ruler would give up eating fifty-six different kinds of delicacies and be satisfied with only six. If the poor use utensils made of wood or mud, the ruler may well use utensils made of such metals as brass. For the ruler who wants to use utensils of gold or silver must be robbing his subjects. The poor should be able to obtain sufficient clothing. Let the king have more clothes, but let not the difference be such as to cause envy. The children of both should be studying in the same primary school. The ruler should become a senior member of the family of the poor. If he does anything for the good of the poor, he should not regard it as a favour that he has conferred upon them. Benevolence has no place in dharma. It is the dharma of the ruler to serve the subjects. What has been said in regard to the ruler applies to all wealthy persons; likewise, it is the dharma of
 the poor not to bear malice towards the rich. That their poverty is largely due to their own fault, their own failings, is something that the poor should realize. Even while making an effort to improve their lot, the poor should bear no ill will towards the king, should not wish his ruin, but rather hope for his improvement. The poor should not cherish the desire to replace the monarch; but should be content with fulfilling their own needs. In the swaraj which I visualize, the two would help each other in this manner.
 In my opinion, in order to win this swaraj, important changes have to be made in the education of both the ruler and the subjects. Both the robber and those who are being robbed are groping in dark- ness. They have lost their way. Neither should tolerate this situation. But this is some-thing of which the ruling class or the wealty class will not be easily con-vinced. I have chosen to serve the poor on the principle that if one party is convinced, the other will automatically be convinced. Everyone can- not become a ruler, but everyone can be subsumed under the heading “all”. And, swaraj would be here today if the poor become aware of their rights and at the same time of their duties. This awareness can be brought about by no other means as quickly as through satyagraha. We have had actual experience of this during the past twelve months. Our attainment of swaraj has been obstructed to the extent that corruption has crept into our satyagraha.
 Satyagraha is the most important tool for the people’s education and awakening. Self-purification is another name for satyagraha. To the ruling class one may only speak of self-purification; it takes time for any impression to be made on it. The poorer classes constantly look for some comfort, they are already aware of their sufferings, but not of the remedy. Hence they try out remedies when someone suggests these to them. In such circumstances, if they can get a devoted worker, they cling to him and accept his remedies to the best of their abilities. Hence, from a particular standpoint this class may be regarded as being eager to learn. Swaraj can also be secured through it. It should become aware of its strength and yet make only a limited use of it. When this happens, the swaraj which I visualize may be regarded as having dawned. Having attained such strength, the people can successfully withstand any force—whether foreign or native— which stands in their way.
 Hence the only dharma of workers is to serve the people. Public service can be rendered only through the path of truth and non- violence. The progress of the nation will be hindered to the extent to
 which corruption creeps in.
 Meanwhile, if the ruling class and the rich recognize  the demands of the age, they would cease to become  owners  of the  wealth they own and their  capacity  to  earn  it  and  rather  become  its trustees and establish the right of the trustee to  earn  his  living too. If they do not do so, ultimately a bitter struggle between the ruler and the subjects, between the rich and the poor is bound to ensue. In the hope that the force of satyagraha will check the poison, persons like me have sacrificed their all for that instrument.

336,,A DICTIONARY,"
    
 Readers must be aware that the second edition of the dictionary published by the Vidyapith has come out. The novel feature of this new edition is that an attempt has been made in it to give in brief current meanings also. In order to compile a scientific and compre- hensive dictionary, a Herculean effort and many lovers of the langu- age are needed. This attempt of the Vidyapith is a preliminary step towards such a comprehensive dictionary. The price, which is Rs. 4, has been kept at the lowest. Copies can be had from the Principal of the Vidyapith by sending him a money order.
 That errata had to be included in the dictionary is one of its drawbacks. But such shortcomings are inevitable at the present mo- ment in our country. We are a poor nation, there is little love of language, compositors are only half-educated—errors persist because of many such reasons. I would suggest to those who use the dictionary to correct the errors before using it.
 Despite its errors, I regard the dictionary as very useful. Those who love the language must write it with correct spellings. Not to do so is to show disrespect towards the language and it is also a sign of indolence. Where there is love, there is no room for indolence. However, despite this, if the tool is not there, how can even an enthu- siast write correct spellings? Moreover, somewhat chaotic situation has prevailed in Gujarat, regarding spellings. The Vidyapith has ended such anarchy and, after having received the concurrence of as many learned men as possible, has adopted a uniform style of spelling. It is increasingly gaining acceptance day by day. I hope that libraries and
 such other institutions as also those States which accept the spellings of the Vidyapith will carry on propaganda for the dictionary. A copy of the dictionary should be found on the desk of every clerk and in every office.

337,"March 23, 1931",INTERVIEW TO “CHICAGO TRIBUNE”,"
         DELHI, 
  [Before March 23, 1931]libtech_276_footnote  The 	Mahatma is pledged not to say anything publicly which might 	prejudice the present negotiation, but he consented to discuss 	general questions. My 	method is love and truth, and no force can avail against them. 	Ask me any question you like. I will answer if I can.  Q.	Have you still faith in the British and in British promises?  A. I had faith in them 	until 1919.  But the Amritsar massacre  and other Punjab atrocities 	changed my heart, and nothing has happened since to make me regain 	my faith. Certainly, not in the past ten months. But my faith in my 	own people has increased, especially in the past ten months. 	Consider the part played by women and children in the present 	movement. The world has never seen such a magnificent spectacle 	before, especially the awakening amongst chil- dren.  Q.	How 	do you account for the children?  	It can only be the work of God. Certainly, God is with us in this 	struggle.  He 	spun away and talked on. He still stands, he said, for his eleven 	points which last year formed the minimum national demand, upon the 	granting of which by the Viceroy he offered to refrain from 	launching civil disobedience. They included the total prohibition of 	alcoholic drinks, the abolition of the salt tax, the reduction of 	land revenue and military expenditure by 50 per cent., the discharge 	of political prisoners and a prohibitive tariff on foreign cloth. I 	 still  stand  by  them   as   the   vital  needs   of   India,   	and any  	constitution will be judged by its capacity to satisfy these 	demands. The situation, however, is changed and the method whereby I 	hope to    
 attain them is accordingly subject to change.
 Q.	If you obtain swaraj would you consider your  labours  finished  and retire, or would you take an active part in the reconstruction of India by the Indians?
I should like to take an active part in the reconstruction of my
 country provided I retain my health and vigour and my people’s confidence in me and my methods. That, indeed, would be a labour of love.
 Do you think most of India’s ills will be solved with the coming of self- government?
Naturally not without trouble and difficulty. I have ever been
optimistic.
 Q. But the great social and economic questions, such as the relations of capital and labour, landlord and tenant, your own special communal problems and those of the depressed classes—do you think mere self-government will solve those so easily?
Yes, all those problems will be fairly easy to settle when we are
 our own masters. I know there are difficulties, but I have faith in our ultimate capacity to solve them, not by following  your  Western models, but by evolving along lines of non-violence and truth, where- on our movement is based and which must constitute the bedrock of our future constitution.
 Q.	How could a capitalist under those conditions stand for inequalities and injustices?
No, I think these problems will be solved quickly and success-
 fully.    Q. And your languages? What about English under the nationalist government? English 	would still be retained as a cultural language.  It would 
  	be as useful to us as French to Europe. Hindustani would become the 	national language used in courts and universities. Native 	vernaculars, many of which possess rich literatures, and are spoken 	by 2,00,00,000 to 4,00,00,000 are to be encouraged.  	It is not true that I would abolish schools. I am as anxious as any 	to maintain our great culture by education. But in our schools today 	we learn only what our foreign masters want us to learn. We do not 	get the training we most need.  Twenty-three 	years ago Gandhiji wrote a book, Indian 	Home Rule, which 	stunned India and the rest of the world with its terrible on slaught 	on modern Western civilization. “It is Satanic, and the Hindus 	call it the dark age,” he wrote, and 
 envisaged the ideal State with no factories, railways, armies or navies and as few hospitals, doctors, and lawyers as are possible.
 Q.	Have you changed your mind about these things?
 Not a bit. My ideas about the evils of Western civilization still stand. If I republish the book tomorrow, I would scarcely change a word, except perhaps a few changes in the setting.

338,"March 	23, 1931",LETTER TO VICEROY,"
           DEAR 	FRIEND,       1  DARYAGANJ, 	 DELHI,  March 	23, 1931 
  	It seems cruel to inflict this letter on you, but the interest of 	peace demands a final appeal. Though you were frank enough to tell 	me that there was little hope of your commuting the sentence of 	death on Bhagat Singh and two others, you said you would consider my 	submission of Saturday. Dr. Sapru met me yesterday and said that you 	were troubled over the matter and taxing your brain as to the proper 	course to adopt. If there is any room left for reconsideration, I 	invite you attention to the following. Popular 	opinion rightly or wrongly demands commutation. When 	there is no principle at stake, it is often a duty to respect it.  	In the present case the chances are that, if commutation is gran- 	ted, internal peace is most likely to be promoted. In the event of 	execution, peace is undoubtedly in danger.  	Seeing that I am able to inform you that the revolutionary party has 	assured me that, in the event of these lives being spared, that 	party will stay its hands, suspension of sentence pending cessation 	of revo- lutionary murders becomes in my opinion a peremptory duty.  	Political murders have been condoned before now. It is worth while 	saving these lives, if thereby many other innocent lives are likely 	to be saved and maybe even revolutionary crime almost stamped out.  	Since you seem to value my influence such as it is in favour of 	peace, do not please unnecessarily make my position, difficult as it 	is, almost too difficult for future work.  	Execution is an irretrievable act. If you think there is the sligh- 	test chance of error of judgment, I would urge you to suspend for 
 further review an act that is beyond recall.
 If my presence is necessary, I can come. Though I may not speaklibtech_277_footnoteI may hear and write what I want to say.

 example. We should not utilize our energy, our spirit of sacrifice, our labours and our indomitable courage in the way they have utilized theirs. This country must not be liberated through bloodshed.
 About the Government I cannot help feeling that it has missed a golden opportunity, to win over the rebels to its side. At least from the point of view of the settlement, it was its duty to postpone inde- finitely the carrying out of the death sentence. The Government has by its own act dealt a severe blow to the settlement and has shown its capacity to disregard public opinion once again and to exhibit the great brute strength it possesses.
 The reliance on violence is perhaps ominous and it suggests that in spite of high-sounding and pious proclamations, it does not want to part with power. But the people’s duty is clear.
 The Congress must not swerve from the path it has chalked out for itself. According to my view, notwithstanding the gravest provo- cation the Congress should endorse the settlement and test its capacity to secure the result hoped for.
 We must not put ourselves in the wrong by getting angry. We must realize that commutation of the sentences was not a part of the truce. We may accuse the Government of violence but we cannot accuse it of breach of the settlement. It is my conviction that the grave blunder committed by the Government has increased our power to win freedom and Bhagat Singh and his comrades have embraced  death therefor. Let us not throw away this opportunity by doing any- thing in anger. It is beyond dispute that there will be a general strike and we cannot honour the deceased patriots better than by taking out absolutely peaceful and dignified processions.

 Mahatma Gandhi has given an important interview to the  special correspondent of the Manchester Guardian in India. According to the special correspondent Mahatma Gandhi declared in the interview that he was certain in mind that the Congress attendance at the Round Table Conference would serve no useful purpose unless the question of safeguards was re-opened on the basis of providing India with an efficient and stable form of self-government. Mahatma Gandhi says :
 
 I have been very much disturbed by the tone of Mr. Benn’s statement with reference to safeguards. I must emphasize that the Round Table Conference cannot succeed if it is prejudiced by declarations which imply that certain demands made by Britain are final.
 Referring to the debated question of equality of trade rights to Britishers in India, Mahatma Gandhi said :
 The rights of the existing business interests must be a matter for negotiations in which India does not desire to act unfairly or ungener- ously. India must retain freedom the future economic development of her resources along lines which commend themselves to Indians.
 Discussing the question of Federation, Mahatma Gandhi declared that the princes must give their subjects a certain minimum of rights as it is impossible to combine complete autocracy and democracy.

 CHI. MAHALAKSHMI,
 I had got your letter, but I could not reply to it earlier. You have given a good description of the work being done by you both sisters. What did you have in mind when saying that the atmos-phere had become impure? I have been hearing many stories. That is why I ask you so that I may have more information. Visiting a drink addict daily and talking to him about the same thing over and over again does not help. Remember what I said in my speech at Maroli. You should take personal interest in the life of an addict and persuade him to take up some work. If he does not wish to spin, he may do some other work. You should encourage him to talk about his joys and sorrows and listen to him with sympathy. You should meet his wife and children, take the latter in hand and make them look more pleasant. If you serve him in this manner, he will probably give up drinking. Also you should not say that, if one of you gave all her time to one person, we cannot influence all the hundreds of thousands like him in the country in that manner. This is the only way to influence such a large number. If one person sincerely reforms him- self, many others follow his example. By serving one person selflessly, we serve all.
 I understand what you say about the children.
 I don’t think Madhavji has committed any error. He has not informed me again about the court case against him.

344,,QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS,"
    
 WHAT SHOULD THEY DO?
 “What are those scholars who left their schools during the struggle to do now?” was one of the questions asked at the workers’ meeting in Bombay, but which for want of time I was unable to answer.
My answer now is :
  The 	struggle is 	not yet over, 	it has 	assumed a 	different, i.e., 	constructive form.  Scholars 	can penetrate 	the homes 	and the hearts of 	the drunkard, 	the opium-eater 	and the user of 	foreign cloth.  Scholars 	can assist those 	sisters who are engaged 	 in peaceful picketing.  Scholars 	can settle down in 	villages and there 	 organize khadi work. Scholars 	can hawk 	khadi in city.  All 	scholars should 	work at the 	wheel or 	the takli 	at least 	for half an 	hour daily.  For 	further reference they 	should write 	to the 	registrars of 	the national universities. 
 FOREIGN-CLOTH DEALERS
 Another question asked was, now that picketing has become mild, new orders for foreign cloth are being given and the sales of existing stock are also brisk. What are you going to do to prevent this?
 This questionpresupposes that picketing has hitherto amounted to coercion. If such was the case, it is better that freedom of action is restored than that any single person is coerced into acting against his will. My conviction is that if the workers will carryon sustained propaganda, the buying public will be converted.We have  concentrated too much upon the dealers and too little on the buyers. Sustained public education in this matter is what  is  wanted. Conversion is our motto, not coercion.
 Coercion is an offspring of violence. Conversion is a fruit of non-violence and love.
 CAN YOU AVOID CLASS WAR?
 The third question, I find, is, if you will benefit the workers, the peasant and the factory hand, can you avoid class war?
 I can, most decidedly, if only the people will follow the non- violent method. The past twelve months have abundantly shown the possibilities of non-violence adopted even as a policy. When the people adopt it as a principle of conduct, class war becomes an impossibility. The experiment in that direction is being tried in Ahmedabad. It has yielded most satisfactory results and there is every likelihood of its proving conclusive. By the non-violent method we seek not to destroy the capitalist, we seek to destroy capitalism. We invite the capitalist to regard himself as trustee for those on whom he depends for the making, the retention and the increase of his capital. Nor need the worker wait for his conversion. If capital is power, so is work. Either power can be used destructively or creatively. Either is dependent on the other. Immediately the worker realizes his strength, he is in a position to become a co-sharer with the capitalist instead of remaining his slave. If he aims at becoming the sole owner, he will most likely be killing the hen that lays golden eggs. Inequalities in intelligence and even opportunity will last till the end of time. A man living on the banks of a river has any day more opportunity of growing crops than one living in an arid desert. But if inequalities stare us in the face the essential equality too is not to be missed. Every man has an equal right to the necessaries of life even as birds and beasts have. And since very right carries with it a corresponding duty and the corresponding remedy for resisting any attack upon it, it is merely a matter of finding out the corresponding duties and remedies to vindicate the elementary fundamental equality. The corresponding duty is to labour with my limbs and the corresponding remedy is to non-co-operate with him who deprives me of the fruit of my labour. And if I would recognize the fundamental equality, as I must, of the capitalist and the labourer, I must not aim at his destruction. I must strive for his conver-sion. My non-co-operation with him will open his eyes to the wrong he may be doing.  Nor need  I be afraid of someone else taking my place when I have non-co- operated. For I expect to influence my co-workers so as not to help the wrongdoing of employer. This kind of education of the mass of workers is no doubt a slow process, but as it is also the surest, it is
 necessarily the quickest. It can be easily demonstrated that destruction of the capitalist must mean destruction in the end of the worker and as no human being is so bad as to be beyond redemption, no human being is so perfect as to warrant his destroying him whom he wrongly considers to be wholly evil.
 WHAT  OF  THE UNEMPLOYED
 The fourth question was, what of the civil-resistance prisoners who are discharged and are out of employment?
 If they are willing to work and are honest they can, I doubt not, be employed in some Congress organization. Nor need everyone look to the Congress and the allied organizations to give them employment. A labourer is worthy of his hire. And those who are honest and do not mind labouring, no matter what they were previous to imprisonment, can always rely upon being suited.
 SACRIFICING COUNTRY FOR TRUTH
Here is the fifth question :
 How can you explain away your inconsistency involved in your making fond and easy advances to the R.T.C. after the Congress deciding not to participate in it, and Jawaharlal ironically calling them only a few months ago ‘old women’?
 Are you always going to sacrifice your country for Truth and treat us like test-tubes in your experiment of non-violence and Truth? Do you realize that you are staking the whole nation for your individual self-evolution?
 Many of us feel that you have become a National Habit which is useful for the capitalist but tragic for the exploited.
 Manners change with the times. Foolish consistency is the hob goblin of little minds.” If I am inconsistent I am wisely so. But I see no inconsistency between my present conduct and the past. There never was any question of permanent boycott of the Round Table Conference. The Congress refused when it could not go there on its terms, it may go now because in its opinion the way is open. And I hope that those who go will deliver the nation’s message in no uncertain tones. Here there is no question of my ‘sacrificing the country for Truth’. In the first place the decision is that of the Working Committee and in the second place there is no sacrifice of the country. But writing parentheti-cally I have  no  hesitation  in  saying that I should, if there could be such a choice, most decidedly sacrifice the country for Truth which t  o  me is  God. I  further hold that no individual or nation has ever gained by the sacrifice of Truth, there therefore, no such thing as sacrifice of country for Truth.
 Those who join me in my experiments in Truth-seeking are not my ‘test-tubes’, they are my valued fellow-workers, sharing with me the joy that the search for Truth brings as no other search does.
 I do not realize that I am ‘staking a whole nation for self-evo- lution’.For self-evolution is wholly consistent witha  nation’s evolution. A nation cannot advance without the units of which it is composed advancing and, conversely, no individual can advance without the nation of which he is a part also advancing.
 The last charge is thoughtlessly made. My experiments began in South Africa and they were made on behalf of the exploited. The latter gained. They gained again in Champaran, Kheda and Ahmedabad. If I may share the merit of the first Borsad campaign, brilliantly fought by Sardar Vallabhbhai during my absence but in strict accord with my prescription, and then again in Bardoli, I may say that the peasants had the benefit of the two fights. What may be the last experiment on a nation-wide scale is still being tried. It is yet too soon to forecast the result. But he who runs may see that the phenomenal mass awakening cannot have taken place without the masses having added considerably to their stature. This recital has not been made here to claim credit for myself. I am but an humble instrument in the hands of God. Credit belongs to Truth and non- violence. The writer’s question seems to doubt the efficacy of Truth and more perhaps of non-violence. The series of examples I have given ought to set at rest all doubt. If we were offering civil disobedience, it was for gaining purna swaraj and if now we have suspended it and are ready to join the Round Table Conference, other conditions being fulfilled, we shall be going to it also for the same noble end. That we may fail to achieve the end is quite possible. Even so we shall be putting ourselves in the wrong if we rejected the advance made by the Government. If we make the right use of suspension, if we carry out the terms of the settlement to the fullest extent possible, if we complete the two boycotts, if we intensify the khadi spirit, at the end of the period of grace we shall find ourselves stronger for battle, if we have not by then already gained our end. We must work away with faith in the settlement leading us to our goal.

345,,THE GIANT AND THE DWARF,"
    
 The reader’s attention is invited to Sjt. Walchand Hirachand’s letter published elsewhere. It has undergone some corrections in order
 to represent my viewslibtech_282_footnotecorrectly. The discussion to which the letter refers arose out of the formula that “there  should  be  no discrimination between the rights of the British mercantile community, firms and companies trading in India and the rights of Indian born subjects.” The formula reads innocent enough but it covers the most dangerous position.
 The situation today is this. The Britisher is the top-dog and the Indian the under-dog in his own country. In the administration of the country, the Indian generally is a mere clerk.  In business he is at best  a commission agent getting hardly five per cent against his English principal’s 95 per cent. In almost every walk of life the Englishman by reason of his belonging to the ruling class occupies a privileged position. It can be said without fear of contradiction and without any exaggeration that he has risen upon the ruin of India’s commerce and industries. The cottage industry of India had to perish in order that Lancashire might flourish. The Indian shipping had to perish so that British shipping might flourish. In a word we were suppressed in order to enable the British to live on the heights of Simla. It was not a mere picturesque expression of Gokhale’s when he said that our growth was stunted. To talk then of no discrimination between Indian interests and English or European is to perpetuate Indian helotage. What is equality of rights between a giant and a dwarf? Before one can think of equality between unequals, the dwarf must be raised to the height of the giant. And since millions living on the plains cannot be translated to the heights of Simla, it follows that those entrenched in those heights must descend to the plains. The process may seem harsh but it is inevitable if the millions of the plains are to be equals of the privileged few.
 It is to be feared therefore that before we reach the state of equality, the levelling process will have to be gone through. Justice demands this. It will be a misnomer to call the process one of racial discrimination. There is no such question. There is room enough in our country for every British man, woman and child, if they will shed their privileged position and share our lot. They must then exchange the British army and the force of the cities for the goodwill of a whole nation, which is at their disposal for the asking. Our goodwill is the truest safeguard that we can offer to them and I make bold to say that will be infinitely better and more dignified both of us.In the process there will be apparent  discrimination  felt everywhere.  It need not  be felt by those who realize that the present is a wrong and unnatural
 
 position. To show that no racial discrimination is involved in this demand one has only to state that Indians who occupy entrenched positions behind their British patrons will also be expected to come to the level of their brethren of the plains. The true formula therefore should be this. In order to remove the existing unnatural inequalities the privileges of the ruling class and those others who have shared them shall be reduced so as to reach a state of equality between all classes and communities.
 On the Indian side it must be a point of honour with us to hold British lives and honour as sacred as our own. This does not, need not, mean the ruin of British trade or interest. Those who are resident can rely on their disciplined habits, trained intellect, great industry and powers of organization to carve out for themselves careers of distinction all the while serving the country of their adoption with the loyalty they have tendered to their own motherland.
 British trade where it is not hurtful to India’s interest can be placed, when we reach a state of honourable association, on a favoured basis. And an India free from exploitation from within and without must prosper with astonishing rapidity. With growing prosperity, her wants must grow. With her growing wants, must grow  also  her imports. If at that time Britain is a partner or ally, she may well become India’s chief supplier.
 That is a dream I should love to realize. I have been party to the settlement for the realization of that dream. I seek every Englishman’s help to enable India to gain that end. My notion of purna swaraj is not isolated independence but healthy and dignified independence. My nationa-lism, fierce though it is, is not exclusive, is not devised to harm any nation or individual. Legal maxims are not so legal as they are moral. I believe in the eternal truth of sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedaslibtech_283_footnote.

 KARACHI,
 March 26, 1931 I failed in my efforts to bring about the commutation of the death sentences on Bhagat Singh and his friends, and that is why the
 young men vented their wrath against me.libtech_285_footnotelibtech_286_footnoteI was quite prepared for it. Although they were incensed against me, they gave vent to their wrath in what I would call a most dignified manner. It was open to them to do physical injury but they refrained from doing so. It was open to them to insult me in many other ways, but they confined their resentment and insult to handing me black cloth flowers representing, I imagine, the ashes of the three patriots. These also they could have showered on me or thrown at me instead of which they gave me the option of receiving the flowers from their hands which I  did gratefully. Of course, they shouted, “Down with Gandhism”, “Go back Gandhi”. This I consider to be a legitimate expression of their anger. Having been used to such an exhibition and that in a much worse and in more serious form, I was unruffled and took these insults as only a mild expression of their deep grief and consequent anger. I am only hoping that they will exercise the restraint that they did yesterday throughout the Congress session for they know I am trying to reach the same goal with them. Only I am following a method wholly different from theirs. I have not a shadow of a doubt that as time goes they will discover the error of their ways. Whatever may be true of other countries, in this country which is teeming with famished millions the cult of violence can have no meaning. In this country of self-suppression and timidity almost bordering on cowardice we  cannot have too much bravery, too much self-sacrifice. One’s head bends before Bhagat Singh’s bravery and sacrifice. But I want the greater bravery, if I might say so without offending my young friends, of the meek, the gentle and the non-violent, the bravery that  will mount the gallows without injuring, or harbouring any thought of injury to a single soul.
 Does the execution of Bhagat Singh and his friends alter your position in any way with regard to the settlement?
 
 My own personal position remains absolutely the same, though the provocation has been of the most intense  character. I  must  confess that the staying of these executions was no part of the truce, and so far as I am concerned, no provocation offered outside the terms will deflect me from the path I had mapped out when I agreed to the settlement.
 Do you not think it impolitic to forgive a government which has been guilty of a thousand murders?
I do not know a single instance where forgiveness has been
found so wanting as to be impolitic.
 But no country has ever shown such forgiveness as India is showing to Britain?
That does not affect my reply. What is true of individuals is true
 of  nations.   One cannot forgive too  much.	The weak can never forgive. Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong.

 Gandhiji who was at the Working Committee meeting was informed of the state of affairs in Cawnpore by the representative of the Associated Press and he made the following statement :
The Working Committee which is sitting at the time of giving
 this message having read the report of the awful communal strife going on in Cawnpore has felt troubled and grieved over the events there. I cannot too strongly condemn this strife. A committee will certainly investigate the causes, but indications have been coming in from other sources also to show that the slightest thing disturbs the mental balance. I can only hope that the poison will not be allowed to stay and that people will remain calm and not allow the harmonious relations to be disturbed. I hope also that the local leaders in Cawnpore will put their heads together and quickly restore peace. Let it be remembered by those who are in a hurry to achieve India’s freedom that every such strife makes progress towards the goal more and more difficult.

348,"March 26, 1931","REPLY TO INDIAN MERCHANTS’ ASSOCIATIONS, KARACHI","
    
 March 26, 1931 A deputation of Indian merchants of Karachi representing Buyers’ and Shippers’ Chambers and Indian Merchants’ Association led by Mr. Jamshed Mehta
 waited on the Congress Working Committee this morning, in connection with the
 demand of British commercial interests for equality of trading rights with Indians. . . .
 Gandhiji who replied on behalf of the Working Committee stated that the Congress needed no urging in that connection and would take all possible steps to get the clause about the equality of trading rights totally rescinded. The Congress, he added, felt even more strongly on the question than the merchants themselves and would certainly go further than the demand put forward by the deputationists in safeguarding Indian interests.
 Gandhiji compared the demand for equality of the powerful British commercial community with Indians, as a demand on behalf of an elephant to be on equal plane with an ant. Gandhiji said he had dealt with the question in  Young  India  in  connection with a letter addressed by Mr. Walchand Hirachand regarding the interview   a Bombay merchant had with him. Gandhiji said it however was not possible nor politic to exaggerate the power of Congress as was seen in the case of Bhagat Singh and his comrades whose execution the Congress has been helpless to prevent, despite their best efforts.
 But on behalf of the Congress he wanted to assure the deputationists that whether it was Dominion Status, or anything else, any constitution which impaired in any way the right of the future Indian Parliament to discriminate against non- national, whenever necessary, as in the national, interest, was worthless and would not be acceptable to the Congress. Gandhiji added that the assurance was a pledge. On his part he urged the Indian mercantile community to play a greater part in national struggle than what they had hitherto done and suggested them to treat the poorer sections of the people, including labourers and untouchables, as their own kith and kin.

		 CONGRESSlibtech_287_footnote","
    
 March 26, 1931
 The first speech in the Congress pandal, or the inauguration address if I may so call it, was delivered by Gandhiji on the 26th, when a vast audience listened to him
 
 spellbound. The canopy of heaven, under which the Congress is meeting for the first time in its history, lent not only special charm and colour to the address, but also a rare inspiration, to which the great silence around him also contributed. This is how  he began :
We are accustomed to think of heaven as the Kingdom of God.
 We imagine that He sends us His messages and commands from above and we thus establish communion with Him. Until now we had a screen between God and us. I am thankful that the Reception Committee has rent it asunder and put us into direct communion with God. Let us not now by allowing impurities to creep in create a fresh screen and let us commence our business with this communion as our valuable asset. We have chosen for our march towards freedom the ancient path of truth and non-violence, and we must let God’s covenant that those who tread on the strait and narrow path shall never come to grief inspire us with faith and hope.
 By the executions the Government have given the nation grave cause for provocation. It has shocked me too inasmuch as my negotiations and talks had made me entertain a distant hope  that Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev might be saved. I am  not surprised that young men are angry with me for not having been able to save them. But I have no reason to be angry with them. For one thing, this is not the first occasion of its kind in my life. It is the duty  of him who claims to serve humanity not to be angry with those whom he is serving. As for myself non-violence being my creed, I cannot afford to be angry with anybody. But even if it is not his creed, it is the duty of a genuine servant not to be angry with his masters. Anger ought to be taboo with him. But if he cannot help being angry, he must abdicate his function as servant of humanity. I for one do not want to do so and therefore I said they had a right to be angry, not I. But I must tell them I had been serving the peasants and workers long before the young men were born. I have lived amongst them, cast my lot with them. Ever since I took the pledge of  service,  I  have dedicated my head to humanity. It is the easiest thing in the world to chop off my head, it does not take the slightest preparation or organization. And outside protection I have never sought. In fact it is futile to think of protecting me for I know that God Almighty is the only Protector. Having said this, let me declare that the demonstrationslibtech_288_footnotelibtech_289_footnoteof  the  young  menyesterday  far  from  making  me angry delighted me, inasmuch as there was no discourtesy about them.
 
 They might have laid hands on me; instead, they formed  my bodyguard and escorted me to my car. I must confess that when I saw them, I felt that my experiences in South Africa, where I was mobbed and assaulted, were going to be repeated.
 But there was no cause for apprehension. The young men were simply shouting, “Gandhi go back”, “Down with Gandhism”. They had a right to do so inasmuch as they thought that I had not done everything in my power to save Bhagat Singh, or that being a believer in ahimsa, I had simply neglected Bhagat Singh and his comrades. But they had no intention to molest me or for the matter of that anyone else. They allowed everyone to pass, and then a young man handed to me flowers made of black cloth. They might have thrown them on me and insulted me, but they had no such intention. Flowers are given me everywhere, I am usually indifferent about them, even when they are received from dear sisters and sometimes even chide them for wasting the flowers on me. But these I seized and have treasured them. I shall also tell you what I want to do with them. If the young men come and tell me that they should not have been angry and that their suspicions about me were groundless and that therefore they want the flowers returned to them, I shall gladly give them back. But if they do not do so, they will be sent to the Ashram to be preserved as heirlooms.
 Those young men wanted to proclaim to the world that how- ever great the Mahatma may be, they were sure that he was doing harm to India.  I think they had a right to expose me, if they felt that  I was betraying the country. I want you to understand my attitude. I cannot behave otherwise with these young men inasmuch as I want to win them over by love. Having flung aside  the  sword,  there  is nothing except the cup of love which I can offer to those  who oppose me. It is by offering that cup that I expect to draw them close to me. I cannot think of perma-nent enmity between man and man, and believing as I do in the theory of rebirth, I live in the hope that if not in this birth, in some other birth I shall be able  to  hug  all  humanity in friendly embrace.
 I have dwelt at length on this little episode, in order that you may not think ill of the young men. Do not seek to protect me. The Most High is always there to protect us all. You may be sure that when my time is up, no one, not even the most renowned physician in the world, can stand between Him and me.
 And now a message for the young men. If you want my service, do not disown me come and understand everything from me. You
 must know that it is against my creed to punish even a murderer, a thief or a dacoit.  There can be therefore no excuse for suspicion that I did not want to save Bhagat Singh. But I want you also to realize Bhagat Singh’s error. If I had had an opportunity of speaking to Bhagat Singh and his comrades, I should have told them that the way they pursued was wrong and futile. I declare that we cannot win swaraj for our famishing millions, for our deaf and dumb, for our lame and crippled, by the way of the sword. With the Most High as witness I want to proclaim this truth that the way of violence cannot bring swaraj, it can only lead to disaster. I wish to tell these young men with all the authority with which a father can speak to his children that the way of violence can only lead to perdition. I shall explain to you why. Do you think that all the women and the children who covered themselves with glory during the last campaign would have done so if we had pursued the path of violence? Would they have been here today? Would our women known as the meekest on earth, would women like Gangabehn, who stood the lathi-blows until her white sari was drenched in blood, have done the unique service they did if we had violence in us? With God’s name on their lips she and her sisters hurled defiance at their oppressors, without anger in their hearts. And our children—our vanarasena (monkey-army). How could you have had these innocent ones, who renounced their toys, their kites and their crackers, and joined as soldiers of swaraj—how could you have enlisted them in a violent struggle? We were able to enlist as soldiers millions of men, women and children because we were pledged to non-violence. I beseech the young men to have patience and self- control. Anger cannot take us forward. We need not consider the English-men as our enemies. I have used satyagraha against them but have never thought of them as enemies. I want to convert them and the only way is the way of love. Rowdy demonstrations cannot help us. Could they call Bhagat Singh back to life? They can only retard the advent of swaraj. I agree that the Government has given sufficient cause for provocation, but I want the impatient youth in the name of God, in the name of our dear Motherland, to throw themselves heart and soul in the non-violent struggle. I ask them to trust my unbroken experience of forty years of the practice of non-violence.
 But if they will not, they might kill me but they cannot kill Gandhism. If Truth can be killed Gandhism can be killed. If non- violence can be killed Gandhism can be killed. For what is Gandhism but winning swaraj by means of truth and non-violence? Will they
 refuse swaraj attained through truth and non-violence? I ask them therefore not to mar the wonderful work done by the workers of Sind. The workers have in the course of three weeks created this Congressnagar, so that swaraj for the peasant, the labourer, the scavenger—all of whom have worked cheek by jowl in creating this city of huts—the lame and the blind, the starving and the well-fed, the wretch and the poor, may soon be a living reality. I beseech you not to mar the beautiful work they have done.
 This leads me to the events in Cawnpore which has been a scene of carnage. This is due largely to the violence we had harboured against one another. It is the handwriting on the wall. Though we have shown ourselves capable of limited non-violence, we have harboured violence in our hearts, we have been guilty of using coercion. The papers allege that Cawnpore Hindus went mad over Bhagat Singh’s martyrdom and started with intimidating the Mussalmans who would not close their shops in Bhagat Singh’s honour. You know the sequel.  I am quite sure that if the spirit of Bhagat Singh is watching what is happening in Cawnpore today, he would feel deeply humiliated and ashamed. I say this for I have heard him described as a man of  honour. And what havoc we have done! Women insulted! Children done to death! Let no Hindu comfort himself with the thought that they were Mussalman children; let no Mussalman feel happy in the knowledge that it is Hindu children who have been killed. I do not know their religion.Let it be recognized that both Hindus and Mussalmans had lost their senses. They were all children of the soil, children of our common Motherland.
 I have felt deeply ashamed of these deeds of blood, and to who-ever my voice may reach I wish to declare that such things may any day prove more than I can bear. How can we, with Hindus and Mussalmans slaughtering one another, continue to assert that we have been non-violent? How can I, a votary of truth, hug the belief that we  as a nation are non-violent if the mischief spreads? If I did so, I would be untrue to myself and to my Maker. With carnage going on about me I cannot bear to live unconcerned. Let me declare, that as soon as I feel that life is unbearable, I should hope to have the courage to fast myself to death rather than witness these blood feuds. You know by this time that I cannot bear denial of pledges solemnly and voluntarily undertaken.I would sooner be dead than see merchants and others break their pledged word, than see those calling themselves Congressmen and swearing by the creed of the Congress break it in their hearts or openly. If I can witness this contradiction with
 equanimity, with what face can I stand before the world and  my Maker? He will tell me I have been living a life of falsehood, a life of sham and fraud. I may not deceive myself and the world. Every moment of my existence is dedicated to the winning of swaraj by means of truth and non-violence.
 I know you will say that that sort of thing has been going on all these years, and I have done nothing to stop it. Penances with me are no mechanical acts. They are done in obedience to the inner voice. I am telling you what has been going on within me all these days. The crisis may never come, either because I am unnecessarily agitated, or because I have lost courage to face reality. I must be true to my Maker, and the moment I feel that life is insupportable for me, I hope not to be found wanting. What better reparation can I do than willing surrender of the body that has ceased to evoke response and may be a hindrance to the discovery of the true way?
 As he was about to close, the questionlibtech_290_footnotementioned above was asked him not by one who wanted to be cantankerous but by one who wanted everything to be known to the public. He replied :
 Well, I was not on my defence, and so I did not bother you with the details of what I did to save Bhagat Singh and his comrades. I plea-ded with the Viceroy as best I could. I brought all the persuasion at my command to bear on him. On the day fixed for the final interview with Bhagat Singh’s relations I wrote a personal letterlibtech_291_footnoteto the Viceroy on the morning of 23rd. I poured my whole soul into it, but  to no avail. I might have done one thing more, you say. I might have made the commutation a term of the settlement. It could not be so made. And to threaten withdrawal would be a breach of faith. The Working Committee had agreed with me in not making commutation a condition precedent to truce. I could therefore only mention it apart from the settlement. I had hoped for magnanimity. My hope was not to materialize. But that can be no ground for breaking the settlement.
 And it was not I alone who did what was humanly possible. The revered friend Panditji and Dr. Sapru tried their best. But why should that failure worry us? Success is in God’s hands. Our failure should spur us to greater effort. That effort lies in being true to ourselves, in Hindus and Mussalmans determining to live as brothers in heart unity, merchants and others keeping their voluntary pledges, in workers eschewing violence in thought, word and deed. May God help us to
 
 mend our ways. May He help us to be strong enough to be true to ourselves and to Him.

Among 	the earliest interviewers today were Mr. Subhas Bose and Mr. 	Satyamurti, both of whom pressed for insisting on the release of all 	prisoners sentenced in connection with the civil disobedience 	movement, the former going further and urging release of all Bengal 	detenus.  Gandhiji 	is reported to have assured them that there was no need to make any 	express conditions in these matters, because he had always insisted 	upon these things in his conversations with the Viceroy and he was 	satisfied that, after some time, all prisoners would be released. 	Delay might be due to the administrative difficulties or 
 even dilatory tactics on the part of local officialdom. If the Congress found, after a reasonable time, that all prisoners who came within the pact were not released, it would certainly be justified in breaking the pact.

 Let us not try to apportion the blame. Let us forget the fact that we are Hindus and Mussalmans. Let us remember that we are Indians, and the shame of Cawnpore is the shame of India. As for the Hindus, however, newspapers say that it was likely that Hindus were more to blame. And what for was all this carnage?  How could  we  go so mad? I am grieved to have to inform you that Sjt. Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi is reported to be missing or killed. Who would not be grieved over the death of such a genuine and earnest selfless comrade? But there is another view of the case. Rather than that a number of insignificant poor Hindus be killed, is it not well that a leader like Ganesh Shankar should have been killed? Rather than the death of a number of hapless poor Mussalmans, would not the death of Dr. Ansari in the cause of peace or unity be more welcomed? For the knife in Dr. Ansari’s body would act as the knife in the bodies of us all. It was therefore fortunate that Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi, who was so eminently free from communal bias, who was an institution in himself, and who was the foremost worker of the place, should have laid down his life in the cause of peace. Let his great example be an inspiration to us all, let it awaken us to our sense of duty. I ask you  to give your anxious consideration to the matter and help in the solution of the vexed question. Let the shame of Cawnpore teach us a lesson so that we may feel that even the loss of 300 men and women was not too high a price to be paid for permanent peace.

 A few representatives of the Red Shirts waited in deputation on Gandhiji and he had a long heart-to-heart talk with them. They explained that it was never their intention to do any physical harm to him, that his life and his health were as dear to them as to anyone else, and that individual terrorism was not their creed. They were adamant in their quarrel with the truce which, they believed, can never lead them to their goal of Workers’ and Peasants’ Free Republic in India. Gandhiji said :
 But my dear young men, go and see Bihar and you will find a workers’ and peasants’ republic working there. Where there was fear and slavery ten years ago, there is courage and bravery and resistance to wrong. If you want capital to be extinct or you want to abolish moneyed men or the capitalists, you will never succeed. What you must do is to demonstrate to the capitalists the power of labour and they will consent to be the trustees of those who toil for them. I do not want anything more for workers and peasants than enough to eat and house and clothe themselves and live in ordinary comfort as self- respecting human beings. After that condition of things is brought about the brainiest among them will certainly manage to acquire more wealth than the rest. But I have told you what I want. I want the rich to hold their riches in trust for the poor or to give them up for them. Do you know that I gave up all my property when I founded Tolstoy Farm? Ruskin’sUnto This Last inspired me and I built my farm on those lines. You will now recognize that I am, so to say, a “foundation member” of your peasants’ and workers’ republic.  And what do you prize more, wealth or work? Supposing you were to be stranded in the desert of Sahara with cart-loads of money, how would it help you? But if you can work you may not have to go hungry. How then is wealth to be preferred to work? Go and see for yourselves the Labour Union of Ahmedabad at work and see how they are trying to establish a republic of their own.
 Q.	Punjab is goonda-raj, Mahatmaji. Where do find the change of heart?
 A.  But I  never said that there had been a  change of heart on the part of the Government.
 Q.	Why then did you give such a certificate to Lord Irwin?
 
 A. Just as I  have given a  certificate to you, young men! I have admired your self-restraint, though I disapprove of your action against me. In the same way I was struck with Lord Irwin’s frankness, sincerity and friendliness and I paid a tribute to it. That was nothing unusual for me. There was no question of a change of heart. The settlement I had never regarded as an indication of change of heart, and so the executions did not alter the position. But I should certainly have given Government credit for some change of heart if they had commuted the sentences.

Though the resolution before you is very brief, I venture to
 suggest to you that it is very comprehensive and capable of passing the most rigorous test that a man who believes in complete independence can exact. The resolution makes it incumbent upon  any delegation that may take part in the Conference deliberations to bear in mind the Congress goal, or as it is called the Congress objective of purna swaraj as stated in the Lahore resolution, and not in the Madras resolution which was a pious wish. Purna swaraj is not a pious wish today. Purna swaraj is the incessant yearning of the soul of the nation which is impatient to get it, and its impatience was demonstrated during the past twelve months. And so it is  the immediate objective that the delegation has got to keep in view in agreeing to any single thing that may happen in the Conference. But that is not enough. Some idea or some inkling of purna swaraj or complete independence has also been given here as essential, and so it is incumbent upon your delegation to obtain control over the defence forces, etc.
 
 
 But the trap—or sting as you would call it—is in the tail of the resolution : “Provided, however, the Congress delegation would be free to accept such adjustments as may be necessary in the interests of India.” Now in this there is a trap and there is no trap. There is no trap if you will choose your delegation well and trust it. There is a trap because ‘adjustments’ is really synonymous with ‘safeguards’. The principle of safeguards is accepted in the terms of the settlement, but the safeguards that might be accepted have to be in the interests of India, and they must be demonstrably necessary,  not  merely  absolutely necessary as it has been suggested in one of the many amendments. Demonstrably for our purpose is a superior word to absolutely. I have given my meaning of the ‘safeguards’ very fully elsewherelibtech_299_footnotelibtech_300_footnoteand I will not dilate upon it.
 Having said this, I want to say something about another amend- ment that has been suggested, that whatever action the delegates may take should be subject to ratification by a special session of the Congress or by the All-India Congress Committee.I venture to suggest to you with all the force at my command, that this is not only unnece- ssary but unbecoming of a Congress thathas lived progressively for the past 45 years and has acquired a prestige unrivalled by any other organi-zation in India and a prestige now acquired by it throughout the world. Surely this Congress is not so poor as not to be able to produce representatives who can fully represent the Congress at any conference or any assembly. Therefore if you send your delegation, that delegation should have the same powers as if the whole Congress was being transported to the Conference. Without that matters such as those that confront us really cannot be adjusted. We will be  one  among many parties. Those who go to the Conference are expected  to have full credentials and full authority to bind their principals. But  if they go there and have to say, ‘We have come here, we will discuss; but we cannot bind our principals, we shall have to refer to our principals’, the procedure becomes interminable, cumbrous  and wholly ineffective for the purpose in view. Hence it is absolutely necessary not to put any such proviso as has been suggested.
 What is the position of the Congress, inter se? What is the  position of the Congress with reference to the intermediate bodies, the All-India Congress Committee and  the  Working  Committee? Although the committees are given a general power of attorney to act on behalf of the Congress, still the right of repudiation is a right of
 
 which the Congress can never divest itself. No organization or no principal can really divest himself of this right. The power of attorney to be given to your delegation is to act within the four corners of this resolution. So long as your delegation acts within the four corners of this power of attorney, it would be improper for you to repudiate them. If they go beyond this resolution, you have every right to repudiate them. That is one thing. But the more effective repudiation comes into play when they have turned traitors and have sold your cause, or when they have become so idiotic, so unintelligent as not to be able to see the many traps that might have been laid for them and thus fall into one of these traps. Even then they would have gone outside the four corners of their power of attorney. In that case, you have absolute right to repudiate all that they may have done, and that power is good against the whole world. The power of repudiation is absolute if your agents act outside the power that you give them. You may take it from me that this is the legal position, if I may so call it. Hence I suggest to you that it is not only superfluous, not only unnecessary, for you to attach the condition of ratification to this resolution, it is unbecoming of you to do so. It will really hamper the progress of the very thing you want them to do. Therefore I hope you will, without entering upon any further discussion, withdraw this parti- cular amendment.
 I would next suggest to you, if you will follow the warning I have uttered from this platform so often, that having brought into being your Working Committee, you should not thoughtlessly or hastily interfere with the build of the resolution that the Working Committee may place before you, because you should give the credit to the Working Committee for having examined all the pros and cons and all the objections that might possibly  be  raised  against  the  several parts of the resolution. It  will  really  be like inter-fering  with the creation of your own architects. But you can do one thing, and that is to exercise the precious right which you possess, viz., the right of total rejection of this resolution. Although the thing itself is a completed whole, and you may not therefore interfere with it in detail, still you have the right of totally rejecting it. I would therefore urge you, that if you really feel that the resolution does not satisfy you as a whole, you will marshal all your forces, intellect, and resourcefulness in a full-dress debate and reject the resolution. The choice before you is either to reject or accept the resolution as it stands, because it is a resolution framed by your trusted representatives after many and
 anxious hours of thought which you could never give to  this resolution; for one thing, you have not the leisure for it, nor can such  a large body of people give one mind to a resolution of this character. So far, therefore, as the body of this resolution is concerned, tear it to pieces if you like, examine it as mercilessly as you please, and then if you come to the conclusion that after all it is not in the interest of the nation, then destroy the resolution. But if you feel that the nation cannot lose but will gain by endorsing the settlement, you must say so boldly and act up to it. Endorsement means an honest endeavour to act up to it cent per cent. I do not want you to accept this resolution in  a niggardly or half-hearted spirit, or because it is a Mahatma who is behind it, or because the Working Committee is behind it. You, as represen-tatives of the nation, will not lose in dignity or in the estimation of the world, if you, after the fullest deliberation, come to the conclusion that it should be rejected, because this settlement is, in your opinion, not worth considering and that it is really a trap laid for the people. It will then be your bounden duty to reject it.
 But do not for heaven’s sake let the recent executions be an obsession in your way. We shall have provocations in our march towards the goal, in our march towards the Conference. Let no provocation deflect you from the right course. Let no provocation blind your judgment. Use your intellect in an absolutely unbiased manner. Examine the settlement on its own merits. Do not be carried away also by the fact that all the prisoners covered by the truce or the provisional settlement have not yet been discharged.  Let  not that worry you. It is up to the Working Committee to see that all those who are covered by the truce are discharged. If a single prisoner covered by the truce remains in prison, it must be a point of honour with the Working Com-mittee to repudiate the truce. Therefore you must not be turned away from your course by any side issues. What you should concentrate upon is this. What does the settlement amount to? What scope does the settlement give the Congress to assert its claim? What scope is there in this resolution for the delegation, even unconsciously, to go beyond the authority it confers on them? If you find it is not sufficiently comprehensive to tie down the hands of the delegation, no matter how clever it may be, you have every right summarily to reject the resolution.
 I warn the English-speaking people that next year they would not call upon a single speaker to speak in English. I hope that by next year they will have learned sufficient Hindustani to be able to follow the proceedings and really be able to speak in Hindustani also.
 Day after day and year after year we ourselves have accustomed the people to consider Hindustani as the common language for inter- provincial intercourse. Now it is too late to retrace our steps and habituate vast audiences to English.libtech_301_footnote
 I have expressed my views in this matterlibtech_302_footnotelibtech_303_footnotein my statement to the Press immediately after the settlement. The princes are naturally touchy, and we should do nothing to touch them on the raw, if we can help it. We may only make it clear to them that a Federation of the people and princes will have meaning only when the princes will stoop to conquer, will stoop to the level of their people, just as we ask the Englishmen to descend from the heights of Simla to the plains. But we do not want to give them any notice of this. We will trust them to conform to the spirit of the times, and I am sure that if we succeed in getting everything else the princes will offer no difficulty.

355,,BHAGAT SINGH,"
    
 Brave Bhagat Singh and his two associates have been hanged. Many attempts were made to save their lives and even some hopes were entertained, but all was in vain.
 Bhagat Singh did not wish to live. He refused to apologize; declined to file an appeal. If at all he would agree to live, he would do so for the sake of others; if at all he would agree to it, it would be in order that his death might not provoke anyone to indiscriminate murder. Bhagat Singh was not a devotee of non-violence, but he did not subscribe to the religion of violence; he was prepared to commit murder out of a sense of helplessness. His last letter was as follows: “I have been arrested while waging a war. For me there can be no gallows. Put me into the mouth of a cannon and blow me off.” These heroes had conquered the fear of death. Let us bow to them a thousand times for their heroism.
 But we should not imitate their act. I am not prepared to believe that the country has benefited by their action. I can see only the harm that has been done. We could have won swaraj long ago if that line of action had not been pursued and we could have waged a purely non- violent struggle. There may well by two opinions on this conjecture of mine. However, no one can deny the fact that if the practice of
 
 seeking justice through murders is established amongst us, we shall start murdering one another for what we believe to be justice. In a land of crores of destitutes and crippled persons, this will be a terrifying situa-tion. These poor people are bound to become victims of our atrocities. It is desirable that everyone should consider the consequences of this. Further, we want a swaraj which is theirs and for them. By making a dharma of violence, we shall be reaping the fruit of our own actions.
 Hence, though we praise the courage of these brave men, we should never countenance their activities.
 By hanging these men, the Government has demonstrated its own brute nature, it has provided fresh proof of its arrogance resulting from its power by ignoring public opinion. From this hanging it may be conclu-ded that it is not the intention of the Government to part with any real power to the people. The Government certainly had the right to hang these men. However, there are some rights which do credit to those who possess them only if they are enjoyed in name only. If a person exercises all his rights on all occasions, in the end they are destroyed. On this occasion, the Government would have brought credit to itself if it had not exercised its rights and this would have been highly useful in maintaining peace.
 However, it is obvious that the Government has not to date develo-ped such discretion. It has given a clear reason for the public to get enraged. If the latter shows anger, it will lose the game which it is about to win. Some officials may even hope that the public will give vent to its anger. Whether they do so or not, ours is a straightforward path. While negotiating the settlement, Bhagat Singh’s hanging was weighing upon us. We had hoped that the Government would be cautious enough to pardon Bhagat Singh and his associates to the extent of remitting the sentence of hanging. We should not break the pledge we have taken just because our hopes have not been fulfilled, but should bear this blow which has fallen upon us and honour our pledge. By doing so under even such trying circumstances, our strength to get what we desire will increase rather than decrease, while, if we break our pledge or violate the truce, we shall suffer loss of vigour, loss of strength and it will add to our present difficulties in reaching our objective. Hence our dharma is to swallow our anger, abide by the settlement and carry out our duty.

356,,THE ANSARI DHARMASALA,"
    
 I had had plenty of experience of Dr. Ansari’s generosity, but during my recent trip to Delhi I had more of it at his house. He insisted that all the members of the Working Committee should put up with him. Besides these, there were other guests also. His large bungalow having proved incommodious, tents had to be put up in his compound. There must have been some hundred guests having their meals at his home every day. On the one hand, there was his large practice and the time which had to be devoted to it and, on the other, there was a stream of people from the native States coming and going and then again there was his hospitality to be offered to so many guests and the talks to be held in connection with the work of the Congress. Despite all this, I have never found Dr. Ansari overcome by worry, become impatient or lose his temper. An ordinary man would have got tired if he had to accommodate such a large number of guests. I never found any trace of fatigue in Dr. Ansari.
 What must be the explanation for such good organization? It was Begum Ansari. One day I asked Dr. Ansari in the presence of Begum Ansari, “How is it that you can cope with so many persons having their meals and so on, with you?’ He replied, “The credit for all this goes to the Begum Saheba. I make over to her whatever I earn. She is very well-versed in Urdu and maintains an account of every single pie spent. She orders whatever she wishes and spends whatever she likes. Hence I have never borne the worries of running a household.” Hearing this, I bowed my head to Begum Ansari. It is not that there is only one such woman among Hindus and Muslims, there must be countless numbers of them in every nook and corner. We do not know of them.
 Readers will be happy to learn that there are two kitchens running in Dr. Ansari’s home. Brahmin cooks prepare separate meals for those who are vegetarians.

 [March 29, 1931]libtech_306_footnote
 This Congress, having considered the Provisional Settlement between the Working Committee and the Government of India, endorses it, and desires to make it clear that the Congress goal of purna swaraj (complete independence) remains intact. In the event of the way being otherwise open to the Congress to be represented at any conference with the representatives of the British Government, the Congress delegation will work for this goal and, in particular, so as to give the nation control over the army, external affairs, finance and fiscal and economic policy, and to have a scrutiny, by an impartial tribunal, of the financial transactions of the British Government in India and to examine and assess the obligations to be undertaken by India or England, and the right to either party to end the partnership at will; provided, however, that the Congress delegation will be free to accept such adjustments as may be demonstrably necessary in the interest of India.
 The Congress appoints and authorizes Mahatma Gandhi to represent it at the Conference with the addition of such other delegates as the Working Committee may appoint to act under his leadership.libtech_307_footnote

361,"March 30, 1931","SPEECH ON PROVISIONAL SETTLEMENT, KARACHI CONGRESS","
    
 March 30, 1931 Our young brothers and sisters are unhappy about the settlement.  I  have nothing but love in  my  heart for them.	I can
 
 
 understand their sorrow. They have every right to doubt the wisdom of this settlement. Their opposition does not irritate me. I am not even angry. We opposed the Round Table Conference; we were also saying that we would get nothing from this Conference. What has happened now to justify our hopes of gaining something by attending the Conference? There is no magic in me, nor is there any in the Congress that will change the attitude of the Round Table Conference, and that we will attain everything. Therefore, please  understand clearly that I make no promise that by attending the Round Table Conference we shall secure complete independence. My mind is full of misgivings and again and again I ask myself the question : “What shall we gain by attending this Conference?” Between what we demand today, and the demands that have been put forward at the Round Table Conference up to date, there is such an ocean of difference that the usefulness of going there may well be doubted.
 But it is a sin not to do what circumstances have made it a duty to do. It is a principle of satyagraha that if there is an op- portunity  for talks with the party against whom satyagraha is being offered, then talks should be  tried.  We  should  strive  to  win  over  by love the person whom we consider our enemy. To conquer him in this manner should be the satyagrahi’s resolve. If he does not possess this attribute but harbours enmity, jealousy and hatred in his heart, then he cannot be called a satyagrahi but a duragrahi. In the oft-repeated goal of the Congress there is no place for wilfulness. There is only place for truth and non-violence. Therefore, if we admit that there can be no compromise with those with whom we have  tried  the method of satyagraha, then that will be a great mistake. This error must be dispelled. Truly, I myself am doubtful of the outcome. Still, when we have been invited, when we have been asked to say what we want, to state our position rather than fight, then what other duty can we have but to do that? This is what the Prime Minister has said. The Viceroy also has uttered similar words. When I was in prison, even then he sent word to say that I could meet him whenever I wished to do so. Then he delivered a speech; and after that we were released. On my release, I wrote him a letter and as a result we decided to meet. Our meetings and talks ended in the present settlement. There is nothing in the settlement for us to be ashamed of. I do not want to explain here why certain things are not in the settlement and why certain matters were left untouched. But I shall explain to you how it became the duty of the Working Committee to make this compromise.
 When the Government set free the Working Committee, it became the duty of the latter either to break the law by offering civil disobedience and go back to prison, or do something other than that. Had we not exercised our discretion in choosing this second course, the world would not have cheered us, it would have censured us.
 This is one question. Another thing is that we have not ended this struggle because we had grown weary. I did not like what Swami Govin-danandlibtech_308_footnotelibtech_309_footnotesaid.   He said, “We were   prepared  to  continue  the struggle for another year.” I agree. I may even go further and add that we could have continued this fight not for one but for another twenty years to come. We are thirty crores in number out of which one crore would fight. And a satyagrahi fights on even when all have wearied and given up the struggle. So, it is not right to say that the Working Committee has accepted the settlement because we had become tired. He who suspen-ds satyagraha because he is tired, deceives God, deceives the nation, decei-ves his country. But this settlement was not concluded in this manner. It was  concluded because it had to be. We cannot argue that we should continue to fight because we have the strength to fight. Even if we had continued the fight for another year more, in the end this very same question would have come up. Would you even then say, “No, we shall  continue to fight”? That soldier who says,  “I  shall  keep  on fighting”, has false pride, and is guilty in the eyes of God. Therefore, the settlement ought to have been concluded.
 Then, another thing. We do not yet quite know whether we shall reach the stage of the Round Table Conference or not. Even if we do, there is no reason to assume that we shall bring back something from there. Even if we return empty-handed you have no right to abuse us, nor can you laugh at us. Because I do not promise that, if I go, I shall necessarily bring back something or other. This is certain however : we shall not return with slavery. We shall not bring anything that is not contained in this resolution. But if we do not bring anything, how does it follow that we should hand over the work of the Congress to others? Even today the work of the Congress is in your hands. It is you that made Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel your President today. If you choose you can remove him from office tomorrow. If you wish to change the Working Committee you can do so. Therefore please do
 
 
 not say that it is the Mahatma who is behind this resolution. The Working Committee is behind it; so you have to let go the Mahatma. It is far better that you do not vote for the resolution. It should not be that simply because some of us have done something we should be kept on. If we have proved ungrateful or if we have acted foolishly, then certainly remove us from office. And instead of removing us on our return from the Round Table Conference, you can do so now. We are your servants; we shall resign and get away. Even if there is the slightest self-respect in us, we shall resign, and you will not be blamed for this. The world will say we did the right thing.
 But if you feel that because I am a Mahatma this cannot be done, then it is weakness on your part. If swaraj cannot be had without the Mahatma, then, believe me, you will never be able to rule yourselves. When I left for Dandi, I said that even if all the leaders were jailed the fight would not stop. Those outside would continue it. You have shown it in action. Not only all the leaders, but all the workers were jailed, yet our work did not stop. The women took it up and were in turn imprisoned; even then the work did not stop.
 Was Kikibehn Lalwani, who was dictator of Karachi, fit to be made dictator? The poor lady was suffering from phthisis. But she plunged into the battle, became dictator, and entered jail. The sick woman was cured, and she became a brave fighter. So, you can see that the Mahatma is not indispensable. I may add further that to the extent I deserve the title Mahatma, it was given to me for my spirit of service. Once I give up serving others I shall cease to be Mahatma from that very moment. Therefore do not feel that because this resolution was drawn up by the Mahatma, or by the Working Committee, therefore it cannot be opposed. If  after  deep consideration you reject this resolution then I shall defend you before the world.
 But if you accept that you must do exactly as you are told by those who have started the fight, then I tell you to be with me and put up a sincere fight. That is, do not worry if your spokesman returns empty-handed. If he brings back something so much the better; but  if he does not bring anything we shall fight again. So many have gone to jail, so many have faced lathi-charges, and undergone hardships that we do not wish unnecessarily to repeat all this. But, having done our duty, if we do not get what we asked for, then our resolve to fight stands. And, when we are there those who remain
 here—supporters and opponents—must finish the work that remains.
 I do not agree with Dr. Kitchlew that when we are away  attending the Round Table Conference, the work that remains to be done should be done by the youth. Who else can picket like the women who picketed the foreign-cloth shops and the liquor shops? They shall abide by the rules of picketing that we have laid down and do the work of picketing. Men like Jamshed Mehta, who is known here by the name of Bhagat had to complain strongly—bitterly— against us. Let all read his article, and avoid the mistakes that he has pointed out and do picketing according to the rules laid down. Khadi work should be taken up in order to complete the boycott of foreign cloth. All this work is not only for the youth to do but for all.
 I shall say a few words about the simple and candid speech of Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan—a speech that so well becomes a Pathan. I was very glad to hear what he said. It is good that we invited him and gave oursel-ves that opportunity of hearing him. I have lived among the Pathans. I have had Pathans as my clients. I know the Pathans’ nature. If the Pathans believe that they have benefited by the Congress—and I believe that they have—then I wish to assure them further that we shall do noth-ing that will curtail their freedom. We shall do our best to see that the Frontier Province attains the same kind of independence as the other States will receive. I had intended to visit that province, but I regret that I shall not get the opportunity to do so. I was told that the Afghans on the other side of the Frontier Province also wished for my release. Why should the Afghans have wanted my freedom? I have worked for the Pathans of the Frontier, but I have done nothing for the Afghans. Yes, I shall certainly say that in our freedom lies theirs too. Today, however, beyond showing this much of fellowship, we are not able to render them any special assistance. On attaining freedom India has no designs to fight any other country. I can give this assurance to the Pathans and the  Afghans. It is a great thing for the Pathans to join us in our fight, because we shall have a whole army of fighters.libtech_310_footnote
 I will say one or two words with reference to what has been left out in the resolution before you. One thing that has been left out is the Federation. What is the meaning of the word ‘Federation’? Is it a Fede-ration between the princes or the States on the one hand and the pro-vinces put together on the other? What are the conditions under which that Federation is to take place we do not know at all. But the princes have taken up one position, viz., that there shall be no
 
 intervention on the part of the Federal Government in their internal affairs. All I have suggested in connection with the Federation is that they should acknowledge that the fundamental rights of the people of the States should be the same as those of the citizens in what is called British India. If those rights are guaranteed under the federal constitution, then there should be naturally some federal institution to protect those rights, i.e., a federal supreme court or whatever you might like to call it, to which an appeal would lie. I hope the princes will of their own accord recognize these two things and also allow representation for the subjects of the States. To do this would possibly be somewhat of a derogation from the sovereignty which the princes enjoy. But if they would be part of the Federation in which the larger part is to be governed by a spirit of absolute democracy, it is up to them to part with some of their power and that of their own accord and free will. I am hoping that some such thing would happen and that is why you find no mention made of Federation in this resolution.
 He also said a word about an important reservation in the resolution viz., “in the event of the way being otherwise open”.
Supposing that we do not arrrive at any settlement whatever over
 this delicate question of Hindi-Muslim unity, what is to be the position of the Congress? So far as I can see at the present moment, it will be useless for the Congress delegation to take part in the Conference if we cannot possibly arrive at a proper communal solution. But I am not able just now to give you my final decision or final opinion. I do not know. Many things may happen, which may make it necessary or highly desirable that the delegation should take part in the Conferene. But that is for the future really to decide.
 Towards the conclusion, he addressed the following warning both to those who would reject it or accept it and gave a solemn promise of loyalty.
If the Congress rejects the settlement summarily, nothing  can
 possibly be said against the Congress. The Congress is a paramount authority. The Working Committee is its creature. The action taken by the Working Committee, or taken by myself, may not commend itself to you. There should be, therefore, no question of toleration or patronage. It is open to every one of you to reject the resolution and to repudiate the settlement if you wish to. But if you endorse the  settlement, then it is also your duty actively to support it, carry out all its items faithfully and honourably and do the various things which are set out before you in the resolution, so that you daily increase   the
 power of the Congress andmake it possible for  the  Congress delegation to vindicate the position of the Congress and possibly to bring the very thing for which you have suffered for the last twelve months.
 One thing more. If this delegation goes as far as the Conference, it does not mean that the delegation will bring in its pocket purna swaraj. If it does not bring purna swaraj, it does not mean that it returns humiliated. Nothing of the kind. All that we expect to be able  to do is to go and tell the British people and the British Minister what we want, and if we do not get what the Congress expects the delega- tion to accept within the terms of the resolution, we are bound to return empty-handed and receive your compliments, not curse. But you will be entitled to give us curses if we return having sold the interests of the country. That is what you have a perfect right to do. But it will not be proper for you to say, ‘you were not able to fulfil your promises.’ No promise has ever been made. No promise is being made now that if the deputation goes  to  the  Conference, whether here or in England, or enters upon further negotiations, that deputation is going to bring purna swaraj. Purna swaraj will come when the full authority of the Congress has been manifested and not a minute before. It will be the greatest achievement of the Congress to bring swaraj if it does. All that I promise faithfully to you on my own behalf and on behalf of any delegation that you might wish to send with me is that we shall not be disloyal to the Congress in any shape or form.
 The appeal did not fall on deaf ears, practically all the amendments were withdrawn, and the resolution was passed without the change of a comma or colon.

 March 31, 1931
 This Congress is of opinion that to enable the masses to appre- ciate what swaraj, as conceived by the Congress, will mean to them, it is desirable to state the position of the Congress in a manner easily understood by them. In order to end the exploitation of the masses, political freedom must include real economic freedom of the starving millions. The Congress, therefore, declare that any constitution which may be agreed to on its behalf should provide, or enable the Swaraj Government to provide, for the following :
   Fundamental 			rights of the 			people, including :  freedom 				of association 				and combination; freedom 				of speech 				and of 				the Press;  freedom 				of conscience 				and the 				free profession and 				practice of 				religion, subject to 				public order and morality; protection of the culture, language and scripts of the    
minorities;

363,"March 31, 1931","SPEECH ON FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS, KARACHI CONGRESSlibtech_312_footnote","
    
 March 31, 1931
 In moving the resolutionlibtech_313_footnoteon fundamental rights in the open Congress Gandhiji, speaking in Hindi, said :
This resolution is meant for those who are no legislators, who
 are not interested in intricate questions of constitution, who will not take an active part in the administration of the country. It is meant to indicate to the poor, inarticulate Indian the broad features of swaraj or Ramarajya. Before my march to Dandi I had included some of these features in my eleven points. These have been made more compre- hensive. They are now presented to you in  a  separate  resolution. They were advisedly omitted from the main resolution because that would have made the mandate for the delegation burdensome. But by passing this resolution we make it clear to the world and to our own people what we propose to do as soon as we come into power. Let Government also take note of it. Let those who may have to deal with us at the Round Table Conference also take note of the fact that the Viceroy, under swaraj, should not get more than Rs. 500 per month. The position has been made as clear as possible, in order that we may not be accused of having sprung sudden surprises on those who have to deal with us. They are also meant to forewarn all concerned. Let them prepare themselves for the coming legislation by modelling their lives in the light of coming changes.
 I shall take a few instances. Clause I (d) of the fundamental rights protects the culture, language and scripts of the minority. Now though I am sure that Islamic and Aryan cultures are not mutually exclusive and fundamentally different, I must recognize that Mussal- mans look upon Islamic culture as distinctive from Aryan. Let us therefore cultivate tolerance. Let us try to learn the Urdu language and Urdu script and understand the Mussalmans’ insistence on it.
 Then there is the abolition of all disabilities attaching to women, in regard to public employment, office of power or honour, etc. The moment this is done many of the disabilities to which the women are
 
 subjected will cease. So far as the Congress is concerned, we have admitted no such disability. We have had Dr.Besant and Shrimati Sarojini Devi as our presidents and in the future free State it will be open to us to have women presidents.
 Religious neutrality is another important provision. Swaraj will favour Hinduism no more than Islam, nor Islam more than Hinduism. But in order that we may have a State based on religious neutrality, let us from now adopt the principle in our daily affairs. Let not a Hindu merchant hesitate to have deserving Muslims as his employees, and let every Congressman make religious neutrality his creed in every walk of life.
 Item number five deserves the immediate attention of all mill and factory owners who should anticipate humane legislation fore- shadowed in the clause.
 The last item relates to the control of usury. Islam strictly prohibits the charging of interest but there is no reason why usury should not be regarded as criminal in a Hindu. The Pathans have forgotten the Islamic injunction, have followed our bad example and are known to charge from 200 to 300 per cent interest. I wish I could persuade Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan to go to our parts to wean his co- religionists from usury. Let also our bankers and money-lenders betimes make drastic reductions in their rates of interest, lest drastic legislation should find them unprepared. The peasants are being crushed to extinction. So let the money-lenders adopt 8 per cent as the maximum rate to afford them some relief.
 Let the zamindars and the Maharajas be assured that the Con- gress does not seek to destroy them, but is determined to destroy all wrong and injustice. Let them make an earnest endeavour to under- stand the grievances of their tenants and introduce adequate measures of relief before legislation overtakes them. It is open to them to join the Congress as Raja Saheb of Kalakankar and Chowdhary Raghuvir- narayan Sinha have done.
 Let it be understood that this resolution by no means has any finality. It is open to the A.I.C.C. to revise, amend or add to the twenty points and so let no one oppose the resolution for mere diffe- rence on matters of detail. Those however who are opposed to the policy and principle must reject it, but they must bear in mind that
 
 the poor man’s swaraj is soon coming and let them not be found unprepared when it actually comes.libtech_314_footnote

366,"April 1, 1931",INTERVIEW TO “THE STATESMAN”,"
    
 KARACHI,
 April 1, 1931
 In an hour’s conversation with me early this morning, Mr. Gandhi indicated in some measure the manner in which he would put his case at the Round Table Conference, his attitude on the question of safeguards, his fears and hopes for the communal problem and last, but not least, his faith in the honesty of Great Britain’s present policy towards India, however mistaken that policy may be.
 He said that on the whole he was very well content with the week’s work in Congress.
 I asked Mr. Gandhi if he felt secure in the freedom of the mandate that Congress had given him for his work at the Round Table Conference. He replied :
The mandate is not an absolutely free mandate, for I am bound
 by the terms of the main resolutionlibtech_318_footnotepassed by the Congress this week. I do not think you could say that those terms are exactly ambiguous, but rather that they are fairly comprehensive.
 Yet they do allow me some latitude, for obviously there must be latitude in a discussion such as we shall have at the Conference. For instance, the words“such adjustments as may be demonstrably nece- ssary in the interest of India” mean what they say, but they give us an opportunity to modify as well as to constrict our present ideas about safeguards and other things if we find that must be done for the sake of freedom.
 We are prepared to surrender what can be surrendered with honour, but there can be no dishonourable surrender.
 Q. What exactly do you mean by this new term ‘equality of partnerships’? Does it mean a national status like Australia’s within the British Commonwealth of Nations?
 A. No, it does not mean that. Until a short time ago I thought  that such a status would be suitable for India, but now I have come to see that certain things stand in the way.
 You see, the nations in the British Commonwealth are essentially British or, as in the case of South Africa, are closely identified with British ideas and culture. Their people are racially British and their institutions are British. We cannot say that of India. We do not aspire
 
 
 to identify our culture with British and the West. We are content and passionately want to retain and develop our own culture and order of society. So there is no real analogy at all between, say, Australia’s status and India’s future status within the British Commonwealth.
 There can, however, be a partnership between Britain and India which will mean a bandobastlibtech_319_footnotelibtech_320_footnotebetween the two countries for assistance, one to the other, in many things and for reciprocal obligations.
 You mean, a kind of semi-contractual alliance. Just as England has an alliance with France for certain purposes of war, so you want an alliance between Britain and India, only this alliance will cover several other things besides war and will be a more fruitful and, let us say, a happier partnership than an alliance merely for war?
Yes, yes, that’s it exactly.
 And you do not want any more Viceroys, any more Lord Irwins?
No, I do not want any more Lord Irwins, any more Viceroys.
 But when you get to the Round Table Conference, will you keep your mind open to conviction that Dominion Status will be suitable to India? If you come to see there that membership of the British Commonwealth would be in India’s honourable interests, would you accept Dominion Status?
 I am open to conviction about that, but I cannot conceive of its possibility. If I were persuaded of what you say, then I should frankly confess it and I should do my utmost to bring Congress round to the same point of view.
 Acceptance of Dominion Status is outside the mandate. There must therefore be previous reference to the All-India Congress Committee and may be even to the Congress. But there will not be any quarrel about words. If there has to be a quarrel, it will be about the substance.
 And what about these safeguards, Mr. Gandhi? The Working Committee admits the necessity for certain safeguards. Is one of them the retention of British troops in India?
I  myself do not believe that  any  Army,   Indian  or  British,  is
 necessary at all, but there the Working Committee disagrees with me. That being so, I am prepared to agree that for a transitional period the Indian Army will need some British officers, because you have never allowed our own officers to learn all that must be learned  about modern warfare.  Perhaps some British regiments would be  necessary
 
 also, partly for the same reasons. But they must be subject to the control of the Indian Government.
 But how and why do you expect that they will be willing to serve here under an alien Government?
Well, we have known of mercenary armies in Europe in the past
 and though the inspiration of patriotism has supplanted pure mercenarism, the soldier asks for and receives monetary wages for his services. Why should he not be willing to lend his services on similar terms for the common good of humanity? But if your officers and men will not serve here under our own Government—well, we shall have to do without them.
 Will you not admit that English troops are necessary in communal distur- bances?
I do not. If our own troops are found wanting, the most that can
 happen is that we might have to put up with civil war  for a time.  But  it is better that we should have communal strife and fight our own battles against it than that we should have to appeal to another country to set our house in order with troops over which our people have no control.
 Very possibly there will be some serious communal strife when we have got swaraj, but only for a little while. If you will not help us to stop it in the way I suggest, then it may perhaps end itself in the exhaustion or destruction of one community or the other. There may be jealousies and disputes between factions, interests (if you insist on the point), even whole provinces.
 It is not consistent with the self-respect of a country or a race that it should give carte blanche to the power of another nation or another race or individual members of it to say, ‘These people cannot manage their own affairs, so they gave us a free hand to do it for them.’
 Whatever the differences between us here, we are all Indians and our land is India. But I am not so pessimistic as to think that the lesson will be learned too late.
 And what other safeguards have you in mind? There is finance, for instance. You have slightly alarmed some people in India who cannot afford a depreciation of the rupee’s purchasing power. There are other people, Indians who have sent much capital out of the country with the intention of bringing it back to their own great profit when, as they hope, self-governing India will have sunk the rupee’s value to very little.
 Yes, I know that is being done and it is very bad. It must be stopped. And I know that there are people in some parts of India who do not want the rupee ratio reduced. But, I do not see why the rupee should not return to its old value of 1s. 4d.
 As to the financial safeguards to be discussed at the Round Table Conference, well, we should of course, be under an obligation to pay for whatever assistance we seek from you.
 The British came here first simply for the sake of trade. Now they say that they have a trust. Their rule has been disastrous for India, but nevertheless I will agree that the man in the street is honest in his belief that he has a trust to fulfil for India. The mischief is due to ignorance—the ignorance of insularity.
 I have said that I cannot conceive of my accepting Dominion Status when I go to the Round Table Conference. I should welcome a closer association in equal fellowship that can make an outstanding contribution to spiritual greatness in international and inter-racial affairs.

367,"April 1, 1931","SPEECH PROPOSING WORKING COMMITTEE,","
    
 A.I.C.C. MEETING, KARACHI
 April 1, 1931 Mahatmaji, in consultation with the President and Mr. Jawaharlal Nehru, had prepared a list overnight, which he  placed  before  the  Committee and  explained the inclusion of new names and the exclusion of other names to find accommo-
 dation. . . .
 Mahatmaji walked into the A.I.C.C. meeting and moved, besides the office- bearers, the following for the new Working Committee : Gandhiji, Dr. Ansari, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, Messrs Rajendra Prasad, Sen Gupta, Aney, Nariman, Dr. Alam, Mrs. Naidu and Sardar Sardul Singh. He said that Messrs Rajagopalachari, Pattabhi, Satyapal and Shiva Prasad Gupta had to be left to find places for Dr. Alam, Mr. Nariman, Mrs. Naidu, and Mr. Aney. Speaking in Hindi, he referred to the convention established in the matter and desired that the A.I.C.C. should accept this Congress Cabinet for the current year.
 Mr. Punniah Sastri (Andhra) questioned why Bombay was given eight seats while Andhra, Tamilnad, Karnatak, and Utkal went without any.
 Gandhiji replied that in these matters they ought not to think provincially. They must consider the work ahead and see if the names he had suggested were not necessary. . . .
 A number of members rose and proposed names which they considered were left out. . . .
 Gandhiji then replied :
 It is most unfortunate that my friends from the South are not able to follow Hindustani. Otherwise most of the remarks that Mr. Satyamurti had made just now would probably have not been made. I said that the South was deliberately omitted and I said also that it was an omission purposely made by me. I made that omission deliberately in order to find accommodation that I personally thought was nece- ssary. When I made the omission I had hoped that if I coupled the omission with the information that the omission was not the joint act of the Work-ing Committee but it was my own suggestion it would not be misunder-stood. People of the South know that some of my staunchest co-workers are from the South. They also know that I owe all that I am today to the South. I became known to India because of my identification with the South in South Africa and that identifi- cation was through an indentured Indian, by name  Somasundramlibtech_321_footnotelibtech_322_footnote. Probably the Indian world and much less the whole world would not have heard of Gandhi but for the accident of Somasundram being severely hurt and receiving my assistance. Since then my connection with the South not only with Hindus but with Mussalmans and Christians ripened. What more explanation do you want from me as to why then the South was omitted in my list of members to the Working Committee? Do you suppose that because I have omitted Dr. Pattabhi I shall not get any assistance from him? After all he was  a party to the contract. The relations between members at meetings of the Working Committee are not at all of a strained character. Every- thing was discussed in the Working Committee. All persons affected were there except Mr. Satyapal. It was an accident that he was not there. Mr. Rajagopalachari was there and do you think I am capable of omitting his name purposely. Do you think I am not going to take from him such work as he is capable of? You are mistaken if you think that is going to happen. To my friends I would say that the
 
 name of Mr. Gopabandhu Choudhri was first put in because at Utkal is to be held the next Congress. But we found that we could not take out any one of the other names we had. Therefore it was I had to withdraw that name taking the responsibility on me. Mr. Venkatap- payya’s name had been suggested by somebody. I tell you I cannot do without him. But I know I can get his service whenever I want.
 A MEMBER. Also Mr. Rajendra Prasad.
 MAHATMAJI. He  was  deliberately  omitted  last  year.  You  do not know him as well as I do. I know him. So I summarily rejected his name at Lahore. If you want to know why Rajendrababu is put in this time, it is because the Working Committee wants his assistance.
 A MEMBER : Do you not want Mr. Rajagopalachari’s assistance?
 MAHATMAJI : Yes, I do. I want his assistance also. But he has been removed in order to make room for others. These are the names. The whole of India knows my connection with some of them. Therefore it was no question of North or South. I was not present when the debate on the deletion of the sentence in the General Secretaries’ report took place. I have not read the report of it in the newspapers. I have no time to read newspapers. Whatever I must read,  I read. Other things are given to me. I know one sentence was deleted from the report. I overheard a conversation between Mr. Rajagopala- chari and Pandit Jawaharlal on the matter. Beyond that I do not know anything. This motion has absolutely no connection whatsoever with whatever reflection you think had been cast by the report on the South. It is wholly an independent thing, and it comes out of my guilelessness, simplicity of nature and my abundant trust in them. . . .
 A VOICE. Was Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya’s name considered? GANDHIJI. It is deliberately not there.
 DR. SASTRI. What about Mr. Rajagopalachari?
 THE PRESIDENT. I withdrew it on his behalf. I know Mr. Rajagopalachari more than you do.
 DR. SASTRI. The future Congress work in the South requires that Mr.
 Rajagopalachari should be in the Working  Committee.
 GANDHIJI. An endeavour will be made by the  Working Committee whenever it needs to invite people from the provinces not represented here. That is all right, I suppose.

368,"April 1, 1931","SPEECH AT JAMIAT-UL-ULEMA CONFERENCE, KARACHIlibtech_323_footnote","
    
 April 1, 1931
 There are many gentlemen belonging to the Jamiat-ul-Ulema with whom I am acquinted. Many of them are persons who have made great sacrifices during satyagraha and have helped us in many ways. I am grateful to them for this. Everyone feels that at present the atmosphere in India has become noxious. Hindus and Muslims lost their sanity in Kanpur, Banars and Mirzapur. I have heard that the Hindus started the riots in Kanpur. I admit that it was a grave error. Ever since the time of the non-co-operation movement, I have been shouting from the house-tops that if we wish to accomplish our task peacefully, we should try to reason with all people and make an impression upon their minds. If we carry out our task through the use of force, we shall be held guilty in the court of God. Even while picketing foreign cloth and liquor shops, the people overstepped the limits. It is possible that this may have had immediate good results, but we have seen, in Kanpur, how it is fraught with danger. When reports of the atrocities committed by Hindus reached me, my head bent low in shame, I was ashamed of myself. I should feel ashamed whenever either of the two communities commits atrocities, but those committed by the Hindus naturally put me to greater shame. It is a matter of regret that till today neither of the two communities—Hindus or Muslims—has
 regained its sanity. Nowadays we have established the practice of returning a blow for a word of abuse and a bullet for a blow. This is an uncivilized practice. I say that not even a blow should be returned for a blow. In this matter, I humbly beg the Ulema to assist me. Please use whatever influence you have with the Muslims.
 In political matters also, we quarrel with one another.  Here, too,  I wish to take as much help from you as possible. If we do not succeed in this, it will be practically futile to attend the Round Table Conference. I do not desire that this Government should become an arbitrator between the two of us and give an award. I shall humbly tell the Jamiat-ul-Ulema that it can be of great help in this matter. As a Congressman and as a Hindu, I say that I wish to give the Muslims
 
 what they want. I do not wish to act like a Bania. I wish to leave everything to the honour of the Muslims. I would like you to put down whatever you want on a blank sheet of paper and I shall agree to it. Jawaharlal too had said the very same thing in prison. The Pathans  of the Frontier Province carry rifles and swords, but in this war they did not make use of either, like brave men they received the bullets upon their chests, they bore in silence whatever suffering fell to their lot. Jawaharlal said: “I would put a pen into the hands of such people and ask them to write down what they wanted and I would affix my signature to it.” It has become the duty of the Congress to settle matters now with minority communities in this way alone. Those who belong to the Congress cannot make any distinctions between Hindus and Muslims. From here we shall be proceeding to Delhi. We have received a telegram from Maulana Shaukat Ali asking us to send a delegation on behalf of the Congress to a conference of Muslims which is being held there. Sardar Patel has already sent in the names of the members of this delegation. That conference is being held on the 4th and the 5th, where every effort will be made [for a settlement]. A mountain of difficulties faces us, but if you too try, the problem will be solved within two or three days. I too shall do likewise. I am aware that the Muslims are greatly enraged by the incidents which took place in Kanpur and other places but, at this juncture, it is our duty to resolve this issue somehow.
 The Congress has, by passing a long resolution, set its own standards, from which it can be seen that the swaraj which will be established will be for benefit of the poor. The Congress belongs to the poor, it belongs to the peasants.libtech_324_footnote
It is not right to say that the Congress is a Hindu organization.
 What is the Congress to do if Muslims would not care to go into it? The Congress is based on adult franchise, and any adult Hindu or Mussalman can join the Congress. No community is excluded. Ask the Muslim friends who are members of the Congress, and they will tell you that they have not come to grief by having joined the Congress. I ask you therefore not to suspect that the Congress is a Hindu organization. I ask every one of you to join the Congress and  to take charge of it. But one cannot take charge of it by force. It can  be done only by willing service.  Ever since the Congress was started,
 
 Young India, 16-4-1931.
 those who have served it have had charge of it. And yet the Congress does not belong only to them, does not stand only for them, it belongs to and stands for all. It is the swaraj Government in embryo. Its prestige is ever so much superior to that of the British Government, and the Congress President is greater than the Viceroy. Only moneyed people and men in high places know the Viceroy. One needs a motor- car to reach the Viceregal House. But the poorest man knows the Congress President (at present Sardar Vallabhbhai) and can walk up to him. The Sardar has dedicated himself to the service of the country, and he who serves the poor is great in the eyes of God. If you want to be in power under swaraj, I invite you to assume the reins of the Congress now by joining it in large numbers. It is the most powerful organization in the country, join it. We will welcome you.
 At this juncture, I am reminded of the simplicity and determi- nation of Hazrat Umer. He could not permit for himself or for his wealthy associates any luxuries or adornments. He made those who wore muslin or velvet discard those garments and made them wear khadi. He made those who were fond of finely ground flour give it up. Will not the Muslims today make such sacrifice for the sake of the poor?
 The Spinners’ Association, which is an organization under Con- gress, has to date spent Rs. 30 lakhs for this purpose. Who received this money? I would like to inform you that the larger portion of this amount has gone to poor Muslim women, as they form the majority among the spinners. The larger quantity of fine khadi is woven from yarn spun by sacred Muslim hands. Many of the weavers of khadi are Muslims. Is khadi made in this manner prohibited to you under a religious injunction, whereas cloth made in Manchester is something permissible? But forget the Muslims, for that matter. It is merely an accident that the major portion of that amount goes to the Muslims, but are not Hindu weavers your brothers? Cannot articles made by them be fit enough for your use? You refer to God as Rahim, you recite kalamaslibtech_325_footnote.  I am an insignificant individual, but I too have read the Koran Sharif. But there is not a single kalama in it which gives you the right to wear foreign cloth. Although thus the Koran permits you to do nothing else, only a handful of Muslims are wearing khadi. At the most, some wear mill-made cloth, but the majority wear only foreign cloth. If the Jamiat-ul-Ulema has any love for the poor, it is
 
 
 its duty to take up khadi work. I know of an old woman of sixty who earns her living by spinning yarn. How much must she be earning in this way? And yet she breaks into tears if no one buys her yarn. Whether a cowrie has any value for you or not, that poor woman values it. From the money she gets from yarn every week, she does not buy tobacco or cigarettes, but lentils, vegetables, ghee and milk for her child. I have merely cited an instance to you. Do you feel no compassion for thousands of such poor people? If you do feel no compassion towards them, I tell you that you cannot attain heaven even by performing the namaz five times. A Hindu, with  great humility, wishes to tell this to you learned Ulema. Moreover, I would humbly tell you that you may as well not recite namaz, but fear God and fear no man. If I am mistaken in saying this, forgive me, but understand the feeling in my heart.
 Now I wish to address a few words to the Muslim zamindars of Sind. I am of opinion that Sind should be made a separate province. However, nowadays I receive hundreds of telegrams and letters from the Hindus of Sind. Today too a deputation of Hindus met me. I replied to them in accordance with my understanding of the situation, but I also asked them to go and meet Muslims first  as  came  and  met me. Now I ask you why are they afraid of meeting you? Why  do you not go to them to see their privations? Why is it that the Hindus of Sind distrust you so much? They are afarid of you. Why are they afraid of you? Is it not your duty to rid them of their fear? If they are afraid of you, is it not a matter of shame to you? With a great deal of humility, I appeal to you, the Ulema, to persuade the Muslims of Sind to win the confidence of the Hindus there. I wish that the Hindus and the Muslims would jointly send me telegrams that both are agreeable to having Sind made into a separate province. Sind does not belong to the Muslims only but to both the communities. It is in your hands to make it into the best province. There are fakir-devotees like Jamshed Mehta in Sind. The Sind Muslims are a wealthy people. There are intelligent, rich Amils  residing in Sind. Sindhis have gone forth to all the corners of the world. By combining all your abilities, you can turn Sind into the most advanced province. If the Hindus stop sending me telegrams, the country will save money, I can spin more yarn and devote my time to more important work. If you can do this, your achievement will
 produce a good impression on other provinces. This is my humble request. It is my prayer to God that my words may touch your hearts and that He cleanse the hearts of all of us.

 I did not suspect that my Parsi friends were so timid, but Sjt. Sidhwa has disillusioned me. Let me therefore reassure you that the Parsi community’s interests do not need to be safeguarded in any scheme of swaraj, in as much as the handful of men and women belonging to that adventurous and resourceful community have never found any difficulty in any corner of the globe wherever they may have chanced to go. There were for instance only a few Parsi families in Porbandar in the days of my childhood when my father was Prime Minister there. But those families had carved out a status for them- selves in the State. Why? Was it because their interests had been specially safeguarded by the State? Parsi Rustomji of happy memory enjoyed a unique position in the public life of the Indian community in South Africa not because the enjoyed any special privileges but because he had that resourcefulness and tact and public spirit with which Parsis are specially endowed.
 And who am I to safeguard your  interests under swaraj? Proportio-nately, perhaps, out of a population of a hundred thousand your commu-nity had more jail going satyagrahis and khadi wearers than any other community, or at any rate the Hindus. I have never met with a Parsi anywhere in the world content with the lot of an under-dog and wherever you have gone you have made your way in the world. What need have you for any special guarantees or safeguards? Supposing you were given proportional representation on the legislatures and on the Cabinet, how many of you would be elected? But by your qualities of head and heart your men hold the foremost positions everywhere. I would therefore ask you to cast off
 
 
 such fears. You are called fire-worshippers keeping the fires eternally blazing.  I assure you that your sun is never going to set.libtech_329_footnote
 But having praised you let me now criticize you a little. How can you talk of your habit of wearing silk saris? You may as well say that you have been habituated to slavery. Sidhwa told me that 50 persons among you wore khadi, but that will not satisfy me. All of you should take a pledge to boycott foreign cloth. I congratulate you on not permitting a person who consumes liquor to be a member of the Congress. There are many among you who talk of giving up liquor, but how can they give up toddy, that tasty drink? Your mouth waters when its name is mentioned. On a sad occasion, it is toddy; and on a happy occasion, it is toddy; if it is cold, it is toddy; and if it is hot, it is toddy; this is all wrong. For one merit it may have, it has many defects. Hence the rule you have made is a good one. In accordance with it, all of you should join the Congress and do prohibition propaganda among the Parsis. Despite many threats, Mithubehn fights against the keepers of liquor-booths. A self-sacrificing Parsi like Durbari Sadhu has taken up his abode in Karadi and is doing this very work as his profession and, as a result has gone to jail. Even in remembrance of these servants, give up those poisonous drinks that dry up your blood. There are few communities which make charities to equal yours. But remember, you will not be able to maintain your ascendancy if you keep up your habit of taking liquor. The author of the Bhagavata has said that the Yadavas perished because of drinking. Remember another thing, that under swaraj the Head of State will not draw a salary of over Rs. 500; hence give up comforts and pleasures, else it will be difficult for Parsis to participate in the swaraj govern- ment.
 When I arrived here, the Sardar told me to rest and said that he would go and meet the Parsis. I replied that elsewhere I would ask him to deputize for me but here that would not do. Here I must place my statement of account before you, and ask for yours. Mine is of course an open book. On scrutiny, yours shows large debits against khadi and prohibition. Clear both of them and join the Congress in large numbers, so that you will always win victory, victory, victory.

370,,AFTER THE CONGRESS,"
    
 The Congress is finished. It was an object-lesson in quick orga- nization.Without the willing co-operation of nearly three thousand volunteers, men, women and childern, and the public, a city accommo- dating twenty thousand persons with all the conveniences could not have been brought into being in twentyfive days. A band of mer- chants undertook the kitchen work, ensuring efficiency, economy and good service. The women volunteers vied with the men in hard work often involving prolonged vigils. But the real credit belongs to the Lord Mayor of Karachi, the great Parsi humanitarian and philan- thropist, Jamshed Mehta. There are seasoned Congress workers who strove to make the organization so perfect. These I need not mention. The chief architectural feature of the Congress was its vast pandal which had no canopy but that of the blue sky. It became thus possible to ensure freedom from suffocating air and to provide ample accommodation. It saved enormous expenses. Instead of building the dais and galleries they were obtained by excavation as at the time of the Ahmedabad Congress. Another feature was the great khadi exhibition which beat all the previous ones in scientific arrangement. Although it was not part of a big show, it attracted vast crowds and was thoroughly successful from the financial standpoint.
 Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s address was perhaps the briefest of all presidential addresses. He was able to finish the proceedings in two days—not a bad record. A day saved means much saving of expense and more of the fagged out exertion of the over-worked volunteers.
 The Congress has endorsed the provisional settlement and issued in the clearest possible terms its delegation.
 Much has yet to happen before the delegation can take part in any conference that may be held. The duty of Congressmen is now clear. They must faithfully observe the terms of the provisional settlement. They must clear the atmosphere of every trace of violence and therefore first examine and purify themselves. The nation must achieve the boycott of foreign cloth and see that the gospel of the wheel spreads through every village of India. Before this can be accomplished, we must develop much greater love of the famishing millions than we have. The drunkard and the drug addict must be induced, not forced to give up their vice. These things require greater
 organization, greater co-operation among ourselves and a living faith in non-violence in thought, word and deed.  Whether it is taken up as  a policy or a creed, mind and body must act together while the policy or the creed is in operation.
 While the truce lasts we must not boycott British goods as such. Last but not least, one must achieve Hindu-Muslim unity. How this is to be done I know. The Hindus have to dare to trust them and let the Mussalmans and the Sikhs take what they want. This rids the nation of all communal taint. But of this hereafter.

371,,LET US REPENT,"
    
 But the hatred which was created and which has been shown in words and actions has been so intolerable that it must set one to think whether release of such mighty forces of hatred all round the country is advisable. From morning till late night one heard through talks, songs, through slogans and felt such mighty torrents of hatred that it was sickening to find such a degradation in large mass of people. I use the word ‘degradation’ with full responsibility. It appeared that speaking lies was a matter of full licence and liberty. To attack Government officers, police officers, men who disagreed,  for  something which was entirely untrue, for something which never happened, was a daily common event seen on the roads and everywhere.	More than words can express the cruelties and the injustice inflicted on the traders of British goods especially, and some other foreign goods were wide, intolerable and unbearable. To request a man not to deal in one article and to request another not to purchase an article is one thing, but to force a man by all possible means, by abusing him, by obstructing him, by making his life miserable   in  every  way  is  another thing,  and   there,   I   must   admit,   non-violence has  miserably  failed.	I am  certain  in  my  mind  that  the  hatred  created and the cruelties inflicted were far from non-violence  and  against  all principles and teachings of Mahatmaji. It was a common practice to obstruct and inflict with all kinds of tactics to make persons’ lives miserable whenever one disagreed with the general movement. In every province there were different types of activities and it appears that either one had to accept such dictation of somebody or one had  to  go  through  whatever  was  inflicted upon  him  by  any  small or  large  band  of  children, ladies   or   full   grownup men. According to them, to differ in any way was pro-British, pro-Government or unfaithfulness to the country, and today one  can	see clearly mental victims of these forces of hatred in several houses.
 But the danger is still greater. The taste of the blood—breaking laws— has been so attractive that one finds today this blessed satyagraha on the lips of everyone. As soon as you differ anywhere, be it in a school, in a house, in a group, in a circle of friends, in business, in an office, you find immediately threat of satyagraha pointed out to you at every time. Between employer and employee, landlord and tenant, parents and children, teachers and pupils, brothers and friends, everywhere this pointed bayonet of satyagraha seems to be ready for use.  To break laws and rules of society or of the State seems to be  so easy and handy. If a college professor suggests discipline, if a municipal officer recommends extra tax, if children are requested not to make noise, if hawkers are told to remove obstructions on roads, if changes or transfers are being arranged, if anything is done which does not suit anybody else, there is this dagger of satyagraha pointed at you.  Discrimination where to use and how  to use seems to have been entirely lost in the whole nation, and this is a danger signal for any nation or country. It is exactly like an aeroplane, which  is being used generally to fly from one country to another speedily and is also used for throwing bombs. It is exactly like matches, which give light, and are also used for burning a house. One can clearly see this danger signal in the satyagraha weapon also. Satyagraha can be used to advantage but it can also be misused to entire destruction. I feel that unless those who proclaim satyagraha as the best weapon to the wide world did feel their responsibility in this matter, they would soon find the tables turned not only  against themselves but on the whole country. If I can humbly suggest, I feel that some of  the  rigidly trained  leaders,  free  from  hated,  should  now  do  nothing else but pass some years of their lives in each province and each city and village to make people understand what real satyagraha or true non- violence means, how it can be brought into operation and when it ought to be brought into operation. I would humbly suggest a regular school of non- violence in every province, where high-minded souls who thoroughly understand this subject scientifically and religiously ought to be teachers to the students of policies who in return should be kept as all-time workers to go round the country, give this message and teach what it is in reality. This can be the only safeguard for saving the country in my opinion.
Jamshed Mehta, the Lord Mayor of Karachi, is a patriot of the
 purest type. But for his identification with the Congress to the extent he was capable of and but for his having placed at the disposal of the Reception Committee all the resources of his Municipality, the wonderful Congress city would not have been brought into being in the incredibly short space of twenty-five days. His sympathy for the satyagrahis when the campaign was  going  on  is  well   known.  Any
 criticism from one like him must therefore arrest attention. The quotation given above is an extract from Sjt. Jamshed Mehta’s article in a Karachi Anglo-Gujarati weekly called Parsi Sansar and Lokasevak. The criticism I have copied follows a glowing tribute paid by him to the satyagrahis who bore suffering without retaliation. But we have no reason to be puffed up with pride over certificates of merit. In so far as we observed non-violence we only did our duty.
 It is then the warning of this true friend of humanity and his country that we must treasure and profit by. What he has said of Karachi is likely to be true more or less of other places.
 Non-violence to be a potent force must begin with the mind. Non-violence of the mere body without the co-operation of the mind is non-violence of the weak or the cowardly and has therefore no potency. It is, as Jamshedji says truly, a degrading performance. If we bear malice and hatred in our bosoms and pretend not to retaliate, it must recoil upon us and lead to our destruction. For abstention from mere bodily non-violence not to be injurious, it is at least necessary not to entertain hatred if we cannot generate active love. All the songs and speeches betokening hatred must be taboo.
 It is equally true to say that indiscriminate resistance to authority must lead to lawlessness, unbridled licence and consequent self- destruction.
 If Jamshedji’s criticism was not more than balanced by his appreciation, that is to say,  if  the  sum  total  of real  non-violence  had not overbalanced the unreal, India  would  not have  gone forward as it has done. But better even than the Karachi  Lord  Mayor’s appreciation is the undoubted fact that the villagers have instinctively observed non-violence in  a  manner  never  before thought of. It is their non-violence that has conduced to the growth  of nationl consciousness.
 The mysterious effect of non-violence is not be measured by its visible effect. But we dare not rest content so long as the poison of hatred is allowed to permeate society. This struggle is a stupendous effort at conversion. We aim at nothing less than the conversion of the English. It can never be done by harbouring ill will and will pretending to follow non-violence. Let those therefore who want to follow the path of non-violence and yet harbour ill will retrace their steps and repent of the wrong they have done to themselves and country.

 Institutions like yours ought to be governed by strict rules and restrictions. The question put to me is whether workers who join the institution should take something for their livelihood or not. There are some who consider it below their dignity to take something and prefer to work in an honorary capacity. Some others say that even the nation’s servants must get a subsistence allowance or else we shall have to seek millionaires as servants. I must say that there is false pride in holding that one would serve without taking money; there is no shame in taking just a subsistence allowance; it is one’s duty. Mr. Gokhale began with Rs. 40 and never took more than Rs. 75. He lived all his life Rs. 75. He used to be a member of commissions, etc., and whatever he got by way of allowances, etc., he made over to the Servants of India Society. He used to consider it a part of his religion to take just enough for subsistence; how can we regard that as an error? It is desirable that even a millionaire’s son should not rely on his millions but should donate his property to such an institution and then like other workers draw as much as is required for his livlihood.
 The other point is whether such institutions ought to be bound by rules. A  man without a  pledge is like a  ship  without  a  rudder. I am not convinced by the argument that here one cannot manage without a hundred rupees. The Sindhis may well believe that they cannot manage with less, but my experience tells me that one can manage without difficulty on a much smaller amount. The institutions of Lalaji and Gokhaleji are well because of their names, but there are may other institutions which function in face of difficulties and restrictions and which have people who draw barely Rs. 25 to Rs. 30. Not more than Rs. 15 to Rs. 20 are ever drawn in Orissa. Hence we should lay down our requirements taking into consideration our country’s condition.
 
 Till today we worked in a wrong way—we did all our work in cities and formulated all our schemes keeping cities in view. We stayed away from village folk, hence they have so far regarded their privations as the result of divine wrath and could think of no other causes. Institutions of public service should be located among the people, be partners of their joys and sorrows and render service by spreading knowledge among them.

374,,374. UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY,"
A well-known merchant of Bombay writes :libtech_335_footnote
 If there is any truth in this, the traders referred to should think over it. This much is certain :
 The 	import of 	foreign cloth into India 	will certainly cease.  Permission 	will never be granted 	to sell 	the stock 	still lying with 	them.  This 	boycott will 	succeed eventually 	through khadi alone. 	Even if 	it can be 	achieved without khadi, 	it will 	not serve 	the cause 	of crores 	of people. 	The special 	value of this 	boycott lies 	in its 	being beneficial 	to the latter.  Although 	the boycott 	of foreign 	cloth is 	bound to 	have political consequences, it was not 	conceived with 	a view to 	these consequences. When 	it is complete, 	the economic 	condition of crores 	of poor 	people will immediately 	improve and an 	unemployed nation 	will be 	busy at 	work. For 	crores of 	people living in 	villages, this 	is swaraj. They cannot derive any greater benefit than this from swaraj. 
 The role of picketing will become clearer once this is under- stood. The above letter indicates that the majority of traders are not convinced even after a struggle of twelve months. They are eager at any cost to carry on the trade in foreign cloth. Farmers have been ruined, but despite this, these traders are not prepared to carry on an innocuous business in place of their sinful one. As this is the prevai- ling situation, picketing should be taken up. But it should be pure, i.e., non-violent. The traders may laugh today, may abuse women, may sell their goods at places where there is no picketing; despite all this, women have got a unique opportu-nity. I have already shown elsewhere while discussing Shri Jamshed Mehta’s article that our picketing   was  not   free   from   blame.libtech_336_footnotelibtech_337_footnoteBoycott   which   is   forcibly imposed can never succeed. Hence when we have got this opportunity those women who have realized the necessity of boycott and, in addi- tion, have also realized that picketing should be wholly peace-ful, should try and evolve a  technique  of  peaceful  picketing. If  they do not see results, they should not accept defeat. As excitement
 
 
 subsides, they should not be disappointed if some women who love excitement leave the ranks. They should carry on their work with steadfast faith and determination.

 [April 6, 1931]libtech_338_footnote
 I see that much misrepresentation is going on with reference to my attitude on the Hindu-Muslim question. My own personal view is quite clear. It is that of full surrender to any unanimously expressed wish of the Mussalmans and the Sikhs. I would like the Hindus to see the beauty of the solution. It can come only out of consciousness of moral strength. It follows that before I can cultivate Hindu opinion on a particular formula, I must have that formula. That is not forthcoming. That which was given to the Congress deputation at the Muslim Parties’meeting on the 4th instant was not a unanimous minimum. For one thing I had the warning of the Nationalist Muslims not to accept anything that did not proceed on the principle of joint electorates based on adult suffrage. Some of the Nationalists are my oldest co-workers to whom Maulana Shaukat Ali gave certificates for honesty, bravery and true love of Islam and who have proved the truth of the Maulana’s certificates. When they tell me that separate electo- rates are bad for Mussalmans, I must listen to them. They further claim that the Mussalman masses do not want separate electorates. Be that as it may, I cannot identify myself with any solution which is frankly based on communalism and yet has not what may be called unanimous support of the community concerned. A solution that is admittedly defective and antinational must, to be acceptable, have the merit at least of almost unanimous support from those affected by it.
 I am unable to understand the anger that is being shown against those who do not at once subscribe to the separate electorate idea. There is no doubt that it is possible for any large body of opinion to stop the country’s march towards swaraj. Swaraj based on non- violence cannot be obtained if it is resisted by even a respectable minority. It is wrong to say suggest that under swaraj there will be majority rule. In true swaraj there can only be the rule of justice. In spite of the great awakening that has taken place, I for one would be content to wait if the accredited leaders of the Mussalmans or the Sikhs would oppose the attainment of a swaraj constitution. The fight
 
 
 for swaraj once begun can only end when the constitution which is its visible symbol is framed and passed. The next phase of the struggle in the absence of a communal solution may, therefore, assume a different form, the goal still remaining the same.
 Members of the All-India Muslim Conference have made angry references to the occurrences at Cawnpore, Benares, Mirzapur, Agra and other places. But will anger solve the question? I find highly exaggerated statements being made. Some of them are without foun- dation. If the goal of these friends is freedom for Hindus, Mussalmans and all others for whom India is their home, they will not allow themselves to be deflected such events from the path of justice. I join them in detesting the horrors perpetrated in these places. I  am  ashamed of them, whether perpetrated by Hindus or Mussalmans. Greater shame overtakes me when I find Hindus perpetrating but- chery. But we have no data as yet for distributing blame. I do not believe in retaliation. For me as a Hindu, therefore, whether as aggre- ssors or defenders, those who resorted to murders, arson and unna- mable cruelties are undoubtedly to blame and call for the greatest condemnation. But I would implore everyone to avoid the language of anger and hatred for, without doing any good to anybody, it can only add fuel to the fire that has hardly yet died out.

		INDUSTRY,  DELHIlibtech_339_footnote","
    
 April 7, 1931
 I hope the English friends here will forgive me for addressing you in the national language. I recall on this occasion the War Confe- rence in Delhi which was held in this very hall in 1918 and in which after some discussion with the Viceroy I consented to participate. But when I con-sented to do so I requested the Viceroy to permit me to address the Confe-rence in Hindi or Hindustani.libtech_340_footnotelibtech_341_footnoteI knew there was no need to ask for this permission, but courtesy required that I should do so, lest my speaking in Hindi should shock the Viceroy. In this very same hall today I propose to follow the same practice.  And I would
 
 suggest to you, members of the Federation, that it is your duty to carry on your proceedings in the national language, looking to the fact that the members of the Federation are all Indians and that you are allowing yourselves to be influenced by the present national spirit. Whilst I was listening  to  the  President’slibtech_342_footnotelibtech_343_footnoteadd-ress  with  attention,  I wondered whether in speaking in a foreign language he would suc- ceed in making on you and on me the impression that he desired. In no other country, dependent or independent, was such an anomaly to be met with. In South Africa, which is a thinly populated country, there has been a long struggle for precedence between English and Taal (a dialect of Dutch) with the result that the English colonists had to yield to the brave Dutch in recognizing Taal  as  the  official language on the same footing as English.
 Your President has dwelt at length on the insistence of the Englishmen that in any constitution which may be granted to India the rights of Englishmen, especially of the English commercial and mercantile firms in India, should be safeguarded. The Congress has considered this question carefully, and I should like to state its  position. It has been said that Indian swaraj will be the rule of the majority community, i.e., the Hindus. There could not be a greater mistake than that. If it were to be true, I for one would refuse to call it swaraj and would fight it with all the strength at my command, for to me Hind Swaraj is the rule of all the people, is the rule of justice. Whether under that rule the ministers were Hindus or Mussalmans or Sikhs, and whether the legislatured were exclusively filled by the Hindus or Mussalmans or any other community, they would have to do even-handed justice. And just as no community in India need have any fear of swaraj being monopolize by any other, even so the English should have no fear. The question of safeguards should not arise at all. Swaraj would be real swaraj only when there would be no occasion for safeguarding any such rights.
 How is it that the insistence on equal rights by Europeans comes to us with a shock of surprise? How is it that it does not strike us as natural and legitimate? The answer puts me in mind of an incident in South Africa. You know that I fought General Smuts in South Africa for a number of years. With reference to the question of race prejudice and colour prejudice there he once told me a story which impressed me very much. He said :
 
 When I was about the same time as you studying in England, I had no race prejudice or colour prejudice against your people. In fact if we had known each other we should have lived as friends or brothers. Why is it then that now we have become rivals, that we have conflicting interests? It is not colour preju-dice or race prejudice, though some of our people do ignorantly talk in those terms, but there is one thing which I want you to recognize. It is this. I may have no racial legislation, but how will you solve the difficulty about the fundamental difference between our cultures? Let alone the question of superiority, there is no doubt but that your  civilization is different from ours. Ours must not be overwhelmed by yours. That is why we have to go in for legislation which must in effect put disabilities on you.
 I understood what he said and recognized that we could not have any other standard there. I also appreciated the fear of being swamped in these days of swift communications. If, therefore, we wanted to live in South Africa, I said to myself, we must adopt their standard of life, so long as it was not against morality.
 Let us try to understand the genesis of this talk of equal rights in the light of what I have said. With all deference I would tell the Englishmen that at the back of their insistence is their insistence on living their standard and civilization. There is a wide gulf between our way of life and that of the Viceroy however good he may be. Our people, when they go abroad, adopt the manners and customs of those countries, but shed them as soon as they come back home, and if they retain them, they become strangers. It is a mercy that the Western way of life has not yet taken deep root in our country. But the fear at the back of the Indian’s mind is lest he should be swamped by the onrush of Western civilization. In this problem I invite the help of all Englishmen who, if they choose to stay here, must live in conformity with our way of life and as the servants of our country. The same cause has been at the root of the clash between the Chinese and the Europeans and the Chinese and the Americans. I want our English friends to understand what I am saying. The whole trouble arises out of the Englishman’s insistence on living according to his Western way of life and according to Western standards. I am quite aware that our civilization has its blemishes,—untouchability is an indelible stain on Hinduism and I have called it Satanic,—but I do not want to give Hinduism up, for the simple reason that I was born and bred in it. I
 would purge it of its blemishes. If then we contemplate examining so- called vested rights in the light of India’s interest, it is not because of racial prejudice but because of vital neces-sity. Their vested rights may not smother nascent indigenous enterprise.
 Your President has paid a tribute to the Congress, and suggested, that the Congress should confer with commercial experts in economic matters. I welcome the suggestion. The Congress would always be glad of your advice and help. I may tell you that the Congress does not belong to any particular group of men; it belongs to all, but the protection of the poor peasantry, which forms the bulk of the population, must be its primary interest. The Congress must, therefore, truly represent the poor. But that does not mean that all other classes—the middle classes, the capitalist or zamindar—must go under. All that it aims at is that all other classes must subserve the interest of the poor. The Congress stands for the industrial prosperity and progress of India. The industrial classes are slowly coming within the Congress fold. During the past year they rendered it help for which we cannot be too grateful. In fact your invitation to me to address you is not due to my name, but because I am humble servant of the Congress and representative of Daridranarayana. I  cannot forget the services rendered by the commercial classes, but I want you to go a step further. I want you to make the Congress your own and we would willingly surrender the reins to you. The work can be better done by you. But if you decide to assume the reins, you can do so only on one condition. You should regard yourselves as trustees and servants of the poor. Your commerce must be  regulated for  the benefit of the toiling millions, or as Pandit Malaviya would put it, you must be satisfied with earning the ‘pure cowrie’, i.e., an honest penny. I do not for a moment believe that commercial prosperity is incom- patible with strict honesty. I know business men who are absolutely honest and scrupulous in their dealings. It is thus easily open to you to take charge of the Congress. You know that there is no constitution more democratic than the Congress constitution, it has worked for ten years without a hitch. It is based practically on adult suffrage.
 If we want your co-operation in our task, I want that of the Englishmen too. I want to remind them of the services rendered to the Congress in the past by distinguished Englishmen and Englishwomen like Hume, Yule, Wedderburn and Dr. Besant In fact the Congress owes its birth to the genius of a large-hearted Englishmen. Ant I want
 English-man now to join us in our work of serving the poor. It is entirely a matter of good-will, a matter  of  the  heart.  Give  your  heart to the poor of India.
In conclusion, I repeat the Congress seeks to represent all. Our
 nationalism can be no peril to other nations, in as much as we will exploit none just as we will allow none to exploit us. Through swaraj we should serve the whole world. In this task I invite your greater co- operation so that civil disobedience may not have to be  resumed. With your material and intellectul co-operation heartily rendered, our demand for swaraj would be absolutely irresistible.

  	the only solution, communal or national. The moment you realize that 	we do not want a third power to arbitrate for us, we will for the 	moment agree to surrender everything—not because it is the ideal 	solution or a just solution but because it is the only expedient. 	And why do you fear willing surrender to a community as such? Take 	my attitude on the National Flag question. The flag is my own 	personal creation. It has been before the country for ten years, a 	lot  of sentiment has gathered round it, much sacrifice and 	suffering has been gone through to keep it flying. Do you think it 	is a pleasure to me to agree to its being altered? But I know that 	you are dissatisfied and if only to please your community I agreed 	to have a Committee about the flag. In the same way we might be 	called upon to do many things to satisfy a particular community.  But 	this did not seem to carry conviction.  	Well, then I suggest that you should meet the nationalist  Muslims, 	discuss the situation with them and arrive at a solution which 	satisfies them and you and place it before the country.  Young 	India, 23-4-1931         April 	8, 1931  In 	a joint 	replylibtech_346_footnotein 	Hindi Mahatmaji, 	though ill, 	in a 	clear and 	low voice said 	that the piece of 	cloth tied 	round his 	head showed that 	he was 	not keeping well. 	A  few 	months ago 	he  was 	a  prisoner 	of  the 	Government but 	today he 	 was a 	prisoner of 	the people. 	Since he 	had arrived 	in the 	morning the 	crowd had so be- 	sieged the 	bungalow that he 	had not been 	able to go out 	once and, therefore, 	begged the 	forgiveness of 	the Municipality 	for not being 	able to 	receive their address at 	Town Hall. The 	address had 	referred to 	communal question. They 	were all faced with 	the question of 	this communal 	settlement. He 	was trying 	his best to 	find a 	solution that 	would satisfy all 	parties. It 	was not the work of 	one man or 	of the Mahatma 	alone. If they 	could all make 	up their 	minds that they would not 	 be afraid 	 of each  other 	 and  would  not 	 quarrel  with  each  	other,  if 	 they  really 	 wanted  to live 	together at 	peace with 	each other, the 	matter could be 	settled without much 	difficulty. It 	was for them 	to give 	the lead. 	 What Amritsar would 	do today, 	 the  rest 	of Punjab would do tomorrow and subsequently the whole of India 	would do the    
 same. If what they had said in their address fully proceeded from their hearts he hoped they would prove their sincerity by living up to their professions.
 Replying to the address of the Congress Committee, Mahatmaji said the name of the Congress had become great in the country. The eyes of the whole world had been fixed towards the Congress. By the Gandhi-Irwin agreement they had not as yet attained swaraj. He did not know how far or near it was. But let there be no mistake. The Congress had declared purna swaraj, i.e., complete independence as its immediate goal, and they dared not rest till it was reached. Its early attainment depended on the nation’s capacity to live up to the ideal of absolute non-violence. In proportion they had failed to do so, their progress towards it had been hindered. He did not want the nation to adopt the path of non-violence out of weakness. The non-violence which he wanted the nation to follow was really the weapon of the strong. The Congress was pledged to the creed of non-violence.
 Concluding, Mahatmaji said he was feeling weak and therefore couldn’t say more. He thanked both the Committees for their addresses. Whatever work they were doing in India, said Mahatmaji, if they all did with united strength, they would surely win swaraj. To him swaraj meant insaf raj or rule of justice.
 Mahatma Gandhi then once more stood on the balcony and gave darshan to the crowd below. They again lustily cheered. him.

 "
381,,OTHER POLITICAL PRISONERS,"
    
 There has been much heart-burning over the fact that the release of all political prisoners whether convicted of violence or otherwise should not have been made a condition of the settlement. This was clearly impossible in the sense that the demand would not have been just or wise. It could not be made as a condition for suspending civil disobedience. It could be made as a condition in a final settlement. Some people have thoughtlessly argued that I would not demand the release of prisoners convicted of violence because of my non-  violence. The fact is that my non-violence to be  worth  anything  would have made the demand obligatory on me, had it been otherwise just in my estimation. But what was not possible for me to do in
 
 connection with the settlement, I had no hesitation in recommending the Congress to do. The Congress resolution in the matter is publi shed elsewhere. It is,  I  admit,  sweeping  in  character  and  includes all possbile prisoners or persons under restraint. It includes those who being out of India are prohibited from re-entering, and it in cludes the Punjab Martial Law prisoners who have been rotting in the jails since 1915libtech_347_footnotelibtech_348_footnoteand are all old men by this time.  It includes also over 400 detenus of Bengal and Punjab against whom no crime has been proved. They were arbitraily arrested and are as arbitrarily detained. It includes also the Meerut undertrial prisoners whose long-drawn-out trial is a perfect scandal. Sjt. Nariman has been appointed to make an exhaustive list of all these prisoners. It will be possible to take some step under the resolution as soon as the list is made. I hope, therefore, that all concerned will help Sjt. Nariman so as to enable  him  to prepare the list at the earliest possible time.
 Of course the Government need not even wait for the list. I admit that from their standpoint all the prisoners will not stand on the same footing. Let them begin by releasing without being asked those at least whose case, I shall hope to show through these pages, is un- answerable. A strong Government never errs when it releases prisoners before the expiry of their sentences, for it ever possesses the power to rearrest them should they commit crimes. And political  crime becomes rare when there is no political injustice.

 GANESH SHANKAR VIDYARTHI
 The death of Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi was one to be envied by us all. His blood is the cement that will ultimately bind the two communities. No pact will bind our hearts. But heroism such as Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi showed is bound in the end to melt the stoniest hearts, melt them into one. The poison has however gone so deep that the blood even of a man so great, so self-sacrificing and so utterly brave as Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi may today not be enough to wash us of it. Let this noble example stimulate us all to similar effort should the occasion arise again. I tender to the bereaved widow and her children not my condolences but my congratulations for having deserved Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi. He is not dead. He lives today far more truly than when we saw him in the body and knew him not.
 HINDI OR HINDUSTANI
 It is becoming increasingly difficult year afrer year to conduct the Congress proceedings or the A.I.C.C.  proceedings  in  English. The majority in the A.I.C.C. do not follow English as well as they can Hindustani. And of those that do, the vast majority demand Hindi. At the open session Sardar Vallabhbhai had difficulty in obtaining a hearing for English speakers. For the next year the people from the South have promised to learn Hindi enough to be able to talk and follow the proceedings in Hindustani. If they will give three hours per day for three months most of them will have no difficulty in gaining a passable knowledge of the language. I hope the friends from the South and Bengal will make the necessary effort and save the nation’s time. At any rate I propose to keep the members to their promise and not heed the demand for English if it is made in spite of the promise not to make it.

  "
383,,SOLE DELEGATE,"
    
 The appointment by the Working Committee of me as the sole delegate to any conference to which the  Congress  delegation  is desired by the Government was made after over two hours’ exhaustive discussion. The idea behind it was that what was to be presented was not several points of view but only the Congress view. The Congress view was set forth in the mandate. What was not in the mandate was to be covered either by a letter of instructions from the Working Committee or instructions received from time to time. Either therefore the whole Working Committee should be appointed or only one member holding its power of attorney. The latter arrangement thus easily became the best, most efficacious and most economical  in every sense of the word. For not only would money be saved but energy. What is more, Congress could not afford to keep away from the country without sufficient cause its best workers for any length of time. It is the implicit belief of Congressmen that in the end it will not be work at the Conference that will bring swaraj; it can only be work in India that can do it. Not the ability of the delegation will tell at the Conference but the power behind it. It was further thought that the Congress delegation was not designed to enter into or examine details but to discuss and examine principle and their application. And whether at the end of the Conference it was to be peace or war, every available hand was needed in the country. We want all our men and women in the country to avoid war. For the best way to ensure peace is to push up the constructive programme and to implement the conditions of the provisional settlement. Moreover the reader should know that the people directly affected by the settlement are not at all satisfied with the way in which the agents of the Government are carrying out its conditions. Constant vigilance on the spot is therefore necessary. From every point of view, therefore, the appointement of sole delegation was not only desirable but almost necessary.
 But this appointment enchances my responsibility a thousand fold. My task, however, becomes light with the thought that I have but to carry out the instructions of my principals. For the rest I have to seek God’s infalliable guidance and ‘be careful for nothing’. And
 then who knows that if and when the time comes, the way will be open for me to attend the Conference?

 ON WAY TO AHMEDABAD,
 April 9, 1931
 DEAR MR. EMERSON,
 I thank you for your letter of 2nd instant, which shall receive immediate attention.
 Though I am still feverish and travelling, I dare not delay writing to you on the matter mentioned in your letter of 31st Marchlibtech_349_footnoteand discussedlibtech_350_footnotelibtech_351_footnotebetwen us on 6th instant, when we met at your house. The only way I can account for the impression left on H. E. the Viceroy and later on you, is that we have been thinking at cross purposes. I could never surrender the primary function of the Con- gress, viz., to speak for and represent the peasantry. The Congress, as I told you, is predominantly a peasants’ and workers’ organization. The Congress could not possibly implement the terms of the settle- ment if the local authorities refused to recognize and treat with sym- pathy the advances of the Congress when speaking for the peasantry. The difficulties you mentioned about U.P., I am con-vinced, could all have been solved if the local authorities had sent for the Congress officials in their respective districts. Many of the Congress officials are well known to them. I suggest that any other attitude would be contrary to the spirit of the settlement, and must defeat the very  purpose we both have in view. It would be wrong to accuse the Con- gress of breach of the settlement if the local autho-rities by ignoring local Congressmen render it impossible for them to implement it. After all the terms have to be carried out through the people and the Congressmen must fail if they could not interpret the people’s wishes and woes to the authorities.
 It is possible that the Congress officials may err as the Govern- ment officials may. These errors can be easily rectified. But the Con-
 
 
 gress may not, even on that account, be looked upon with suspicion or distust whilst the settlement lasts.
 After my investigation of the complaints received by you about Gujarat and after my interviews with Mr. Garrettlibtech_352_footnoteand then His Excell- ency the Governor of Bombay I shall be able to give the illustrations of the application of the principle I have endeavoured to set forth.
 Lastly I hardly need to give you my assurance that I shall strain every nerve to see that the terms of the settlement are carried out by the Congress so far as it is humanly possible.
My movement is.	libtech_353_footnote

387,"April 11, 1931","SPEECH AT CONVOCATION, GUJARAT VIDYAPITH, AHMEDABADlibtech_355_footnote","
    
 April 11, 1931 My blessings were already bestowed on you, that is, on the snatakaslibtech_356_footnote, and the gramdikshitslibtech_357_footnotewhen  I  read out the  address.  But
my inward blessings are to be given now. I hope you will take pride in
 the certificates you have received and will not underrate yourselves. I also hope that you will adhere to the pledge that you have just taken. It is easy to repeat a vow that is either written or printed. To grasp it fully and make up one’s mind to act upon it is difficult. I also expect that you will not utter a single thought less or inadvertent word about the Vidyapith or other current national activities. I consider that to be the foundation of progress. The students must have this foundation; otherwise I have no doubt the superstructure will remain weak. Here a distinction has been made between the snatakas and the gramdikshits and that is right. If you want to preserve truth, you cannot do without distinguishing between the two. The curriculum for the snatakas is different and they have to put in more years. Because of that I hope the village dikshits will not think less of themselves than the snatakas. Theirs is no small task.  I should not be surprised if they beat the latter
 
 by their record of work. I for one would say that there is more need for these dikshits than these snatakas for since the inception of the Vidyapith I have been repeating that through it we must reach the village. The snatakas’ ambition should also be to qualify themselves for service in the villages. We have not yet fully realized how the Vidyapith has served the nation.
 I am delighted beyond measure to know of the part you have played in the great struggle. The Bihar Vidyapith and Kashi Vidya- pith also distinguished themselves in a like manner. When the history of the fight comes to be written, the contribution of our Vidyapiths to the struggle will occupy a large space in it. Even the world will be proud of your glorious record. When in jail I read something about the students and teachers of the Vidyapith, I naturally drew a compari- son between Govern-ment educational institutions and the national ones, and I felt that our programme for boycott of Government educational institutions had more than justified itself. When I say this,  I do not lose sight of the fact that Government schools and colleges are still full of students. There is also the more painful fact  that students are so eager to go to those institutions that they do not hesi- tate to sign the most abject apologies and to pay fines to get admission to them. I have known circulars by heads or directors of the educational department that those who may have directy or indirectly taken part in the struggle or who may have gone to jail may not be readmitted until after the previous sanction of these heads. What is one to say of those students and of those directors of education? I wonder if you know anything about the Government’s attitude with regard to the Hindu University. It would have lost its grant, but for the fearlessness and the readiness for sacrifice of Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviyaji. But even if the grant had been forfeited, Malaviyaji would not have shed a single tear. He was determined that the University should rather go without the grant than that any teacher or student who served the country be penalized for his service.
 Let the proud record of the Vidyapith fill the snatakas and dikshits with pride that they are the alumni of no less an institution than the Gujarat Vidyapith. Let them not feel that they had joind the institution through sheer helplessness. Let them not be depressed by the thought that they are a handful. Though a handful they are like the ocean, and though the students of Government institutions resem- ble by their numbers the ocean, they are as unreal as mirage. For the education that they receive and the life they are taught to live cannot
 give them the vital energy to win swaraj, whereas an institution like the Vidyapith can do so in a large measure as one can see from the last year’s record. Let those who have helped to maintain the Vidyapith realize that their money has been spent to noble purpose and that it has come back to them with compound interest. Let them study the Registrar’s report and see if any institution in India can boast of a prouder record. I invite their attention to Kakasaheb’s appeal for funds and trust that the money needed will be paid up automatically.
 But that led him to the question of economy in national expenditure and the duty of those who would have to run the swaraj Government in future.
 I want you to study the Vidyapith accounts. You will see that strict economy has been maintained. I do not think anyone can beat me in my passion for guarding and expending public money like a miser. The reason is obvious. Public money belongs to the poor public of India than whom there is none poorer on earth. That is why  I asked the Sardar to make drastic cuts in the next year’s budget for Gujarat. I am hoping that the provisional settlement may lead on to permanent peace, and I shall leave no stone unturned to achieve it. But man is often powerless before Nature. I at any rate cannot strive with Nature, and Nature seems for the time being to be against us. And if God wills that there should be no peace, you may be sure that the next struggle will be fiercer than the last and will engulf us all. And it may have to be fought without any resources. Gujarat may be always ready to contribute funds, but even the resources of Gujarat are not inexhaustible. Let us therefore think twice before we expend a pie and curtail our expenditure in all directions. I have often wondered where we get all our cars from, and whether we need them really. I know I often use motor-car but let no one follow my bad example. Let the snataka and the dikshit of the Vidyapith make a point of  going out to the villages on foot whenever possible. Let us be worthy of swaraj when it comes. Let us remember that we have 20 points now instead of 11  which  contain  the  quintessence  of  swaraj, and  let me tell you that it was not I who fixed the maximum salary of the Swaraj Viceroy at Rs. 500 but Pandit Jawaharlal. He has given his thought to the problem and he has deliberately fixed that amount. And if that is to be salary of the Viceroy, what is to be the remune- ration of an ordinary worker? Let us keep that ideal in the mind and cut our coat according to our cloth. The Government of today collects taxes by force and recovers revenue at the point of the bayonet. In swaraj we shall not be able to do so, we will have numerous Garhwalis
 to refuse to use arms against their brethren. Let us therefore order our affairs in the terms of the poor of the land. Let us not go to sleep, now that there is a provisional settlement. We have to be more wakeful, more cautious, more careful and let us be ready to account for every pie that we receive from the public.
 It is my duty to ask you to make real sacrifices.  May the snatakas and gramdikshits fare well and may God grant them the strength to observe the pledge they have taken.

 "
388,,THE NATIONAL WEEK,"
    
 It may be said that I had forgotten the National Week this time, or you may say that ever since I came out of Yeravda Prison, it has been one unbroken National Week for me. Under pressure of continu-ous work which keeps coming up, I become oblivious of the day of the week, the date, whether according to the Engligh calendar or the Indian one. I was not even aware of the single meal that I was to take on the 6th. Luckily, of late owing to travelling and lack of sleep, I eat practically only one meal a day, hence it may be said that I unknowingly observed the 6th.
 I know that what happened to me also happended to others, as I am not aware of anyone in the camp having recalled this fact.  If even  a single person had thought of it. I would have known it.  The truth  of the matter is that the awakening of the past twelve months has made us forget such special days like the National Week. Prior to this, we pretended to be active during the National Week, thus making some amends for our year-long idleness. That idleness is no longer there and the impatience to win swaraj has kept many of us busy in the final bid for it.
 This is as it should be. But it may be said that our effort is,   to a small or large extent, blind. We would have reached our destina- tion long ago if our effort were equally matched by knowledge and discretion. Although there is enthusiasm, it tosses us hither and thither for want of a lighthouse in the form of discretion. If that were not so, the unfortunate incidents which took place in Kanpur, Benares, Agra, Mirzapur and other places would not have occurred. Both Hindus and Muslims lost their sanity. Both descended to a level lower than even that of beasts. These are no signs of eagerness on our part to win swaraj.Those Hindus who used to blame the Muslims started indulging
 in the very acts which they had condemned.Our peacefulness truned out to be merely verbal. Those who have learnt the lesson of peace know that a peaceful attitude has to be maintained not only towards the British, but also amongst oursevles. However, I hope to write more on this subject when I find time to do so.
 What applies to peace also applies to khadi. I have regarded khadi as the very embodiment of peace, that is, non-violene. For, khadi implies pure love towards the poor, it implies unalloyed co- operation with them. Although those who give alms to the starving may be said to be compassionate, their co-operation with the poor is not untained; they put the latter under an obligation and so regard them as inferior to themselves. Those who wear khadi made by the hallowed hands of the poor—whether it be fine or coarse, expensive or otherwise—become their comrades and always help them to become industrious as also preserve their self-respect. The propa- ganda for khadi becomes an important activity druing the National Week.
 And so too with untouchability. At the Jallianwala Bagh, the blood of all was shed together. There was no distinction there between the “touchables” and untouchables, between the Hindus, the Muslims and the Sikhs. A further attempt is also made during the National Week to make people forget these differences. In other words, this Week is celebrated for the purpose of self-purification. This article should be in the hands of the reader on the 12th instant, so that two days of the Week would still remain. Every reader who has not undergone these three kinds of purification should wake up and make his contribution to the best of his ability.

389,,VIDYAPITH’S APPEAL FOR FUNDS,"
    
 I draw the attention of readers to the Vidyapith’s annual appeal for funds. The contribution made by the national Vidyapiths in the last struggle cannot be regarded as negligible. If the part played by the professors and students—both men and women—is taken into account, it is not an exaggeration to say that the Vidyapiths have justified their existence and have given adequate return for the money spent on them. I have had personal experience of  the  services rendered by the professors—both men and women—of the Gujarat Vidyapith. It is my hope that the Rs. 40,000 appealed for will soon be forthcoming. It should not at all be necessary for the Principal or the professors to go from door to door. It would do credit to both the Vidyapith and the people and a double purpose would be served if the Vidyapith gives an annual account of its services and  the  public, witout any effort, meet its demands for the coming year.

390,,MY NOTES,"
    
 THOUGHTLESS ARGUMENTS
 The following extractlibtech_358_footnoteis from a letter written by a resident of Ahmedabad who has given his name and address.
 There is a good deal of thoughtlessness in this argument. I do not harm the cause of the spinning-wheel when I stay at a  mill- owner’s place. Though I love the spinning-wheel, I bear no ill will towards mill-owners. I started propaganda for the spinning-wheel twelve years ago and my association with the mill-owners also dates back to the same time. This is not the first time that I have stayed with these people.
 A satyagrahi bears no ill will towards anyone. He accom plishes his task through love. Even while staying with the mill- owners, I make them render some service to the cause of khadi. I take funds also from them for khadi. I have such friends among the mill-owners
 
 
 who, along with their families, habitually wear khadi. This is no outward show on their part, but it indicates their faith in khadi.
At present, the textile mills are doing no harm to khadi as the
 entire country has not become khadi-minded. The mill-owners would readily given up the textile mills if the entire country took to khadi and the spinning-wheel plied in every home. I believe they would not be against khadi even for a moment. I also believe that, if they are depraved enough to oppose it, their attempt to do so would prove futile. It is almost impossible to prevent the setting up of new textile mills so long as there are innumerable people who wear mill-made cloth. The mills should be prevented from competing with khadi. This has been done to some extent and attempts are being made to stop the mills’ competition altogether. Hence the duty of the citizens of Ahmedabad and others is to carry on propaganda for khadi and to spread spinning far and wide. This task cannot be accomplished by bearing ill will towards the mill-owners or by severing my connection with them.
 FOREIGN-CLOTH DEALERS
 It is a matter of sorrow that foreign-cloth dealers do not still seem to be able to resist temptation. They should realize that foreign cloth—whether English, Japanese or any other—will no more be consumed in India. The opposition to it is increasing and not decreas- ing and it will keep on gaining in tempo. The golden remedy for the hunger of crores of people lies hidden in giving up foreign cloth. In order to make a success of this renunciation, some have laid down their lives, thousands have suffered lathi-blows, thousands have cour- ted imprisonment. Do not the foreign-cloth merchants regard this as an adequate sacrifice? As compared to he loss  suffered by  the country, these people will find that they have no right to bemoan their own loss. The latter means their giving up a portion of the income which they have gained by carrying on an immoral trade for many years, and their being satisfied with perhaps a smaller income  in future. Why do they not exchange their business for that of khadi? The art, interest and purity in the khadi trade are not there in the trade in foreign cloth. As the former is something new, there is scope in it for the full use of one’s intelligence and courage. Both self-interest and benevolence are subsumed in it. Hence if it is carried on with integrity, it will be regarded as an untainted form of business.
 But the subject-matter of this article is not trade in khadi, but the abandonment of trade in foreign cloth.  After  giving  up  the  latter, merchants may trade in anything else they like. They should, however, shun foreign cloth looking upon it is sinful.

394,"April 	13, 1931",LETTER TO J. H. GARRETT,"
           DEAR 	MR. GARRETT,    AHMEDABAD April 	13, 1931 
  	Here is the promised statement about the new Mukhis or Patels whom 	we regard as undesirable with a summary of the evidence that can be 	led against them. Babar 	Chatur Patel, Saijpur, Borsad Taluk :  	He armed the outlaw Babar Deva with a rifle and was convicted and 	sentenced to two years’ imprisonment but was later released by the 	Sessions Court. He has about 60 to 70 decrees against him. After his 	appointment, four houses belonging to the old Mukhi and two to other 	neighbours were burnt. Lahri 	Mangabhai, Vasna, Borsad Taluk :  	He was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment three years ago. This 	Mukhi got Jhaver Gaba appointed as Rakhalibtech_362_footnotelibtech_363_footnote, although he knew that the latter was five times 	convicted. In his own street, three houses of Hijratis were burnt. 	He would not move to help put out the fire. Mahomedkhan 	Nachhekhan, Porda, Borsad Taluk :  	He has no stake in the village. He abducted a potter’s wife and 	ultimately ‘sold’ her elsewhere. He similarly abducted a Dhed’s 	wife. He is heavily in debt and there are warrants of arrest against 	him in the Gaekwad’s territory. Mirsab 	Majmudin, Davalpura, Borsad Taluk :  	He was dismissed by the Baroda State for bribery. He does not belong 	to the village. Jama 	Gaga, Palaj, Borsad Taluk :  	He has been thrice convicted. Jhaver Vaja, Ras, Borsad Taluk : He 	has been imprisoned for two months for receiving stolen  	property. During his incumbency the crops of Ras were looted.  His  	is a temporary appointment. He applied on the 11th instant for 	perma-nency.    
 Sandasar :
 The Mukhi is a drunkard. Anand and Boriavi :
 These Mukhis had distress warrants against them, but these were stopped at the instance of the Collector.
Jehangirji Cawasji, Varad Bardoli :
 The affidavits in any possession show that he has a force of 100 Dublas whom he uses for terrorizing the people, he has been taking bribes, he has a canteen, he severely assaulted a teacher who was a temperance preacher, and was found guilty by a Board of Arbitrators before whom he publicly apologized.
Abumia, Buhari, Bardoli :
 He was convicted for theft and sentenced to three months’ imprisonment.
 Umarmia, (1) Shaku, (2) Ambada, Jalalpur Taluk : He was convicted for one and a half years.
Dayalji Bhaga, Dandesar, Tarsadi and Quabi, Jalalpur Taluk : Drunkard.
Prema Gopal, Tighra, Jalalpur Taluk :
Drunkard.
Govan Rama Akoti, Bardoli :
 Several statements. He was guilty of keeping people under duress and recovering without permission for his use private carts and bullocks. He has no stake in the village. Also that he refuses to pass receipt for revenue recovered.
 This list is not exhaustive, nor are all the complaints against the respective parties summarized. I have given a sample list from the papers before me. There should be a full impartial enquiry into these cases and similar cases unless the general suggestion made by me is adopted. Apart from the point of view of peace and expediency, I have suggested that the appointments which are admittedly temporary and “until further orders” can in no sense be regarded as permanent in terms of the settlement. However, the consideration that generally applies to the appointment of a Mukhi, viz., that he should be of the people and more or less a representative enjoying among them a status and influence is lacking in every case. In any event there seems to have been much dilatoriness in the reappointment of Mukhis and
 Talatis. As to the latter, I also drew your attention to the fact that in Bardoli several Talatis have not been reappointed on grounds  of retrenchment. As I told you yesterday, there are men acting for these old Talatis. It is ominously strange that not one of the Talatis in Bardoli has been reinstated.libtech_364_footnote
 CONFISCATED AND OCCUPIED PROPERTY
 Property in Bardoli confiscated under the Criminal Law Amendment Act has been restored practically intact, but in Kaira District, there are serious allegations of misappropriations. A number of articles belonging to the Kaira District Congress Committee are missing (fountain-pens, watch-chain, currency notes worth Rs. 10/-, etc.). 250 maunds of fuel in possession of the Ras Chhawni seems to have been appropriated by the Police. In Tranja in Mater, 20 maunds of cotton and five maunds of tobacco in Devataj were attached. Both are undisposed of, but lying in the chora, instead of being restored to the rightful owners. There has been vexatious delay in restoring confiscated property. There can be no question of contumacy as the revenue is being steadily paid wherever possible. Confiscated property should therefore be returned automatically under the settlement whereas in some [cases] Mamlatdars have asked for applications from those who want their lands back. As the sowing season is fast approaching, it is essential that people should be put in possession of confiscated property as soon as possible.
 ASSESSMENT
 As to assessment I have suggested that there should be no coercive processes and no fines or payments on account of Rakhas should be demanded. I have suggested that in every case the Colle- ctors should confer with our local workers and come to an under- standing as to the assessment. A place like Ras where movables are taken away, locks of houses broken, houses burnt, crops destroyed can hardly be expected to pay anything. I brought to your notice a case in which for Rs. 10/- revenue, Rs. 50/- worth of grain was removed and Rs. 10/- had been kept for annas 10/-. Here is another case.
 In Ober (Jambusar Taluka, Broach  District),  lands  belonging to some of the satyagrahis were forfeited and third  parties  who  offered to pay up the revenue dues in respect of them were put in
 
 possession of the land. They paid the revenue and took the whole crop. They think that the lands have been transferred to them for good and refuse to  give  up  possessin.  On  the  other  hand,  the  Talati has passed no receipt to the original owner for dues recovered out of the crops thus made over to third parties and the original owners are asked to pay up the dues before they can be put in posse- ssion.
 One Pragji Vasanji of Ugat (Jalalpur) had migrated during satyagraha and had not been able to reap his crop. He approached the Mamlatdar with an application for suspension. The latter admitted the application, but four days later issued orders for attachment of applicant’s buffaloes which were returned only on his promising to pay half the assessment within a month.
 I bring some of these instances to your notice to show how the spirit of the settlement is being broken probably unintentionally.
 It is possible to bring counter complaints against the people, I repeat the assurance I gave you yesterday that it is Sardar Vallabh- bhai’s any my desire that the settlement should be observed fully by the people. Any case of breach on the part of the people brought to our notice shall receive prompt attention.
 PENDING PROSECUTIONS
 There are no less than 82 prosecutions in Borsad pending since long before the truce. There are several in Bardoli and Anand and Jalalpur. I append a detailed listlibtech_365_footnote.  Several cases have arisen, since the truce, as a result of the lack of information regarding confiscated lands. They are separately mentioned.
 There is the case of one Ratanji Dayaram of Bajipura who with two others was prosecuted under Section 435 I.P.C. and sentenced to six months’ imprisonment and fine. His companions have been released under the settlement but he is still in jail.
 I gave you the name of Babalbhai, a Vidyapith student who is still in prison for disobeying the deportation order under the Foreigners’ Act. His full name is Balkrishna Pranjivan Mehta. He has not only not been released, but has been asked, before he can be released on the expiry of his term, to sign an undertaking to the effect that he must inform the Dhrangadhra State of his  movements whenever he moved out.
 
 There is a similar case of Fakirbhai Dhanjibhai. He disobeyed the order before the truce.
 SOLD LANDS
 I refrain for the time being from saying anything about sold lands  beyond  repeating  that  the  least  that  I  am  entitled  to  is the list of sold lands, their acreage, and names of the buyers, the dates when they were sold and how.

401,"April 15, 1931",INTERVIEW TO ASSOCIATED PRESS OF INDIA,"
    
 AHMEDABAD,
 April 15, 1931 Mahatma Gandhi again visited his Ashram this morning. Asked by a representative of the Associated Press if his visits to the Ashram were a breach of the
 vowlibtech_370_footnotetaken by him last year, Mahatma Gandhi said :
 I have been going to the Ashram recently every day to  see Imam Saheb, who  is  very  seriously  ill  and  other  patients.  It  is quite untrue to suggest that this is in any shape or  form  a  breach of my vow about not going  to  the  Ashram.  The vow  has  refe- rence to settling down in the Ashram and leading  there  the  ordi- nary settled Ashram life but it does not in any way preclude me from visiting the ashram for seeing the patients or in furtherance of the very thing for which the vow was taken.
 Indeed, nothing in the vow prevents we from staying at the Ashram whenever I come to Ahmedabad but I deliverately refrain from doing so in order not to create any confusion in the minds of the large body of people who would not and have no time to understand the full significance of the vow. I consider it to be an improtant pledge having been taken by many of my companions. I wanted, therefore, to be extra cautious and hence did not stay in the Ashram even temporarily, but I should be defeating the very and of the vow if I heartlessly refuse to go there and see and console patients, or attend to some such matter.
 Asked if he had permitted some of the volunteers with whom he had marched to Dandi last year, [and who were bound by the] pledge to stay at the Ashram, Gandhiji said :
If I found that it was necessary to keep any of my fellow-
 pilgrims for the furtherance of the cause, I should not hesitate to keep them at the Ashram without laying them open to the charge of a breach of the vow.

CHI. CHHAGANLAL JOSHI,
 Why do you worry ? If you have no work to do in Kheda, you need not stay there. If it is necessary to let the Ashram workers remain at the places where they have been working, their expenses should be provided by the residents of those places, Or you should decide for yourself whether they should be kept there and their expenses met by the Ashram. You may treat your decision in this regard as mine.

 [April 15, 1931]
 
CHI. CHHAGANLAL,
I got your letter.
 You should come and see me and discuss in detail what the duty of the Ashram workers is. A rule that applies to me does not necessarily apply to all of you. Since I suggest the rules, I ought to be strict in observing them, even outwardly, though this may not be necessary in the case of some rules. You will be able to think of numerous instances of both types of rules and understand the reasons why they ought to be or need not be observed literally.
 
 If, when your work in Kheda is over, you have of other work before you, you also should go and live in the Ashram. You should so plan your work that, as soon as one task is completed, you have another waiting. It is certainly true that no one ought to return to the Ashram for the sake of an easy life. Does not our vow not to return to the Ashram before we have won complete swaraj mean the  same thing? In other words, the Ashram is a place of ease and comfort and one goes to it for rest. But the volunteers who had joined the march are not free to enjoy such rest. But what should one do if it become necessary to return to the Ashram so that one may be able to work for purna swaraj? Or if life outside the Ashram is found easier? Be that  as it may, I am not impatient, nor do I insist that my own view should be accepted. Think over all this and follow whatever rule you think proper for yourself and for others.

THE CULT OF VIOLENCE","
 Mr. Peddie’slibtech_374_footnotelibtech_375_footnotemurder and the making of the murderer of Mrs. Curtislibtech_376_footnotelibtech_377_footnotea hero at the Sikh League meeting bring out in clear light the tragic fact that the cult of violence has still many votaries. The extolling of murderers is being overdone. If we are to sing the praises of every murderer because the murder has a political motive behind it, we should proceed from praising the deed to the deed itself. The praising of Sajjan Singh as a hero raises a doubt in my mind about the wisdom of my having been the authour of the Congress resolutionlibtech_378_footnoteabout Bhagat Singh. My motive was plain enough. The deed was condemned. The spirit of bravery and sacrifice was praised. The hope behind was that we would thereby be able to distinguish between the deed and the motive, and ultimately learn to detest deeds such as political murders, no matter how high the motive might be. But the effect of the Congress resolution has been perhaps quite the contrary. It seems to have given a passport for extolling murder itself. I repeat my deliberate opinion that whatever may be true of other countries, in India at least political murder can only harm the country. This is much more true whilst an experiment on the largest scale yet known to the world is being made to win liberty through strictly peaceful methods. He who runs can see that the experiment has proved its merit beyond all expectation, and is almost on the point of succeeding. I make bold to say that had the experiment not been interrupted by political murders and the violence in thought and less often in speech and still less often in action of civil resisters, India would by this time have been free.
 Non-violence is the weapon not of the weak but of the strong. Non-violence means forgiving an injury and not retaliat-ing.‘For- giveness  is  an  ornament  of  the  strong,’libtech_379_footnotesays  a  Sanskrit   proverb. Yudhishthira gave an exhibition of this quality when he even though
 
 provoked beyond measure by Virata not only for-gave him but took extraordinary measures to protect him against the wrath of his brother Arjuna who would but for those precautions have killed him for insulting and injuring the great king Yudhishthira.
 Non-violence is not a mechanical performance. It is the finest quality of the heart and comes by training. When it comes, it seems, because it is, natural, and the posessor wonders that it should have cost any trouble at all in its attainment. What can be more natural than to return blow for blow, says the beast in us. What can be more natural or more human than that we should return a blow with forgiveness, says the man in us. He who gave the blow was ignorant and forgot himself. Why should the injured person betray ignorance and forget himself? Are the many wives who suffer the brutalities of their brutal husbands more than human because they forgive their husbands? They would of course do better if they would not add pampering to their forgiveness and would withdraw co-operation from their husbands for the the latter’s own sakes.
 But let me not go into deeper waters. Those who profess nonviolence should realize their strength and be non-violent in thought, word and deed. Let those who still doubt the efficacy of the non-violent method and are not sure of that of the violent method, ponder over the following :
 India’s 	millions have no 	tradition of 	the violent method.  They, 	the villagers, 	have never been known to 	have combined 	on any 	large scale to 	use the violent method.  They 	have no definite 	ideas as 	yet of 	political freedom in 	terms of 	India as 	one country.  Where, 	as in Europe, 	the people 	have gained their freedom by 	the violent 	method, the people 	were more or 	less trained 	in the 	use of arms.  They, 	the peoples 	of Europe, 	gained their freedom 	by being 	able to 	use greater 	violence than the 	enthroned authority.  It 	is at least doubtful if 	they, not 	excluding the 	English, have 	got real 	freedom. The 	masses there 	still feel that they 	are being ground down by 	the moneyed classes who have the 	reins of government in 	their hands. 	Look at 	their varied 	problems ever 
 increasing in perplexity.
  In 	India on 	the other 	hand we know 	that it is through 	the non-violent 	method alone that the 	phenomenal 	massconsciousn ess, 	including the 	awakening of 	women, has 	come into being.  We 	know as 	a proved 	fact that where 	the people 	erred and became 	violent, they 	lost ground, 	became demoralized and 	 were  cowed down. 
 If I were to give more thought to the past twelve months I could elaborate the list. But as it is, it is perhaps enough for my purpose.
 To those who have settled convictions in favour of the violent method, I say: You will give me the same credit that you claim for yourselves for love of the country. If so, you should accept my testimony that by mixing your method with mine you protract the agony. The belief which, I know, some of you hold that an occasional murder of an official helps the cause is wholly unfounded. On the contrary I know that every murder has hampered me in my pursuit. I know that you are as anxious as I am—you will probably say you are more anxious than I am—for the release of all political prisoners. You must admit that the terrorist method can only retard their discharge. Constituted as this Government is, all governments are, they will not discharge political offenders convicted of violence when political violence takes place. All things considered, therefore, you will do well to listen to my advice and request, and suspend your activities whilst the nation is giving a trial to my experiment.

  "
405,,405. AN ENGLISHMAN’S DILEMMA,"
 India knows the Englishman who carried my letter containing the eleven points to the Viceroy and who waged a ceaseless struggle in the face of heavy odds in England whilst the Civil Disobedience was going on. Mr. Reginald Reynolds now writes the following plaintive letter :
 I was very glad to hear from you in reply to my letter. Before this reply came the newspapers had already informed me, of course, of all that happened at Delhi, which from my point of view so badly needed explanation.
 I must frankly confess that your letter leaves me entirely unconvinced. No one who knows you would doubt your sincerity, and so long as you can still speak for India, it is hardly the business of any Englishman to criticize your actions. Nevertheless, you will be the first to recognize my complete right to disagree with you, which I do emphatically on the following points :
  The 	Government is 	not pledged 	to grant 	purna swaraj, 	and it 	would be 	thrown out 	if it attempted to 	do so. MacDonald only 	remains in office 	because he 	has not the courage 	to deal 	justly with your country, and 	justice would cost 	him that office. If you accept less than purna Swaraj —less than your 
 birthright, that is to say,—where does the Independence Resolution at Lahorelibtech_380_footnotecome in, and how does it differ from “Dominion Status”? What advance was made, and what did the pledge really mean?
  Oppressin 	still continues. How do 	you hope for freedom 	from the hands 	of those 	who defy Indian public 	opinion and use their 	armed forces to 	drive bargains 	with you 	on your 	own soil 	for a 	‘truce’? Where 	is the 	‘change of 	heart’?  From 	time to time 	you have put forward 	terms—the Delhi 	Manifesto of 	November 1929libtech_381_footnote, your 	own Eleven 	Pointslibtech_382_footnote, 	the terms 	you gave to 	Slocombelibtech_383_footnote, the ‘Gandhi-Nehru 	Terms’libtech_384_footnote. 	What has 	become of 	these? The 	Government meets 	them in 	graceful ‘concessions’ 	whereby a 	few are to 	be fulfilled in some 	measure at 	its own ‘discretion’. But : 
 They have not pledged themselves to anything in the way of self- government.
 Nothing secures the proper and adequate representation of Congress in the forthcoming Conference (where you may easily be swamped by reactionaries appointed by the Government as supplied or the previous Conference) [sic].
 There is no promise of the conditional release of all political prisoners (including those in jail before the present campaign).
 And so on—you know the points infinitely better than I do.
 I wish you Indian leaders could realize how extraordinarily difficult this makes things for those who want to help and look to you for leadership. If you do not stand by your terms, what surety is there in our case? We believed your terms to be minimum terms, from which you would never depart. Instead, we find you bargaining and whittling these terms down. How can we even speak with certainty again, and who would believe us if we did?
  From 	the purely 	tactical point of view 	I cannot 	see what 	you have 	gained. Civil 	disobedience was 	commenced, I 	take it, 	because the 	Government would 	not accept 	the Delhi 	Manifesto. They have not 	accepted it 	today—not one 	of your 	four points. The arguments you use now for conciliatory methods are 	they very arguments 	which were then used by 	many to 	dissuade you 	from your 	course and 	bring you to the 	Round Table Conference. 	Those arguments 	you then 	rejected; why do you now 	advance them? The country 	has  suffered  terribly, 	but what 	for? Many are still in 	prison, much 	confiscated property is 	unrestored, so are the 	dead, and the work of the 	lathi cannot be 	expiated—what have 	you to 	show for 	this? What offer has 	Lord Irwin made that he 	was not 	ready to 	make before Civil 	Disobedience began? 	With the exception 	of the 	small concession 	in the 	matter of 	salt, I 	can see no 	single right or 	principle that 	has been established. The 	truce does not even represent 	the status 	quo ante 	bellum : it 	is a partial 	and patronizing 	restoration on the 	part of 	the Government of some of its 	spoils acquired during 	the struggle, 	but not of 	 any of 	those rights for 	which the 	struggle itself 	was fought. 
 You will, I know, forgive my bluntness. I have neither age nor experience, but I have, I believe, enough common sense to appreciate such a situation as this. You will see that I attack your position from two sides, as it were. Firstly, because it is too moderate and secondly because (having regard to the moderation of your find position) your methods seem to me now needlessly drastic. Had you been moderate throughout I shold have disagreed but understood. But to adopt the method of a non-violent revolution with all its suffering in order to gain nothing at all—that is a policy I do not understand. Will India understand it?
 I would like to venture one more final criticism. You live for the Indian masses—for the peasant and the labourer. Everywhere in this country I have
 made that clear, and done my best to dispel the common idea that swaraj means the rule of the Brahmin and the Bania and the oppression of the poor. How then can the reactionary proposals of St. James’ Palace in any way satisfy you? There has always been one point on which I have agreed with our worst English reactionaries such as Churchill—though I doubt  whether  they seriously care about it. They say that the so-called “reforms” are only designed to benefit and conciliate the propertied classes of India and increase their power over the illiterate millions. I agree with this, and I have always said, swaraj is not that : it is the opposite of that : it is the overthrow of the present conspiracy between British Imperialism and Indian Capitalism, and its replacement by a living and conscious democracy, which alone can protect the classes now socially or economically depressed. If this is true—and nothing less would have led me to the service of swaraj—what do you hope from conferences of princes, zamindars, industrialists and the like? I know there are men among them who are above the interests of class; but what do these as a body represent that is not more bound up with British Imperialism than with Indian democracy?
I have removed nothing from the letter except domestic and
 personal references. I publish the letter at Mr. Reynolds’s wish. And I do so with pleasure as I know that though by reason of amazing faith in me the Congress endorsed the Pactlibtech_385_footnote, there are Indians who share this brave Englishmen’s views. There must be also some Englishmen, be they ever so few, who are puzzled like Rey-nolds over my moderation and so-called inconsistency. I must, therefore, attempt to answer Reynolds’s complaints for his and their sakes. India will want their active help and sympathy for many a year to come.
 The charge of moderation I must admit. Friends who know me have certified that I am as much a moderate as I am an extremist and as much a conservative as I am a radical. Hence perhaps my good fortune to have friends among these extreme types of men.  The mixture is due, I believe, to my view of ahimsa.
 Inconsistency is only apparent. It appears so to many friends because of my responsivencess to varying circumstances. Seeming consistency may really be sheer obstinacy.
 The real point is this. Charges of moderation or extremism or inconsistency ought not to matter. What must count with a public servant is the approbation of his own conscience. He must be like a rudderless vessel who, leaving the infallible solace of his own cons-
 
 
 cience, ever seeks to please and gain the approbation of the public. Service must be its own and sole reward. Whether therefore the argu- ment and facts I am about to set forth serve their purpose or not, it must be sufficient for the reader as it is, I am aware, for Reynolds to know that in entering upon and advising the acceptance of the Settlement, I have done what in my opinion was not only right but obligatory.
 Now for the facts and the arguments. Reynolds and those who think like him have been led into confusion because he and they have missed the historical perspective. A single new factor may change a whole situation. Reynolds mentions four events: (1) The Delhi Manifesto of November 1929, (2) The Eleven points, (3) The terms given to Mr. Slocombe, (4) The Gandhi-Nehru terms.
 The Delhi Manifesto was an answer to Lord Irwin’s famous declaration and was therefore just confined to that declaration.
 The Eleven-point letter was written as a precursor to Civil Disobedience and set forth the conditions on which Civil Disobe- dience could be averted. It had therefore to be different from the November Manifesto.
 The terms to Mr. Slocombe were given just after the commen- cement of civil disobedience. There was therefore a slight variation from the Eleven-point letter but no reduction of it.
 The Gandhi-Nehru terms were given during the height of the movement and whilst we were all in custody and thus by being shut out of the world at a disadvantage. In all the four stages the Round Table Conference had not been held, the Government policy was not declared.
 The Settlement is the natural evolution from the first stage. Whatever the variations between the stages, they are due to the varying situations. Unlike as in the four stages, the Round Table Conference had been held and the Government policy declared before the fifth stage, i.e., the Settlement, was reached.
 At no other time was it possible to offer co-operation at the Round Table Conference because the British Government would not declare its policy and the intention of the delegates to the Conference was not known. But at Delhi last March the demand of the Conference delegates was known as was also known the British policy.  The demand was Dominion Status. The British policy was a declaration tantamount to the acceptance of the demand.
 Not that either the Indian demand for Dominion Status or the British declaration satisfy the Congress requirement, especially as they are hedged in by the so-called safeguards which, according to the Congress notion, certainly are not designed in the interest of India.
 Nevertheless this is an unmistakable advance upon the past uncertainty. And when it was ascertained that it was possible for the Congress to press forward its view to the fullest extent, it was felt that the Congress would put itself in the wrong if it had declined to put forth its demand and press for its acceptance at a Round Table. The Congress would have been bound at any stage to enter upon  a discussion of its claims after such declaration as has been made by the British Government. A satyagrahi never misses, can never miss, a chance of compromise on honourable terms, it being always assumed that in the event of failure he is ever ready to offer battle. He needs no previous preparation, his cards are always on the table. Suspension or continuation of battle is one and the same thing to him. He fights or refrains to gain precisely the same end. He dare not always distrust his opponents. On the contrary he must grasp the hand of friendship whenever there is the slightest pretext. The pretext here was the unex- pectedly unanimous Indian demand, the British response, inadequate though it was, and the utter sincerity running through Lord Irwin’s conversations.
 I have never claimed any change of heart on the part of the powers that be. That has still to come. When it comes, there will be a settlement not merely provisional but absolutely permanent. Then  there will be full surrender on the part of the satyagrahi; for change of heart means surrender to the Indian demand in toto and without any mental reservation.
 Lastly, throughout all the stages there never has been a lowering of the flag. Dominion Status was given up on 23rd December 1929. It is now Complete Independence, i.e., association if possible with the British on equal terms and with the right to either party to dissolve it at will. That this may not be attained through conference as yet is quite possible; that the so-called safeguards may remain the halters that they are is also highly possible. If so the Congress will not be responsible for failure, but it will come out with enhanced moral prestige and its demand more fully known and equally fully justified. It is true that all the political prisoners are not discharged. Their discharge could not be demanded as part of the Provisional Settlement. They will be discharged if full settlement is reached. If it is not reached, those who
 
 are temporarily out will then be in and increase the army of political prisoners. For a satyagrahi a prisoner’s life is no disability, no unhappiness. Prison for him is the gateway to freedom.
 Lastly, let there be no mistake as to what purna swaraj means to the Congress. It is full economic freedom for the toiling millions. It is no unholy alliance with any interest for their exploitation. Any  alliance must mean their deliverance.

406,,NOTES,"
    
 MALAVIYAJI AND WORKING COMMITTEE
 A reader asks :
 You explained to the Subjects Committee at Karachi why you kept out the members from the South; you never explained why you kept out Pandit Malaviyaji.libtech_386_footnote
The explanation was so obvious that nobody called for it. There
 could be no question of offending Malaviyaji. He is above being offended. No organization can add to his status or impor- tance by enrolling him as a member. His membership can add to its prestige. The Working Committee deliberately kept him out in order  to  preserve his independence and freedom of action at a given moment. Without being a memebr, since the release of leaders, he has always been attending the Working Committee meetings and taking an active part in its deliberations. Valuable as his work on the Committee has been, the members thought that his being subjected  to  the Committee’s discipline might prove embarrassing to him. Indeed Dr. Ansari was so eager for Malaviyaji to be on the Committee that he preferred to be dropped out in favour of Malaviyaji. But the consi- deration I have just mentioned was so effectively urged by Jamnalalji that Dr. Ansari too became reconciled to Malaviyaji being kept out. This arrangement permits the Committee to avail itself of Malaviyaji’s advice at its deliberations and at the same time leaves intact  his freedom of action. Indeed even the Government has recognized his unique position in society by separately inviting him to the Round Table Conference.
 
 BOYCOTT THROUGH KHADI
 Last year saw a striking increase in the production and sale of khadi all over the country. This was in the main due to the pheno- menal demand stimulated by the struggle of which khadi at once became the symbol. Sales so far outran the demand that workers were hard put to it to organize new fields of production to meet the sudden rise in demand.
 The ground thus gained during the year of national awakening should not be lost, but on the contrary, should be made the basis of still further expansion. The devotion of war time must continue during the period of peace, if the fruits of the work are not to be lost. The Congress attitude in favour of khadi remains the same in spite of the recognition of indigenous mills as a part of the boycott pro- gramme. It must not mean supersession of khadi. Mill manufacture is to supplement khadi where the latter is absolutely unobtainable. But at the present moment kahdi can overtake all the demand that can be made upon it. Khadi holds the key position in the foreign-cloth boycott programme. Not merely is no effective boycott of foreign cloth possible without working up the vast possibilities of khadi production, but if the fruits of the national boycott are to benefit the millions of our village population and not merely the moneyed few, it can be done only by the widest possible spread of the life-giving wheel. That is why the Congress at Karachi has again emphasized the unique position of khadi in the boycott programme, and has appealed to all “Congress organization and allied bodies to intensify foreign- cloth boycott by increasing khadi propaganda.” The experience of the last year has shown the capacity of khadi production to respond promptly to any increase in demand; and we have to maintain not merely the existing work, but extend the spinning activities still further. The least that we must do is to reach the level of last year if we cannot show a substantial increase upon it.

       From 	a photostat of the Gujarati : G.N. 3398         Blessings 	from  BAPU        BOMBAY,  April 	18, 1931 
  Answering 	questions put to him by a group of pressmen, regarding the recent 	complaint in a section of the Press, to which the retiring Viceroy 	also had alluded in his reply to the Mill-owners’ Association 	address, Mahatma Gandhi declared : I 	have no war mentality. I have peace mentality at the present  	moment and I should strain every nerve to retain that mentality and 	establish permanent peace in the country for which my companions 	also are striving.  Proceeding, 	he reiterated 	his view that the would 	not go to the 	Round Table Conference 	until the communal 	problem was solved. 	He added 	that for the present 	he had 	dismissed the 	idea of 	going to 	the Round 	Table Congerence until 	a communal 	solution was found.  Asked 	what his next programme was, he said he didn’t know it and would  not 	be able 	to evolve 	one until 	he felt 	that no solution 	to the 	communal problem was 	 in sight.  Q. 	Can you make any 	statement regarding the communal problem?  A. I am unable to make 	any statement except that I shall leave no stone unturned and pray 	for success because I know prayer can move even mountains. 
 Q. Are you against separate electorates ?
 A. I am against nothing that will end the communal trouble.
 Q. Will not separate electorates widen the gulf between communities?
A. These are not things for me to consider.
 Q. Do you expect to satisfy every section of Muslims?
A. I hope to satisfy all sections.
 Q. What do you say about Mr. Shaukat Ali’s recent statement about you being a danger in Indian politics?
 A. Seeing that he is an old friend of mine, he was perfectly right to say that thing about me.
 Q. What do you say to the complaint made in the Anglo-Indian Press that the Congress is not keeping the terms of the Truce?
a. I say emphatically “No”, except there have been isolated
 cases and I am surprised to read Mr. Benn’s reply. In Gujarat, there was satisfactory response. In Bardoli, for instance, peasants have been paying up dues as quickly as possible. Up to the 16th instant, Bardoli and Valod have paid Rs. 1,16,658 while Jalalpur paid Rs. 1,96,453, after the announcement of Provisional Settlement. I regard these as handsome figures and I cannot help saying they have been grossly misinformed. Regarding lands already sold to third parties, he said he would ask on bended knees these purchasers to return them and felt sure that every inch of land would be returned.
 Asked if he was not keeping the country in suspense, he said that the country knew that every effort was being made to achieve lasting peace and if it be not available, the country should be prepared to suffer.
 Asked if he thought that by negotiations he could achieve permanent peace, he declared that in negotiations backed by real strength, he most deci- dedly believed real peace could be had. Referring to the re-export of foreign cloth, he said that the schemelibtech_387_footnotewas being put into execution and also con- tradicted the report that he had any talk with Mr. Geoffrey Corbett about the same.

409,"April 18, 1931","SPEECH IN REPLY TO CORPORATION ADDRESS, BOMBAYlibtech_388_footnote","
    
 [April 18, 1931 ]libtech_389_footnote
 I had thought that the one address you had given me six years agolibtech_390_footnotelibtech_391_footnotewas quite enough, but love knows no bounds and your love has prompted you to present to me another address. But you may be sure that I am not so unthinking as to appropriate all that love for myself, for I know that as in 1924 so now it has been given to me as a representative of the toilers of the land. I claim to live for the semi- starved paupers of India and swaraj means the emancipation of these millions of skeletons. Purna swaraj denotes a condition of things  when the dumb and the lame millions will speak and walk. That swaraj cannot be achieved by force, but by organization and unity. Your address I take it is a token of your sympathy for Daridranarayana.
 You have in your address referred to my endeavour for the uplift of the so-called untouchables. Their rights should be our sacred trust, but one of the indispensable conditions of swaraj is that Hindus wipe out that stain on Hinduism.
India does not live in its towns but in its villages. But if the cities
 want to demonstrate that their populations will live for the villagers of India the bulk of their resouces should be spent in ameliorating the condition of and befriending the poor. We must not lord it over them, we must learn to be their servants. When the cities realize that they must live for the welfare of the poor, they will make their palaces and institutions and the life of their inhabitants correspond somewhaat to our villages. Whilst therefore I am accepting an address from you for a second time you will permit me to hope that you will more and more make the cause of the poor your own and as an earnest of you desire to do so I want you to identify yourselves with the thousands of workers in the city. I want you to make them feel that the Corporation is theirs as it is of the well-to-do. Handsome is that handsome does, and Bombay the beautiful must do beautiful things for the poor. If Bombay is the premier city in India it is chiefly because of the Parsis whom the world recognizes as the most generous in their charities.
 
 Does not this Corporation owe its influence to the singnal services of Sir Pherozeshah Mehta who was justly called the father of this Corporation? You may not then lag behind in the service of the poor.
 You have referred to the question of communal unity. Let all of us Hindus, Mussalmans, Parsis, Sikhs, Christians, live amicably as Indians, pledged to live and die for our motherland. Let it be our ambition to live as the children of the same mother, retaining our individual faiths and yet being one, like the countless leaves of one tree. You have blessed my endeavour to achieve communal unity. But it cannot be achieved by the efforts of a single individual.
 One word more. If the appeal I have made in the cause of the poor has gone home and if you will identify yourselves more with the villages, a beginning can be made by introducing handspinning in your schools and making your 80,000 boys and girls spin on the takli. This can be done at the least expense and without any difficulty, and in the wake of the takli khadi will follow as a matter of course. What can be better education for our boys and girls than that they should learn through spinning to identify themselves with the poor. May God give you the strength and the will to serve the inarticulate millions of India.

  "
410,,TO THE SATYAGRAHI FARMER,"
    
 Many satyagrahi farmers in the Kheda, Surat and  Broach districts forfeited their lands, lost their crops, had their homes robbed; they were rendered homeless, the homes of some were burnt down and a settlement was made without getting anything in return for this and, going even further, those who could pay have been asked to pay up their revenue dues and, as if this was not enough, so many Patels and Talatis have not been restored to their offices—those who think along these lines can never be satisfied.
 But another line of thought can be as follows. The farmer has no grounds whatsoever to complain. This is so because when  he  joined the struggle, he had decided to risk the loss of his fields, his home, his livestock and his life and property. He was prepared to lose his all in order to win swaraj. Hence, if he gets something back now, it should be regarded as a windfall. If he reasons on these lines, he would have no cause for complaint at all. Some may argue in their impatience : How can we be reconciled to the losses as long as swaraj has not been won? The reply to this is that this Truce has been signed in the midst of the struggle; it is not the end of it. While suffering a total loss, whatever has been spared should be gladly accepted. We should welcome any opportunity of sacrificing our all, till such time as swaraj is won. Hence no one should have any reason for despon- dency because of losses incurred. This Settlement has not been made in order to make good our losses; rather, it is a step towards swaraj. Underlying it is indeed the idea that we should spare ourselves any avoidable loss. This is already being realized. Whatever has been made good from the loss already incurred should be regarded as a fresh gain. Those who realize this should not become impatient; let those who are being tried be released at a later date, let there be delay in returning lands which have been attached, let some time elapse before Patels and others who had resigned and relinquished their offices can take up their posts again. This may involve a violation of the Pact in some respects on the part of the Government. We should put up with it and continue to observe the conditions which bind us. If we do so, we shall add to our strength in every way.
 As we are not at present practising non-co-operation with the Government, we can meet its officials and put before them whatever complaints we wish to.
 One of the biggest complaints is in respect of the lands which have been sold. It is necessary to be patient in regard to this. Owners of lands should be convinced at heart that in the  end  they  will certainly be restored to them. But we wish to do so only in a straightforward way and not through force. We have a right to reason and plead with those who have bought these lands. I believe that we shall succeed in persuading them. But even if we fail, what does it matter? That should not make anyone conclude that we shall never recover the lands. We should have the self-confidence that we shall secure swaraj within a short time. The first task of the government under swaraj should be to redress such acts of injustice. Here I am speaking not of the distant future but of the immediate future. Suppose we do not win swaraj in the near future, then the time will again come for us to abandon our lands and our homes, and the Sardar, I and others will be enjoying ourselves in the prison-palace. Hence those whose lands have been sold, should have patience.
 However, I myself have nost lost hope of persuading those who have bought the lands. These are our own brethren. It is reported that there are Parsis, Muslims and Dharala Thakores amongst them. All of them have a heart. They all know that they have bought the land cheap. They too would be ashamed of this fact. I believe that they will certainly return the land if they realize the fact that the land had been owned by those who had come forward to suffer for the sake of swaraj. The Patidars have a special duty towards the Dharala Thakores. They should remove whatever injustices the latter have suffered in the past; they should be made to feel one with the rest of us. It does no credit to a swarajist to give up hope of ever persuading the purchasers. Whatever happens, we should not start a struggle of any kind against them. We should avoid all such situations which would lead to a clash with them. The land will remain untilled this monsoon. It is our dharma to put up with this loss and those who have self-confidence will do so.
 A few words now regarding the payment of revenue dues. It is the dharma of those who can to pay up their dues. Let no one believe in the topsyturvy justice that if one person pays up, others must necessarily do so; likewise, it is contrary to law to believe that no one
 should pay up because someone does not do so. The right course is the one which I have suggested. Those who can should certainly pay up. There is no question here of paying up by contracting debts. It is solely a questions of one’s own capacity. Our goodness and our strength lie in abiding by the conditions of the Settlement even at the cost of some hardship to ourselves.

 I enclose herewith a translation of what purports to be a notice from the Borsad Mamlatdar. You had left me under the impression that you would investigate the matters I had discussed with you and that I would know from you what was intended to be done. The notice seems to ignore these conversations and the Congress as the intermediery between the Government and the people. If this is to the position to be finally taken up by the Government it will, in my opinion, be a distinct breach of the Settlement.
 After the conference with the local workers Sardar Vallabhbhai and I have come to the following conclusions :
 Ras has been so hard hit that it can hardly pay anything.  The 	remaining villages will 	endeavour to pay 	one year’s dues 	to the 	utmost extent possible. 	I am having 	an exhaustive 	note prepared on this matter.  Taqavi 	and the balance 	of arrears 	shold be 	suspended. If 	the Government notice of 	11th March 	last re-suspends 	suspended arrears in 	all cases, how 	much more are 	the villages affected by 	the movement in 	need of 	such relief? 	That in 	the opinion 	of the 	Government their 	misfortunes may 	be considered 	to be due 	to their 	own fault 	is an irrelevant 	consideration after the Settlement.  The 	Settlement clearly 	contemplates waiver of 	Rakha, attach- 	ment, and 	notice-fee charges. 	These therefore 	should not 	be deman- 	ded. 
 On receipt of a reply from you I shall arrange with the people for payment in accordance with the foregoing offer.

Do all work without attachment. Read the preface to Anasaktiyoga frequently, if it does not tire you. The more you study it, the more clearly will you understand how to act, and in consequence you will experience spiritual contentment.

 DEAR MR. GARRETT,
I have to thank you for your exhaustive reply.libtech_402_footnote
 The chief point of the moment is with reference to the status of the Congress in the Settlement. If you agree that the Settlement is between the Congress and the Government, and if it is the Congress that has to implement its terms so far as they are applicable to the people, it follows that the Congress must be recognized as the inter- mediary between the Government and the people whom the Congress represents. If such was not the case, I suppose that I should have no right to see you or to correspond with you or to receive your replies in the several matters arising out of the Settlement. Your letter raises a question of the first magnitude, and on your reply to it will depend the action to be taken by me in connection with the Settlement. Meanwhile, I refrain from dealing with the details covered by your letter.
 Yours sincerely,

420,"April 21, 1931","420. SPEECH AT SABARMATI ASHRAM, AHMEDABAD","
 April 21, 1931 Mahatma Gandhi was present this evening on the occasion of the marriage ceremony of Lakshmi, daughter of Lakshmidas Gandhi, a khadi worker, in Dr.
 Pranjivandas’s Bungalow near Sabarmati Ashram. The marriage ceremony was very simple and brief. Mahatma Gandhi administered the marriage oath.
 Before the marriage ceremony, Gandhiji entered his Ashram and attended the evening prayer for the first time after his Dandi March. Addressing a small congregation consisting of the inmates of the Ashram, Mahatma Gandhi said that he did not expect to be back in the Ashram at so short a time. He had, however, not returned to the Ashram after the conclusion of peace. He had come for a special occasion, viz., the marriage of a girl who was brought up in the Ashram. The marriage of one connected with the Ashram during the time of war would cause surprise, but this
 
 marriage was not to serve as an example. Those who could not do without marriage were at liberty to marry. Celibacy was enjoined in the Ashram, but it was not compulsory. Those who could not remain celibate, might leave the Ashram.
 It was not known, when the fight would be resumed. But it would be a fierce fight, if it was resumed. The inmates of the Ashram should therefore be alert and augment their strenght. Courage and purity of the people had been fully awakened, and if the fight was resumed, crores would take part. But if all of them lost heart and remained aloof they (inmates of the Ashram) were to set example and give the lead.

       From 	a photostat of the Gujarati : G.N. 3399     Blessings 	from  BAPU          BARDOLI,  April 	22, 1931 
  	I enclose herewith copies of the latest correspondence between the 	Commissioner, Northern Division, and myself. If His Ex- cellency too 	takes the same view that Mr. Garrett does about the Congress 	mediation, I feel that it nullifies the whole Settlement. It was 	only when the Government of India and the British Govern- ment 	recog- nized that the Congress truly represented the people that 	there was the Settlement between it and the Government. To repudiate 	the Congress as the intermediary between the people and the 	Government means repudiation of the Settlement.    
 In the light of this extraordinary development, the other matters about which I complained on the 17th instant pale into insignificance. But I recapitulate the main points here to show how far Government have till now failed to implement the Settlement.
  Some 	of the 	Sholapur prisoners and 	several other prisoners 	who the Congress 	claims are 	covered by 	the Settlement 	still remain 	undischarged. Several 	such prosecutions are 	still continued.  Civil 	resisters coming under the 	Foreigners’ Act 	have not yet had 	the ban removed.  Vatan 	and Inam 	cases against civil resisters have not 	yet been withdrawn.  Officials 	such as 	Patels, etc. 	who resigned during the 	Civil Disobedience 	period still 	remain unreinstated 	though the 	appoint- ments 	held by the new 	incumbents are 	all, so 	far as I am aware, 	tempo- rary 	or “until 	further orders”, and 	although several new 	Patels are 	undesirable.  Confiscated 	movables and immovables 	have not 	yet under 	some pretext 	or other 	been returned.  Liquor 	vendors still 	continue their 	unlicensed business 	 in spite of 	the knowledge of 	the authorities.  Names 	and prices 	of the 	forfeited lands with the 	dates of 	sales and the way in which they were sold have not yet been supplied.  On 	the ground of 	‘non-co-operation’ 	during the 	Civil Disobedience 	period, the Government 	still withhold 	grants from the 	Ahmedabad municipality 	for education, 	dispensation from 	revenue dues 	for lands 	used for purposes 	of sanitation 	and for a 	hospital and 	maternity home. This 	matter though not 	specifically mentioned 	in the 	Settelment clearly falls 	within its scope. 
 I would like to have Government’s final decision on all these points. I promised to furnish Mr. Collins with details of the cases under clauses 1 and 4. These are being collected. But I think a general order will cover these cases. But if the Congress is not recognized as the proper intermediary, everything else recedes in the background.libtech_406_footnote

427,,FOREIGN CLOTH AND OTHER BRITISH GOODS,"
    
 It is devoutly to be wished that Englishmen in general and Lancashire mill-owners in particular will realize that India to be free from chronic starvation must for ever banish foreign cloth whether English, Japanese or any other. This is an economic necessity which will not be removed even when India acquires the most complete independence. Among the very first acts of a popular government would certainly be complete prohibition of foreign cloth.
 And foreign cloth will be replaced not by indigenous millcloth but by khaddar spun and woven in 7,00,000 villages of India. Though the indigenous mills undoubtedly and automatically benefit by the foreign-cloth boycott, the Congress concentrates its main energy in this boycott, on behalf of khaddar, i.e., the toiling millions. Let all the foreigners understand that this boycott mevement is a mass movement, it is a humanitarian movement. Foreign manufacturers will in the end advance their own and their operatives’ interest by realizing and recognizing the intensity and the purity of the movement. It has political consequences, but being a purely economic and humani- tarian movement it should command the support of the whole world.
 And yet needlessly bitter and unwarranted agitation has been launched out against foreign-cloth boycott in England. The tre- mendous advantage gained by England owing to the removal of the boycott of British goods is hardly ever noticed. This is not fair play. This suppression of a fact of very great importance makes much more difficult the solution of the Indian question which is already difficult enough. Do the English public know that the British goods boycottt movement is over thirty years old? Do they realize that it gained the greatest impetus during the last struggle and that it attained success almost as great as the movement against foreign cloth? India will for a long time to come, if not always, need certain things from foreign countries. Today the Settlement is provisional. Suppose there is a lasting settlement and an honourable partnership between England and India, will not the trade with England in other articles that India may need to import more than compensate for the loss of the piece- goods and yarn custom which England must forgo in every case?
 The things to realize is that India can no longer be the dumping ground for every thing English or foreign whether she wants it or not. The days of exploitation are over. We may or may not achieve
 
 communal unity. If we fail, we may not have immediate indepen- dence. But the world will find that all Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Chris- tians, Parsis, Jews, for whom India is their home, will fight unitedly to resist the exploitation of India’s resources for the benefit of the foreigner. They will resist the ceaseless annual drain which starves all the communities with ruthless impartiality.

 "
428,,FOREIGN MISSIONARIES,"
    
 
 Correspondents angry or curious have sent me clippings from the Press or their comments on what has been ascribed to me by interviewers on the subjects of foreign missionaries.libtech_412_footnoteOnly one corres- pondent has been cautious enough to ask me whether I am correctly reported. Even George Joseph, my erstwhile co-worker and gracious host in Madura, has gone into hysterics without condescending to verity the report. That is the unkindest cut of all.
This is what a reporter has put into my mouth :
 It instead of confining themselves to humanitarian work and material service to the poor, they do proselytization by means of medical aid, education, etc., then I would certainly ask them to withdraw. Every nation’s religion is as good as any other. Certainly India’s religions are adequate for her people. We need no converting spiritually.
I have given so many interviews that I cannot recall the time or
 the occasion or the context for the statement. All I can say is that it is  a travesty of what I have always said and held. My views on foreign missions are no secret. I have more than once expounded them before missionary audiences. I am therefore unable to understand the fury over the distorted version of my views.
Let me retouch the statement as I should make it :
 ‘If instead of confining themselves purely to humanitarian work such as education, medical services to the poor and the like, they would use these activities of theirs for the purpose of proselytizing, I would certainly like them to withdraw. Every nation considers its own faith to be as good as that of any other. Certainly the great faiths held
 by the people of India are adepuate for her people. India stands in no need of conversion from one faith to another’.
 Let me now amplify the bald statement. I hold that proselytizing under the cloak of humanitarian work is, to say the least, unhealthy. It is most certainly resented by the people here. Religion after all is a deeply personal matter, it touches the heart. Why should I change my religion because a doctor who professes Christianity as his religion has cured me of some disease or why should the doctor expect or suggest such a change whilst I am under his influence? Is not medical relief its own reward and satisfaction? Or why should I whilst I am in a missio- nary educational institution have Christian teaching thrust upon me? In my opinion these practices are not uplifting and give rise to suspi- cion if not even secret hostility. The methods of conversion must be like Caesar’s wife above suspicion. Faith is not imparted like secular subjects. It is given through the language of the heart. If a man has a living faith in him, it spreads its aroma like the rose its scent. Because of its invisibility, the extent of its influence is far wider than that of the visible beauty of the colour of the petals.
 I am, them, not against conversion. But I am against the modern methods of it. Conversion nowadays has become a matter of business, like any other. I remember having read a missionary report saying how much it cost per head to convert and then presenting a budget for ‘the next harvest’.
 Yes, I do maintain that India’s great faiths are all-sufficing for her. Apart from Christianity and Judaism, Hinduism and its offshoots, Islam and Zoroastrianism are living faiths. No one faith is perfect. All faiths are equally dear to their respective votaries. What is wanted therefore is living friendly contactamong the followers of the great religions of the world and not a clash among them in the fruitless attempt on the part of each community to show the superiority of its faith over the rest. Through such friendly contact it will be possible for us all to rid our respective faiths of shortcomings and excres- cences.
 It follows from what I have said above that India is in no need of conversion of the kind I have in mind. Conversion in the sense of self- purification, self-realization is the crying need of the times. That however is not what is ever meant by proselytizing. To those who would convert India, might it not be said, ‘Physician heal thyself’?

429,,‘ONE OF THE MANY’ (?),"
    
 The open letter written by “One of the Many” is the late Sukhdev’s letter. Sjt. Sukhdev was Sardar Bhagat Singh’s comrade. The latter was delivered to me after his death. Want of time prevented me from giving the letter earlier publication. It is printed without any alteration.libtech_413_footnote
 The writer is not “one of the many”. Many do not seek the gallows for political freedom. However condemnable political murder may be, it is not possible to withhold recognition of the love of the country and the courage which inspire such awful deeds. And let us hope that the cult of political assassination is not growing. If the  Indian experiment succeeds, as it is bound to, the occupation of the political assassin will be gone for ever. At any rate I am working in that faith.
 The writer does me less than justice when he says that I have made no more than sentimental appeals to the revolutionaries to call off their movement, and I claim on the contrary that I have given them hard facts which, though they have been often repeated in these columns, will bear recapitulation :
 The 	revolutionary activity 	has not brought 	us near our 	goal. It has added to the military expenditure in the country.  It 	has given 	rise to 	reprisals on 	the part of 	the Government 	without doing any good.  Whenever 	revolutionary murder has 	taken place, it 	has for a 	time and 	in that 	place demoralized the people. It 	has in no way contributed 	to mass awakening.  Its 	effect on 	the masses 	has been doubly 	bad in 	that they had 	to bear 	the burden 	ultimately of 	additional expense 	and the indirect 	effect of 	Government wrath.  Revolutionary 	murder cannot thrive in 	the Indian 	soil, Indian tradition, 	as history 	teaches us, being 	unfavourable to 	the growth 	of political violence.  If 	the revolutionaries seek to convert 	the masses to their 	method, we 	would have to 	wait for an 	indefinitely long 	time for it to permeate the 	masses and 	then to 	gain freedom. 
 
  If 	the method 	of violence 	ever becomes 	popular, it is bound 	to recoil, as it has done in other countries, on our own heads.  The 	revolutionaries have 	an ocular 	demonstration of the 	efficacy of 	the opposite 	method, i.e., non-violence, which has 	gone on 	in spite 	of sporadic 	cases of violence 	on their 	part and in 	spite even of 	violence occasionally 	done by the so-called 	votaries of non-violence. Revolutionaries 	should accept 	my testimony 	when I tell 
 them that their activity has not only not done any good to the movement of non-violence, but it has on the contrary harmed the cause. In other words, if I had a completely peaceful atmosphere we would have gained our end already.
 These, I claim, are hard facts and no appeal to sentiment. But the writer further objects to my making public appeals to the party and suggests that thereby I help the bureaucracy to crush the movement. Surely the bureaucracy is in no need of my help to deal with the movement. It fights for life both against the revolutionary and me. It scents more danger from the non-violent movement than from the violent. It knows how to deal with the latter. It is baffled by the former which has already shaken it to its foundations.
 Moreover, authors of political murder count the cost before they enter upon their awful career. No action of mine can possibly worsen their fate.
 And seeing that the revolutionary party must work in secret, I have no other way open to me but thay of making public appeals to its unknown members. I may say parenthetically that my public appeals have not altogether fallen on deaf ears. I count many past revolutionaries among my co-workers.
 The open letter complains that prisoners other than satya- grahis have not been released. I have explained in these pages the reasons why it was impossible to insist on the release of the other prisoners. Personally, I want the release of all of them. I would make every effort to secure their release. I am aware that some of them ought to have been discharged long ago. The Congress has a resolution in that behalf. Sjt. Nariman has been appointed by the Working Committee to collect all names. As soon as he has got the list, steps will be taken to secure there release. But those who are out must help by preventing revolutionary murder. We may not have the cake and also eat it. Of course there are political prisoners who should be discharged in any case. I can only give the assurance to all concerned that the delay is
 due not to want of will but to want of ability. Let it be also remem- bered that when the final settlement comes, if it does, in the course of a few months, all political prisoners must be discharged. If it does not come, those who are trying to secure the release of the other political prisoners will find themselves in prison.

431,,431. AGAINST PICKETING,"
 
A retired Government officer from the South writes:libtech_415_footnote
 I gather from the Hindu of Madras that you have published in  Young Indialibtech_416_footnote a new code of picketing liquor and foreign-cloth shops, and have invited your readers to send you any other rules for picketing they might think of. May I venture to suggest Punch’s famous advice : “Don’t” in this connection? In your most excellent addresslibtech_417_footnoteto the journalists explaining the terms of the Peace Pact you said among other things that freedom was not worth having if  it did not include freedom to err and even to sin, and you pointed out that when Almighty God Himself had given the humblest of His creatures full freedom even to sin it was unthinkable that any man should dare to deny the same complete freedom to his fellow-creatures. May I most respectfully ask you then why you are toiling night and day to prevent people from drinking liquor or wearing foreign cloth if they liked to do so ? . . . with results that would be totally embarrassing. I hope you will not fail to bestow your best thought on
 the matter and be quite sure that in encouraging picketing in any form you are not helping to ‘sow the wind’.
 The writer is plausible but not convincing. He forgets that picketing is as old as time. It does not need legalizing. The Settlement does not legalize that which was illegal before it. Picketing is the right of a reformer which he may not give up without giving up his cause.
 The writer has been betrayed into the common error of thinking that because a man has the freedom to err or to sin, any warning against sin would be an unpardonable interference with the freedom. The fact is that individual freedom to sin carried with it the freedom on the part of the public to wean the sinner from his sin and even to legislate against it. ‘The wages of sin is death.’ No one can sin or err with impunity. What I have protested against and what the world has always resented is the arrogant and unctuous assumption by authority to force people against their will to be ‘good’ and to claim infallibi- lity about its standard of what is good and what is bad. Peaceful picketing on the other hand is a friendly warning against a practice that a reformer thinks to be bad. When it goes beyond that point, and becomes violent, the law steps in and prevents the person from inter- fering with the human liberty. The writer has pictured the dangers of picketing in certain conditions. He is not even original in his illus- trations. Temples have been picketed before now. Only the attempt proved futile and was given up. And there is nothing to prevent any person from renewing such picketing so long as he observes the rule of the game and does not mind public opprobrium. Picketing  of drink and drug shops and foreigncloth shops has been possible and largely successful because there is a public feeling against these shops. There is therefore no danger of the Congress having ‘sown the wind and reaping the whirlwind’. Picketing of the educative type has come to stay, for it has proved its usefulness.

432,,AN INGENIOUS SUGGESTION,"
    
 A correspondent sends the following ingenious suggestion for solving the communal puzzle :
 The Hindu and Muslim communities should have equality of votes in every province. As an adjustment of communal voting, this is obviously unjust to the majority community. The idea, however, is not to adjust but to nullify communal voting. The result of adopting my suggestions will be that every question on which the two communities find themselves ranged on opposite sides at the polls will in effect be decided by the votes of the other (minority) communities. It is understood that these other communities will have proportional representation.
 I make no comment on it for the simple reason that everything will commend itself to me if it commends itself to the communities concerned. Will the Mussalmans be satisfied, and how would the Sikhs fare?

439,,VIOLATION OF PLEDGE,"
    
A friend writes:libtech_420_footnote
 It is my confirmed belief thay my pledge not to visit the Ashram is still intact and that it has not been violated in the least. To abstain from going to the Ashram implies not staying there for any length of time. This never implied, and should not imply, that in case of need I cannot visit the sick there. Moreover, it did not and does not mean that I cannot go there if it becomes necessary to do so for the sake of the struggle itself. I cannot go there for my convenience or other selfish end.
 The Ashram is everything to me. I feel an attachment to it, as it is my creation. For me it is the place where my ideals can be realized.  It is a source of inspiration to me. Ever since my return to India, it is there that I derived the inspiration for many, if not all, of the fresh steps which I have taken. By beginning this latest struggle through the Ashram inmates, I hope that even in the unhappy event of everyone being defeated someone from the Ashram will come forward to continue the fight to the very end. Regarding the Ashram I cherish the hope and the delusion that at a time when violence prevails, a witness for non-violence will come forth from the Ashram. It may be that there are no grounds for this hope. It may well be that the person of whom we may entertain expectations may disappoint us, whereas one from whom we expect nothing at all may surpass our hopes. This may well happen. I am publicly giving expression to my fond hopes. I am pointing out where my expectations lie. My prayer is that many non- violent, truthful persons may arise in the country who will fight unto death. For me who has the illusion that even if this prayer is not granted, some fruit will at least be reaped from the Ashram—it is too much to give up the Ashram. My renunciation holds good only so far as my self-interest is concerned; it cannot imply the giving up of any occasion for rendering service. Such renunciation cannot  involve doing harm to its very object.
 I find no substance in the opposition to the red bungalow. The only offence which it has committed is that it is in the neighbourhood of the Ashram. It is absolutely detached from the  Ashram. Why should I not stay in the red bung a low if I have some work pertaining to the Ashram but do not wish to live in it? If there is no harm in staying at the Vidyapith, if there is no harm in  staying  at Ambalalbhai’s house, why cannot I stay at the red bungalow?
 As a matter of fact, I would not regard it as a violation of my pledge even if during my visits to Ahmedabad I put up at the Ashram. But I gave up the idea of doing so as that would have been misunderstood by people and from experience I find that it was all to the good.
 It is not right that we should interpret a pledge literally. Rather than stick to the letter, we should consider its spirit. This is the golden rule of interpreting a pledge. If more than one interpretation is possible, we should give up that which is favourable to us and suffer any inconvenience which results from an unfavourable interpretation and stick to it. Hence I cannot go to the Ashram or stay there for accepting some service there. If I am hungry and the Ashram is nearby, I cannot go there to get food but should suffer my hunger until I find food elsewhere.

440,,THE SARDA ACTlibtech_421_footnote,"
    
A correspondent asks the following questions:libtech_422_footnote
 In my opinion, the following are the replies, in the order of the questions:
 One 	can go and 	register complaints. A 	true priest would not 	yield to 	threats or pressure.  Risks 	have to 	be taken in 	trying to 	do a good 	deed. Hence 	when a 	certain course of 	action clearly seems to 	be our dharma, 	it should 	be followed 	even at 	the risk of 	one’s life and 	property. Every individual should 	decide for himself 	on every 	occasion whether 	his duty 	demands risking his 	life and property.  The 	Congress does 	not stop with mere political 	activity. It takes 	up all tasks 	which help in the uplift 	of the people. 	All servants 	of the 	nation—whether men 	or women—should 	bear this in 	mind while 	making their 	own decisions. Making a 	decision is 	not always 	an easy task. 	There are many 	reforms which 	have to be abandoned 	in the larger 	interests of the 	country. Hence the 	question that arises is 	always as 	follows : 	“By taking 	up the 	cause of 	this reform, do 	I increase 	or diminish 	my overall 	usefulness?” If the 	reply tends towards the 	latter, we should think twice before taking up the cause of that reform.

441,,WOMEN VOLUNTEERS AND KHADI,"
    
 There is an association of women volunteers in Nadiad and this question has come up there. Some people claim that a woman volun- teer can carry on picketing while clad in a mill-made sari, etc; that it is no longer necessary now for those working for the Congress to wear khadi. This reasoning is erroneous and the use of mill-made saris and other clothes is not permitted. The rule passed by the Congress is almost eight years old now. It was attacked by many and was fully discussed at the annual session. Despite this, Congress representatives have refused to alter the clause relating to khadi and hence khadi has
 
 now taken deep roots. No member of the Congress has the right to violate that rule or break that tradition. In my opinion, therefore, the above question should not have arisen at all.
 But I have been told that if the condition in regard to khadi is not relaxed, there will be a sharp fall in the number of women volun- teers and perhaps not a single woman volunteer will be forthcoming locally in the Kheda district who would be prepared to wear khadi. If this is a fact, it is a sad thing. Nevertheless, as the person who has laid down the Shastra of khadi, I am prepared to put up with this set-back. If there is real strength in khadi and if there is any tapascharya  behind it, it will overcome this new difficulty which it is facing.
 In the world, wherever people have swerved from the path of truth they have done so to evade such difficulties. There is no other motive for swerving from the path of truth. Human nature tries to avoid difficulties. It seeks an easy way out. The easy way takes one downhill, the difficult way leads one upwards. The rule of physics applies also to spiritual matters. An object drops heavily to the ground due to gravitation, whereas trying to lift it up makes one breathless. Hence neglecting khadi in our impatience to boycott foreign cloth is like abandoning the path of truth. Every volunteer—man or woman— should bear in mind that the boycott cannot succeed by deviating from that path, and even if succeeded, it would not be worth while. We regard the boycott of foreign cloth as our dharma because in it we see the means of satisfying, more or less, the hunger of crores of persons and the spinning-wheel is the means and this implies khadi. Hence no Congress volunteer, whether a man or a woman, can use anything but khadi.
 What, then, of mill-made cloth?—some people  thoughtlessly ask. The movement for boycott was not started for the sake of the Indian textile mills. However, mills too grow under the shade of the great tree of khadi. Khadi spreads at a snail’s pace. Its use has not yet become widespread. It is not available in every town and every local- ity. In such circumstances, the Indian mills can readily sell  their stocks. But if these compete with khadi, both would be faced with ruin. Whereas khadi needs the assistance of advertising and exhibi- tions, the Indian textile mills stand in no need of these. The latter get protection through the khadi movement.
 A woman volunteer who is aware of this situation, while pleading for boycott will insist upon the use of khadi and never ask the people
 to use mill-made cloth. She would not recommend the use of mill- made cloth even to those who refuse to use khadi. Patiently and lovin- gly, she will refute the arguments against kahdi and to the very end she will recommend its use. Fearlessly, yet with determination, she will say, “Indian mill-made cloth is not meant for you, it is only for those who have not heard the message of the Congress.”

442,,WORTH WHILE QUESTIONS,"
    
 A co-worker has sent me the following questionslibtech_423_footnotewhich were put to him:
 I  do  not  know  of   any  freedom  to  import  foreign  cotton.libtech_424_footnotelibtech_425_footnoteI personally believe that if foreign cotton is required to produce fine cloth, there is no harm in importing it. I see no harm in importing raw material from abroad if we can make use of it. We have seen that much harm is done by exporting raw material which we can utilize, but just as it is advantageous to export that which we cannot utilize, even so it is good to import any necessary raw material.
 Like raw cotton, raw silk may be imported from abroad, if that is necessary.libtech_426_footnoteSilk  in  its  raw  from  means  cocoons.   If   these   can   be imported from abroad and anyone orders them, there is no harm in doing so from the economic stand-point. However, from the stand- point of non-violence I would not approve of this trade.
 I have not heard of woollen “tops”.libtech_427_footnoteBut just as in accordance with the rule mentioned above, we cannot import foreign cotton or silk yarn, likewise we cannot import woollen “tops”. However, I do not know if an exception has been made in regard to this.
 How is it possible that no one would have to undergo any suffering while a country, steeped in slavery and reduced to dust, is attempting   to   recover   from   this   plight?libtech_428_footnoteThis   has   not   happened
 
 anywhere in history. A much larger number of weavers than those engaged in weaving foreign yarn at present were once engaged in weaving exclusively Indian yarn. If I had my way, I would make these weavers who are unemployed at present weave Indian yarn alone. With regard to such hardships, it is sufficient to realize that if those who have used foreign yarn or traded in it suffer losses or hardships now, it is their atonement for the sins they have committed so far.
 The answer to thislibtech_429_footnoteis contained in the above. In great struggles we cannot like Banias make petty calculations. Such calculations go ill with noble sentiments.
 The success which was achieved was due to the sentiment for khadi and the knowledge that the poor were being helped thereby.libtech_430_footnoteHowever much the Indian mills step up their production, boycott cannot be achieved if this sentiment is absent. The suggestion not to buy new cloth will not find acceptance without such sentiment. The shortage of khadi was experienced for one or two months only. At the end of that period, large quantities of khadi began to be produced. If there is a demand, the requisite amount of khadi can be produced within a short time. This is because the means which are at hand for the production of khadi are not available for the production of cloth in Indian mills. Nature is favourable to khadi. Indian mills have to take risks by opposing nature. I do not cite this as a drawback. Man goes in for many adventures by opposing nature and some of these are even desirable. At this juncture,by bringing in nature and showing that khadi is in keeping with it, I am only describing an existing situation. Experience has shown us that it is only after the advent of khadi era that we began to believe in the possibility of the boycott of
 
 which was largely used to feed handloom, there might be unemployment among handloom weavers and as the yarn produced by the mills and on the handloom did not come up to 40 counts, was it not prudent to postpone the boycott of such yarn, until the same could be produced in the country?”
 foreign cloth, it is only after that that there was an awakening among the people. It is only through the presence of khadi that we can, to some extent, save the mill-owners from the clutches of self-interest.

444,"April 	26, 1931",LETTER TO R. M. MAXWELL,"
          DEAR 	MR. MAXWELL,    AS 	AT BORSAD,  April 	26, 1931 
  	I thank you for your letterlibtech_433_footnoteof the 24th instant. I must apologize for the omission 	to send you a copy of my letter of the 20th instant to Mr. Garrett. 	I repair the omission now and send you a copy herewith as also 	translation of the circular now recalled. From the copy you will 	observe that I never claimed that the Government and the people can 	have no dealings with one another except through the Congress. My     
 objection was to the Mamlatdar’s notice issued over my head whilst negotiation was going on between Mr. Garrett and myself.  Mr.  Garrett, you will note, gave the following categorical reply:
 You refer to the Congress as an intermediary between the Government and the people. This is not one of the matters agreed upon in the Settlement and I am unable to agree to the suggestion.
 The position taken up in your letter under reply is surely diffe- rent from this as also different from what Mr. Garrett has taken up in his latest letter of which I attach copy herewith. He writes under date 24th instant.
 You write that ‘the Congress must be recognized as the  intermediary between the Government and the people whom the Congress represents’. I am unable to see anything in the terms of the Settlement which bears on this point. There is nothing to prevent the Congress advising people as to what they should do, nor can any restriction be placed on the duty  of  the Government officers to perform their functions directly with those concerned.
It will be observed that the quotation from my letter is torn from
 its context and is thus made to bear a meaning which is wider than the one it bears when read in its context. Mr. Garrett wrote the letter after having ordered the issue of a revised notice by Mamlatdars not very different from the notice which is substitutes.
 My contention is that even the new notice is premature and that in any case it should not have been issued without consultation with the local workers. Such notices become necessary only when it has become clear that the people affected are deliberately withholding payment. That this is not the case at present is manifest from the fact that the people have been paying as fast as it is possible in spite of the non-fulfilment in several respects by the Government of the terms of the Settlement. This is hardly consistent with the terms of the Settle- ment which contemplates amicable relations and mutual trust. I con- fess that here, in Gujarat, see not only no trust but a secretiveness and distrust which one see when the relations are strained. I hope that the matter will receive His Excellency’s immediate attention. Notwith- standing the serious grievance, I want to gove my assurance that I am anxious that the people should carry out their part of the Settlement to the fullest extent possible.
 
 If His Excellency the Acting Governor thinks that any useful purpose can be served by mutual discussion let him consider me to be at his disposal.
 Yours sincerely,

     DEAR 	FRIEND,  April 	26, 1931 
  	I thank you for your letter as also a copy of the speech you would 	have made at the Sikh Leaguelibtech_437_footnote. With some parts of your letter I can heartily agree 	and I wish that we were rid of the slightest commu- nal taint. But 	it seems that, if there is any settlement in the immediate future, 	there would be at least some communalism about it.  	I have never been able to understand the nationalism which remains 	nationalistic only if all the rest do so and otherwise become 	uncompromisingly communalistic.  	I have not the dread that you have of adult suffrage. Every form of 	suffrage will be liable to abuse, adult suffrage perhaps the least 	so. And I have an effective antidote that might, to a certain 	extent, obviate the mischief. But I need not dilate upon it at the 	present moment.  	I am also in agreement with you that we should have education on the 	widest scale possible of the masses, not so much of children as of 	grown-up men and women who will presently be armed with great powers 	for good or evil. That education, I think, the Congress has given 	not always successfully, not always well, but on the whole 	undoubtedly successfully and well.  	I do think that the association of high salaries with efficiency and 	public honesty is an hypnotic effect produced by the rulers. The 	sooner we get out of it the better it will be for us. The present 	civil service is open to influences which are far more subtle and 	deadly than open bribery. Nor do I consider the administration to be 	efficient except in so far as it guarantees at the point of the 	bayonet safety for the lives of the European population but 	certainly not of the masses. I think that we have patriotic men and 	women enough in the country who, when we come to our own, will 	gladly give their services for maintenance money that will easily 	bear comparison with the average imcome of the toiling but starving 	millions. Poverty, if it is due to ignorance, is no less due to 	heartless unparalleled exploitation.     
 Thus though we have differences of opinion I have valued your letter and the enclosure, both of which I have read with a great deal of interest. Do please therefore favour me again whenever you have anything of importance to tell me.

 When Mr. Gandhi arrived the villagers told him that all their rice crop worth about Rs. 50,000 which was the main crop of the village, had been attached and sold to a parsi for Rs. 1,400. They had no means of support and depended on the relief given by the Congress, but still the Mamlatdar called upon them to pay land revenue.
 Mr. Gandhi said that in view of their condition they were entitled under the terms of the Truce to get time for the payment of land revenue. He advised them as well as all peasants in Gujarat to pay land revenue if they could, but if they could not pay they should not be afraid to refuse to pay land revenue and patiently bear all the consequences. . . .

 APPENDIX I
 PRIME MINISTER’S DECLARATION AT R.T.C .libtech_439_footnote
 January 19, 1931
 The view of His Mejesty’s Government is that responsibility for the Govern- ment of India should be placed upon Legislatures, Central and Provincial, with such provisions as may be necessary to guarantee, during a period of transition, the observance of certain obligations and to meet other special circumstances, and also with such guarantees as are required by minorities to protect their political liberties and rights.
 In such statutory safeguards as may be made for meeting the needs of the transitional period, it will be a primary concern of His Majesty’s Government to see that the reserved powers are so framed and  excercised  as  not  to  prejudice  the advance of India through the new constitution to full responsibility for her own government.
 His Majesty’s Government, whilst making this declaration, is aware that some of the conditions which are essential to the working of such a constitution as is contemplated, have not been finally settled, but it believes that as the result of the work done here, they have been brought to a point which encourages the hope that further negotiations, after this declaration, will be successful.
 His Majesty’s Government has taken note of the fact that the deliberations of the Conference have proceeded on the basis, accepted by all parties, that the Central Government should be a Federation of all-India, embracing both the Indian States and British India in a bi-cameral legislature. The precise form and structure of the new Federal Government must be determined after further discussion with the Princes and representatives of British India. The range of subjects to be committed to it will also require further discussion, because the Federal Government will have authority only in such matters concerning the States as will be ceded by their Rulers in agreements made by them to entering into Federation. The connection of the States with the Federation will remain subject to the basic principle that in regard to all matters not
 
 ceded by them to the Federation their relations will be with the Crown acting through the agency of the Viceroy.
 With a Legislature constituted on a federal basis. His Majesty’s Government will be prepared to recognize the principle of the responsibility of the Executive to the Legislature.
 Under existing condition the subjects of Defence and External Affairs will be reserved to the Governor-General, and arrangements will be made to place in his hands the powers necessary for the administration of those subjects. Moreover, as the Governor-General must, as a last resort, be able in an emergency to mintain the tranquillity of the State, and must similarly be responsible for the observance of the constitutional rights of minorities, he must be granted the necessary powers for these purposes.
 As regards finance, the transfer of financial responsibility must necessarily be subject to such conditions as will ensure the fulfilment of the obligations incurred under the authority of the Secretary of State and the maintenance unimpaired of the financial stability and credit of India. The Report of the Federal Structure sub- Committee indicates some ways of dealing with this subject including a Reserve Bank, the service of loans, and Exchange policy, which in the view of His Majesty’s Government will have to be provided for somehow in the new constitution. It is of vital interest to all parties in India to accept these provisions to maintain financial confidence. Subject to these provisions the Indian Government would have full financial responsibility for the methods or raising revenue and for the control of expenditure on non-reserved services.
 This will mean that under existing conditions the Central Legislature and Executive will have some features of dualism which will have to be fitted into the constitutional structure.
 The provision of reserved powers is necessary in the circumstanced and some such reservation has indeed been incidental to the development of most free constitutions. But every care must be taken to prevent conditions arising which will necessitate their use. It is, for instance, undesirable that Ministers should trust to the special powers of the Governor-General as a means of avoiding responsibilities which are properly their own, thus defeating the development of responsible Govern- ment by bringing into use powers meant to lie in reserve and in the background. Let there be no mistake about that.
 The Governor’s Provinces will be constituted on a basis of full responsibility. Their Ministries will be taken from the Legislature and will be jointly responsible to it. The range of Provincial subjects will be so defined as to give them the greatest possible measure of self-government. The authority of the Federal Government will be limited to provision required to secure its administration of Federal subjects, and
 so discharge its responsibility for subjects defined in the constitution as of all-India concern.
 There will be reserved to the Government only that minimum of special powers which is required in order to secure, in exceptional circumstances, the preser- vation of tranquillity, and to guarantee the maintenance of rights provided by Statute for the Public Services and minorities.
 Finally, His Majesty’s Government considers that the institution in the Pro- vinces of responsible government requires both that the legislatures should be enlarged, and that they should be based on a more liberal franchis.
 In framing the Constitution His Majesty’s Government considers that it will be its duty to insert provisions guaranteeing to the various minorities, in addition to political representation, that differences of religion, race, sect or cast shall not themselves constitute civic disabilities.
 In the opinion of His Majesty’s Government it is the duty of the communities to come to an agreement amongst themselves on the points raised by the Minorities sub-Committee but not settled there. During the continuing negotiations such an agreement ought to be reached and the Government will continue to render what good offices it can to help to secure that end, as it is anxious not only that no delay should take place in putting the new Constitution into operation, but that it should start with the goodwill and confidence of all the communities concerned.
 The various sub-committee which have been studying the more important principles of a Constitution which would meet Indian condition have surveyed a considerable part of the structure in detail and the still unsettled points have been advanced a good way to an agreement. His Majesty’s Government, however, in view  of the character of the Conference and of the limited time at its disposal in London, has deemed it advisable to suspend its work at this point, so that Indian opinion may be consulted upon the work done, and expedients considered for overcoming the difficulties which have been raised. His Majesty’s Government will consider, without delay, a plan by which our co-operation may be continued so that the result of our completed work may be seen in a new Indian Constitution. If, in the mean time, there is a response to the Viceroy’s appeal to those engaged at present in civil disobe- dience, and others wish to co-operate on the general lines of this declaration, steps will be taken to enlist their services.
 I must convey to you all on behalf of the Government its hearty appreciation of the services you have rendered not only to India but to this country, by coming here and engaging in these personal negotiations. Personal contact is the best way  of removing those unfortunate differences and misunderstandings which too many people on both sides have been engendering between us in recent years. A mutual understanding of intention and difficulty, gained under such conditions as have
 prevailed here, is by far the best way for discovering ways and means of settling differences and satisfying claims. His Majesty’s Government will strive to secure such an amount of agreement as will enable the new Constitution to be passed through the British Parliament and to be put into operation with the active goodwill of the people of both countries.

 VICEROY’S STATEMENT libtech_440_footnote
 NEW  DELHI,
 January 26, 1931
 The following statement has been issued by His Excellency the Governor- General this afternoon :
 “In order to provide opportunity for the consideration of the statement made by the Prime Minister on the 19th January, my Government, in consultation with local Governments, have thought it right that the members of the Working Committee of the All-India Congress should enjoy full liberty of discussion between themselves and with those who have acted as members of the Committee since Ist January, 1930.
 “In accordance with this decision and with this object, and in order that there may be no legal bar to any meeting they may wish to hold, the notification declaring the Committee to be an unlawful Association under the Criminal Law Amendment Act will be withdrawn by all local Governments and action will be taken for the release of Mr. Gandhi and others who are now members of the Gommittee, or who have acted as such, since Ist January 1930.
 “My Government will impose no conditions on these releases, because we feel that the best hope of the restoration of peaceful condition lies in discussions being conducted by those concerned under term of unconditional liberty. Our action has been taken in pursuance of a sincere desire to assist the creation of such peaceful condition as would enable the Government to implement the undertaking given by the Prime Minister that if civil quiet were proclaimed and assured, the Government would not be backward in response.
 “I am content to trust those who will be affected by our decision to act in the same spirit as inspires it. And I am confident that they will recognize the importance  of securing for those grave issues calm and dispassionate examination.”

 LETTER FROM GANGABEHN VAIDYAlibtech_441_footnote
 You know that there was to be a procession in honour of Lilavati and as a protest against the ourtrageous assault on her by the police. It was not possible for me to keep out of the procession. In fact I took it upon myself to organize the procession by placing the Ashram girls at the head of small batches of women coming from various parts of the town. Whilst I was leading my batch I was informed that Shakariben and Kalavatiben who were at the head of the Ras batch were being belaboured by the police with lathis. I immediately ran to the spot. I found that a girl was profusely bleeding. I went and cheered her up and asked the rest of the sisters to march forward reciting Raghupati Raghava Raja Ram. I was also asking the passers- by to keep on one side of the road so as not to obstruct the procession, when all of a sudden the policy came down upon us with a shower of lathi-blow. I came in for a big share of them, receiving several on the head, the arms, the back, the face and the ears. Blood streamed out from a wound caused on my head but I did not budge an inch and asked the other sisters to sit down. Seeing that I would not be deterred the Foujdar came and arrested me and handed me over to the police. I was taken, bleeding, to the police choki where I found Shakariben, Kalavati, Padma, Lakshmi and Madhu who had all had their share of the blows. My head was still bleeding and I sat down allowing the sun’s rays to fall on the bleeding part. I was perfectly peaceful. Some time after the police came and asked every one of us if we had been injured. “Can’t you see with your own eyes ?” I told them. To which he replied: “You would like to be taken to the hospital ?” “No”, said I, “suppose we can get well without medical aid.” At this moment another police official arrived on the scene and sternly said to the man who was gloting over our agonies : “Don’t you see that she is still bleedin? Take them quickly to the hospital. How could you allow them to remain here unattended so long?” Thereupon we were taken to the hospital where we found Maitri, Lalita, Lakshmi and other girls who had all been hammered and already admitted as in- patients. My wound was then dressed. It was, the doctor told me, three quarters of an inch to one inch. The others were treated, but were later turned out, evidently because they had chosen to arrest only Vasumati and me.
 We are in the lock-up. My wound is being dressed daily and I am quite  happy and peaceful.  I  have my  prayers regularly, but have  not  yet  been  given my takli.  It was on this occasion that I understood somewhat the meaning of ahimsa.    I was quite fearless when the blows were coming down upon me and I assure you that I had no hatred or anger in me. Even now I feel no resentment towards the police, and it
 
 is growing upon me that we shall achieve success only to the extent we cultivate the spirit of ahimsa. The other sisters bore the blows with exemplary brabery. In some cases the assaults were outrageous, many being kicked on their chests with the hells of the policemen’s boots. Not one budged an inch, everyone stood unflinching at her post. Wherefrom came this sudden access of courage and strength, I wonder. God was with us I am sure. He gave us the strength.
 I will not trouble you with more details. The girls will write themselves. Bombay Secret Abstracts, 750(14)-0-PTA

 VICEROY’S CABLE TO SECRETARY OF STATElibtech_442_footnote
 Immediate, Private and Personal
 I  HAVE  HAD   TWO   LONG   TALKS   WITH   GANDHI.   APART FROM   THE   VARIETY   OF   IMPORTANT   POINTS   RELATING   TO    ACTUAL    TERMS    ON WHICH     CONGRESS     WOULD    CALL     OFF     CIVIL    DISOBEDIENCE     TO WHICH I WILL REFER LATER, THE MAIN MATTERS OF SUBSTANCE WE DISCUSSED WERE:
 THE 	SCOPE OF FUTURE CONSTITUTIONAL DISCUSSIONS;  THE 	INTENTIO OF 	THE CONGRESS, IF THEY CAME INTO THE DISCUSSION, REGARDING POTENTIAL 	RESUMPTION OF CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE. 
  AS 	 TO  THE  FIRST  I  TOLD  HIM  THAT  THREE  MAIN   PRINCIPLES   OF 	THE	CONFERENCE WERE 	FEDERATION, SAFEGUARDS AND INDIAN 	RESPONSIBILITY, THAT 	THESE WERE FUNDAMENTAL,  BUT  DETAILED 	APPLICATION OF THESE 	PRINCIPLES WAS OPEN TO FURTHER DISCUSSION.  HE 	ASKED ABOUT THE RIGHT TO RAISE IN  DISCUSSION  THE 	 QUESTION OF 	DISSOLUTION OF PARTNERSHIP  BY  WHICH  HE  PRESUMABLY MEANT THE 	RIGHT  OF  SE-CESSION  FROM  THE  EMPIRE.  I  SAID  THAT  I PRESUMED 	HE COULD 	RAISE IT, IF 	HE SO DESIRED, BUT 	THAT IT 	WOULD BE 	VERY DAMAGING 	IF HE MADE ANY PUBLIC 	STATEMENT TO  THIS  EFFECT.  I GATHER  HE   DID   NOT   ATTACH   	MUCH   IMPORTANCE   TO   THE   POINT   AND 	THIS IMPRESSION HAS BEEN 	CONFIRMED BY SAPRU AND OTHERS.  HE 	ALSO MENTIONED QUESTION OF STATE SUBJECTS. I SAID I PRESUMED HE 	COULD RAISE THE MATTER IN DISCUSSION, BUT THAT HE WOULD 	FIND HIMSELF 	UP AGAINST 	THE PRINCES. 	HERE AGAIN, 	MY IMPRESSION 	IS THAT 	HE DOES 	NOT WISH TO PRESS THE MATTER. 
 
 
  I 	FEEL WE 	MUST BE 	VERY CAREFUL 	NOT TO 	GET INTO A 	POSITION OF 	CON    FUSION AND 	MISUNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE CONSTITUTIONAL POSITION.   I HAVE, 	I HOPE, 	KEPT IT 	CLEAR UP 	TO DATE; BUT 	I AM SURE IT WOULD 	BE DANGEROUS 	TO PERMIT 	CONGRESS TO SAY 	TO THE 	WORLD THAT 	EVERYTHING WAS 	OPEN FOR DISCUSSION, AND THAT THEY HAD MADE IT CLEAR AS  A CONDITION 	OF PARTICIIPATON THAT IF THEY WERE NOT SATISFIED THEY WOULD RESUME 	CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE. IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES IT WOULD PROBABLY BE 	BETTER NOT TO HAVE THEM IN AT ALL. MUCH DEPENDS UPON A CLEAR 	STATEMENT OF THE SCOPE OF DISCUSSION. IF THIS IS CONFUSED, WE MAY 	LATER GET A 	BIG LANDSLIDE 	IN ALL 	PARTIES BOTH 	HERE AND AT HOME 	AND SO LOSE 	ALL THE ADVANTAGE 	GAINED BY THE 	CONFERENCE. PRIME 	MINISTER IN HIS 	ANNOUNCEMENT PROMISED THAT STEPS WOULD BE TAKEN TO ENLIST SERVICE OF 	THOSE WHO WISH TO CO-OPERATE ON GENERAL LINES OF HIS DECLARATION, 	BUT   I FEEL THAT IN DEALING 	WITH THE 	CONGRESS IT IS NECESSARY TO  HAVE CLEARER 	DEFINITION, AND I AM 	INCLINED TO 	A STATEMENT IN 	THE FOLLOWING SENSE. 	FEDERATION IS AN ESSENTIAL OF THE SCHEME, SO ALSO ARE SAFEGUARDS 	SECURING CROWN CONTROL OF DEFENCE AND EXTERNAL AFFAIRS,  THE 	FINANCIAL CREDIT OF INDIA AND THE DISCHARGE OF OBLIGATIONS. THE 	EXACT METHOD BY WHICH EFFECT MAY BE GIVEN TO PRINCIPAL OF FEDERATION 	AND TO SUCH SAFEGUARDS IS 	MATTER FOR 	DISCUSSION. IF 	CONGRESS CANNOT ACCEPT 	THIS POSITION THEN 	DISCUSSION WITH THEM 	WOULD BE 	UNPROFITABLE. I SHOULD BE 	GRATEFUL IF 	YOU COULD 	CONSIDER AND BE 	PREPARED TO 	LET ME 	HAVE AS 	PRECISE A 	STATEMENT AS 	POSSIBLE SHOWING THE 	POSITION OF 	HIS MAJESTY’S 	GOVERNMENT IN THESE 	MATTERS. I DISCUSSED 	THIS WITH SAPRU, 	SASTRI, JAYAKAR AND SAFI TODAY AND THEY AGREED TO ABOVE DEFINITION 	OF SCOPE OF DISCUSSIONS. THEY WERE AVERSE TO ANY MORE NARROW DEFINITION.  IN 	REGARD TO POTENTIAL RESUMPTION OF CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE MOVEMENT 	AFTER ITS ABANDONMENT, 	GANDHI TOLD ME THAT 	HE COULD 	NOT GIVE 	ASSURANCE THAT CONGRESS WOULD IN NO CIRCUMSTANCES RESUME CIVIL 	DISOBEDIENCE MOVEMENT, 	BUT THAT 	IF THEY 	CAME INTO THESE DISCUSSIONS 	THEY WOULD DO 	SO WITH THE 	GENUINE DESIRE TO 	MAKE THEM A 	SUCCESS AND 	WOULD NOT, IN ANY CASE, 	RESUME CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE BEFORE THEIR CONCLUSION. 	I UNDERSTOOD 	HIS MEANING 	TO BE THAT 	THERE WOULD BE 	NO QUESTION 	OF RESUMPTION WHILE THE 	CONSTITUTIONAL DISCUSSIONS CONTINUED 	IN INDIA, 	BUT THAT HE 	COULD NOT 	BIND HIMSELF FURTHER THAN 	THIS. SAPRU AND THE 	OTHERS REGARDED IT AS ESSENTIAL THAT THERE SHOULD BE DEFINITE 	UNDERSTANDING THAT PEACEFUL ATMOSPHERE SHOULD PREVAIL 	DURING DISCUSSION IN 	INDIA, AND 	THEY CONSIDERED THAT 	IF THIS 	WAS NOT FORTHCOMING 	IT WAS 	USELESS FOR 	THE CONGRESS TO 	COME IN. 	I AGREE 	WITH THIS VIEW, BUT DOUBT WHETHER WE CAN TIE HIM DOWN MORE CLOSELY.  MATTERS 	RELATING TO GOVERNMENT 	ACTION, SUCH AS 	AMNESTY, SALT, ETC., WILL 	ONLY ARISE IF 	CONSTITUTIONAL POSITION 	IS SATISFACTORILY 	CLEARED UP. 	I ANTICIPATE CONSIDERABLE 	TROUBLE IN REGARD 	TO THEM, 	BUT WE 	SHALL OF 	COURSE CONSULT YOU 	BEFORE WE 	COME TO 	ANY CONCLUSION, IF 	WE GET TO FAR. GENERAL 	ATMOSPHERE OF OUR DISCUSSION WAS QUITE FRIENDLY AND 
 I HAVE LEARNT THAT GANDHI  IS  PLEASED  AND  WANTS  PEACE,  BUT  I  AM  VERY APPREHENSIVE OF HIS MANOEUVRING YOU AND US INTO  A  POSITION WHERE CONGRESS COULD PLAUSIBLY REPRESENT THAT THEY GOT BEHIND THE WORK OF THE CONFERENCE AND HAD SECURED THE RIGHT TO REOPEN THE WHOLE SUBJECT. THE PROBLEM THEREFORE IS HOW TO SECURE OURSELVES AGAINST THIS, WITHOUT REFUSING TOO FULL A LATITUDE  OF  DISCUSSION WITHIN THE WIDEST LIMITS THAT CONFERENCE AGREEMENTS LEAVE POSSIBLE.
  IF 	DISCUSSIONS ARE 	TO PROCEED 	FURTHER I FEEL 	THAT THEY MUST RESUME 	WIDER SCOPE. ON RECEIPT 	OF YOUR 	REPLY I PROPOSE 	TO SEE 	GANDHI MYSELF 	AND STATE TO HIM PRECISE LIMITS OF CONSTITUTIONAL DISCUSSIONS. IF HE 	ACCEPTS THESE OR IF AFTER HEARING THESE HE IS PREPARED TO PURSUE THE 	MATTER FURTHER, I PROPOSE 	THAT OUTSTANDING 	QUESTIONS SHOULD BE EXAMINED 	AT A COFNERENCE 	OVER WHICH I WOULD 	PRESIDE AND CONSISTING 	OF SENIOR 	EUROPEAN INDIAN MEMBERS OF 	MY COUNCIL—HOME 	SECRETARY, SAPRU, SASTRI, JAYAKAR, SAFI, CHHATTARI, PROBABLY ANOTHER 	MUHAMMADAN, A EUROPEAN 	NON-OFFICIAL MEMBER OF 	THE ASSEMBLY WTH 	GANDHI AND 	TWO OR 	THREE CONGRESS 	REPRESENTATIVES NAMED BY 	HIM. I 	ANTICIPATE THAT, IF 	EVERYTHING WENT WELL, 	THIS CONFERENCE MIGHT MEET ABOUT THE 27TH AND 	WOULD ASK FOR YOUR 	APPROVAL TO IT.

 JAWAHARLAL NEHRU‘S NOTE ON PROVISIONAL SETTLEMENTlibtech_443_footnote
 In consequence of the provisional settlement between the Working Committee and the Government of India a period of truce has been proclaimed. It is with regret that, on the morrow of this agreement, I have to strike a note of discord. I recognize that, in many respects, the terms of settlement  are honourable and give evidence   of the strength that the nation has gained by  the  sacrifice  and  suffering  of  the past year. I  recognize also  that  the  settlement  is  provisional,  leaving  all  the vital questions open, and the final settlement  is yet to come.   But I  feel that there  is a certain commitment in it regarding the scope of discussions and a certain limitation of our ideal as laid down at Lahore. Safeguards and reservations  are  referred to and, although these are said to be in the interests of India, they may be, and I fear will be, interpreted to mean a limitation of our freedom in regard to defence, external affairs, finances and the public debt.  The  Congress  and  the Working Committee are pledged to the full control by the people of India of the defence services, the financial and economic policy, and the . . .libtech_444_footnotemany of my colleagues of the W.C. are of opinion that the reference to safeguards and reser- vation does not limit their freedom in any way to work for the independence of India.    I hope they are right and will prove their contention by their achievements in the coming  Conference.	But, as I cannot get over my doubts in regard to this phraseology, I am unable to accept or reconcile myself to any reference to safeguards and reservations. I do not desire however that any impediment should be placed in the way of those who interpret the words differently from me and who propose to extract independence   out  of  them.	Truce having been proclaimed by the Working Committee, I trust all of us will honour it and carry out the directions of the W.C. in regard to it.

 APPENDIX VI
 PROVISIONAL SETTLEMENT
 The following statementlibtech_445_footnoteby the Governor General in Council published in the Gazette of India Extraordinary of 5th March 1931 gives the conditions on which the civil disobedience movement is to be suspended pending  final terms  of settlement.
 Consequent 	on the 	conversations that 	have taken place between His 
 Excellency the Viceroy and Mr. Gandhi, it has been arranged that the  civil disobedience movement, be discontinued, and that, with the approval  of  His Majesty’s Government certain action be taken by the Government of India and local Governments.
  As 	regards constitutional 	questions, the scope 	of future 	discussion is 	stated, with 	the assent of 	His Majesty’s 	Government, to 	be with the object of 	considering further the 	scheme for 	the constitutional 	Government of India 	discussed at 	the Round 	Table Conference. Of 	the scheme 	there outlined, 	Federation is an 	essential part; so 	also are Indian 	responsibility and 	reservation; or 	safeguards in 	the interest 	of India, 	for such 	matters as, for instance, 	defence; external 	affairs; the 	position of minorities; the financial credit of India, and the discharge of obligations.  In 	pursuance of the statement 	made by the Prime 	Minister in 	his announcement 	of the 	19th of January 	1931, steps will be 	taken for the 	participation of 	the representative 	of the 	Congress in 	the further 	discussion that are to 	take place 	on the 	scheme of 	constitutional reform.  The 	settlement relates 	to activities 	directly connected with 	the civil 	disobedience movement. Civil	disobedience 	will be effectively 	discontinued and 	reciprocal action will 	be taken 	by Government. 	The effective 	discontinuance of the 	civil dis- 	obedience movement 	means the effective 	discontinunace of 	 all  activities  in 	furtherance thereof, by  whatever  methods 	 pursued  and,  in  	particular,  the 	following: 
 The 	organized defiance of 	the provisions of 	any law. The movement for the non-payment of land revenue and other legal 
 dues.
 The publication of news-sheets in support of the civil disobedience 
 movement.
  Attempts 	to influence 	civil and 	military servants of 	village officials 	against Government or 	to persuade them to resign their posts. 
 
  As 	regards the 	boycott of 	foreign goods, there are 	two issues involved: 	firstly, the 	character of 	the boycott 	and secondly, 	the methods 	employed in giving 	effect to it. 	The position 	of Government 	is as follows. 	They approve 	of the 	encouragement of 	Indian industries as 	part of 	the economic 	and industrial 	movement designed 	to improve 	the material 	condition of 	India, and 	they have no desire 	to discourage 	methods of propaganda, 	persuasion or 	advertisement pursued 	with this 	object in 	view, which do 	not interfere with the 	freedom of 	action of 	individuals, or 	are not 	prejudicial to 	the maintenance 	of law 	and order. But 	the boycott of 	non-Indian goods 	(except of cloth 	which has been 	applied to all 	foreign cloth) has 	been directed 	during the 	civil disobedience 	movement cheifly, if not 	exclusively, against 	British goods, and 	in regard 	to these 	it has 	been admittedly employed 	in order 	to exert 	pressure for 	political ends. 
 It is accepted that a boycott of this character, and organized for this purpose, will not be consistent with the participation of representatives of the Congress in a frank and friendly discussion of constitutional questions between representatives of British India, of the Indian States, and of His Majesty’s Government and political parties in England, which the settlement is intended to secure. It is, therefore, agreed that the discontinuance of the civil disobedience movement connotes the definite discontinuance of the employment of the boycott of British commodities as  a political weapon and that, in consequence, those who have given up, during a time of political excitement, the sale or purchase of British goods must be left free without any form of restraint to change their attitude if they so desire.
  In 	regard to 	the methods employed in 	furtherance of 	the replacement of 	non-Indian by 	Indian goods, or 	against the 	consumption of 	intoxicating liquor 	and drugs, 	resort will not be 	had to 	methods coming within the 	category of 	picketing, except 	within the limits 	permitted by 	the ordinary 	law. Such picketing, 	shall be 	unaggressive and 	it shall 	not involve 	coercion, intimidation, 	restraint, hostile 	demonstration, 	obstruction to the 	public, or 	any offence 	under the ordinary 	law. If 	and when 	any of 	these methods is 	employed in 	any place, 	the practice 	of picketing 	in that 	place will be suspended.  Mr. 	Gandhi has drawn the attention 	of Government 	to specific 	allegation against 	the conduct 	of the 	police, and 	represented the 	desirability of 	a public 	enquiry into them. In 	present circumstances 	Government see great 	 difficulty  in 	this course and feel that it must inevitably lead to  charges and 	counter-charges, and   so 	militate against the 	re-establishment of 	peace. Having regard to 	these conside- 	rations, Mr. 	Gandhi agreed not 	to press the matter.  The 	action that Government 	will take on the 	discontinuance of 	the civil disobedience 	movement is stated 	in the 	following paragraphs.  Ordinances 	promulgated in connection 	with the civil 	disobedience movement 	will be withdrawn. 	Ordinance No. 1 of 1931 	relating to the terrorist 	move- ment does not 	come within the 	scope of the provision.  Notifications 	declaring association unlawful under 	the Criminal Law 	Amendment Act 	of 1908 will be 	withdrawn, provided that 	the notifications 	were made in connection 	with the civil 	disobedience movement. 
 The notifications recently issued by the Burma Government under the Criminal Law Amendment Act do not come within the scope of this provision.
  (i) 	Pending prosecutions 	will be 	withdrawn if 	they have been 	filed in connection with 	the civil 	disobedience movement and 	relate to 	offences which do 	not involve violence other than technical violence, or incitement to such violence. 
  The 	same principles will 	apply to 	proceedings under 	the security provisions 	of the Criminal 	Procedure Code.  Where 	a local 	Government has moved 	any High Court 	or has 	initiated proceedings 	under the 	Legal Practitioners’s 	Act in 	regard to 	the conduct 	of legal 	practitioners in 	connection with 	the civil 	disobedience movement, 	it will make application 	to the 	Court concerned 	for permission 	to withdraw 	such proceedings, 	provided that the 	alleged conduct of 	the persons concerned 	does not relate 	to violence 	of incitement 	to violence.  Prosecutions, 	if any, 	against soldiers and 	police involving 	disobe- dience of orders will not come within the scope of this provision. 
  (i) 	Those prisoners will 	be released 	who are undergoing 	imprisonment in 	connection with the 	civil disobedience 	movement for offences 	which did not involve 	violence, other than technical violence, or incitement to such violence. 
  If 	any prisoner 	who comes 	within the scope 	of (i) 	above has 	been also sentenced 	for a 	jail offence, not 	involving violence, other 	than technical violence, or 	incitement to 	such violence, 	the latter 	sentence also 	will be remitted, 	or if a prosecution 	relating to 	an offence of this 	character is pending 	 against  such 	 a  prisoner, it 	will be withdrawn.  Soldiers 	and police 	convicted of 	offences involving 	disobedience of orders—in 	the very 	few cases 	that have occurred—will not 	come within the 	scope of 	the amnesty. 
  Fines 	which have not been realized will be remitted. Where an order for 	the forfeiture of 	security has 	been made under the 	security provisions of 	the Criminal 	Procedure Code, and the security has not been realized, it will be similarly remitted. 
 Fines which have been realized and securities forfeited and realized under any law will not be returned.
  Additional 	police imposed 	in connection 	with the 	civil disobedience 	movement at the expense of the inhabitants of a particular area will be withdrawn at 
 the discretion of local Governments. Local Governments will not refund any money, not in excess of the actual cost, that has been realized, but they will remit any sum that has not been realized.
  (a) 	Movble property, 	which is 	not an 	illegal possession 	and which 	has been 	seized in connection with 	the civil disobedience 	movement,  under 	 the Ordinances 	or the 	provisions of 	the Criminal 	Law, will be returned, 	if it is still 	in the 	possession of Government. 
  Movable 	property, forfeited 	or attached in connection 	with the 	realization of 	land revenue of 	other dues, will be 	returned, unless the 	Collector of 	the District 	has reason 	to believe 	that the defaulter 	will contumaciously refuse to 	pay the 	dues recoverable from him 	within a 	reasonable period. 	In deciding  what  is  a 	reasonable period, 	special regard will be 	paid to 	cases in 	which the 	defaulters, while 	willing to pay, 	genuinely require time 	for the purpose, and 	if necessary, 	the revenue 	will be suspended in 	accordance with the ordinary principles 	of land revenue 	administration. Compensation 	will not be 	given for deterioration.  Where 	movable property has been 	sold or otherwise 	finally disposed of by 	Government, compensation 	will not 	be given 	and the sale 	proceeds will 	not be 	returned, except in 	so far as they are 	in excess of 	the legal dues for 	which the 	property may 	have been sold.  It 	will be 	open to 	any person 	to seed 	any legal 	remedy he may 	have on 	the ground 	that the attachment 	or seizure 	of property 	was not in 	accordance with 	the law. 
  (a) 	Immovable property 	of which possession 	has been taken 	under Ordinance 	IX of 1930 	will be returned 	in accordance 	with the 	provisions of 	the Ordinance. 
  Land 	and other immovable 	property in the 	possession of 	Government, which 	has been 	forfeited or 	attached in 	connection with the 	realization of 	land revenue or 	other dues, will be 	returned unless the 	Collector of 	the district 	has reason 	 to believe 	that the defaulter 	will contumaciously 	refuse to pay 	the dues recoverable from 	him within 	a reasonable 	period. In 	deciding what is  a  reasonable 	 period special regard 	will be paid 	to cases 	in which 	the defaulter, 	while willing to 	pay, genuinely, 	requires time for 	the purpose, and 	if necessary the 	revenues will be suspended in accordance with the ordinary principles of land revenue administration.  Where 	immovale property has 	been sold to third 	parties, the 	transac- tion must be regarded as final, so far as Government are concerned. 
 NOTE. Mr. Gandhi has representedlibtech_446_footnoteto Government that according to his information and belief some, at least,  of  these  sales have  been  unlawful  and  unjust. Government on the information before them cannot accept this contention.
  It 	will be 	open to 	any person 	to see 	any legal remedy he 	may have on 	the ground 	that the seizure 	or attachment 	of property 	was not in 	accordance with 	the law. 
  Government 	believe that there have 	been very few cases in 	which the 	realization of dues has 	not been made in accordance with the provisions of the law. In order 	to meet 	such cases, if any, 	local Governments will issue instructions to 	District Officers 	to have 	prompt enquiry made into any 	specific complaint of 	this nature, and 	to give 	redress without delay if 	illegality is established.  Where 	the posts rendered 	vacant by 	the resignations have 	been permanently 	filled, Government 	will not 	be able 	to reinstate 	the late 	incumbents. Other 	cases of resignation 	will be 	considered on 	their merits 	by local 	Governments who 	will pursue a 	liberal policy in 	regard to 	the reappointment or 	Government servants 	and village 	official who apply 	for reinstatement.  Government 	are unable to condone 	breaches of  the  	existing  law 	relating to 	the salt administration, 	nor are they able, 	in the 	present financial condi- 	tions of the country, to make substantial modifications in the Salt Acts. 
 For the sake however of giving relief to certain of the poorer classes, they are prepared to extend their administrative provisions, on lines already prevailing in certain places, in order to permit local residents in villages, immediately adjoining areas where salt can be collected or made, to collect or make salt for domestic consumption or sale within such villages, but not for sale to, or trading with, individuals living outside them.
  In 	the event 	of Congress 	failing to give 	full effect to the 	obligations of 	this settlement, 	Government will take such 	action as 	may, in 	consequence, become 	necessary for 	the protection of 	the public 	and individuals 	and the due observance 	of law 	and order.

 CONVERSATION WITH GANDHI CONCLUDED SATISFACTORILY LAST NIGHT. WE ARE TELEGRAPHING TO YOU  OFFICIALLY  GIVING  TEXT  OF  STATEMENT  THAT  WE SHALL ISSUE AS  SOON  AS  YOU  HAVE  FINALLY  APPROVED,  AND  AS  SOON AS WE ARE ASSURED, WHICH I HOPE WE SHALL BE TODAY,  THAT  THE  WORKING COMMITTEE ACCEPTS. IF THEY HAVE ANY MINOR VERBAL AMENDMENTS TO SUGGEST, WE WILL TELEGRAPH THEM FOR SIMULTANEOUS ANNOUNCEMENT AS YOU DESIRE. WE ARE TELEGRAPHING OFFICIALLY ABOUT TIME OF RELEASE FOR PUBLICATION. TEXT OF STATEMENT IS I THINK SELF- EXPLANATORY. IMPORTANT SECTIONS ARE BOYCOTT, PICKETING, POLICE AND SALT. SCOPE OF DISCUSSIONS. THE FIRST TWO ARE AS SATISFACTORY  AS I COULD SECURE,  AND WE  ARE  PRETTY  WELL  ASSURED  THAT  WE  HAVE  GOT IT IN A FORM THAT MAKES IT CERTAIN THAT PICKETING IN ITS  OFFENSIVE FORMS WILL QUICKLY DISAPPEAR AND PROBABLE THAT ANY FORM OF PICKETING WOULD ONLY BE PRACTISED ON VERY SMALL SCALE. THE POLICE FORMULA IS GOOD. SALT IS A CONCESSION I DO NOT LIKE ON POLITICAL GROUNDS, THOUGH ON REVENUE GROUNDS IT IS UNIMPORTANT. BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SECURE SETTLEMENT WITHOUT  IT.  YOU  WILL  OBSERVE  THAT  WE HAVE VARIED THE  FORMULA  ABOUT  CONSTITUTIONAL  DISCUSSIONS  AND  ON THIS I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT OWING TO MISUNDERSTANDING HE WAS UNABLE TO APPROVE AS I HAD THOUGHT  ORIGINAL  WORDING.  BUT  I  THINK  THIS FORMULA GIVES US ESSENTIALS WE WANT. ON QUESTION OF DEBTS AND SECESSION WHICH  ARE NOT MENTIONED, GANDHI’S POSITION REMAINS AS STATED IN MY TELEGRAM  OF  FEBRUARY  28TH,  EXCEPT  THAT  HE  ASSURES ME HE DOES NOT THINK THERE WILL BE ANY DIFFICULTY ABOUT HIS NOT WALKING OUT OF CONFERENCE ON ANY DEBT QUESTION BEFORE CONCLUSION OF CONFERENCE DISCUSSIONS. HE HAS GIVEN ME ASSURANCE THAT IN NO  CASE  WILL  HE  RESTART  CIVIL  DISOBEDIENCE  TILL  CONCLUSION  OF CONFERENCE DISCUSSIONS, AND THAT  AFTER  THAT  HE  WOULD  HOPE  NOT  TO RESTART AT ALL THOUGH HE CANNOT GIVE DEFINITE UNDERTAKING BEYOND CONFERENCE STAGE.

 APPENDIX IX
 EMERSON’S NOTE ON INTERVIEW WITH GANDHIJIlibtech_449_footnote
 March 19, 1931
 I had a talk for about three hours with Mr. Gandhi this evening relating to difficulties arising out of the settlement. I made it clear throughout that any opinions which I expressed were my own and not those of Government. Mr. Gandhi first mentioned the points he desired to bring to the notice of Government which were as follows :
 He mentioned the case of the Raja of Kalakankar in which according to 
 the A.P.I. message, elephants, motors, etc., had been attached for arrears of land revenue. He stated that he did not himself know the facts of the case, but did know that the Raja was a Congress sympathizer. He had, he said, written to ascertain the facts. I said that Government had no information, but that I personally thought it probable that the attachment had been made in the ordinary course of land revenue administration and that, if this was so, the settlement did not of course affect cases of this kind, since the revenue administration must pursue its normal course. I promised to ascertain the facts.
  He 	next mentioned a 	case that occurred some 	months ago in 	the district 	of Colaba 	in connection 	with forest 	satyagraha, when 	in the 	course of a riot 	a Mamlatdar was 	accidentally shot by the police.  The case, he said, was now under 	trial   in the Sessions 	Court, to which 	it had 	been committed. According 	to his 	information no 	provocation had 	been given by 	the accused 	and some 	of them 	certainly had 	not committed 	actual violence. He 	suggested that 	the case against those 	accused, at any 	rate, should be 	withdrawn. I 	told him 	that I 	had not seen the 	papers for 	some months; 	but my 	recollection was 	that the 	case was 	one of serious 	violence in which 	the police 	had had considerable 	difficulty in escaping 	and that, 	so far 	as I 	remembered, one 	or two 	forest guards had 	been killed. I 	explained that this was 	not a case which we 	could possibly represent 	to the 	local Government and 	that, in 	so far as 	the Government 	and Congress 	versions differed, the Court would decide.  He 	then got on 	to the question of whether  offences  under  Section  124-A, 	Indian Penal Code, and 	108, Criminal Procedure 	Code came within  the 	terms of 	the amnesty. 	His contention 	was that all such cases 	did come within 	it and 	that offences 	involving incitement to 	violence should only 	be regarded 	as exceptions, 	if the 	result of 	the incitement 	had been actual 	violence. He also 	urged that where the 	incitement has 	not resulted in 	violence it 	should be 	regarded as 	technical.  I 	explained  to him that, so far as I was concerned, there was no room for misunderstanding, since 
 
 when technical violence was included in the amnesty the intention was made quite clear, and I mentioned the illustration that had been given when the settlement was being discussed, namely, that convictions for rioting would have to be examined on their merits and that, while a trivial fracas might properly be regarded as coming within the term “technical violence”, a serious riot could not be so regarded and that all persons who were concerned in it whether they had been guilty of actual violence or not would be excluded from the amnesty. He admitted that this was so, but said that  he had not realized that Section 124-A, Indian Penal Code, and Section 108, Criminal Procedure Code, would come within the exceptions. I explained that, under both the sections, there were cases in which persons had been prosecuted for speeches which included incitement to serious violence and that, while it could not always, or indeed ordinarily be said that the direct result was violence, there was no  doubt  that  speeches of this sort had gained recruits to the terrorist movement and so had been indirectly responsible for violence. In any case the criterion of actual violence had not been adopted. I said that the matter was not one merely of interpretation but of great practical importance, and I took the opportunity of stating to him the position in the Punjab and in Delhi. I mentioned the meetings in Lahore and in Amritsar, the general campaign there had been in favour of Bhagat Singh and violence generally, and the apprehensions of the local Government that a serious situation would arise. I told him that I had just received a letter from the Punjab Government giving accounts for sppeeches made by Dr. Satyapal and Sardul Singh Kaveeshar, both of whom were members of the Working Committee. I said that the local Government had held its hands in the desire to avoid action which was likely to prejudice the settlement, that we had told them that, while the Government of India naturally hope that the necessity of action would not arise, we did not desire to fetter their discretion if circumstances so required, and that it was no part of the settlement that action should not be taken under the ordinary law against persons who violated it. Mr. Gandhi agreed that this was so. I then mentioned the case of Delhi, told him of the meeting  in honour of Chandra Shekhar Azad and the concern of the Chief Commissioner, Delhi, and of the Deputy Commissioner that the situation might deteriorate, and that  it might be necessary to prohibit meetings. I said that we were anxious if possible to avoid resort to the Seditious Meetings Act, but that we could not allow a situation of danger to arise, and that, if excitement grew, we might have no alternative; but in that case we would, so far as possible, restrict the use of the Act to meetings in support of violence. I then asked him if he had seen in the papers that the Governor-General in Council had rejected the petition for mercy on behalf of Bhagat Singh. He said that he had and that he was apprehensive regarding the consequences. I did not mention the date on which the execution would be carried out, but I did explain to him that the question as to whether it should take place before or after the Karachi Congress had been very seriously considered by Government who realized the difficulties of either
 course, but thought it would have been unfair to the condemned persons to postpone execution and also not fair to Gandhi to allow the impression to gain ground that commutation was under consideration when this was not the case. He agreed that of the two alternatives it is better not to wait, but he suggested, though not seriously, that the third course of commutation of the sentence would have been better still. He did not seem to me to be particularly concerned about the matter. I told him that we should be lucky if we got through without disorder, and I asked him to do all that he could to prevent meetings being held in Delhi during the next few days and to restrain violent speeches. He promised to do what he could.
 I then applied these facts to the  matter  under  discussion,  namely,  inclu- sion of all cases under Section 124-A, Indian Penal Code, and Section 108, Criminal Procedure Code, in the amnesty. I explained that we could not possibly approach local Governments with a suggestion of this kind in present  conditions.  The violence [sic] movement was serious menace with which we could not afford to trifle, and that, before we could even think of making a suggestion of this kind, there must be a cessation of  the campaign of violence and of incitement thereto.  He argued that to keep persons convicted of such offences in jail increased rather than lessened the danger by embittering feeling and he said that he would himself like an understanding by which all persons convicted before the amnesty under Section 124-A, Indian Penal Code, and 108, Criminal Procedure Code, were released while no quarter was given, in regard to prosecutions, to persons who preached violence in future. He said that Government’s interpretation of the settlement on this point placed him in a difficult position and he would like to consider it further. The matter was left in this position, but I said that I did not think the Government could possibly alter its position in this respect.
  He 	mentioned two 	specific cases under 	Section 124-A and Section 	108, namely, 	that of 	the two Delhi 	women and of 	a Professor 	Kripalani in the 	United Provinces. 	I said 	that the former had 	been carefully examined 	and that it 	had been 	definitely considered 	that it did 	not come within the 	amnesty. In 	regard to 	Professor Kripalani, 	he said 	that he was 	sure that he 	had said 	nothing in 	his speeches 	which incited 	to violence. 	I said 	that I would 	ascertain the facts 	from the United 	Provinces Government. 	At the 	same time, however, I 	was able 	to give 	him facts 	and figures 	of the action 	taken by the 	United Provinces 	Government which, he 	admitted, showed 	that that Government had 	acted in 	a very liberal spirit.  He 	then mentioned 	Sholapur cases and said 	that, so far 	as he knew, 	no prisoners 	of Sholapur 	had been 	released. I said 	that the position 	in regard 	to Sholapur 	was the same 	as in all 	other cases, namely, that 	the test 	was violence 	or incitement 	to violence 	not being 	technical violence and 	that subject 	to this 	test there was 	no distinction, 	whether convictions were 	in the 	civil or military 	courts. I said 	that the matter was necessarily one for the discretion of the local Government and that, while 
 I imagined they would naturally take a serious view of offences connected with the outbreaks of violence, they would not exclude from the amnesty persons convicted of breaches of Martial Law regulations, etc., where no question of violence or incite- ment thereto arises. I promised to ascertain the position from the local Government.
  He 	then  raised 	 the  question  of  additional 	 police.  He 	 said   that  he 	had received 	complaints regarding realization of 	cost after 	the 5th of 	March. I 	said I 	thought it very improbable that any such cases had occurred, but 	would ascertain the facts 	if he mentioned 	specific cases. He asked 	that, where realization had 	been made 	after the 5th owing to 	non-receipt of 	orders by District 	Authorities,  the 	 sums  collected should be refunded.   I said that I thought this   	was reasonable.   I again made  it clear 	to him that 	it has always 	been con-templated that some delay is 	likely to 	occur in 	the withdrawal 	of additional 	police, and that local 	Governments would wait 	until satisfied 	that conditions 	had become 	normal. He agreed 	that this was the under- 	standing. 
  I 	then mentioned 	various matters which 	from the Government point 	of view 	were causing difficulty and misunderstanding. 
 (a) I first mentioned the question of the boycott of Indian mills by a system under which Congress placed on a black list those mills whose agents did not sign an agreement. I said that the principle on which Government stood was that the encouragement of Indian industries shoud not involve interference with the freedom of action of the individual and that my own view was that a system which involved placing a mill on a black list which did not take a certain course necessarily involved coercion amounting almost to blackmail, and further that any pressure on  the consumer (which went beyond persuasion) to induce him to boycott the products of a mill was a breach of the settlement. I also expressed the opinion that a mill, which was placed on a black list, would have civil action for damages.  Mr. Gandhi said that it was not the intention to use methods other than persuasion either with the manufacturer or consumer, but he regarded it as justifiable propaganda to let customers know that particular mills did not observe the swadeshi creed. I explained that the Directors and Agents of mills definitely objected to a boycott list as amounting to coercion and that, while, so far as I knew, they did not object to persuasion, they did most strongly object to the methods employed in the past. I said that, while I did not know the view of Government on the subject, they might not object to certificates to be used for purposes of advertisement to mills, which adopted swadeshi creed, and to the replacement of the black list by a list of swadeshi mills—such a list being used for propaganda purposes only. He said that there would be no difficulty in this.
 (d)	We then discussed the new scheme for the export of foreign cloth.  I said
 that the principle in this case was that dealers should be free from any interference with their liberty of action and that no one who did not wish to join in the scheme should be forced to do so.  Also that sellers and buyers who had refrained from dealing
 in foreign cloth should be left free without any form of restraint to change their attitude if they so wished. He said quite definitely that this was the intention. I said I could conceive that there might be dealers who were honestly convinced that the sale of their stocks of foreign cloth in India was contrary to the good of the country and who, therefore, had real scruples against selling it and that, in cases of this kind, I myself saw no ground on which objection could be taken. I then quoted to him a reported speech of Babu Rajendra Prasad of Patna, made on the 10th of March, in which the following passage occurred :
 A word to the merchants. They should not suppose that the effect of  the truce was to give them perfect liberty to sell and import British cloth. The  speaker  was  aware  that they had  suffered  and  he   was   grateful   for the help that they had given. But what was the suffering of the rich merchants compared to that of poor people who had lost their all, whose houses had been looted and everything found either taken away or destroyed. The merchants had at least ten years’ notice not to deal in foreign cloth, and if they suffered no one else was to blame, but the Congress was anxious to see that some way was found to save them from ruin or heavy loss. The way, however,  could  not be to permit them to sell their stocks in India. Mahatmaji was in consultation with business magnates of Calcutta, Bombay, Ahmedabad and Delhi and other places to devise a scheme which would enable the existing stock to  be disposed of outside India. It was a very big scheme as it involved ten or twelve crores worth of foreign cloth, and there was a likelihood of loss even when the scheme was put through. This will have to be borne by dealers and possibly a way would be found to give some relief. They had to wait and see how the thing developed.
 I said that the sentence underlined seemed to me to be quite inconsistent with Mr. Gandhi’s position. He said that this was in fact not so and that he himself had taken the same line with merchants who asked him for permission to deal in foreign cloth. He explained that it was contrary to the Congress creed specifically to give such permission, since this would amount to repudiation of the doctrine to which they attach great importance, that it was one thing for Congress to recognize that merchants were free to do as they liked and another thing for the Congress specifically to accord this permission. I then asked him how merchants were to know how they stood, and said that Government regarded it as essential that they should be in no doubt on this point. He said he had no objection whatever to Government making the position clear. He added that, so far as he knew, there was not any doubt on the matter and that the hesitation of merchants to deal freely in foreign cloth was due to uncertainty as to what might happen in the future. I pointed out that, in accordance with what had been said in (b) above, the description of the scheme which relates to the “certification of handloom cloth made for such Indian mills as may not
 be under the Congress ban” would have to be expressed in different terms since no question of a Congress ban now arises. Mr. Gandhi agreed.
  On 	the general question of 	the boycott of 	foreign cloth he 	was quite can- 	did  and  said  that he  had  no  doubt  	himself   that   the 	  movement   would 	  gain great 	momentum without 	resort to coercion 	or pressure, 	that Indian 	and English mill-owners 	were convinced 	of the 	benefit to 	themselves of 	the swadeshi 	movement and 	that before long 	those who had so far 	stood out would voluntarily 	come in. He 	appears to 	be firmly convinced that 	the propaganda 	he intended 	to pursue 	would have very 	big results, 	and he pointed 	out quite 	truly that the  boycott 	on an extensive 	scale   of 	a particular class of 	goods must, however 	unobjec-tionable the 	methods might be, 	influence the dealers 	in their 	future course of business 	and so 	indirectly affect their 	freedom of action. 	He was 	very vague about the export 	scheme and admitted 	that details 	had not been worked out.  His chief argument in support of it was 	that men like  Sir Ness Wadia and accepted it as workable.  
 I told him that I was particularly disquieted by the indication of a campaign of the Congress in the United Provinces to stir revenue payers against Government and tenants against landlords, that it was very easy to raise a rural agitation on these lines and that the consequence could not fail to be serious. That, in so far as there was
 
 economic distress, local Governments were fully alive to the gravity of the situation and would deal with it as liberally as circumstances permitted and that any attempt by Congress as an organization to intervene would merely make the situation more difficult. I mentioned to him the report I had seen that the Congress Committee or Council in the United Provinces had made a recommendation that 50 per cent of land revenue and rents should be remitted and had advised revenue payers and tenants to withhold payments pending decision by the local Government. Unfortunately I did not have the reference with me and so could not verify it. Mr. Gandhi agreed that if the facts were as stated it was wrong to advise tenants to withhold rents.  I promised  to look out the reference and to let him have it.
  1 I 	next mentioned 	definite disquieting reports from 	Gujarat saying that 	land revenue 	was not being paid, 	and I told him that 	I had seen a speech 	by Vallabhbhai 	Patel suggesting that 	Government would be 	quite content to 	wait a 	year or even two 	years for 	revenue where there was 	difficulty in 	paying it. 	I suggested 	to him that 	statements of 	this kind would naturally 	be taken 	advantage of 	by revenue payers 	who could 	easily pay and that, 	while I had no doubt 	that the local 	Government would 	consider any genuine cases of distress, our information was that 	there should be  no 	difficulty at 	all in 	paying up 	by far the greater 	part of 	the revenue 	at once. 	I said 	that the 	inevitable result of 	unwarranted delay on 	the part of 	revenue payers would be 	the recommencement 	of coercive 	processes and 	the creation of 	an unfavourable 	atmosphere. He expressed 	surprise that land revenue was 	not coming in 	and said that, 	so far as 	he was concerned, 	there was no 	intention to 	discourage people, who 	could pay, 	not to do so. 
  He 	then himself 	mentioned certain 	correspondence he had 	with the Collector 	of Kaira 	regarding forfeited lands and 	other matters. He 	regarded the 	corres- pondence 	as unsatisfactory, but did not say what it was about and dropped the 	subject.  He mentioned, 	however, a circular 	issued by a Mamlatdar 	of Kaira 	to the 	effect that 	village servants who 	had resigned had 	not only to 	apply for 	reinstatement, but 	had to express 	regret for their 	conduct and also to 	pay a 	penalty before 	reinstatement. He 	regarded this as 	contrary to 	the spirit of 	the settlement. I 	said that I 	could express no 	opinion on 	the matter 	in ignorance 	 of the 	policy of 	the local 	Government.  He said 	 he would let me have a 	copy of the circular.  I 	then read to 	him a 	letter received today 	from the United 	Provinces Government 	mentioning a case 	of forcible 	picketing in Agra. 	He agreed 	that, if the 	facts were correct, it 	was a clear case for suspension of all picketing. I promised to let 	him have 	a copy. 	I also 	mentioned cases 	which had been 	brought to 	my notice by 	non-officials of picketing in Amritsar and Cawnpore where the transport of goods 
 from one place to another had been prevented; but, as I had no official confirmation of these facts, I could not press for effective action.
  The 	general impression 	left was 	that Mr. 	Gandhi is 	anxious to 	im- plement 	the settlement 	and to 	obtain a 	genuine solution. He 	seemed to 	be confident about 	the Karachi Congress; but 	he expected 	opposition from the left 	and said that the 	execution of 	Bhagat Singh might 	seriously complicate 	matters. He was 	very loyal 	to Pandit 	Jawaharlal, but, I 	gathered, did 	not regard it 	as altogether improbable 	that he 	would take his 	own line sooner or 	later. He 	recognized the 	difficulties that 	would be created by an 	undiluted resolution in favour of complete independence at the 	Karachi Congress and 	by a declaration 	that the Congress 	would go on fighting 	until they 	achieved this.  It seemed 	to me that 	he himself 	had made 	up this 	mind to see that 	  a course 	of this 	kind was not taken 	and that 	the actual 	resolutions of this 	nature would be qualified by speeches which would avoid banging the door in the way of peace.

GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, 	HOME DEPARTMENT, 	NEW DELHI,  March 	28, 1931  DEAR 	MR. GANDHI,  In 	my letter of the 21st of March I promisedlibtech_454_footnoteto let you know 	what the       
 position was regarding the salt concession. I now learn that general orders were issued on the 9th of March by the Central Board of Revenue to the various local authorities asking them that :
   Orders 		might be 		issued  immediately 		 directing  all 		 officers   concerned to 		act forthwith 		in  accordance 		 with  the  spirit  of 		 the  arrangement,  and 		 to  refer  any 		difficulty or 		doubtful point that 		might arise to 		superior a 		authority before taking 		punitive action in cases where there appeared to be any abuse of the concession; and  draft 		standing orders 		governing the operation 		of the 		concession might 		be worked 		out, with the least 		possible dealy, and 		submitted for 		the approval of 		the Government 		of India.  
 The telegram, a copy of which you sent to me, presumably referred to the draft instructions by the local authority. These have not yet received the approval of the Government of India, and the latter have no intention of imposing a limit of distance within which people must reside in order to be eligible for the concession. As you yourself recognize, it is difficult to translate the formula used in the Statementlibtech_455_footnoteof the Governor General in Council into an exact definition, but I understand that the Central Board of Revenue will prescribe as a rough working test that villagers should neither come to the salt sources nor take their salt away otherwise than on foot. From the administrative point of view the main check against the abuse of the concession will be its withdrawal from any area, after such warning as may be reasonable, where   it is clearly abused. But Government hope that the people themselves will avoid the necessity of action of this kind by refraining from any abuse of the concession.
 Yours sincerely,

                DEAR 	MR. GANDHI,  APPENDIX XIII  LETTER FROM H. 	W. EMERSONlibtech_456_footnote        NEW 	 DELHI,  March 	22, 1931 
  In 	accordance with our conversation yesterday, I enclose the drafts of 	two questions, which by arrangement could be asked in the 	Legislative Assembly,     
 and  of   the  replies  thereto.	I have  not  been  able  to  take  orders  of  Govern- ment thereon in time  for  this  letter  to  reach  you  before  you  leave  Delhi,  and  they may therefore be regarded as provisional. I will, of course, let you know if  any changes are made in them. Will you kindly inform me whether you regard them as suitable?
 2. I do not know the particular forms of agreement or declaration which are now signed by the agents or managers of mills, and, in any case, you will understand that Government could not place themselves in a position where they appeared to approve of any particular form of agreement. The questions and replies are, therefore confined to the general principles included in the statement of the 5th of March and are not to be taken as connoting acceptance by Government of specific provisions of any agreement or declaration.

Courtesy : 	National Archives of India    APPENDIX XIV  EMERSON’S 	NOTE ON INTERVIEW WITH GANDHIJIlibtech_459_footnote  April 	7, 1931   I 		had five 		hours’ talk 		last night with 		Mr. Gandhi 		regarding various 		matters arising out of 		the settlement. 		We talked 		first about the communal 		situation, which 		he recognized 		as very 		serious. He 		obviously had 		little hope 		of an early 		settlement with the 		Muhammadans and 		he expressed 		himself as very 		grieved that not only 		was the feeling 		extremely bitter, but 		that non-Congress 		Muhammadans were 		challenging the 		honesty of 		proposals he 		made. I 		took the opportunity 		of rubbing 		in that 		in the 		present state of 		feeling throughout 		Northern India any 		trivial incident 		would suffice 		to start 		serious trouble and 		that it was, 		therefore, the 		more necessary that 		the Congress 		should avoid interference with the 		liberty of 		individuals, which was 		an important cause 		of the 		keen resentment 		felt by 		Muslims. I 		also emphasized 		the great danger of 		trouble spreading into 		the villages, 		especially  in 		 the  United Provinces, 		and the difficulties 		that would arise in 		stamping it 		out, if 		it once began in 		rural areas. He 		was obviously 		fully aware of the 		danger, and 		the impression I 		gained was 		that he will 		use his influence with 		Congress to 		avoid causes of offence to Muslims. 		I gathered 		that the Congress 		were already 		using much more 		discretion in 		picketing the 		shops of 		Muhammadans and that 		Gandhi’s own desire  		was  that picketing 		of their 		shops should cease.  We 		then got 		on to the 		subject of 		Gujarat, about 		which he said 		he was 		recei-ving very 		distressing accounts. 		Some of 		the new Patels 		were men of bad 		character, etc., 		and were making the 		lives of the 		villagers unbearable; 		there was no 		real spirit 		of co-operation 		between Government and 		the Congress; the 		latter had, 		for instance, asked for a list of the lands which had been sold and the persons to whom     
 they were sold, but this had been refused, although in fact, according to his account, previous owners of land had not, in some cases, correct information on this point. It was understood that Government would remain neutral regarding the recovery of lands sold to third parties, but they were not doing so. For instance, they were using the Police to put purchasers in possession of lands they had bought, although according to law the purchasers ought to have obtained possession by a regular suit in cases where they had not obtained more than formal possession from Government. Again there were some temporary Patels who had not yet been replaced by previous incumbents who had resigned. Generally, the burden of his complaint was that he had made a mistake in agreeing about the non-restoration of lands sold to third parties and the non-reinstatement of Patels whose places have not been permanently filled, and, although he had no intention of going back on the settlement, he now realized what difficulties were involved.
 I then gave him the other side of the case. I told him that for every complaint he had made I had seen several from the other side, that the position, as reported to the Government of India, is that in particular taluks land revenue collections are at a standstill, continuous pressure is being brought to bear on loyalists, on purchasers of land and movable property and on new Patels, and that generally from the Government point of view the situation is very unsatisfactory. So far as Patels are concenred, I imagined that the actual position is that villagers are trying to obtain the reinstatement of the old Patels by securing the dismissal of the new ones, that the District Officers are, therefore, naturally sceptical in regard to complaints about the latter, but that I did not think that they would desire to keep any Patel in office if his conduct was such as to render him liable to dismissal under the rules. On the other hand, the District Officers would naturally defend the Patels against frivolous complaints. He admitted that the complaints were not against all the new Patels, but against some of them. I said that, as regards the neutrality of Government, this could not be interpreted as meaning that Government should not give purchasers of land the legal rights to which they were entitled, and that, if they were, in fact, entitled under the ordinary revenue law to summary possession, it was obviously right to give it.
 I then read out to him extracts from the demi-official letters of the Bombay Government, dated the 2nd and 4th April, which showed clearly that in certain taluks, e.g., Borsad and Bardoli, collections of land revenue had practically stopped since the settlement. He seemed to be surprised at these figures and asked for a copy of the extracts, which I promised to give him. I said that it was absurd to suppose that this general suspension of payment was due to economic distress, that our information was that crops were very good and that cases in which persons would find any difficulty in paying were extremely few, that Government regarded the delay in payment as a serious breach of the settlement and that, even if it were true, as he said, that people in one or two villages were having trouble from the new Patels, that was
 no reason why land revenue should not be paid, that the Bombay Government had recently informed the Government of India that they proposed to resume coercive processes within the next ten days and on the information before  them  the Government of  India  could  not  possibly  take  exception  to  this  proposal, although  naturally  both  they and  the  local Government   hoped   that   it   would not be necessary to resort to them, since it was clear that, once the use of coercive processes began on a considerable scale, the atmosphere in Gujarat would again become seriously disturbed and more ill-feeling would be engendered. Mr. Gandhi admitted the great desirability of avoiding resort to coercive processes, but recog- nized that the local Government could not reasonably be expected to wait beyond the period stated. He expressed his desire that the settlement should be scrupulously observed and said that he would be in Ahmedabad on the 12th, when he would very much like to have a heart-to-heart talk with the Commissioner of the Northern Division. I said that I thought it was an excellent idea and would pass on his wish to the Bombay Government. He said that he hoped that later His Excellency the Governor of Bombay would be able to grant him an interview.
 The impression left on my mind by the talk about Gujarat was that Vallabhbhai Patel and his friends are making it as difficult as possible for Gandhi to honour the settlement; that they are holding up the payment of land revenue on one pretext or another in the hope that all Patels will be reinstated and all lands restored; that they are communicating to Gandhi all sorts of complaints, few of which have any foundation, and that Gandhi himself would like to find a way out, but cannot. I am inclined to think that when he returns to Gujarat he will play the game regarding the payment of land revenue, but that he will meet with considerable opposition and that there will be attempts to exploit any pretext for non-payment. I think it would be a good thing if the Commissioner, Northern Division, were able to hear what Mr. Gandhi has to say to give him the other side of the picture with specific examples. Gandhi himself recognizes that the settlement must stand regarding lands and Patels, and I think it might be possible to satisfy some of his doubts and misgivings, if he were assured that
  the 	policy of 	reinstating Patels, whose 	places have 	not been filled, wll 	be liberally pursued,  Government, 	while protecting new 	Patels against frivolous 	complaints, will 	be prepared to deal under the ordinary revenue rules with Patels, if 	any, who abuse their position,  local 	officers will give 	such information 	as might 	reasonably be  expected 	regarding the slae 	of lands. 
 I venture to make these suggestions, because I am quite clear that Gandhi does not want to break the settlement and that he is fully alive to the undesirability of
 collection by coercive processes.
 In the mean time I made it quite clear to him that the Government of India do not intend to raise any objection to the proposal of the local Government to start coercive process in the near future.
  I 	mentioned the 	cases of 	 delay  in  the  payment  	of  land  revenue  in  	the Kanara 	and Dharwar 	Districts. He said 	that this delay was 	entirely due 	to bad 	harvests and 	economic distress, and 	that when he 	saw His Excellency 	the Governor, 	he would mention the 	matter to him. I did not pursue the subject.  Mr. 	Gandhi then 	raised the 	question of 	the United 	Provinces which he 	discussed for 	about two 	hours. I 	read out 	to him the gist of 	letters of 	the Collectors of 	Allahabad and 	Muttra, last 	week’s report of 	the special 	branch of United 	Provinces and the 	instructions sent 	by the 	Provincial Congress 	Committee to 	the District Committee 	of Fatehpur. 	I told 	him that 	Sir Frank 	Noyce and I had recently 	discussed the 	situation with His 	Excellency the 	Governor of 	the United 	Provinces, and that 	the Government 	of India 	and the local 	Government regarded the 	situation in several 	districts with 	great concern. There 	was no doubt 	that the situation had 	deteriorated very rapidly 	and that 	in one 	or two 	districts there 	was imminent 	danger of 	serious disorder 	at any 	time. If 	disorder began, 	it might 	easily spread and there 	was very 	grave danger that, 	although it 	might begin as 	agrarian, it 	would end 	as communal. 	Mr. Gandhi was very 	obviously surprised at the facts placed before him and he at once 	admitted that the 	following Congress 	activities were wrong : 
  Advocating 	tenants to 	withhold payment 	of rent 	and land 	revenue in whole 	or part, the establishment of a Congress Tahsildar in the Muttra District,  dissemination 	of the 	idea that swaraj had 	been attained and 	that revenue 	and rent need no longer 	be paid, attacks 	by tenants 	on zamindars, interference 	with Muslims. 
 He was particularly concerned about the  last  item  and  I  laid  stress  on  the  fact that, if Muslims generally had reason to believe that the Congress were  attem- pting to come between Muslim landlords and their tenants, communal bitterness would be increased and there would be grave danger of trouble. I  said  that Government regarded the activities of the Congress in the United Provinces in regard to rent and revenue as a very serious breach of the settlement, that it had never been contemplated that anything of the sort would be done and that Government were satisfied that, under cover of economic distress, the Congress were in fact carrying on the campaign for political purposes. I had been instructed  by Government to tell him that the local Government  propose  to  take  what measures were possible under the ordinary law to deal with the situation and that the Government of India approved of this course; further it was anticipated that,
 if this action did not suffice, the local Government would come  forward  with proposals for special measures, e.g., the renewal of powers conferred by the Unlawful Instigation Ordinance or action under the Criminal Law Amendment Act; and that the Government of  India  directed  me  to  let  him  know  that,  if  such  proposals  were made, they would receive the serious consideration of Government. I added,  as my own opinion, that, if Congress  activities  continued,  action  under  the  ordinary  law  would  almost  certainly prove inadequate  and  that an   irresistible case would be made out for special measures. I said that this would almost certainly break the settlement, a result which Government were very anxious to avoid, if this were possible.
 I then briefly explained to him the statement of land revenue policy made by His Excellency the Governor a few days ago in the Provincial Legislative Council and said that the local Government considered that it would meet the requirements of the economic situation; at any rate, it was essential that it should be given a trial; and that, if the consequences above outlined were to be avoided, Congress should cease to interfere. Mr. Gandhi asked me whether Government considered it as part of the duty of the Congress to secure the payment of land revenue. I said that, so far as the United Provinces were concerned, I thought that Government would be satified if Congress abstained completely from any sort of interference, and that they would not wish to impose on Congress any obligation in this respect. I explained that the position in Gujarat was different.
 Mr. Gandhi said that he had heard complaints from the other side, as, for instance, brutal treatment of tenants by landlords, and that the real problem was how the Congress could co-operate with Government in regard to the situation. He said that the methods so far pursued were on the facts given by me undoubtedly open to objection, but that was no reason why the matter should not be put on the right lines which he proceeded to develop. The proposals as they eventually emerged were that  in each tahsil there should be a Congress Committee which would co-operate with the local officers in land revenue matters. In ordinary times, the Congress Committee would have nothing to do, since the full demand would be accepted as a matter of course; but in times of distress the Congress would collect facts and figures themselves, would ascertain the views of the zamindars and the tenants and would make representations to the Collector which the Collector would examine. He asked me whether Government would object to this scheme. I said that I thought that the Government of India and the local Government would object very strongly to it. He suggested that this showed distrust of Congress which was not warranted, that the reasonable course was for the Government and Congress to work together, that in fact Government were now at peace with the Congress; they had entered into a settlement with it, and that there could be no reason why this principle should not be extended. I pointed out to him that the settlement reached related to the
 abandonment of the civil disobedience movement in which Government and the Con- gress were solely, or at any rate mainly, concerned, that it was a different matter for Governmet to use the Congress as an intermediary in matters in which other parties were concerned, that, while it was regrettable that there was distrust, he could hardly expect Collectors of districts, in veiw of the facts that had been placed before him, to welcome the scheme. Moreover, however unobjectionable it might appear in theory,  it was open to grave practical objections and would certainly lead to a continuous agitation on the part of tenants, at any rate, in regard to their rents. No Government could abrogate its functions in the manner suggested and provincial autonomous governments of the future would have grave cause of complaint against the present Government, if they allowed any political party to intervene in the way suggested. Mr. Gandhi asked whether I objected to a combination of tenants, for common purposes. I said that I could not take legal objection to it, but I thought that such combinations almost inevitably led to trouble and disturbed the relations between landlords and tenants. He then said that, if there and were no objections to a combination of tenants, what objection could there be to Congress representing the interests of the tenants, Congress assisting the cause of tenants by appeals to zamindars on the grounds of humanity. He suggested that zamindars themselves would find such an arrangement advantageous. I pointed out that Congresss did not command the universal support he seemed to think. Muslims, for instance, were intensely hostile to it, and there were many zamindars who regarded its activities with the greatest apprehension and suspicion. In fact the  general  tendency  of  the  Congress to interfere in other people’s affairs was the cause of a good deal of existing unrest. I then explained that the objections would apply equally whatever political party was concerned. I asked him whether, for instance, he considered that it would conduce to harmony if the Muslim League interfered in the Punjab between a Hindu landlord and a Muhammadan tenant.
 Mr. Gandhi then said that Congress had always supported the cause of tenants and that it would be impossible for him to stand by and see tenants ill-treated by landlords without trying to help them. I said that I was quite sure that the local Government would do everything to discourage ill-treatment of tenants in order to enforce payment of rent and that they would be only too glad if tenants filed criminal complaints. In any case, whatever might be the theoretical position, organized interference by Congress at the present time in matters affecting land revenue and rent would inevitably lead to serious trouble and had to be ruled out. He then asked what he was to do about it. He had previously said that he was very concerned about affairs in the United Provinces and felt that he himself would have to try to put matters right there. He had also mentioned his desire to discuss matters with the Governor. I suggested that the proper course for the Congress was to leave things alone so that the scheme of the local Government might be put into operation, that it might be
 presumed that, if incidental adjustments in the scheme were necessary, these would be made and that the local Government would pursue a policy in accordance with the requirements of the situation. I said that I could not  say  anything  about  his interview with the Governor, but, if one were granted, I felt that the Governor would be able to satisfy him that there was no intention of demanding land revenue in excess of the capacity of the land revenue payers to pay, that it was the desire of the local Government that landlords should not demand excessive rent, and that they would actively discourage ill-treatment by landlords for the purpose of exacting rent. I gathered that Mr. Gandhi would not, in any case, be able to see the Governor before the return of Sir Malcolm Hailey.
 The final understanding was that Mr. Gandhi would do what he could to stop the present activities in the United Provinces relating to land revenue and rent and that he would seek an interview with Sir Malcolm Hailey on his return.  My impressions regarding this part of the conversation were that Mr. Gandhi was  ignorant of a great deal that had been going on and that he generally disapproved of it. He was also evidently apprehensive regarding the possible consequences of agrarian and communal trouble combined. At the same time, the scheme of Tahsil Committees (which I take to be Jawaharlal’s) had certain attractions for him and it no doubt represents one side of the Congress programme to get hold of the rural classes by acting as an intermediary between Government and the people and exercise functions which belong properly to Government. I doubt whether Jawaharlal and other leaders of the United Provinces will readily give up their programme, and I should not be surprised if Gnadhi had considerable difficulties in dealing with them. In the mean time he is in no doubt regarding the action which the local Government will at once find it necessary to take and the further measures that may be necessary if the activities continue. This knowledge should operate in making him exercise greater control over Jawaharlal, for he does not want a breach of the settlement and it appeared that even before our conversation he was uneasy regarding the United Provinces.
  I 	next brought 	up the 	subject of 	the issue 	by the 	All-India Congress 	Committee of 	a directory 	which includes 	a list 	of mills 	that had not given a 	certain undertaking. 	Mr. Gandhi said that 	the directory had been 	issued  before  the 	arrangement had 	been finally reached by 	which the Congress 	were not to 	issue any 	such list or 	to make any reference 	to the 	Congress ban. 	He said 	that he had 	already given 	instructions that 	no such 	list would issue in 	future. I 	again emphasized 	what Government 	regarded as essentials 	in connection 	with the 	movement in 	favour of 	Indian goods, namely, 	that the 	methods should 	be  confined  to  persuasion, 	propaganda and 	advertisements and 	that the 	object should 	be economic and 	not political. 	I said 	that, if Government 	found that other methods 	were being pursued, 	they would take what action they considered to be necessary. Mr. Gandhi agreed. 
 
 I  then mentioned the question of racial  discrimination  which  appeared  to be involved in some of the undertakings which the  agents  of  mills  had  given, e.g., provisions regarding share capital and personnel of the management. I said that, although the matter had not been raised  during  the  course  of  the  con- versations  which  led  to  the  settlement,  it  should  be  understood  that   Govern- ment regarded as objectionable activities which involved discrimination between British and Indian firms engaged in business in India; that the views of the Government of India were contained in their Reforms Despatch and that these held good. Further, although we had not received specific complaints on this matter, it was not improbable that we might receive them, and that there was no doubt that attempts to get undertakings from English firms in India involving provisions of this kind would create much feeling in India and would emphasize the necessity of making provision against discrimination in the new constitution. I suggested to him the folly of the Congress in pursuing a course which was likely to alienate English feeling and so prejudice the friendly atmosphere created at the Round Table Conference. Mr. Gandhi was non-committal on this subject, but said that he had given the question of discrimination much thought, that he recognized the advisa- bility of going slow in matters on which British opinion was strong, that the question of discrimination mainly arose in matters such as shipping, and he gave expression to sentiments about the preservation of Indian civilization (which I see he mentioned in his address today to the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry).
  I 	mentioned a 	report just 	received from 	the Punjab Government to 	the effect 	that “a dealer in foreign cloth in Amritsar had been ‘persuaded’ 	by Dr. Kitchlew   to pay fine 	of Rs. 3,000 	to Congress 	funds”. He had refused 	to make 	a public 	apology in the 	Jallianwala Bagh.  I 	said that, while the 	dealer in 	question would probably 	say  if 	questioned that the 	so-called fine was 	a free gift, it 	was very difficult to 	believe that 	this was 	so, and 	incidents of 	this kind 	which were coming to 	the  notice  of 	Government left little 	doubt that the principle 	of individual 	freedom of action 	was not 	being observed. He 	promised himself to 	make enquiries during his 	forthcoming visit 	to Amritsar. 	Incidentally he observed 	that picketing had been 	much reduced and that 	the sale 	of foreign 	cloth was on the 	increase, but 	I do not know what basis 	there is for 	these statements. I 	told him 	that we 	were still receiving a 	number of 	complaints from 	Bihar and Orissa 	about picketing 	which seemed 	to be worse 	there than in any 	other province. 	I said 	that I would 	send him another 	batch of complaints 	just received and that it was his duty to see that matters were put right.  I 	told him 	that local Governments 	had, since the 	settlement, deliberately 	abstained from 	prosecutions on 	account of 	political activity, so 	that the 	settlement might 	not be 	prejudiced, that there 	was, however, no reason 	why they 	should further abstain and that the Government of India intended to inform local Governments that 
 they did not wish them to hold their hand in cases where they considered prosecutions to be necessary. Mr. Gandhi merely observed that it was right that those who brought themselves within the mischief of the law should suffer the consequences.
  Amongst 	the complaints 	which Mr. Gandhi himself 	made were the 	following : 
  The 	case of a few persons expelled under the Foreigners Act. I said that 	I would try to discuss with the Bombay Government next week.  A 	few cases of 	persons expelled from 	Cantonment areas. I 	explained the 	position and asked Mr. Gandhi to give me information of specific cases.  The 	general question of 	civil disobedience 	prisoners still in 	jail. His 	complaint, which was 	not seriously pressed, 	was that some prisoners 	coming within the 	amnesty had 	not been released. He 	mentioned, in 	particular, a 	case in 	Muttra and 	again referred 	to Sholapur 	prisoners. He said 	that this question of 	prisoners was 	causing him difficulty.  	I said that there could be very few, if any, cases of non-release   	of prisoners 	coming within the 	amnesty, and 	that local Governments 	had acted 	very liberally; 	the question 	was really 	one of 	leniency towards persons 	not coming 	within the amnesty, 	and that we 	could not approach 	local Governments 	even informally 	in this 	direction so long 	as conditions 	of peace 	were not very 	definitely established and 	Congress were 	not implementing 	the spirit 	of the 	settlement. I 	promised to 	go through 	a long 	memorandum which had 	been prepared for 	Mr. Gandhi and 	which he 	confessed he 	had not had time himself 	to digest.  To 	my surprise he 	did not raise 	the question 	of political 	prisoners in general—in 	regard to 	whom a 	resolution was 	passed at 	the Karachi 	Congress. He apparently does not wish to ask for anything outside the settlement. 
  I 	found Mr. 	Gandhi very 	friendly and 	reasonable. He 	was pleased 	with his 	success at 	Karachi, but 	depressed regarding the 	communal situation. He 	did not 	conceal his 	keenness to 	go to the Round 	Table Conference or to reach a final 	settlement of 	constitutional problems. 	His demands 	will, I 	fancy, be 	far less extra- 	vagant than 	some of his 	earlier speeches 	indicated, and, if 	he goes to 	London, he 	is likely to 	pay more 	regard to the 	spirit in 	which problems 	are approached 	and the 	attitude of 	British parties towards 	Indian aspirations than 	to the 	actual terms 	of the 	settlement, although he 	will require 	to be convinced 	that, if certain 	demands are not 	met, there are 	adequate reasons for 	not meeting them. 	Financial safeguards will give 	the most trouble 	and after 	them possibly 	discrimination. I believe 	that his 	present intention 	is to go to London 	not with 	the object 	of wrecking 	the Conference 	by excessive 	demands, but to 	obtain a 	settlement which, 	according to his 	lights, he 	can honourably 	accept. I do 	not think 	he will 	lightly return to 	India and 	confess failure. 	On the other 	hand, he does 	not profess 	to be over-confident 	of success, 	and he is quite 	candid in saying that, in the mean time, Congress will attempt to consolidate their 
 
 position in case there is another fight. This is the big danger involved in the present position and the practical question that will almost certainly arise sooner or later is how far Government will be able to remain inactive. Gandhi, however, realizes the disadvantage, from his point of view, of forcing Government to take action and it is to be hoped that this knowledge will act as a brake on Congress activites. I made it quite clear to him that the so-called consolidation of the Congress position might easily produce a situation which Government could not tolerate.

 APPENDIX XV"
453,"April  21, 1931",LETTER  FROM  J. H.  GARRETTlibtech_460_footnote,"
 AHMEDABAD,
 April  21, 1931
 I have received your letter of 20th instant regarding land revenue matters in the Kaira District.
  I 	have already 	informed you in 	my letter of 	13th April 1931 that I 	am inquiring 	into the matters 	referred to in our 	discussion and 	supplied to 	me with your 	letter of the same date.  The 	translation of 	the notice 	from the Mamlatdar 	of Borsad 	has already 	received my 	attention and 	necessary instructions 	have been issued to 	modify it 	where it conflicts with 	the terms 	of the Settlement. 
 The recovery or collection or charges for watchmen has already been waived although this goes beyond the terms of the Settlement.
 As regards future action, you are aware that in case of default in payment Government has clearly reserved the right to use coercive measures where necessary. This of course includes the right to charge notice-fees and to impose one-fourth fine as well as to adopt the more severe measures of distraint and sale of movable property and forfeiture and sale of immovable property.
  In 	the first paragraph 	of your letter 	you refer to Congress 	as the 	intermediary between the 	Government and 	the people. This is 	not one of 	the matters 	agreed upon in 	the Settlement and 	I am unable to 	agree to 	the suggestion. The 	people are 	perfectly free and 	able to 	approach Government 	officers direct in any 	matter that 	affects them.  As 	regards the 	points mentioned in 	paragraphs 2, 	3 and 	4 of 	your letter 	my reply 	is as follows : 
 Payment 	of land 	revenue by Ras and other villages. 
 The present position is that they are required to pay the current year’s land
 
 revenue and all unauthorized arrears except those arrears which became unauthorized owing to the operation of A.O. XXIX. All fines, penalties and charges for watchmen are remitted.
 The terms of the Settlement further lay down in paragraph 16(b) the conditions under which recovery will be suspended in cases where defaulters while willing to pay genuinely require time for the purpose. All officers will strictly conform to this clause.
 Tagavi 	and balance of arrears (unauthorized arrears of land revenue). 
 These are matters which are receiving the attention of Collectors. It is not possible to make any general order on these points. All cases of hardship which are brought to the notice of the Collector by the persons affected will be duly considered.
  Orders 	have already been issued not 	to recover charges 	for rakhas 	(watchmen) and notice fees. 
 As regards charges for attachment of movable property, the matter is under consideration.

 LETTER FROM R. M. MAXWELLlibtech_461_footnote
 BOMBAY ,
 April  24, 1931
 I am to acknowledge your letter of the 22nd April, enclosing copies of Mr. Garrett’s letter of the 21st April to you and of your reply of the same date to him. As you have not enclosed a copy of your letter of the 20th to Mr. Garrett, to which his was a reply, it is difficult for His Excellency to appreciate the exact point of the misunderstanding which appears to have arisen. His Excellency does not imagine that you have ever claimed that the Congress is the intermediary between the Government and the people in the sense that the Government and the people can have no dealings with one another except through the Congress; and unless such a claim is asserted, he does not see that exception can be taken to the terms of Mr. Garrett’s reply. In your letter of the 21st to him you appear to acnowledge the extent to which the Government have been prepared to recognize your own representative position, and His Excellency had hoped that the full discussion which he had with you on various problems affecting the observance of the Settlement would have enabled you to realize the sincerity of the Government in its dealings with yourself and those whom you represent. As you know His Excellency, on his part, recognizes the great
 influence for good which you are in a position to exercise in securing faithful observance of the Settlement among your supporters and encouraging general acceptance of the terms to which you agreed and he feels sure that you, as he, will continue to exert yourself in the interests of that peaceful atmosphere which is so essential to the future work with which you will be associated.
 If, however, you wish to claim for the Congress any status which is not implied in the treatment which you as its representative have already received from this Government and the Government of India, His Excellency feels that the question raised is one which fundamentally affects the interpretation of the agreement which you entered into directly with the Governemtn of India, and he regrets that he is unable to express any opinion on it. He can only say that neither Mr. Garrett nor the Bombay Government itself would have been justified in accepting any interpretation of the agreement which has not hitherto been understood, and he feels that your correct course would be to approach the Government of India yourself on the subject if you have not already done so.
 With regard to the matters of detail mentioned in your letter, I am to say that his Excellency has recently discussed many of these points with you and that he will be very glad to go into them further. In the meanwhile it is only necessary to assure you once more that the Bombay Government have every intention of taking all action which can be shown to be in accordance with the terms of the Settlement, and that they will be ready to investigate any cases which you may specifically bring to their notice in which there is reason to suppose that any further action would be appropriate.

  APPENDIX XVII  LETTER FROM H. 	W. EMERSONlibtech_462_footnote        SIMLA,  May 	2, 1931 
  I 	write to 	thank you 	for your letter of 	April 22nd and 	its enclosures and 	for the confidence 	you expressed 	that no 	effort will 	be spared 	to avoid 	a breakdown 	of the 	Settlement. I 	do not 	think there is 	imminent danger of 	this, but 	apart from 	any difficulties 	that may have occurred 	in Gujarat—about 	which we 	are consulting 	the Bombay 	Government—there are 	several matters in 	regard to 	which Government think 	 a personal 	discussion with 	you will 	be of value. 	For instance, 	there are several 	features in 	the general 	situation, which call for 	improvement. Then 	there is 	the case 	of the North-West Frontier Province, about which you wired to me yesterday. So far    
 as I know, you are mistaken in thinking that the agitation against Abdul Ghaffar Khan is inspired, for Government have been, and are, very anxious to avoid affairs in the North-West Frontier Province coming to a crisis, and the last thing they desire is to make out situation to be worse than it is. The position, however, is far from satisfactory. You have also mentioned in your telegram the speech of His Excellency the Governor of the Punjab. The events and tendencies, of which he gave illustrations, are not peculiar to his province. Incidentally I am trying to obtain details of the instances he mentioned. There is, therefore, plenty for us to talk about, and reluctant as I am to drag you up to Simla at this time of the year, I am sure that, if we have a heart to heart talk, we shall find the difficulties much less than they seem to be at a distance. I have not yet heard from Sir Malcolm Hailey, but I hope that it will be possible to make the two visits fit in. Subject to this, it would be convenient if you could come here about the 11th of May. I am not suggesting an earlier date, because you have probably made your plans for the next few days, we have to obtain certain material, and also by that date the question of procedure regarding the Round Table Conference will, I hope, reach a stage where it can be usefully discussed.

 APPENDIX XVIII
 LETTER FROM SUKHDEVlibtech_463_footnote
 MOST GRACIOUS MAHATMAJI,
 Recent reports show that since the successful termination of your peace negotiations you have made several public appeals to the revolutionary workers to call off their movement at least for the present and to give you a last chance to try your non-violent cult. As a matter of fact, the calling off of any movement is neither an ideological nor a sentimental act. It is the consideration of the peculiar needs of different times that force the leaders to change their tactics.
 Let us presume that at the time of peace parley, you did not overlook the fact even for a single moment, and did not make a secret of it, that this was not going to be the final settlement. I think all intelligent people would have understood quite easily that after the introduction of all the reforms you acquire it would not be thought that the final stage was reached. The Congress is bound by its Lahore Resolution to carry on the Struggle relentlessly till the complete independence is achieved. In face of that Resolution, the peace and compromise is but a temporary truce which only means a little rest to organize better forces on a larger scale for the next struggle. The
 
 possibility of compromise and a truce can be imagined and justified in the light of the above consideration alone.
 As regards the proper opportunity and the conditions on which any truce
 can be effected, it rests with the leaders of the movement to decide. In face of the Lahore Resolution you have thought it expedient to call off the active movement for  the present, but nevertheless that Resolution stands. Similarly, as is evident from the very name—the Hindustan Socialist Republican Party
 the revolutionaries stand for the establishment of the Socialist Republic which is not   a half-way house. They are bound to carry on the struggle till their goal is achieved and their ideal is consummated. But they would be quite apt to change their tactics according to the changing circumstances and environments. Revolutionary struggle assumes different shapes at different times. It becomes sometimes open, sometimes hidden, sometimes purely agitational and sometimes a fierce life-and-death struggle. In the circumstances, there must be special factors, the consideration of which may prepare the revolutionaries to call off their movement. But no such definite idea has been advanced by you. Mere sentimental appeals do not and cannot count much in the revolutionary struggles.
 Since your compromise you have called off your movement and consequently all of your prisoners have been released. But what about the revolutionary prisoners? Dozens of Ghadar party prisoners imprisoned since 1915 are still rotting in jails, in spite of having undergone the full terms of their imprisonments. Scores of martial law prisoners are still buried in these living tombs. And so are dozens of Babar Akali prisoners. Deogharh, Kakori, Machhua Bazaar and Lahore Conspiracy case prisoners are amongst those numerous still locked behind bars. More than half a dozen conspiracy trials are going on at Lahore, Delhi, Chittagong, Bombay, Calcutta and elsewhere. Dozens of revolutionaries are absconding and amongst them are many females. More than half a dozen prisoners are actually waiting for their executions. What about all of these people? The three Lahore conspiracy case condemned prisoners,who have luckily come into prominence and who have acquired enormous public sympathy, do not form the bulk of the revolutionary party. Their fate is not the only consideration before the party. As a matter of fact their executions are expected to do greater good than the commutation of their sentences.
 But in spite of all this, you are making public appeals asking them to call off their movement. Why should they do so? You have not mentioned any very definite thing. In these circumstances your appeals mean you are joining hands with the bureaucracy to crush that movement, and your appeals amount to preaching treachery, desertion and betrayal amongst them. If that were not the case, then the best thing for you would have been to approach some of the prominent revolutionaries and to talk over the whole thing with them. You ought to have tried to convince them to call off their movement. I do not think you also share the general conservative
 notion that the revolu-tionaries are devoid of reason, rejoicing in destruction and devastation. Let us inform you that in reality the case is quite the contrary. They always consider the pros and cons of every step they take and they fully realize the responsibility which they thus incur and they attach greater importance to the constructive phase of the revolutionary programme than to any other, though in the present circumstances they cannot but occupy themselves with the destructive part of their programme.
 The present policy of the Government towards them is to deprive them of the sympathy and support of the masses which they have won in their movement, and then crush them. In isolation they can be easily hunted down. In face of that fact any sentimental appeal to cause demoralization amongst their ranks would be utterly unwise and counter-revolutionary. It would be rendering direct assistance to the Government to crush them.
 Therefore we request you either to talk to some revolutionary leaders—they are so many in jails—and come to terms with them or to stop these appeals. Please for goodness sake pursue one of these two alternative courses and pursue it whole- heartedly. If you cannot help them, then please have mercy on them. Let them alone. They can better take care of themselves. They know that the hegemony of the revolutionary party in the future political struggle is assured. Masses are rellying round them and the day is not far off when they will be leading the masses under their banner towards their noble and lofty ideal—the Socialist Republic.
 Or if you seriously mean to help them, then have a talk with them  to understand their point of view, and discuss the problem in detail.
 Hope you will kindly consider the above request and let your view be known publicly.
 Yours,
 ONE OF THE MANY
