We have no doubt what the tendency will be. The last ten years have not shouted their warning for nothing in South Africa. And, under Union, the comparatively liberal-minded Cape members will  be ‘snowed under’ by the large Transvaal, Orangia, and Natal contingent of Indophobes. Undoubtedly, the spirit of artificial race-segregation is in the air, and at the back of the Indian hostility to most of the South African Governments is the firm- rooted conviction that, sooner or later, the policy of confinement in latter-day ghettos or bazaars will be put into operation against British Indians, together with other Asiatics.”"

It was not sent for publication on arrival in London as Gandhiji was anxious not to publish it until it was known that the negotiations had failed. The draft underwent several alterations and additions, mainly at the instance of Lord Ampthill. Gandhiji sent him proofs of the statement on July 29. He modified and enlarged it in the light of suggestions made by Lord Ampthill, in his letter of August 3; vide Appendix XIV. Later he prepared a summary of this statement of which an earlier, incomplete draft is also available. Both the statement and the summary were subsequently printed in the form of a pamphlet: “A Concise Statement of the British Indian Case in the Transvaal”, and finally released with the “Letter to the Press” on November 5, about a week before the deputation sailed for South Africa."

Such a document must necessarily be very brief and, if I were to advise, I should say that the reasons which you give in support of your demand should mainly lay stress on the desirability of ending a quarrel which all must in their hearts deplore and of enabling His Majesty’s Indian subjects in the Transvaal to share in the general rejoicing over the union of South Africa. You could then send this statement to His Majesty’s Ministers, to the Colonial representatives in this country, and to the Press.” Vide “Statement of Transvaal Indian Case”, 16-7-1909"
libtech_661_footnote,"1Replying to this in his letter of July 28, Lord Ampthill observed: “I think that I am right in saying that there is no question of altering the South Africa Bill which does not touch the problem at all. All that is wanted is that the passage of the Bill through Parliament should be signalized by an announcement on behalf of the Transvaal Government that they intend by a conspicuous act of grace to put an end to the difficulty and remove the Indian grievance.”"
