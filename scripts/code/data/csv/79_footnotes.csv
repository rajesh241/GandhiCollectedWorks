In ancient India villages were based on this system. There were as many separate administrations as there were villages. The villages used to elect the administrators; that was their Panchayat. The Panchayats framed and administered the laws. The people gladly obeyed them. That was a non-violent organization that lasted till the present day. The British government has shaken it though they have not destroyed it completely. Though I would not call it a perfectly non-violent organization, it never- theless had seeds of non-violence. Whether that was so or not I have described above my idea of satyagraha groups. Such groups in spite of being independent of each other should work together when time comes because the common bond between all of them will be ahimsa and nothing else. Just as we can build a most beautiful building by arranging similar bricks together we can also produce a mighty satya- grahi army from several similar satyagrahi group."""
