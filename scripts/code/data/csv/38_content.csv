    LETTER TO B. F. MADON        DHULIA, 
    DEAR 	FRIEND,  February 	13, 1927 
  	I have your illuminating letter. Everything coming from you commands 	my attention because I like your straightforward and popular 	exposition of a subject which has been [made] unnecessarily abstruse 	by economists. I am taking the liberty in anticipation of your 	permission of sending your letter to Prof. Wadia so that he may 	understand and appreciate your viewpoint. I would love to constitute 	myself a bridge over the gulf that, without cause as it seems to me, 	separates economists and that makes it difficult for a layman to 	study this very important subject. If all the principal economists 	of our country will agree on the fundamentals and issue a brief, 	reasoned joint statement, it will prove very useful to students like 	me who have opportunities of educating the popular mind.  	What is this thunderbolt that Mr. Shroff has hurled in our midst? It 	is occasionally that I get a peep at the newspapers. Whenever there- 	fore you get a moment and have anything to pass on to a busy man 	like me, please do not hesitate. For, though I am saying nothing in 	the Press, I am watching everything with an absolutely open mind.  From 	a photostat: S.N. 11777-A

DEAR FRIEND,
 I send you Mr. Madon’s letter and a copy of my replylibtech_147_footnoteto him. These speak for themselves. I therefore add nothing beyond saying that I know that I can implicitly rely upon your doing everything possible to put this controversylibtech_148_footnoteon a high and moral level.
 I send you my itinerary up to the end of the month so that in the event of your wanting to say to me anything urgently you can put yourself in direct touch with me without the intervention of my permanent address.
      Enclosure 	1 + 1 PROF. 	P. A. WADIA MALABAR 	HILL 	BOMBAY  From 	a photostat: S.N. 11777  Yours sincerely,  M. K. GANDHI 
      LETTER TO SUSHILABEHN MASHRUWALA    Sunday [February 13, 1927]libtech_149_footnote   CHI. 	SUSHILA,  	Herewith the telegram I have from Manilal, and also a copy of the 	letterlibtech_150_footnoteI 	had written to him; so you will now understand what I expect from 	both of you. God alone would know how fortunate you are but Manilal, 	I think, has certainly been lucky in getting you.       
 Get used to writing in ink. Try to improve your Gujarati as much as possible. Write to me if you get the time. Remember you can always write to me frankly.

MASHRUWALA    [February 13, 1927]libtech_151_footnote  BHAISHRI 	NANABHAI,  	I got your letter at Jalgaon. Please go through the telegram from 	Manilal, which I got at Amalner, a copy of my letter to him and my 	letterlibtech_152_footnoteto 	Sushila and then pass them on to Chi. Sushila.  	Now that Chi. Shanti is not to be operated upon for the time being, 	it would suit me if the marriage is solemnized at an early date and 	then the eight days of Holilibtech_153_footnotewill not come in the way. I am likely to reach 	Sabarmati on the 6th which will be Phagan Sud 3. I 	would suggest we discontinue consulting an astrologer for choosing a 	date. For an auspicious thing the sooner the better. But in these 	matters I would not insist on my own views.  	I can appreciate your wish to have Akola as the venue. All my tour 	dates are fixed. Only this change could be made: Since the Kathiawar 	[Political] Conference has been postponed I am free from the 4th to 	the 8th; on the 4th I reach Bombay. From Bombay I can straight away 	come up to Akola alongwith Manilal. Thus we can have the marriage on 	the 6th when I reach there and having spent there Monday the 7th, my 	silence day, I can leave for Ahmedabad. I must reach Ahmedabad by 	the 10th at the latest. I would like to put you to the minimum 	inconvenience. If you would have the date some time before the 6th 	that could be done if the marriage is performed wherever I happen to 	be. The other alternative is that you should      
  
 perform the ceremony without my being present. You would all like me to be there. I know Ba would desire it, so would Manilal. But I do not consider my presence indispensable. If you agree to this and if you can find out a date that suits you and falls before March 11 you can have a day of your choice.
 I do not regard marriage as always indispensable. When it becomes indispensable it could only be a religious rite which may be performed with or without the presence of elders. And it could be done any time. This is why I do not insist on my being there. I impor- tune you for an early date because Manilal’s work in Natal suffers, and I want to send him off at the earliest opportunity.
 Please consider all this and fix any day that suits you, and, if possible, send me a wire.
 Here is my tour programme:

   SPEECHES AT DHULIAlibtech_154_footnote  
 February 13, 1927
 The programme at Dhulia was heavy, but everything was so ordered and quiet that Gandhiji could address six meetings during the day, spinning on his charkha throughout the speeches! He said:
You will not regard me as impertinent if I go on spinning whilst
 I address you. I do so because of the wonderful stillness here, and because I think I can best respond to your affection by giving you an object-lesson in the thing I most believe in. When Dr. Tagore came to our Ashram some years ago,libtech_155_footnotelibtech_156_footnoteI asked him, after the morning prayers
 
 were over, to address a few words to our boys. He said nothing, spoke nothing by way of apology, but sang one of his sweetest songs in his sweetest way and was quiet. That to my mind was the acme of his courtesy. He satisfied us with the best that his soul could give. I am simply following him in turning my wheel before you, which is my only lyre and through which I think I can render the greatest service to India.
 There have been everywhere addresses from the local bodies. Let me summarize Gandhiji’s reply to the Local Board address at Dhulia.
During my wanderings throughout the land I have not yet come
 across a single local body which has been fanctioning of its own independent initiative and which I could point to as an ideal body. Mr. Lionel Curtis remarking on the contrast between an Indian village and an English village said that whereas the one gives you an impression of general untidiness and reminds you of a village built on a dunghill, the other gives an impression of cleanliness and health and beauty all around. Of course he knew nothing of the condition of the Indian villager, he did not know that his daily income was five per cent of that of the English villager. But let us not ignore one substratum truth in his remark. There is no gainsaying the fact that our villager betrays a woeful ignorance of even the rudiments of village sanitation. One could deplore the race prejudice amongst the South African Europeans, but their attempts to keep their towns  healthy and sanitary were heroic and worthy of imitation. Do not say that politics occupy all your time and that you have no time for other things. It is a lame excuse. The capacity to look after the village and town sanitation is included in our capacity for swaraj and when we demonstrate it, nothing on earth can stand between us and swaraj. You may be sure that we shall be able to retain only as much as our capacity has won for us. Some of our local bodies keep only those roads clean as are likely to be used by Government officials, but they have no regard for the roads which are used day and night by poor villagers and their bullocks, and which are always and everywhere ill-kept. Can’t we make the roads more easy and better negotiable and make the villagers’ and the bullocks’ lot a little less irksome? . . .
 At Dhulia the merchants had insisted on voting him an exclusive address and an exclusive purse, and in the address Gandhiji as one of them, as belonging to the Vaisya class. And in his reply they got more than they had bargained for.
  
 As I said at Jalpaiguri in 1925libtech_157_footnotelibtech_158_footnote, it is not the Brahmins, nor the Kshatriyas nor the Sudras that lost India; it is the Vaisyas who lost India, and it is the Vaisyas alone who can regain it. Indian history is replete with instances of Banias who helped and served the English shopkeeper to the prejudice of India. The shopkeepers who came here in search of trade became warriors to protect their trade and became Brahmins too to maintain their dominion based on trade. Our varna- sharma dharma does not say that a Bania may not be a Kshatriya and fight for the honour of his mother and sister, nor does it say that a Bania may not acquire knowledge like the Brahmin and serve like the Sudra. The Englishman combined all the qualities in himself; and dazzled at his feat we forgot our dharma, we became cowards, we forgot the real work of the Bania—agriculture, cow-pro-tection and trade—and became traitors to the motherland. You can retrieve the situation today by becoming true Banias again, by capturing again the whole of the national trade. Our black caps, our mill dhotis and our women’s fine saris are the badges of our shame and slavery. Instead of keeping the raw produce in the country and manufacturing it we looked to our narrow interests of the hour, sold the raw produce, and helped the Englishman to tighten his grip on us. We are engaged in our immoral trade today to the eternal ruin of  our  motherland. Doctors may heal if we are ill, lawyers may help us in law-courts, but only merchants can win swaraj. I want us to be the Vaisya of the Bhagavad Gita, the Vaisya whose natural calling is protection of the cow, agriculture and trade, for his own country. If we were true to our calling why should a scrap of foreign cloth come to our country, why should a cow be sold to a butcher, why should nine crore rupees worth of hides be sent out abroad? What is it that has so deadened our sense to our obvious duty? We think we must trade in foreign cloth, we refuse to listen if someone asks us to keep our dead cattle and treat their hides ourselves. We turn away in disgust when we are asked to convert our dairies into good milk-producing centres and tanneries. I cannot tell you the deep agony of my soul. Do you think I am mistaken? Do you think I am in my dotage? I tell you I shall pocket
 
 all my pride and fall at the feet of anyone who proves to me that I am wrong. Win me over to you, if you dare, otherwise follow me and take up the cause of khadi and the cow.

   LETTER TO SUSHILABEHN MASHRUWALA  
 Sunday night [February 13, 1927]
 CHI. SUSHILA,
 I hope you have the letterlibtech_159_footnoteI wrote earlier. Preserve that letter as well as its enclosures. Let me have your reply. Let Nanabhai and others read the letter. Young people, young women especially, fight shy of discussing such matters with their elders. You need not feel the least embarrassment. You should not even hesitate to call each other by your names. In later life this kind of reserve comes in our way. I see no sense in it. Manilal too has become tongue-tied. I shall write to him to shake off his bashfulness.
 Write to me about Gomatibehn’s health. I do hope Kishorelal won’t have fever again.

   LETTER TO MIRABEHN  
 Unrevised	DHULIA,
 February 14, 1927
 CHI. MIRA,
I wrote yesterday a brief letter.
 You need not worry about sending me your accountlibtech_160_footnote. You should certainly keep an account of every pice spent, and that not on scraps of paper, but in a properly kept account book. It is incredibly simple. There are credit entries and debit entries. Cash is debtor to the extent of moneys received by it, creditor to the extent paid out.
 
 
  
 Therefore receipts go to the debit side and expenditure to the credit side. Thus:
 Date		Dr. to	Date		Cr. by Monies received	12-8	Paid for
from Ashram	150/–/–	tonga	1/8/–
postage	3/8/–
Balance	145/–/–
---------	-----------
150/–/–	150/–/–
 This is how according to the English system all cash-books are kept, and yours is a cash-book. A ledger is an index for the different accounts in a cash-book and a day-book. A day-book contains all transactions where no cash passes. Thus sales on credit and purchases on credit will be entered in a day-book. This is in practice the whole of account keeping.
 I am surprised you had no wheel there. I must give you a travelling charkha such as I have. I am asking Khadi Pratishthan to send one to you. If you cannot manage it yourself, I must teach you when I come there.
 Dhulia is a very restful place. We are accommodated in the house of a worker who joined me when I was working in Champaran. And here too lives a gentleman who wears a face gentler even than Andrews, if it is possible. Akola was another such place. And Akola has given me a bride for Manilal. She is Kishorelal’s niece, 19 years old. Marriage will take place almost immediately. She will accompany Manilal when he leaves for South Africa. She belongs to a godly family.
With love,
   [PS.]              17   Ahmedanagar   23   Pandharpur     18}   Kurduwadi   24   Satara    19 	}	25	Belgaum 20}	Sholapur	26	Vengurla  }	27, 		28   Ratnagiri Gulbarga   BAPU

   LETTER TO HEMAPRABHA DEVI DAS GUPTA  
 DHULIA,
 Monday [February 14, 1927]libtech_161_footnote
 DEAR SISTER,
 God is testing you severely. Never give up. Happiness and unhappiness, birth and death, old age and disease are ever with us. 1 could not bear to see you crying when I was at Sodepur. It is good if God would let our dear ones be with us, nor is it bad if He takes them away. They belong to Him; and what is it to us if He takes away his own? Surely, He is going to take away everyone. Being the greatest of all actors we call Him Natavar, the Supreme Actor. He tosses us as He pleases. We are after all puppets. Is it not better to dance in tune with Him than with the world?
May God grant peace to you all.

 You must have got the news about Manilal. If Manilal has not shown the letters written to him, you will know from letter to Chhaganlal. Please inform everyone. I do not know if Nanabhai will have Panditji or someone else to perform the rites; I have left it to him. Please ask Panditji to be ready in case he has to go. The wedding will be at Akola.

    LETTER TO ASHRAM WOMEN       DHULIA, 
    SISTERS,  Monday, Maha Sud 13 [February 14, 1927]libtech_164_footnote 
 I 	am in receipt of your letter written by Chi. Manibehn.  	What you write to me in regard to women who intend to visit the 	Ashram is quite right. For the present, I cannot expect any of you 	to keep them with you. I wish only that you will mix freely with 	them, will look after them if they are ill, will not keep away from 	them, and you will invite them off and on to your midst.  	You might have known that Tara’s elder sister Chi. Sushila has 	been betrothed to Chi. Manilal. The marriage will take place at 	Akola on the 6th of March. I shall, therefore, reach the Ashram on 	the evening of the 8th or on the morning of the 9th. 14th is Monday. 	I     
 shall stay on in the Ashram till that day, and then again I set out. So I shall have only a few days in the Ashram.
 Whether I will or no, I get involved thus in marriages. And yet the more I am drawn into such activities, the more I see that it is very necessary for men and women to observe brahmacharya. Chi. Manilal remained unmarried for 32 years, merely in order to develop self-control. He then expressed a desire to marry, and so I began looking for a good match. As he is to marry in a family of persons devoted to God, I expect nothing but good to result from this alliance.
 We should not feel bashful to talk about marriage. But whether married or unmarried, we should not become a prey to passion by such talk. One who cannot control one’s passions should certainly marry. But one who can control them, should do so and seek to obtain moksha in this very life.

   LETTER TO NANABHAI I. MASHRUWALA  
 Silence Day [February 14, 1927]libtech_165_footnote
 BHAISHRI NANABHAI,
 I have your telegram. I am glad that the 6th suits you. Please get either Gopalrao from Wardha or Sahasrabuddhe there for  the marriage ceremony; or shall we ask Panditji to come over from the Ashram? Or if there is some particular person in your view, that makes no difference for me. Nothing suits me better than if Nath himself performs the rites. If you would have Panditji, let me know by wire.
 We shall have no ceremony other than the strictly religious. You must not incur expenditure by putting up pandals and other things. Please have no sweets in the meals. Our new relationship is not going to make you my in-laws nor is Sushila going to be my daughter-in-law; she will still be a daughter to me, and you will all be my cousins as always.
 You must not give away with the  bride  so  much  as  a  grain  of gold. Indeed, she must not wear any jewellery on the occasion. If afterwards she has a liking for them I shall be helpless. Because she has as much freedom as you and I.
 
  
 On my part I am not bringing her anything besides a garland of my hand-spun yarn. Of course I am going to present her a takli, the Gita and a copy of the Bhajanavali, if available.
 In South Africa Manilal wears foreign dress; he had asked my permission for it, but Sushila would not need it. In her khaddar sari she will be as resplendent as the celebrated Sita. Please do not gather a crowd, nevertheless do not hesitate to invite those whom you ought to.  I shall leave Bombay along with Manilal by the Nagpur Mail and reach Akola on the 6th morning. The 7th being a Monday, I shall stay on there. On the 7th if there is a convenient train in the evening I shall straight away leave for Ahmedabad.
 Ramdas and Devdas may arrive there either with me or direct. I will not stop anyone else who wants to go there.

The day has been 	fixed for Sunday, 6th March. I have to go to Akola direct from 	Bombay. I am likely to reach Bombay not earlier than the 4th. Being 	a Monday, the 7th will be spent in Akola. We can leave on the 7th    
 evening and reach the Ashram on the 8th evening or the 9th morning. I have written to Nanabhai asking him not to put up any show.
He should give the bride not even the most insignificant jewels. I am
 giving her nothing. In South Africa, you use foreign dress with my permission but Sushila need do nothing of the sort; in her khaddar sari she will look as resplendent as Sita. Let me know if you want any change in these arrangements. After you are married you are both free to live as you like. But I certainly wish that you should give no jewels to Sushila and that there too she should wear no cloth other than khadi.
 The more I think the more I feel that you are going to have a jewel. My only fear is whether you would be able to take care of her.
 Please keep your passion under control; let her study. The girl would be helpful in many of your activities. She can even learn composing. If she tries she can improve her Gujarati but it all depends upon you whether you would make a doll or a companion out of her. After all, she is just a child. She does not know the ways of the world. If, henceforth, you will observe more restraint than hitherto I see a blissful future for both of you.
May God grant strength and wisdom to both of you.
 Now you can easily go to South Africa in March. You can make the necessary preparations.
 You should start from there on the 4th and meet me in Bombay on the morning of the 5th.
 I am writing to Ramdas and Devdas that they may come along if they want to.

 I got all your letters. I have asked Mahadev to reply to them as well as to take the necessary action. Something has already been done. I still have to write about the laxity in spinning. I shall take out
some time and attend to it. I  am writing this on a  moving train.  The
 schedule was such that I could do nothing. But now I have asked the programmes to be so arranged that I may get some more margin. Who else but the Charkha Bhandar is to make up the losses resulting from the transfer to Jerajani when the two stores are amalgamated? I do not very well understand it as I have forgotten many of the facts. Anyway we shall finally decide about it in the Conference which is to be held at Belgaum on the 25th or 26th. Are you supposed to attend it? Take over into the Charkha Sangh the yarn we got from South Africa. I am very glad that you examine the strength of all the yarn. Whatever time is spent in it is only . . .libtech_173_footnotefor us because we get to learn much out of it.
 Whatever experiences you have, whatever there is worth know- ing, do write out in Gujarati and send over to me so that it can be published in Navajivan and we can also take out of it whatever we want for Young India.
 Other things you will learn there and so I do not write about
 them.    Blessings 	from  BAPU

 I had first thought of asking the Khadi Pratishthan people to debit the Ashram with the price of the travelling charkha that will he sent to you. But I reconsidered my decision and I saw that it would be cheaper to have the charkha by value payable parcel. If therefore you receive a parcel from Calcutta by value payable post, please discharge the bill there.
 On the 6th and 7th of March, I shall be at Akola for Manilal’s marriage. From the 8th to 14th March I am at the Ashram, 15th to 17th Bardoli. I entrain at Surat on the evening of the 17th for the Gurukul.

If  I 	can satisfy him by spending the 5th morning at Santa Cruz I can 	allot the evening of the 4th to Poona and leave there on the same 	night for Bombay from where I can proceed to Akola.    
  
 Since Gomati has returned there she and Kishorelal need not again come to Akola. If Nath is there please ascertain from him if he would perform the wedding rites. I would like to have the ceremony performed by him, if it is no inconvenience to him.
 I think it would not matter if you could not come because of Janakibehn’s operation or something else.
I have to proceed to Sangamner this very evening.
       From 	a photostat of the Gujarati: G.N. 2884      SPEECH AT NASIKlibtech_175_footnote    Blessings 	from  BAPU        February 	16, 1927 
  	Some youths handed over to me several questions as soon as I arrived 	here; my replies to them will be my speech today.  [1.] 	Don’t you think as a Hindu you should concentrate on collecting 	for the Shraddhanand Fund rather than for any other fund? I 	am an imperfect mortal and my capacities are limited. I know  	the theory and practice of economy, and whilst all my  time  and 	energy are given to the country, I am not vain enough to think that 	I should do all things myself. The work you refer to is engaging the 	attention and energies of men like Malaviyaji and Lalaji and there 	is no reason why I should also put in my oar. At the first meeting 	held in Calcuttalibtech_176_footnotelibtech_177_footnoteto collect funds for raising a fitting memorial to 	Shradd- hanandji, I was asked to be present by Pandit Malaviyaji and 	I did so. I do not think he expects more from me. I claim to follow 	in daily life the teachings of the Gita and I know that, 	humble as is the work that I am doing, it is better for me than much 	other work which may be quite as good and even better but which is 	not my work.  [2.] 	The collections you make today are only for khadi, are they not so? 	If they are, how will you utilize them? Yes, 	of course, this fund is only for khadi because it is being collected 	  for   the    All-India   Deshbandhu   Memorial	Fund.	The     
 Deshbandhu’s name has been associated with this fund because hehad drawn up, a few days before his death, a scheme for the organization of villages through khadi. Khadi work was dear to him. The All-India Spinners’ Association has been set up only to collect funds for khadi and use them to organize work. Accounts of its funds are being maintained to a pie and everyone has a right to inspect them. The Association has an executive committee, auditors and inspectors. This Association has now placed before the country a scheme for an organization of khadi service. You will ask what effective work this association can do, paying as it will be only thirty rupees a month to each worker. Of course, ours is a poor Association, for it has been established with money collected from the poorest of the poor. It is not another Indian Civil Service, so that it can afford to pay salaries of thousands of rupees. The Indian Civil Service is maintained with taxes paid by the people and is meant to rule the people; our poor little association is meant to serve them.
 [3.] Are you partial to the Mussalmans? Why don’t you answer the charges some of the Mussalman leaders level against you?
 I can do justice to people of other faiths by appearing to be partial to them, and I know that I am protecting my own faith by showing if you will a reasoned partiality for other faiths. I do not, I cannot, wish to harm the Hindu religion, for I am after all a drop in the ocean of Hinduism. If Mussalmans call me kaffir, what then? What can be the answer to it? In South Africa, a nephew of mine was staying with me. It was only when people said that I was partial to him that he realized, and I realized, that I was only just to him. The fact that the Mussalmans are finding fault with me possibly suggests that I am not yet sufficiently partial to them to convince them that I am just to them. Why should I answer their charges? All my twenty-four hours are consecrated to the service of Lord Krishna who is ever with me, who guides my footsteps, and whom I always pray to do whatever is needed for me. He will answer for me, if there be any need.
 [4.] If you fought for the Khilafat, why do you not fight for the Hindu
 sangathanlibtech_178_footnotetoday?
 The question is well asked. I had pledged myself to lay down my life for the Khilafat and I knew that I was indirectly helping thereby the cause of the cow. ‘How much cow-protection have you
 
 
  
 achieved?’—you will ask. Very little, I admit. But what does that matter to me? “To work you have the right and duty and not to fruit thereof,” says the  Gita.libtech_179_footnoteIt was  at  the  bidding  of  the  Lord  that  I offered my co-operation to the Ali Brothers and rendered whatever help I could. I have never had reason to regret it. I would do the same thing should another occasion arise. That is the teaching of all our religious books. Let the people rail at me, insult me if they like. I am not going to pay them back in their coin. Mine is the religion of tapascharya, the way of penance taught by the scriptures and by Tulsidas. That is the law of my being and I cannot do otherwise. “The whole creation,” says the Gita, “follows the law of its being. How will restraint then avail?”libtech_180_footnoteMy joy is in the fulfilment of my duty and the confidence that when some day the Mussalmans join hands with the Hindus in protecting the cow, everyone will say that the good result is due to the efforts of that mad Gandhi who died working for the cause.
 In my opinion, there is no sanction in Hinduism, Islam or Christianity for the shuddhi, tabligh or proselytizing (respectively) as it is going on today. How then can I take part in the shuddhi? The Gita and the Tulsi Ramayana teach me to resort to self-purification whenever I or my religion is in danger. And what is true for me is true for all. That process of self-purification I am going through all the twenty-four hours of my day. Parvati, Narada had foretold, would have an ominous-looking husband. She knew that only Siva was as blissful as he was ominous-looking and she performed penance for winning Siva and won him. So the lesson of penance and self-purifi- cation is writ large everywhere in our scriptures and the Himalayas are the living witness to it—the Himalayas where countless rishis ground their bodies to dust for self-purification The Vedas, to me, are not the texts writ on paper, but my very conscience and the In-dweller. They tell me to observe yama and niyama (the cardinal and the causal virtues) and trust everything to Lord Krishna. In all humility I claim that all my work is conducive to the service of Hinduism. As a Hindu,  I could do nothing else. The way of doing it is of course my own.
 [5.] Do you know that most of the donors of the money that will be presented to you today are dealers in foreign cloth, and they give you money for the love they bear you, not for the love of khadi?
 
 I do not want a single pice offered through love for me; I want people to appreciate my mission and help it with money. Through love you can give me another thing. Through it you can give me your foreign clothes, but not money. The truth is that business men give me money in the belief that, if my business thrives, it will harm neither them nor the country. They know that ultimately they will have to deal in khadi. They understand the position correctly but today they lack strength of will. They ask me to pray to God that He may grant them that strength. Meanwhile, they donate money and help this movement. They do not give me money in order to deceive me.
 [6.] Why do you confine yourself to khadi work alone and neglect other important or even more important political activities?
 I have already said that the sphere of my work is limited. Duryodhana described how his warriors had taken up their due positions on the battle-field. He had asked everyone to remain in his place and protect Bhishma. The varnashrama dharma taught in the Gita also says the same thing. It asks everyone to know his own sphere of work. If India wants me to serve it, it must understand my limita- tions. Although it is possible that 1 can do other jobs well, there are people doing them. As I believe that no one else can do khadi work as well as I can and since I regard khadi work as my supreme duty, I have confined myself to that work. I favour satyagraha, I want to start it, but I want to create a suitable atmosphere for it through khadi. Satyagraha is like my very breath, but I regard it as impossible without khadi.
 [7.] What is the extent of the help you are getting from the Mussalmans during this tour?
 I admit that for my khadi work I have been having not much help from them. But what does that matter? I do not bargain with my brother or wife in my domestic affairs. I do my duty and leave the rest to do theirs. In the same way I will not bargain with the Mussalmans, as I will not with Pandit Motilalji or Kelkar. Why should we fear the Mussalmans? We need fear only God and no man. Even  if  men should play you false, do not be deterred from doing your duty, in the confidence that God will take care of you.

   LETTER TO SATIS CHANDRA DAS GUPTA  
 [Before February 17, 1927]libtech_181_footnote
 DEAR SATIS BABU,
 You must be well. Now that you have gone out of Calcutta, you must give yourself prolonged rest and be thoroughly restored. You will not be anxious about Pratishthan affairs. Leave them in God’s hands in so far as your share of the work is concerned. After all khadi is not and cannot be one man’s affair. If it is pleasing in the eye of God, He will raise His own instruments and keep in order those He has raised. Let us realize that we are nothing even as a machine is nothing. The machinist is everything. Let us reduce the teaching, of the Gita and the Ramayana to practice and we shall cease to worry.
 Do please keep me well posted with news about yourselves. Here are the dates:
 Ahmednagar	25 Belgaum Kurduwadi	26 Vengurla 
19, 20, 21 Sholapur	27, 28 Ratnagiri

   OUT OF NOTHING  
 When one thinks of the immense possibility of the charkha it is surprising that its simple message is taking so long to become universal. “Nothing comes out of nothing,” says a Latin proverb. But the charkha would seem to falsify at least the letter of the proverb. For without destroying or replacing anything useful, it seeks to utilize the waste and idle hours of the nation.
This idleness, whether it be regarded as enforced or voluntary, is
 
 killing the very soul of the nation. The more I penetrate the villages, the greater is the shock delivered as I perceive the blank stare in the eyes of the villagers I meet. Having nothing else to do but to work as labourers side by side with their bullocks, they have become almost like them. It is a tragedy of the first magnitude that millions have ceased to use their hands as hands. Nature is revenging herself upon us with terrible effect for this criminal waste of the gift she has bestowed upon us human beings. We refuse to make full use of the gift. And it is the exquisite mechanism of the hands that among a few other things separates us from the beast. Millions of us use them merely as feet. The result is that she starves both the body and the mind.
 The spinning-wheel alone can stop this reckless waste. It can do that now and without any extraordinary outlay of money or intelli- gence. Owing to this waste, we are living in a state almost of suspended animation. It can be revived if only every home is again turned into a spinning-mill and every village into a weaving-mill. With it will at once revive the ancient rustic art and the rustic song. A semi-starved nation can have neither religion nor art nor organization.
 The only objection that has been urged by its critics is that the wheel does not pay. But even if it pays only one pice per day, it does pay when we remember that our average income is six pice per day against the fourteen rupees and six rupees per day respectively of the average American and the average Englishman. The spinning-wheel is an attempt to produce something out of nothing. If we save sixty crores of rupees to the nation through the spinning-wheel, as we certainly can, we add that vast amount to the national income. In the process we automatically organize our villages. And as almost the whole of the amount must be distributed amongst the poorest of the land, it becomes a scheme of just and nearly equal distribution of so much wealth. Add to this the immense moral value  of  such distribution, and the case for the charkha becomes irresistible.

   A GREAT SPINNER  
 When at the end of the Bihar tour and on my way to the Central Provinces, I heard at Calcutta of the death of Babu Jogeshwar Chatter- jee whom I had the privilege of knowing as a spinner who gave
  
 promise of being able to revive the old Dacca shubnum—the night-dew muslin—I at  once  sent  a  messagelibtech_182_footnoteto  Kshitish  Babu  of Khadi Pratishthan to supply me with details of the deceased’s life. These have been now received and I share them with the reader:libtech_183_footnote
 Jogeshwar Chatterjee, son of Sjt. Jatileshwar Chatterjee of village Panpur in the district of 24-Parganas . . . died on Sunday, the 30th January morning. He left behind him his wife, a daughter aged one year, a younger brother and aged father. . . .
 Jogeshwar Babu read up to B.A., and was a teacher for some time. He then took service in the E.B.R., and served it for seven years. He was aged
 35 at the time of death.
 He took to spinning during the Non-co-operation days, and was an ardent spinner. At the Gauhati Exhibition a muslin of 200 counts was
 exhibited by the Pratishthan, the yarn of which was spun by Jogeshwar Babu. During one year—Cawnpore Exhibition to Gauhati Exhibition—he spun 200 count yarn for the above muslin, and sufficient yarn of 100 count, out of which two dhotis are made. Of the last two dhotis, one was for Acharya P. C. Ray and the other for his father. . . .
 He was all along spinning on the Pratishthan’s box charkha. He was out-and-out a khadi man, who used to spin during leisure hours, and made such    a rapid progress in spinning.
I tender my condolences to the family of the deceased and hope
 that the attempt to reproduce the ancient art will not die with Jogesh Babu’s death. Let it be remembered that Jogesh Babu’s was a labour of patriotic love. And it is only voluntary spinners who can follow up Jogesh Babu’s grand effort.

 February 18, 1927 I have just been to the Rashtriya Pathshala. I have inspected for nearly an hour like a strict inspector all the management and working
 of the institution and found it to my satisfaction. I have thoroughly
 examined the boys in a lively heart-to-heart talk and found them sharp in intellect and prompt in answers. In short, I see in Ahmed- nagar Rashtriya Pathshala a lovely little oasis in the midst of such a vast desert of darkness.libtech_188_footnote
 [Continuing,] Mr. Gandhi said that, if Ahmednagar district was poor, the rest of India was poorer still. Hundreds of thousands of men and women were without any kind of employment and almost starving. He had not the slightest doubt in his mind that khadi work alone could give these people some employment and bread. He appealed to all present to give their mite to him for his great work.

 MY DEAR SATIS BABU,
 So you and Hemaprabha Devi are being tried through and through. You will stand this very severe test and come out victorious. Read the second chapter of the Bhagavad Gita again and again and face the battle like true warriors that you are. It is now your double duty to take care of yourselves. Among the properties you hold in trust for God’s purposes, your bodies are not the least important. If we may not indulge them neither may we for-bare them through false love [sic].
 But enough of philosophy. Ever since the receipt  of the telegram I have prayed for you. And this letter is the first thing I have
 
 taken up after the morning prayer. May God sustain you and bless you.

Gods, it is said, take away those they love most. The human 	mind has devised many methods of assuaging grief. But the real fact 	is not to feel the grief. But that is almost superhuman especially 	in Hindu society. Please tell Hemaprabha Devi not to think of what 	Anil would have done, if he had lived. His work in that body was 	finished. A rare soul such as Anil’s had much higher work to do 	and he left the body. Let us not grieve over our loss which 	may be the world’s gain. It is as well that we do not know the 	mysteries of life and death. I want you both now to get rid of your 	weakness. Pray do not think of stirring till you have fully 	recuperated yourself.

May God give you peace and strength.

   SPEECH AT SHOLAPUR libtech_194_footnote  
 February 20, 1927
 As at Nasik,libtech_195_footnotethe speech at Sholapur was a reply to questions and criticisms made in an open letter addressed to Gandhiji by some people from the town. Their first criticism was that those who appeared in khadi on the occasion of Gandhiji’s visit were hypocrites inasmuch as they would shelve it the day he left. Did that indicate the progress of khadi? Gandhiji said:
Well, I do not know. I know that I am selling khadi wherever I
 go, and there ends my work. Supposing you purchase from me millions of rupees worth of khadi and sink it into the sea, the sale is not vitiated. But the criticism is unfair. I know that some wear khadi for the occasion, but they do not disguise the fact. They appreciate the message of khadi, but they say they cannot exclusively wear it for a number of reasons. Am I to tell them, ‘You are no good. I can do without your khadi?’ No, no. My duty is to define our dharma in its fulness. Their duty is to follow it as much as they can. People deceive me, you say. I do not understand how they can harm me even if they do. I am but a self-appointed agent of Daridranarayana and I shall take from you only what you can give me. . . .
 
 “You are good enough,” they say, “but your work has ruined the country.” I am but an erring mortal and like any one of you I am full of shortcomings; therefore I beseech you to reject them and simply make the best of my capacity for service. Turn my good points to account and reject the bad ones. If you do not pick and choose and simply reject me wholesale, what will the world say to you? Will you regret the service of a man as a carrier because he is blind?
 As I said at Nasik, I fail to understand the shuddhi, tabligh and proselytization as they are carried on today. I cannot understand a man changing the religion of his forefathers at the instance of another. But that is my personal conviction. No one  need stop shuddhi, tabligh or proselytization at my instance. My own duty is clear. I must go on purifying myself and hoping that only thereby would I react on my surroundings. It is my unshakable conviction that penance and self-purification are the only means for the protection of Hinduism. Do any amount of sangathan, only let not that sangathan be of the evil forces, let it be only of the forces of good. . . .
 You say I am partial to the Mussalmans. So be it, though the Mussalmans do not admit it. But my religion will not suffer by even an iota by reason of my partiality. I shall have to answer my God and my Maker if I give anyone less than his due, but I am sure that He will bless me if He knows that I gave someone more than his due. I ask you to understand me. If my hand or heart has done anything more than was anyone’s due, you should be proud of it, rather than deplore it. It should be a matter of pride to you as Hindus to think that there was amongst you at least one mad Gandhi who was not only just to the Mussalmans, but even went out of his way in giving them more than their due. Hinduism is replete with instances of tolerance, sacrifice and forgiveness. Think of the sacrifice of the Pandavas, think of the forgiveness of Yudhishthira. Should it be a matter for sorrow for you, that there is at least one man who has tried to carry out the precept of Hinduism to the letter? . . .
 If there is anything in the charge that you are wearing khadi just to please me, and for show, I say for God’s sake do not do so. I am not a Mahatma. If I am one, the Mahatmaship is but the expression of some   shaktilibtech_196_footnotelibtech_197_footnote.   Pray   do   nothing   for   my   sake.   I   shuddered   when
 
 
 someone proposed that though I was silent I should exhibit myself for darshanlibtech_198_footnotelibtech_199_footnote. I assure you the words ‘darshan’  and ‘Mahatma’ stink in my nostrils. I am unworthy of giving darshan.  Even like you I  am a vessel of clay, liable to all the affections and passions that flesh is heir to. How can I be fit to give you darshan? One and only one darshan is necessary, viz., that of the nameless, formless, indefinable Absolute. Try, if you can, to see Him everywhere, in a poor man’s hut as in a palace, in a latrine as well as in a temple. Have, if you will, the darshan of khadi and visualize its immense potentialities. Dismiss the mortal frame called Gandhi from your mind. Its darshan will be of no avail.

I agree 	it is difficult for you to wear khadi. It will not be difficult for 	Sushila as long as she keeps up her Indian style with sari and other 	things. A presentable khaddar dress can be had at a reasonable 	price. People dressed in khadi are to be found now even in distant 	Edinburgh.    
  
 It is not my attempt to make recluses of you or Sushila, but I certainly intend to make you disciplined householders. If I wanted to make you monks I would not have bothered about getting you married. I would not disapprove if you sought your pleasure within limits. In spite of all this you are free and should act as you please; I do not want to exercise the least pressure.
 Jamnalalji has not turned a recluse, only he has given up a number of pleasures. You are quite grown-up and I do not look upon you as a child.
 I have been taking steps after consulting you about everything. Do let me know if you wish for any change in the marriage ceremony or for some merriment. I have suggested and acted as I thought fit but  I want to be as agreeable to you as I can while following my own code of conductlibtech_202_footnotelibtech_203_footnote. I know marriage is a turning point in the life of a young man and woman. I am also aware thatparents should not interfere in it. Do not think yourself to be under any kind of pressure. Do I need to be more frank? Do I have to give any more reassurance?
 Nanabhai has invited Panditji, so he should come with you. Both of you can meet me by taking the Tapti Valley route; thereby you can also save some time. But do what both of you find convenient.

   LETTER TO NANABHAI I. MASHRUWALA  
 Monday [February 21, 1927]libtech_204_footnote
 BHAI NANABHAI,
I have your letter. The wedding may take place at 10-30.
Evening would never suit me.
 Why should you offer a dress to Manilal? The dress he will have on, won’t that do? However, I would not hurt your feelings.
 Tell Chi. Sushila that she must cultivate the habit of writing letters. Once she starts writing she will not be short of topics.
 
 I have written for Panditji’s coming over.
 You need not send biscuits from there. I have collected plenty of them on my way. Vijayalakshmi may pack a tin for me when I reach there.
 Does she still want to have Manilal stay with her for some days? If she does I would send him there a few days ahead or he may stay on for some days after the marriage. You already have my tour programme.

   LETTER TO MAGANLAL GANDHI  
 Monday [February 21, 1927]
 CHI. MAGANLAL,
I have your letter.
For the present take such work from Parasram as he can do.
 Ask Panditji to be ready. He should take a train from Sabarmati on the 5th morning to save time and money, and join me at Jalgaon by taking the Tapti Valley route. It will do if Manilal also takes the same train. But they may, if they want to, travel via Bombay. Panditji should write to Nanabhai about the preparations to be made. The marriage ceremony is to be performed on Sunday at 10-30 a.m.
 I was under the impression that Ganesh’s Christian name was John. Because of this and because I had forgotten the name Ganesh, I wrote John.libtech_205_footnotelibtech_206_footnoteGive him this new letter in which I refer to him by the name of Ganesh. And if the fellow can take a joke and would not mind his name being forgotten, give him the one which carries the name of John too. Otherwise destroy that letter.
Now I do not have to worry about  Rukhi.
 I feel we must not let the common mess close, though those who want to, may drop out of it. Self-Cooking and common mess must he carried on together.
 We are bound to devote the minimum amount necessary for the tannery and the [water] lift. The funds for cow-protection have to be used for the tannery. I remember a resolution to this effect adopted at
 
  
 Wardha. If not we will pass one on the 11th. We must take up that activity which involves no risk of loss.
 For the lift too we shall collect the amount needed. But I shall decide about it after I reach there on the 9th.
 The amount from Mirabehn comes in regularly. All of it is to be spent at the Ashram. Since a year is over, we can now utilize the amount. Only you have to be careful that we do not suffer any loss on account of an error in accounts or some other slip.
 Are you now in a position to meet the demand for lifts and to set them up? I have deliberately omitted to publish anything [about the lift]. Write to me if you want it to be publicized so that I can prepare an article for the next issue. Let me know what I may write. Have you now trained people to work the lift? I  believe  I  must mention the minimum weight of the animal that should go with each. Why can we not use an old buffalo? Why not a good or pliant bull? There should be no error in our calculations. I am afraid, we might have to depute our men in all places for quite some time. But it will be all right if you have given thought to all this.
 The same applies to hides and skins. Let me have a copy of the pamphlet about this. I will publish it after examining it.

  From 	the Gujarati original: C. W. 7762. Courtesy: Radhabehn Chaudhri      LETTER TO ASHRAM MEMBERS    Silence 	Day, February 21, 1927  	I see from the letters I get that attendance at the prayer is 	irregu- lar and thin. A general slackness is also creeping into the 	spinning.  	Spinning and prayer are the two beacons for us. If we do not keep an 	eye on them, we will be able to do no credit either to the Ashram or 	to ourselves. It is one thing not to do them after deciding right 	from the beginning that we would not engage in either of them, and 	another to omit doing them after undertaking them. In my  opinion, 	he who approves of neither can achieve nothing at the 
 Ashram, since we regard them both as essential religious activities. Those who, while approving of them, grow lax in their practice will develop a general laxity. If we wish to learn to insist on truth and to experience the strength it gives, we must never omit to perform the two aforesaid rites. Both require faith on our part. To a certain extent we can adduce rational arguments in support of both, but in the last resort faith alone can satisfy us. One sometimes feels that nothing is gained by attendance at prayers, that one is unable to concentrate attention, one feels a sense of lethargy, and so on. These things cannot be reasoned out; they can be dispelled only by faith. The Gita recommends faith alone when it speaks of dispassionate action. An effort is never wasted. It is an act of faith to believe in the ultimate triumph of truth in the face of failures, and to follow truth dispassionately. We should have the same attitude to spinning as to prayer. It is not for me to calculate how this much spinning would benefit me or the country. One may not see any immediate benefit from spinning but one must stick to one’s belief that it is going to bring some benefit. The point is to learn to stick to our resolve. The two external and common activities of prayer and spinning are likely to develop this tenacity. If we are lax in these activities, when shall we learn to stand firm on truth?
 I therefore appeal to all, young and old, not to neglect these two activities.

    LETTER TO ASHRAM WOMEN       SHOLAPUR, 
    SISTERS, I 	have your letter.  Monday, 	Maha Vad 5 [February 	21, 1927] 
  	I find that carding and other work has been going on well. If you 	persevere in the same way, you will make good progress within a 	short time.  	The effect of regular work is like that of regular food. It 	nourishes the soul. But, even as over-eating spoils one’s health, 	so excessive work at a time wears out one’s spirit. 
  
 We are in Sholapur today. It is a big city. There are five mills here. The biggest of them belongs to Morarji Gokuldas. His grandson Shantikumar is still a youth so far as age goes, but he has a great soul. He loves khadi and wears only khadi. I do not mean that this is his greatest virtue. He is sympathetic, generous, humble, devoted to God and truthful. He has the virtue that his name indicates, i.e., he is calmness incarnate. I am very glad that such a jewel amongst men is found in a multi-millionaire family. I was not acquainted with his wife. Yesterday, while I took my meal, I made her sit down by me and talked to her to my heart’s content. I suggested to her that she should take to public work like her husband. I cited all of you as an example to her. Was I right in doing so or was it only my conceit? You alone know whether all of you are devoted to service. Anyhow that is what escaped my lips. It is up to you to justify my statement.

 CHI. JAMNALAL,
 I have your letter. I am returning herewith both the letters from Ghanshyamdas. Because I have faith in his word I am not afraid that he would marry again.
 I want you to come to Belgaum on 25-26 and also to present yourself at the Ashram on the 11th. There is much work to be done at both the places. It would be worth the while if you could stay at the Ashram from the 9th to 13th. You may also stay with me at the time of the Gurukul [Convocation] when Ghanshyamdas too proposes to be present. It depends more on your own convenience in view of the other things you have to attend to.
 What is Kamala doing? I am worried on her account. This does not mean you too should start worrying. She could perhaps settle
 
 down if we could arrange for her education. Let her learn as much English as she likes.

 DEAR SIR PURUSHOTTAMDASlibtech_212_footnote,
 As it appears to be more convenient for you to handle English letters I am sending you this in English.
 Though I have myself yet written nothing about currency matters, perhaps you are aware that I have been closely following the agitationlibtech_213_footnotelibtech_214_footnote, that is, as closely as I can, in spite of incessant travelling. I have been studying the question carefully and carrying on an active correspondence with experts chiefly Messrs Madon and Wadia. The latter has sent me a draft bill which I understand he has circulated among the members of the Assembly. Will you please let me know whether that Bill meets your approval?
 If a pure gold standard is established, free mints opened, and a Reserve Bank established, does not the question of ratio disappear altogether? Will not things right themselves? Whereas if the ratio is fixed at 1 to 15 and all questions about gold, currency, mints and Reserve Bank shelved or decided in accordance with the recommen- dation of the Commission, will it not be worse than the existing state of things?

Do you not think that there is considerable force in what Prof. 	Wadia says, namely, that the ratio question should not be separated 	from the permanent question of standard; or do you say that since 	there is a statutory definition of the rupee in terms of gold, we 	should be entirely satisfied if the ratio is satisfactorily settled 	and the other recommendationslibtech_215_footnoteof the Commission either shelved or given effect to 	just as they are. In other words, if you had the choice what will 	you do?  	Have the ratio fixed at 1 to 15 and the status quo retained 	in all other respects?  	Or the ratio fixed at 1 to 50 and gold Bullion standard with the 	Reserve Bank mentioned in the Commission established?  	Or a pure gold standard established, mints reopened for coining gold 	mohors freely and a central bank given such as Prof. Wadia suggests, 	leaving the ratio undisturbed by any statutory action?

  SPEECH AT GULBARGAlibtech_219_footnote 
 February 22, 1927
 [Addressing] both the Hindus and Mussalmans gathered in the vast courtyard of the famous Sharana Basappa Temple which still bore the marks of the mob-fury of 1924libtech_220_footnote, Gandhiji said:
 My heart burns with agony when I see young men, dressed in foreign caps and clothes. It is surprising that they do not see that, whilst the rupees that they spend on foreign caps are wasted, the annas that they need spend on khadi caps all go to the pockets of the poor. The man who shuts his eyes to the poor of his land and seeks to befriend the poor of the world must be mad indeed. God will find him guilty of arrogating to himself His function. The Hindu who recites his Gayatri regularly and the Mussalman who says his namaz five times a day are doing so in vain, if they have no corner in their hearts for the poor of their land. This is the message I would leave with the Hindus and Mussalmans of this place.
 Much as I would like to pour out my agony before you, I know that it will be a cry in the wilderness. I therefore daily send out my prayer to God: ‘Lord, do somehow deliver us from this confla- gration.’ But I should be untrue to my creed if as a believing and satyagrahi Hindu I disguised from you the feelings within me. When I went into the temple I was shown the spot where the idol was removed and the Nandilibtech_221_footnotewas desecrated. I tell you the sight pained me. You may call me an idolator if you will. I see God everywhere and in everything. I tell you God would never approve of those acts of desecration. Whilst in Yeravda Jail, I read Maulana Shibli’s Life of the Prophet, I also read Usva-e-Sahaba and can say that those who did
 
 the acts were wrong, that Islam never sanctions such things and they were guilty before God and man. When I heard of these things I was convinced that the matter had passed out of human hands. If there were men who devoted all their time and energy to the cause of Hindu-Muslim unity I at least was one of them, but when my efforts did not seem to bear any fruit I threw myself on God. When the saints and godfearing people of Islam saw that there was discord and strife after the passing away of the Prophet, they dissociated themselves from them, migrated to Egypt, Persia and other lands and there retired into seclusion and sent up their prayers to God. It is these saints that have kept Islam alive. How often have I wished to retire thus into seclusion! And though I know that history will take note of my efforts as those of one who was a servant of God, who committed Himalayan blunders but who had also the courage to confess them and repent for them, I know that today I can do no better than be silent on this question.
 But if you will not listen to me in that matter, you certainly will not disdain to think of the millions of the poor amongst you. Do you know that many of the spinners in Bihar, Bengal and the Punjab out of the 50,000 spinners in India for whom the A.I.S.A. finds employment, are Mussalmans? Have you read the heart-rending tales of woe of some of them? One of the workers in Gujarat asked a Mussalman woman aged 65 as to why she bothered to spin when spinning brought her only an anna per day. She said the fact that there was someone to give her an anna in return for the yarn she spun convinced her that there surely must be God somewhere. Fight, therefore, as much as you wish, but when a man like me appeals for help, pray forget your quarrels and your hostilities and do something for the cause he pleads.

     SPEECH AT PANDHARPURlibtech_222_footnote   [February 23, 1927]libtech_223_footnote  At 	Pandharpur the 	people in 	charge of 	the temple 	had somehow 	got the report 	that Gandhiji was 	going there with a 	European friend and 	they were terribly 	exercised as 	to what they should 	do if Gandhiji 	insisted on entering 	the temple 	with the friend 	as he did 	at Banaras. 	They must have been 	relieved to 	find that there was 	no such 	friend in 	our party. But 	Gandhiji made a 	pointed reference to 	this matter in 	his speech. He said:  	I am sorry that neither the Buddhist friend who was with me at 	Banaras nor the ‘untouchable’ girl I have adopted is with me. 	But you may be sure that I should not have visited the temple 	without them if they had been with me. Had I left them out, I should 	have been guilty of insulting Vithoba Himself. I would not mind even 	an atheist  entering our temple, for I know that God can take care 	of Himself. Who is there in the world who can insult the God in the 	image? But     
 the lady friend who was with me is a Buddhist and therefore a Hindu. If she had no right to enter the temple, who else can have it? I have visited many places of pilgrimage and I have been pained to see hypocrisy and cupidity there. It is necessary first to  purify  the drunken and dissolute worshippers in charge of some of these tem- ples. If the things continue as they are today, if we do not bestir our- selves and go through the necessary penance and cleansing and self-purification, I tell you that not even the 22 crores of Hindus can keep Hinduism alive. The Himalayas are spotlessly snow-white  in virtue of the spotless glory of the countless sages who laid down their lives performing penance in their caves. Only such penance can save us and our religion from perdition today.

  HONOURABLE COMPROMISE 
 Sir Mahomed Habibullah and his colleagues are to be congratulated upon having secured a settlement that is honourable to both parties. It is not the best that could be conceived, but it is the best that was possible. I doubt if any other deputation could have done more. The Class Areas Bill, which brought about the Conference and round which the battle raged, is dead and gone. The Right Hon. Srinivasa Sastri, who when the deputation sailed for South Africa was of all members the most communicative and had warned us not to expect much, did not conceal at the end of the labours of the Conference his satisfaction at the result. A perusal of the settlement warrants the satisfaction.
 But like all compromises this one is not without its  danger points. The dropping of the Class Areas Bill is balanced by repatria- tion, re-emerging as re-emigration. If the name is more dignified, it is also more dangerous. Repatriation could only be to India. Re-emigra- tion can be to any country. The following sentence in the settlement clearly points to that interpretation:“The Union Government there- fore will organize a scheme of assisted emigration to India or other countries where Western standards are not required.” This assisted emigration to other countries I hold to be dangerous, for there is no knowing what may happen to the poor ignorant men going to an unknown land, where they would be utter strangers. Such countries as would take them would only be either Fiji or British Guiana. Neither
 
  
 has a good name in India. It is decidedly a disadvantage to have been party to assisted emigration to any other part of the world.
 The good point about this assisted emigration is that whereas before the settlement the repatriates lost their domicile, the re-emi- grants now retain it and lose it only if they absent themselves so long as to warrant the inference that there is no intention on their part to return to South Africa. How many assisted emigrants can hope to refund the assistance in money they might have received or how many can hope to return with their families is a different question. The non-forfeiture clause is clearly designed not so much to guarantee a substantial right as not to hurt national self-respect.
 The annexure, containing a summary of “conclusions reached by the Round Table Conference on the Indian question in South Africa”, is a remarkable document betraying in every paragraph a heroic attempt to reconcile conflicting interests and sentiments. The industrious reader will have no difficulty in discovering hopeful paragraphs. I shall therefore content myself with drawing attention to a paragraph that is fraught with grave danger. The Union Government is “to take special steps under the Public Health Act for an investigation into the sanitary and housing conditions in and around Durban, which will include the question of the limitation of sale of municipal lands subject to restrictive conditions”. I do not know what is aimed at in this paragraph, but my suspecting mind—and my suspicion is based upon previous bitter experience of interpretations, warranted and unwarranted, that a strong party places upon agree- ments with a weak party to the latter’s disadvantage—conjures up all kinds of frightful consequences arising from this proposed committee and limitation. Already the Durban Corporation has been invested with powers which it has utilized for the suppression of its Indian citizens. So far as I know a committee can bring to light nothing that is not known to the Corporation or the Government. The appointment of an advisory committee of Indians may be simple padding. The Health Committee may bring in a hysterical report, as a previous committee to my knowledge has done, and limitations may be put upon the purchase of municipal lands by Indians which may cramp the Indian community residing in Durban. Nor do I like the paragraph which seems to imply that provincial Governments are at liberty to take any action they might against the Indian settlers without
 reference to the Central Government.
 But the compromise is acceptable in spite of the  dangers referred to by me, not so much for what has been actually achieved as for the almost sudden transformation of the atmosphere in South Africa from one of remorseless hostility towards Indians to that of a generous toleration and from complete social ostracism to that of admission of Indians to social functions. Mr. Andrews sends me a glowing account of the utmost cordiality with which the Indian members of the Deputation were received alike by the Government and the people, how local Indians were able to gain entry to the most fashionable hotel in Cape Town without any let or hindrance and how the Europeans in South Africa were flocking to him to know all about the Indian Deputation and the Indian question. If this atmosphere of goodwill and sociability is kept up and encouraged, the settlement can be used as a solid foundation for erecting a beautiful temple  of freedom for the Indian settlers in South Africa. But the success of the settlement very largely depends upon the selection of the Consul or the Commissioner who will be selected to represent the Government of India. He must be a person of eminence, great ability and  great strength of character, and in my opinion, he must be an Indian. They very fact of his being an Indian will strike the imagination of the European population and raise the Indian settlers in European estimation. He will reach the heart of Indians in a way no Englishman, not even perhaps Mr. Andrews, can, and if a man can be selected who will command the equal esteem of the Union Government we need not fear the future. Such a man in my humble opinion is Mr. Srinivasa Sastri. I cannot conclude this hasty survey of the settlement without placing on record my deepest conviction that the happy result is predominantly due to the ceaseless and prayerful  labours  of that godly self-effacing Englishman, Charlie Andrews.

  NOTES 
 A SIMPLE SUGGESTION
 During my tour I observe that at some of the meetings volunteers thoughtlessly begin distribution of papers, such as copies of address, etc., just after the guest has arrived and the address has begun to be read. They do not realize that this creates a fresh disturbance in already noisy and restless meetings. If papers are to be distributed, they should be distributed before the proceedings
 
  
 commence. It is not even realized that if papers are distributed, they should be distributed to all who want them. In mass meetings such distribution is impossible unless thousands of copies are available. In my opinion this would mean an utterly useless waste of public money. Whatever is absolutely necessary will surely be printed by local papers and the public should be satisfied with what the papers give. If they are unable to follow the proceedings without the papers it would not be a bad plan to sell such papers when there would be no question of favouritism. All those who wish to possess copies can have them for a trifling charge to cover printing expenses and a small addition so as to form a contribution, however small, to the expense of organizing meetings.
 
 STEWARDS OF THE NATION
 Much trouble, time and money can be saved by a little forethought. As it is, I often notice a reckless waste of public funds in connection with these meetings. Let organizers of all meetings, but especially of khadi meetings, realize that we are the poorest country in the world, millions of whom are semi-starved, if only because their earnings are less even than three pice per day.  Let  organizers therefore understand, as stewards for the nation, it is their duty to spend public funds like misers and never to spend a pie without thought and without necessity. Organizers of khadi meetings should further realize that every pice collected is a pice meant for the starving millions and so one pice means often a day’s earning for a widow. They must not therefore spend where they need not. For instance, they spend money on paper decorations. This is no time for decora- tions. Let them save as much as they can by avoiding all decorations save only those which may be required to attract people’s attention. In that case they can think of several artistic things which cost nothing or very little. Thus they can have flags and buntings out of waste  khaddar. We are now going in for extensive tailoring in connection with khaddar sales. There is always much waste material in a tailor’s shop which he throws away. Now every part of this waste can be used for buntings which unlike paper buntings can be preserved for further use.
 WRITE YOUR ADDRESSES
 Flowers may be avoided altogether and yarn garlands may be presented. Yarn must not be damaged by being tied into knots. It can be presented in its natural condition so that it can be subsequently used for weaving or any similar purpose. Money can also be saved by avoiding the printing of addresses. The best calligraphist among the organizers can write out the address on simple handmade paper and the paper can be nicely sewn on to a piece of khaddar, or if a little volunteer boy or girl would embroider the letters on a  piece  of khaddar it would be still better, the thread for embroidery, too, being hand-spun. Such work will be at once artistic and even valuable. I have stolen the idea from the remarkable way in  which  Babu Mahendra Prasad’s daughter Rama had embroidered for her father the address presented by the Chapra Municipality of which he is Chairman. It cost the Municipality nothing and I have become possessor of a work of art which will adorn the museum which Adhya- pak Malkani has brought into being in the Gujarat National College.
 AVOID SILVER CASKETS
 Expensive caskets are not required, for I have no use for them nor have I any room to keep them in. Latterly I have been putting to auction every expensive casket received by me and handing the proceeds to the All-India Deshbandhu Memorial Fund.  Although these auctions have invariably proved profitable in that they have fetched much more than their intrinsic value it will not be proper to present caskets for the purpose of securing fancy prices. It will be a good exercise for organizers if they must give their khaddar addresses in caskets to find out something cheap, local and artistic.
 NOT A PLEASURE TRIP
 Well has Gangadharrao said that mine is not a pleasure trip, but a business tour during which I expect to do substantial business for my principal Daridranarayana. Every function therefore should be in fitting with that setting. I have observed that often more local men travel with me than are necessary for the purpose of the mission and that motor-cars are hired without due regard to economy. Every item of expenditure should be previously and carefully thought out. Unless we do so we shall not raise into being an efficient, economical organization calculated to serve the starving millions and we shall be guilty of the same charge, no matter on however small a scale, of
  
 extravagance that we legitimately bring against the Government.  Kitson burners should be avoided whenever possible. I notice, too, a lavish expenditure on feeding. Those who travel with me do not do so to be entertained. It is enough to provide clean lodging and clean food. Indeed I often feel like copying for the whole of my company the excellent example of Mr. Bharucha who always insists on carrying his own food with him. We spend much too much money and time upon food. It grieves me to see people sending for parcels of fruit from Bombay or Calcutta. Much of this expense is wholly unnecessary. Some fruit is no doubt an essential part of my dietary and unless obtainable locally, something has no doubt to be imported. But I am sure that the expense incurred in bringing fruit can at least he reduced by 75 per cent. ‘But,’ argue over-zealous friends, ‘why should not people who love you express their regard in some such loving acts of service? They will not spend money otherwise, nor will they give you all the money that they spend for your personal  comfort. Let them therefore have the joy of spending some little money for you.’ The argument is no doubt flattering, but wholly unconvincing.
 TRANSMUTATION INTO SERVICE
 If those who love cannot transfer their love to the thing for which I stand, their love is blind and of little value. I do not know if one should live to provide mere enjoyment for friends. Friendship means loving mutual service, and sometimes it is a positive disservice to indulge one’s friends and to expose them to temptations. And if there are friends who would spend lavishly for providing luxuries for me, but would not spend for the cause I espouse, it is my clear duty to resist such luxuries. Friends to be friends must first provide me with necessaries of life before they think of indulging me with luxuries; and khaddar work is a vital necessary of life for me, more vital than food. Reception Committees please note.
 AUCTION OF GARLANDS
 The foregoing paragraphs were written, or rather dictated at the halts before we reached Ahmednagar at which latter place, there was an imposing meeting where there were several addresses presented, the Municipal address being in a beautiful silver cylinder. The represen- tatives of each body brought also expensive flower garlands. Mr. Firodia who presented the inevitable purse excused himself for its
 smallness by saying that Ahmednagar was a famine-ridden tract. When therefore  I  began  my  replylibtech_224_footnotelibtech_225_footnoteI  could  not  help  noticing  the contrast between the palatial surroundings, the expensive ceremonial and the statement of famine conditions. I told the audience that what was true of Ahmednagar was true of the whole of India. Was not India a famine-ridden land? But the fact did not prevent accumulation of wealth on the part of a few. We the city-dwellers lived upon the exploitation of the famine-stricken villagers and the Khaddar movement was in tended somewhat to redress the wrong and to make some slight return to the millions whom we were  exploiting. I therefore suggested that the acknowledgment of the fact that Ahmed- nagar was a famine area made it doubly the duty of its well-to-do citizens to give more rather than less. I told them also that it would ill become me to accept for myself such caskets and rich floral tributes. I told them further that believing as I did that plants were as much endowed with life as we were ourselves, I did not like the unnecessary plucking of a single flower. But in a place like Ahmed-nagar my dislike was heightened by the reminder that I was a self-chosen representative of the very famine-stricken millions whom Mr. Firodia had mentioned. Every rupee spent upon unnecessary things meant a deprivation of the livelihood of 16 famishing women and I therefore suggested that they should auction the silver casket as also the flowers, and if my remarks went home they would pay not the market value of the casket and the flowers but they would pay for the sentiment that the things would carry with them. The auctioning was entrusted naturally to the Chairman of the Municipality, Khan Bahadur Dorab- seth. The casket was knocked down to Sheth Magniramji the local philanthropist for Rs. 1,001 and the garlands and the bouquets were auctioned separately under the same able management and they fetched in all Rs. 502. The result of my appeal went beyond the meeting and the citizens seemed to catch the spirit of my address to them, and the purse of Rs. 1,700 for which Mr. Firodia had apolo- gized went up to nearly Rs. 6,000 apart from a brisk sale of khadi at the meeting. Future organizers beware! I warn them that they need not present me with flowers and rich caskets, but if they do I shall assume
 
  
 that they are presented for the purpose of being auctioned and in order that their contribution to the poor people’s fund may be substantially increased.
 TILAK SWARAJ FUND
 During the Maharashtra tour at one or two meetings I was asked what had become of the crore collected for Tilak Swaraj Fund.libtech_226_footnotelibtech_227_footnoteThe questioners had every right to put this question even though they might not have contributed a pie to the Fund. A public fund becomes public property and therefore every member of the public is entitled to know in detail the administration of such funds. I  therefore answered the question fairly exhaustively. The gist of my answer will bear repetition although the question has been  answered  in  these pages already.
 The accounts have been published regularly by the All-India Congress Committee. Copies of the audited accounts can be had at any time from the Congress Secretaries or the Treasurers. Every pie has been accounted for. There is no doubt that in some instances those to whom funds were entrusted were not faithful to the trust, but that is as much as to say that the Congress like all human institutions is an imperfect body having in its fold all sorts of men. I know of no institution in the world which does not have dishonest agents. The Congress is no exception. But I can say this that no loss has been sustained beyond what a most careful merchant suffers. The little loss that had been sustained is due not to negligence, but has occurred inspite of vigilant inspection and auditing. It should be further borne in mind that the Congress has had in Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and in Sheth Jamnalal Bajaj an incorruptible working Secretary and an incorruptible working Treasurer respectively. Moreover 75 per cent of the funds were administered locally by local representatives who had assisted in raising the funds and who were trusted by the people. Lastly, the largest amounts were mostly earmarked and controlled by the donors, subject no doubt to the conditions that they were to be used only for purposes coming within the programme of non-co-operation and the accounts were to be open to inspection by Congress agents. Personally, I have absolutely no regret about having raised the Fund and my conscience is clear as to its administration.
 
 Everything that was humanly possible to guard against fraud, mal- administration or misappropriation was done. The Fund has served an immense national purpose. The tremendous organization that came into being all of a sudden could not have been created without this great national Fund to which both rich and poor  contributed so handsomely.

  LETTER TO LAURA I. FINCH 
 February 27, 1927
 DEAR FRIEND,
 Your letter has been redirected to me from Sabarmati. As I am constantly on the move, you will pardon my dictating this letter. Both you and Mrs. Blair whom I know very well would be welcome at the Ashram whenever you both go there. For the most part I expect to be there between 9th and 14th of March. I should be delighted to give you personal welcome if you come during that time.
 I would suggest you and Mrs. Blair carrying a mosquito net, not that there are many mosquitoes at the Ashram but it is wise to be forearmed especially as we do not stock mosquito-curtains at the Ashram.
 
       From 	a microfilm: S.N. 12815       LETTER TO MIRABEHN   Yours sincerely,  M. K. GANDHI          MALVAN,  February, 	28 1927 
   CHI. 	MIRA, I have two letters 	from you.  	I have no doubt in my mind that a vow is like a rudder—a life 	regulator. And just as a rudderless ship is lost, so is a life 	without a vow a lost life. For after all a vow means a religious 	determination to carry out a decision for self-restraint even at the 	cost of one’s life. I should therefore welcome your desire to take 	what is perhaps the supremest vow for a man or a woman. But if it is 	taken let it be taken after the maturest deliberation. It would be 	wrong on my part to 
  
 prevent you from taking the vow, if you are clear about the necessity of taking it. Not to take the vow is to trust one’s little self. To take it is to distrust oneself and to trust only God. I know where I should have been if I had not taken the vows I have.
 But there is the other side, i.e., Andrews’s. He says: “I do not know that the voice within is always the voice of God. What I may hold to be right today may be found to be wrong tomorrow. I must therefore hold myself free to do the will of God as I discover it from moment to moment.” This attitude has answered  his  purpose.  I should be undone. I see a fallacy behind A’s argument. He does not. So it sustains him. Fallacy, error and the like are relative terms. What is good for one may not be good for all even though Truth is one for all time. The difficulty lies in our hopeless ignorance of Truth. Cruel God has enabled us to see that Truth is one and nothing else is; but He has disabled us for knowing its content.
 If therefore you feel the call within to take the vow and if you feel it will make you feel freer, you shall take it. Nothing need be done in haste.
 You must keep your health. Of course you will always starve when you feel the slightest touch of fullness or indigestion. Even weakness is preferable to apparent strength if it is accompanied by indigestion or even a feeling of fullness.
 You must not worry about your Hindi. You are doing all you can. The rest must lie in the hands of God. A change  may  be necessary after we meet. The fact evidently is that you must not combine two things—learning Hindi and teaching charkha. It evidently exhausts you. And you have not been helped to the extent you needed. However the experiences you have gained  are  inestimable and I am satisfied.
 I have only now got Ramachandra’s letter. I must see what can be done when I am there.
With love,
 Yours,
 BAPU

I have no time even for revising this important letter.

  LETTER TO ASHRAM WOMEN 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 MALVAN,
 
    SISTERS,  Maha 	Vad 11 	[February 	28, 1927] 
  	This is the last letter I write to you, for next Monday I should be 	on my way back home.  	In my tours I always address women’s meetings. Consequently I keep 	learning new things about women. I realize that women hold the key 	to swaraj. But who will awaken them? Many women have little to do. 	Who will make them industrious? Mothers spoil their children from 	birth. Who will prevent them? They load their children with 	ornaments and clothes of all kinds. They get their girls married 	quite young. They give them in marriage to old men. When I look at 	the jewels on women, I feel very annoyed. Who will explain to them 	that real beauty lies in the heart and not in these ornaments? I can 	write on many such matters. But how can all this be set right? It 	can be done only when a brilliant and dynamic Draupadi rises from 	amongst women. You have to try and get the necessary qualifications. 	Make up your mind about it and then have patience. One can achieve 	nothing by being in too great a hurry. 
       From 	a photostat of the Gujarati: G.N. 3641     LETTER TO N. M. KHARE   Blessings 	from  BAPU          MALVAN, 
  Monday 	[February 	28, 1927]  BHAI 	PANDITJI,  	Please go through the letter from Nanabhai which I have for- warded 	to Chi. Manilal. If you can find the time, please go there a day in 	advance and satisfy Nanabhai. We must have the minimum rituals. 	Please make it a point that the ceremony does not stretch beyond an 
  
 hour. Though of course you should do all that ought to be done. Please have two copies of the [marriage] vow, one for each of them. We shall not have to solemnize such marriages. We cannot refuse if other friends want it. Hence this procedure and so on. Please think over it and try to make it as solemn and sacred as possible. Consult Kaka; we might add to or amend it if necessary.
 I think we should start the ceremony with prayers and devo- tional songs and also conclude it in like manner. Consult Kaka about this too; if we decide to do so, what bhajans we should have, what slokas we should recite in our prayers, etc. Not the usual prayers that we offer daily but if you can find out some which would specially suit the occasion.

  LETTER TO MANILAL GANDHI 
 [February 28, 1927]libtech_232_footnote
 CHI. MANILAL,
This should reach you on Wednesday.
 Maganlal writes to me that you would board the train in Bom- bay. You have to leave there on Friday. On Saturday morning I shall be in Poona. Leaving there at 10, I shall join you at Kalyan. I have a meeting at Poona in the morning.
 Herewith letters from Nanabhai and Sushila, for your information. I think you should honour their wish to have you at Akola for some days. Vijayalakshmi would naturally want to know you; she is your mother-in-law.
 You should not be angry nor should you worry over  what Sushila writes about jewels and dresses; I have tried to encourage all the good traits she has cultivated. But I have not bound her  to anything. You will influence her the way you would like to, and take such liberties as you please with her consent.
 The vow to be taken at the time of the marriage ceremony is available with Panditji. I wish you would get it in advance, think over it and understand it. May you be always ready to observe the vow and
 
 may God grant you the strength for it.
 I know marriage begins a new life. Therefore though I do not get the time to write to you more often or at greater length, I am always thinking about you.
 Even if you stay over at Akola I must leave on Monday. I have plenty of work waiting for me at Ashram.
 Make a note of whatever you want to ask me or tell me, because after this meeting we may perhaps not meet again, may be never in our lives. In the month of March, when you will proceed to South Africa, I do not know where I may be wandering. I see therefore that whatever you have to ask should be done mainly on the train. On Sunday we shall be busy with the wedding ceremony. Of course there may not be much fuss. There would be a solemn atmosphere on the day and also peace all round. But I am a busy man and it is quite likely that we shall get little time to ourselves.
 In his letter Nanabhai asks for Panditji to go there a day in advance. Panditji may do so if he can. Just the same I am dropping a line to Nanabhai assuring him that this should not be necessary. He [Panditji] should however spare a day if possible.
 Bring with you two copies of the Gita, two of the [Ashram]
 Bhajanavali and a couple of taklis.

 BHAISHRI NANABHAI,
 I have your letter. You may not need Panditji to go there in advance. All the same I have written to him that he should reach a day earlier if he could.
 You must not put up any kind of elaborate decorations or other fanfare. Please spend as little as possible on pandals, etc. It would look well to have the marriage ceremony in the open; it would be enough if there is shade.
 There is a religious atmosphere about your house, no doubt; but
 
  
  	I wish it is particularly so during these days.     [PS.]    Blessings 	from  BAPU 
  	I have written to Manilal to spend a few days at Akola if he can. If 	he does it might become necessary to let them have a separate room. 	Perhaps it is essential that immediately after marriage they live 	together for some days.  From 	the Gujarati original: C.W. 1129. Courtesy: Sushilabehn Gandhi     LETTER TO SUSHILABEHN I. MASHRUWALA   Monday [February 28, 1927]libtech_234_footnote  CHI. 	SUSHILA,  	So at long last I have a letter from you written with much 	nervousness. I wish you could get into the practice of writing to me 	without shrinking.  	On Sunday Manilal and you, Nanabhai and Vijayalakshmi, myself and Ba 	will have to observe fast till the marriage ceremony is over, i.e., 	up to about 12 noon. Devote all that time to contemplating on dharma 	and to understanding the significance of marriage. People are now 	totally oblivious of the fact that marriage is not a license, it is 	a discipline. A person—man or woman—has recourse to marriage to 	regulate, to circumscribe the desire one feels. This is the 	distinction between man and beast. Thus though pursuit of pleasure 	results from marriage, the Shastras suggest that the couple should 	gradually shake off its hold over them. Even those relationships 	which are formed for pleasure, the Shastras try to use for the 	attainment of moksha. They enjoin them to this end. So much 	so that seekers have described the relationship between the 	individual self and the Supreme Self on the analogy of marital 	union. The concept of purity underlies conjugal love just as much as 	the communion of an individual with God. Thus marriage can become a 	great help in rendering social service. May your marriage prove so. I 	am trying to let you have in advance a copy of the marriage    
 vow. If you get it ponder over it. May God grant you the strength to fulfil it.

  SPEECH AT RATNAGIRIlibtech_237_footnote 
 [March 1, 1927]libtech_238_footnote
 After describing Ratnagiri as a place of pilgrimage for the whole of India, as it was Lokamanya’s birth-place, and after a feeling reference to Sjt. V. D. Savarkar, Gandhiji said:
 You know Lokamanya’s swaraj mantra. I do not think there has been any follower of Lokamanya who has tried to carry out  the mantra more than I. There may be many whose efforts are equal to mine, but no one can claim to have put forth greater effort. For I know that not only is swaraj our birthright, but that it is our sacred duty to win it. For in so far as we are removed from swaraj we are removed from manhood. A proper manifestation of all our powers is impossible without swaraj. And the swaraj that Lokamanya had in view was not the swaraj for Ratnagiri people or for Maharashtrians, but for the whole of India, poor as well as rich, and swaraj has no meaning for
 
  
 the poor unless they have enough to eat. Why should we not serve our mills, you ask. Sheth Narottam Morarji, the owner of the Sholapur mills is a friend of mine, and I was the guest of his sonlibtech_239_footnotewho showered his affection on me. But does that mean that I must use cloth from the Sholapur mills and serve that “poor” Sheth Narottam and his son? Even they will not say that I would be serving the poor by using their cloth.
 I have been told everywhere that Konkan is poor. If you are poor, the situation must be unbearable for you. You say that poor people from your parts go to Bombay and earn a living there. Do you know the price that they have to pay for that living? They live in hovels without light and air, a few feet by a few feet, where several men and women are huddled together without regard for their bodily cleanliness or decency. Are you ready to send your mothers and sisters to live under such conditions? Do you not agree that  the women that go to the Bombay mills are your mothers and sisters and the men your brothers? Are you prepared to see your brothers and sisters take to a life of drunkenness and shame and return home and spread the infection of their vices? Is it worth while paying this terrible price for the eight annas they manage to earn there?
 Our cattle are destroyed because we do not know true cow- protection and our villages are ruined because we do not know true economics and sociology. The charkha can stop that ruinous process. Do you know the daily income per head of our country? Our economists say that it is one anna and six pies, though even that is misleading. If someone were to work out the average depth of a river as four feet from the fact that the river was six feet deep in certain places and two feet in others, and proceeded to ford it, would he not be drowned? That is how statistics mislead. The average income is worked out from the figures of the income of the poor man as also of the Viceroy and the millionaires. The actual income will therefore be hardly three pice per head. Now if I supplement that income by even three pice with the help of the charkha, am I not right in calling the charkha my cow of plenty? Some people attribute  superhuman powers to me, some say I have an extraordinary character. God alone knows what I am. It is also possible to disagree about the efficacy of
 
 satyagraha, but I do not think there is any reason for disagreement on these obvious facts about the charkha. If someone convinces me today that there is no poverty in India, that there are few in India who starve for want of even a few pice a day, I shall own myself to have been mistaken and shall destroy the spinning-wheel.
 I ask you therefore to bear in mind what you mean when you say that Konkan is poor. If you are really poor there is nothing like the wheel which can cure your impoverishment and which is a safeguard for the honour of your women. Seek ye first the charkha and its concomitants and everything else will be added unto you. How can you disregard a thing which is of such a national and universal character? Does it behove the followers of Lokamanya to deride or reject the wheel?
But you will ask, as a youth who sought to heckle me asked, “If
 Lokamanya liked this thing, why did he not ask the country to take it up?” Well, I cannot be taken in by your question. Whether or not Lokamanya had khadi in mind when he defined swadeshi, surely his swadeshi cannot but include khadi. I am but the heir of Lokamanya, and if I do not add to the patrimony he has left me, I would not be a worthy son of a worthy father. I pondered well over Lokamanya’s message, applied my many years experience to it and came to the conclusion that Lokamanya’s message must mean khadi. Do you know what he used to do? I am telling you of an incident that happened a short time before his death. When Maulana Shaukat Ali approached him as regards the Khilafat question, Lokamanya said to him: “I shall put my signature to whatever Gandhi signs, for I trust to his better knowledge in this matter.” Supposing therefore Lokamanya had not khadi in mind when he advised swadeshi, what does it matter? Supposing we were manufacturing spectacles here and someone were to say, “We cannot use them, Lokamanya did not advise the use thereof”, would it be proper? We would dismiss him as a literalist, Vedavadarata as the Gita would describe him. As the literalist interpreter of the Vedas does not grasp the infinite meaning of the Vedas, even so these literalist interpreters of Lokamanya’s message miss its infinite power.
 But someone comes and says, “When Mussalmans are conver- ting us who is going to listen to your khadi?” Have you, I ask,  become so impotent that you will be Mussalmans because someone compels you to embrace Islam? If you have true dharma in you, no
 
 one dare violate it. But I want to protect even our dharma by means of khadi. For khadi means the service not only of Hindu but of Mussalman women. A Maulvi in Bengal went and asked some of those women not to spin, on the ground that the khadi movement was a Hindu movement. They listened to him for a couple of days, but the third day they came asking for cotton. For what could they do? They could not go on starving and the Maulvi had no food to offer them. The learned author of the Mahabharata has described Vishvamitra, the sage, as ready to eat what was forbidden to him and even to steal, when he was oppressed by the pangs of hunger. One cannot say what  a hungry man or woman would not stoop to. I therefore tell you that you must take to khadi if only to alleviate the poverty and safeguard the honour of your women.
 I am asked to take part in the shuddhi movement. How can I, when I wish that its Muslim and Christian counterparts should also cease? It is unthinkable that a man will become good or attain salvation only if he embraces a particular religion—Hinduism, Chris- tianity or Islam. Purity of character and salvation depend  on  the  purity of heart. I therefore say to the Hindus, “Do whatever you like, but don’t ask a man like me, who has come to his conclusions after the maturest thinking, to take up what he cannot.” Man’s capacity is after all limited. I can do what is within my power, not what is beyond it. I cannot do a hundred or even half a dozen things at a time. I would think myself blessed even if I can do one thing well at a time. If you agree with me that the charkha is the best sangathan that is possible, give me as much help as you can render.

  DISCUSSION WITH V. D. SAVARKARlibtech_240_footnote 
 March 1, 1927
 Sjt. Savarkar asked Gandhiji to clear his attitude about untouchability and
 shuddhi. Gandhiji cleared some of the misrepresentations and said:
 We cannot have long talk today, but you know my regard for you as a lover of truth and as one who would lay down his life for the sake of truth. Besides, our goal is ultimately one and I would like you
 
 to correspond with me as regards all points of difference between us. And more. I know that you cannot go out of Ratnagiri and I would not mind finding out two or three days to come and stay with you if necessary to discuss these things to our satisfaction.libtech_241_footnote

  RAMACHANDRA LIFT 
 After having advertised the Ramachandra Lift in these pages I have been purposely silent about it all these weeks because it was necessary to ensure a continuous supply of these lifts on the cheapest terms possible before further notice could be taken of this ingenious invention. I have much pleasure now in informing the reader that Sjt. Ramachandra Aiyer has placed himself entirely at the disposal of the Ashram, made over his patent rights to the Ashram subject to a certain royalty being paid to him for every lift up to 1,000 lifts. Lifts can now be had on the following terms:
 Cost of the lift f.o.r. Sabarmati:
 For 30 ft. depth, Rs. 125; for 35 ft. depth, Rs. 132; for 40 ft. depth, Rs. 139 and so on; Rs. 7 extra for every additional 5 ft. depth.
These quotations are for such lifts as contain buckets up to 32 gallons.
 For buckets of greater sizes special quotations will be offered.
 (Prices are subject to market fluctuations and may vary without notice.) For local governments, zamindars, native States and co-operative societies who are willing to introduce the lift in their jurisdictions on a large scale) special quotations will be supplied on application for orders of 50 lifts or over at a time. A reduction in the prices will be made according to saving in
 the charges for packing, despatching, etc.
 When sending orders, the intending purchaser should supply the maximum depth of the well as measured from the silt to the point of discharge, and mention the size of bucket required.
 All orders must accompany 50 per cent cash and for the balance, the
 articles will be sent per V.P.P. The delivery of the lift will be made nearly a month after the receipt of money in order of precedence.
 There is no profit made by the Ashram, only cost price up to delivery is charged. The lift that has been now at work at the Ashram has proved entirely satisfactory and the problem at the Ashram is what use to make of the superfluous bulls. An illustrative catalogue giving full details has been printed. Anyone requiring further information can have the catalogue on sending to the Ashram Manager one anna postage stamp. All those who corresponded with Sjt. Ramachandra Aiyer or with me may now have their lifts on complying with the foregoing terms.

  IS INDIA PROHIBITIONIST? 
 An English friend who is anxious to undertake prohibition work for India writes:libtech_242_footnote
 I know that what everyone will say to me is that  the  Indians themselves have shown no overpowering desire for prohibition and that as they have not organized any movement for this, it is interference on our part to move in the matter. Moreover of all the Councils only one or two have declared for prohibition. Already people are saying this to me. I always point them to the Non-co-operation movement when the volunteers picketed the liquor shops. But when they say that was five years ago and they have shown no great enthusiasm lately, what is the answer?
The puzzle the friend asks me to solve is not new. The question
 is bound to occur to one who does not know the history of the total prohibition movement in India. And a stranger coming in our midst is bound to ask himself, ‘If India wants total prohibition, why does she not agitate for it as she does for many other things?’ One observes that people do not agitate when they feel absolutely helpless. It is our helplessness which prevents us from agitating beyond having reso- lutions by temperance societies and sometimes petitions to the Legislative bodies. The cry for swaraj came out of a realization of growing helplessness in matters of paramount importance to our well-being. Take the military expenditure. Everyone recognizes that much of it is a criminal waste of money collected from the starving millions. Instead of agitating for reduction in military expenditure, we agitate for swaraj, the argument being that nothing is possible without swaraj. Who can say that there is no great deal of truth in the  argument? When in 1920 we felt that we were getting swaraj, we took the law into our own hands, we successfully picketed the liquor shops and the Government was frightened to notice an immediate fall in the liquor revenue. Liquor dealers trembled in their shoes and for a moment it appeared as if the drink evil had gone. Unfortunately the party of non-violence had not attained sufficient control over the people. Violence broke out. It was discovered that pickets did not everywhere carry out the instructions to create a blockade without resort to violence or threats to use it. The picketing had therefore to
 
 
  
be suspended.
 But the history of 1920-21 shows in unmistakable terms what India would do if she had the power and what she did do when she thought that she had it. Let it be further borne in mind that millions of Indians are teetotallers by religion and by habit. Millions therefore cannot possibly be interested in keeping up the nefarious  liquor traffic. Thus in so far as it can be said that there is no agitation in India in favour of total prohibition, absence of agitation is due not to want of desire on the part of the people to secure total prohibition, but it is due to a consciousness of helplessness and to the certain know- ledge that it is an integral part of the struggle for swaraj.
 The very fact that it is necessary for any Englishman to defend liquor revenue on the grounds that there is no agitation among us for total prohibition, makes out an irresistible case for swaraj. For, it shows utter ignorance of Indian conditions where the opinion is honestly held. There is no agitation on the part of the people against malaria and scores of other diseases. Is that any reason for taking no measures for eradicating malaria and other diseases? In order to deal with a known evil, no agitation should be necessary for taking prompt measures. The drink and the drug evil is in many respects infinitely worse than the evil caused by malaria and the like; for, whilst the latter only injures the body, the former saps both body and soul. The drink revenue, military expenditure and the Lancashire’s exploitation of India through its calico, constitute the threefold wrong done by British rule to India. When Englishmen realize that it is sinful to trade upon the drink habit of the poor labourers of India, that it is sinful to dump down English and other foreign calico on the Indian soil when India’s starving millions can easily produce during their spare hours all the cloth needed for her requirements, and when they realize that it is sinful to impose a terrific military burden upon India under the ostensible purpose of defending her borders but in reality for the sake of holding her people under subjection against their will, it would be a complete demonstration of change of heart, and co-operation on a basis of absolute equality will become a real possibility. The only agitation therefore that India can carry on is to end the system which makes these wrongs possible, which is the same thing as saying that
 the agitation for swaraj is the agitation for the removal  of  these wrongs. This removal is the acid test, in my opinion, of English sincerity.

  ANCIENT WISDOM 
 Here is wisdom sent to me by the friend whom I have already introduced to the readers of these columns:
 That which is incomplete becomes complete. The crooked becomes straight.
 The empty becomes full. The worn-out becomes new. He who obtains has little. He who scatters has much.
 That is why the self-controlled man holds to unity and brings it into manifestation for men.
 He looks not at self, therefore he sees clearly. He asserts not himself, therefore he shines.  He boasts not himself, therefore he has merit. He glorifies not himself, therefore he endures.
 The Master indeed does not strive, yet no one in the world can strive against him.
 The words of the Ancients were not empty words. “That which is incomplete becomes complete.”

  CO-OPERATIVE KHADI PURCHASE 
Sjt. K. A. Nair writes as follows:libtech_243_footnote
 I commend this ingenious device for the adoption of khadi lovers. This method enables one to buy khadi without having to pay for it at once. But the unfortunate member of this co-operative club, as it may be called, whose name comes last in the raffle gains no
 
  
 advantage from his investment save that he will have learnt the art of buying khadi in a thrifty manner. The club will be his savings bank and at the end of a year he is in a position to buy all his khadi worth Rs. 24 without feeling the pinch. If the arrangement can be extended to a longer period, as it well may be by easy adjustment, all can receive the same advantage. But perhaps the attraction lies in the uncertainty of advantage and in the trifling nature of the disadvan- tage. The success of this scheme lies entirely in the honesty of the members. For, if the member who has received his Rs. 24 worth of khadi ceases to pay his contributions, the remaining ones become the losers. Therefore if this scheme has to work inexpensively and yet effectively, the membership must be necessarily restricted and con- fined only to those who know one another and are also perhaps working in a common institution or office so as to minimize the risk of loss by death or dishonesty. I hope that the example set by Sjt. Nair and his friends will be copied by others.

  SPEECH AT VAISYA VIDYASHRAM, SASAVANElibtech_244_footnote 
 [March 3, 1927]libtech_245_footnote
 I had come entirely unprepared for these tokens of love,libtech_246_footnotelibtech_247_footnote— love not only for me, but for the poor, and my greatest joy is due to the shape these tokens have taken. The donation of Rs. 63-3-0libtech_248_footnotelibtech_249_footnotereminds me of a sacred donation that I received from the late Swami Shraddhanand for my work in South Africa and which represented the value of the labour of love rendered by his brahmacharis. It is worth more than millions to me and it makes my responsibility for utilizing the funds all the greater. Your yarn also is worth its weight in gold, for what is the value of gold, but the price of labour spent in obtaining it?  Is  your  labour  any  the   less?  And  it  is  more   sacred
 
 inasmuch as it has been all done in the spirit of sacrifice.
 The rest of the speech was as a Vaisya talking to Vaisya boys.
 With brahmacharya as your shield and buckler you should find no difficulty in entering any walk of life, and if you will follow the vocation natural to you—agriculture, cow-protection, and commerce—in the right way, you will serve both your community and the country. But beware that your pursuit of these professions may not become synonymous with exploitation as it is today. If you desire to take off the sinister aspect of greedy commerce, you will have to make it centre round the charkha. There are exploiters enough on this earth. If we also follow suit, we shall have to seek for our victims on other planets. Khadi is the only wholesome national trade that we can pursue and as Vaisyas I ask you not to neglect it.
 There were garlands . . . but Gandhiji did not auction them. Nor did he make any appeal for collections. He said:
 I had not come on a business visit here. But you have given me more than enough.

  SPEECH AT VAISYA VIDYASHRAM GYMNASIUMlibtech_252_footnote 
 [March 4, 1927]
 In the morning Gandhiji performed the installation ceremony of the image of Marutilibtech_253_footnoteas part of their gymnasium. He said:
 I install this image of Maruti here, not merely because Maruti had the strength of a giant. Even Ravana had that strength. But Maruti had the strength of soul, and his physical strength was only a manifestation of his spiritual strength which in its turn was the direct fruit of his exclusive devotion to Rama and his brahmacharya. May you therefore be like Maruti of matchless valour born out of your brahmacharya and may that valour be dedicated to the service of the Motherland.

  SPEECHES AT POONAlibtech_254_footnote 
 [March 4, 1927]libtech_255_footnote
 [Concluding his Maharashtra tour Gandhiji addressed a public meeting at Reay Market. He said:]
 Hanuman tore open his heart and showed that there was nothing there but Ramanama. I have none of the power of Hanuman to tear open my heart, but if any of you feel inclined to do it, I assure you will find nothing here but love for Rama whom I see face to face in the starving millions of India.
 Gandhiji . . . [addressed a students’ meeting] at about midnight. The cry for “English, English” was there . . . Gandhiji, pained as he was by it, acceeded to the demand because of his overflowing love for the students. He said:
 If I cannot make myself understood to Poona students, it is my misfortune, the misfortune of my country, and shall I say your misfortune?
 But he acceeded to the students’ clamour for English only so far as he had to express his regret for being late at the meeting . . . When he saw that he had succeeded
 
 in gaining their ear, he delivered the message itself in Hindi. He said:
 It is possible that my message if delivered in English might get more silver from you, and it is probable that you might understand me better. But I hold my message to be far superior to myself and far superior to the vehicle through which it is expressed. It has a power all its own, and I hope it will produce an impression on the youth of India. Whether it will produce an impression in my lifetime or not, I do not care, but my faith is immovable, and as the days roll on and as the agony of the masses becomes prolonged, it will burn itself into the heart of every Indian who has a heart to respond to the message. You must understand, that at a time of my life when I should be enjoying my well-earned rest, I am not going about from one end  of  the country to the other for nothing. It is because I feel within myself with increasing force every day the strength of my conviction that I must try until the end of my days to reach it to as many ears and hearts as possible.
 The rest was a brief history of the charkha movement, which he had conceived as early as 1908 before he had actually seen a charkha, and the duty of the student world to those at the cost of whose moral and material ruin they were receiving their education.
 You may, if you will, go on receiving that education, but do at least make a decent return for it. I know you have not taken to khadi, not because you are perverse, but because you lack the conviction that there is anything like the stupendous problem of poverty and unemployment, whose existence I have been declaring from the housetops. The King of Siam refused to believe Lord Curzon when he said to him that he was coming from a country where rivers were frozen for a part of the year. I assure you I am describing to you con- ditions I have seen with my own eyes when I say that 30 million people in our land have to go without a decent meal a day.
 The rest of the speech was on brahmacharya, a thing that comes uppermost to Gandhiji’s lips whenever he finds himself amongst students. Rubbing the thing home into them, he said:
 It is as easy as it appears to be difficult, for brahmacharya is a quality of the soul; and your souls are not dead but slumbering. They are only waiting to be aroused. It seems difficult to arouse them because we have become unbelievers. It will be easy as soon as you have faith, for with faith comes God’s grace. Then it no longer
  
 remains a matter of effort and trouble, but of joy and peace. I tell you this as I have known the joy of it.

 DEAR SATIS BABU,
 I have come to Akola for a day to marry Manilal to a niece of Kishorelal Mashruwala. I leave for the Ashram tonight. I hope you are making steady progress.
 Arrangements are being made to send you as much as possible out of the 50,000 you ask. The hawking commission is not possible. It is paid under the rules only to professional hawkers for their maintenance. If we stretch the rule, we should be overwhelmed. The rules were framed to encourage hawking for a livelihood.

  UNTOUCHABILITY, WOMEN AND SWARAJ 
 I gladly publish Suhasini Devi’s letterlibtech_262_footnotelibtech_263_footnotewhich the reader will find in another column. Whilst the versatile Presidentlibtech_264_footnotelibtech_265_footnoteof the Congress is well able to defend himself, I am inclined to think that my fair correspondent has over-generalized from her own very brief experience. No statistics are needed to demonstrate the vast strides that the movement for the removal of untouchability has made. The barrier is breaking down everywhere. The higher classes are to be met
 
 with in every province ministering to the wants of the suppressed classes in the shape of conducting schools and boarding-houses for their children. It was this phenomenon that the President evidently had in mind when he made the reference in his address. There is however infinitely more yet to be done than has been already accomplished.
 The question of breaking down the feminine prejudice is most difficult. It is in reality a question of female education. And in this it is a question not merely of education of girls but it is one of the education of married women. I have therefore repeatedly suggested that every patriotic husband should become the wife’s own teacher and prepare her for work among her less fortunate sisters. I have also drawn attention to the implications of the suggestion. One of them is for husbands to cease to treat their wives as objects of their enjoyment but to regard them as co-partners in their work of nation-building. We cannot have Rama without Sita. And Sita got her real schooling under the gentle care of her partner during those terrible years of exile and probation. Well, we are all exiles in our own land and need to imitate Rama and Sita to the best of our abilities and opportunity. And in this connection, I cannot help drawing Suhasini Devi’s attention to the fact that Sjt. Iyengar has not only broken down the barrier of untou- chability for himself but has carried his wife and family too with him in the reform which perhaps he himself would have thought impossi- ble only ten years ago.
 The question of inter-dining must be kept distinct from that of untouchability. Exclusion in culinary matters permeates the whole of Hindu society. To confuse it with untouchability is to retard the progress of the latter movement which is aimed at removing the ban on the social service to which the so-called untouchable has as much right as any other human being and on the same terms as the others receive it.
 There is, too, confusion regarding swaraj. The term swaraj has many meanings. When Sjt. Iyengar says that removal  of untouchability has nothing to do with swaraj, I presume he means that its existence can be no hindrance to constitutional advance. It can surely have nothing to do with diarchy or greater and effective powers being given to the legislatures. Removal of untouchability is a social question to be handled by Hindus. Why should it prevent the Mussalman and the Parsi in common with the Hindu from having the power to regulate the military expenditure, to determine the ratio or to achieve total prohi-bition or to impose a prohibitive tariff on foreign
 
 
 cloth and protecting the indigenous industries? Real organic swaraj is a different question. That freedom which is associated with the term swaraj in the popular mind is no doubt unattainable without not only the removal of untouchability and the promotion of heart unity between the different sections but also without removing many other social evils that can be easily named. That inward growth which must never stop we have come to understand by the comprehensive term swaraj. And that swaraj cannot be had so long as walls of prejudice, passion and superstition continue to stifle the growth of that stately oak.

  PRAVARTAK YOUNG BENGAL SANGH AND KHADI 
 There is no province at the present moment so sorely affected as Bengal. Some of its best young men are rotting in jails without knowing why. Even in the Congress camp there is division. After Deshbandhu the Provincial Congress Committee has not been able to reconcile itself to a single leadership. It is no wonder. There could be only one Deshbandhu.
 But in spite of all this, constructive work is going on in Bengal almost without a stop. The number of selfless young men who are engaged in that work is daily growing. The Pravartak Sangh of Bengal whose headquarters are in Chandranagar and which is guided by Sjt. Motilal Roy has been steadily increasing its activity in the production and sale of khadi. But hitherto khadi in the Sangh has been a subsidiary activity—a little one among big ones. But Moti Babu is now determined to make it the centre of his system. I had a long talk about it myself with him when he said that the conviction was being forced upon him that it was not possible to render true service to the masses except through the spinning-wheel as the centre piece. Messrs Banker and Lakshmidas visited Chandranagar after me and they gave me a glowing account of the enthusiasm of the Sangh, about the wheel and its work at Kutubdia. They told me too how eager Moti Babu was to learn the latest improvements in carding and spinning. The Sangh is a comparatively old institution. Its original inspiration is derived from the recluse of Pondichery and has a number of selfless devoted workers in Bengal.
 From their khadi figures before me for January, I find that at their production centre they manufactured over Rs. 700 worth of khadi and their sales amounted to over Rs. 3,400 during that month. If the Sangh could concentrate its energies on khadi production, it could soon rival Khadi Pratishthan and Abhoy Ashram without in any way interfering with either. For the field for both production and sale is unlimited provided that each new organization explores and takes up a new field. It is impossible for any single organization to cope with a mighty province like Bengal.

  WANTED WORKERS 
 One hears loose talk about village organization, about work in the villages. Paper schemes also for village organization are now and again presented to the country and sometimes elegantly printed and often indifferently written. When questioned the authors tell us frankly that they have not tried their schemes, they have not got the resources, or the time or the inclination; but they think that any idea that occurs to them they are in duty bound to put before the country, however ill-digested or impracticable it might be. Some of the authors get angry when they find that their schemes do not even get a start. But there is one scheme which has been now before the country for some years and which its authors have tried to work first individually, then collectively and which is now being worked through  an ever-growing organization called the All-India Spinners’ Association. The spinning programme which has been demonstrated to be comparatively a success can be indefinitely extended if workers of the right type can be had.
 During the Maharashtra tour, I have been taken to villages where there is almost continuous famine and where people are supposed to be without enough work and without enough to eat. Some of the villages are deserted for six or eight months during the year. The villagers go to Bombay, work under unhealthy and often immoral conditions, then return to their villages during the rainy season  bringing with them corruption, drunkenness and disease. If the righttype of workers go to these villages with the message of the wheel and with a patience that will not be exhausted and a faith that will not be moved, not one of the villagers need leave their homes. For it is not
 merely the wages earned by the spinners that are to be counted but it is the whole reconstruction that follows in the wake of the spinning- wheel. The village weaver, the village dyer, the village washerman, the village blacksmith, the village carpenter, all and many others will then find themselves reinstated in their ancient dignity, as is already happ- ening wherever the spinning-wheel has gained a footing.
 Who then can become a village worker? For the work that is required of him each worker should have a thorough knowledge both theoretical and practical of the science of spinning; he should there- fore know the different varieties of cotton; he should know  the  method of picking cotton suitable for hand-spinning. For mill-spin- ning cotton is picked anyhow. For hand-spinning if cotton is properly picked it will save an immense amount of labour and the yarn also will be stronger. He should know how to gin and should know the varieties of hand-gins used in Indian villages. He should know carding and he should know the different carding-bows in use. He should be able to tell the different staples of cotton and should be able to spin a given number of counts. He should be able to test the strength and evenness and counts of yarn. He should know a good charkha from a bad one and should be able to put dilapidated charkhas under  repair.  He should be able to straighten an incorrect spindle. If the worker is to live a model life in his village, he must know also the laws of civic sanitation and provide an object-lesson in sanitation to the villagers. He should know the domestic treatment of diseases of daily occurrence. He should know simple accountancy. Above all he must lead a pure and chaste life, if he is to make his mark amongst the villagers and gain their confidence. Naturally a village worker must find happiness in a simple and frugal life. Let no one think that I have sketched what is an impossible requirement. I have not. The technique though it reads formidable is by no means so for a patient student. Purity of character must be a foregone conclusion in any of this work. And no village worker can help falling a prey to some disease or other if he does not know and observe in his own person the laws of sanitation and does not know domestic treatment of simple diseases. The spinning organization is capable of accommodating any number of workers who can satisfy the simple test laid down above.

  BURMA AND CEYLON 
 A correspondent whose studious habits are evidenced by his letter itself writes thus:
 Some of the following may strike you as idle academic questions, but the mention of India and Burma in the letter of your correspondent, who objects to Hindustani being our inter-provincial language, published in Young India of 10-2-1927, along with your replylibtech_267_footnote(in which however you do not refer
 to Burma), gives me the excuse to put you these questions which I have long been thinking of doing:
  Do 	you believe 	that Burma can properly 	be a partner 	with India in the 	future swaraj, or 	do you think 	it better 	that Burma 	should have a 	separate nationality 	? (As 	Burmese opinion itself is 	divided on 	the question, 	yours may guide 	both it and the Indian.)  Have 	you ever been to Burma in the course of your many past tours of your 	country? If not, 	do you intend 	paying a visit 	to Burma 	in the future 	and when 	?  Don’t 	you think 	it fit 	that Ceylon should be 	a partner with India in 	a future 	Swarajic Federation on 	account of 	their closer 	racial, linguistic and 	religious ties that exist 	between India and 	Burma—provided of 	course that the 	Ceylonese are willing to it (and they seem very likely) ?  Do 	you think that Hindustani 	has any appreciable 	vogue in Burma, 	though it 	has been a 	Congress province now 	for some years (since 	1908?), or that 	Hindustani will be acceptable to the Burmese? Ditto 	of Ceylon 	and the Ceylonese. 
 Well, these questions coming from me who have never been to Burma or Ceylon myself and can boast of no personal connections there may surprise you, but my interest in them is that of a cosmopolitan, which I take you also to be. I therefore hope you will answer them at your early convenience, especially as I know that many Burmese and Ceylonese as well as Indians are
 
 greatly interested in them, and are curious to know your views
 I have been to Burma and know that part of the world suffici- ently to enable me to answer with confidence the question put by the correspondent. I cannot say the same thing of Ceylon, which in spite of my desire, I have not yet been able to visit. I have no doubt in my mind that Burma cannot form part of India under swaraj. British India is an artificial description reminding us of foreign, that is, British domination and therefore its boundary is contracted or expanded at the will of those who hold us in bondage. Free India will be an orga- nic whole and will include those only who desire to remain as its free citizens. Therefore free India will have its geographical, ethnic and cultural limits. A free India will therefore recognize the differences in race and culture of the Burmese, and while it will extend the hand of fellowship and help to the Burmese nation, it will recognize its right to complete independence and help it to regain and retain it in so far as it lies in India’s power. Needless to say that therefore in my scheme there is no demand upon the Burmese to learn Hindi or Hindustani. I expect those who are within the real Indian border to learn Hindustani because they are the children of a common land and heirs  to  a common culture and are bound together by various other considera- tions and their provincial dialects contain so many common words.
 About Ceylon I cannot speak with equal confidence. Although we have a common culture with Ceylon and although it is predomin- antly inhabited by Indians from the South, it is a separate entity. And as I have no imperial aspirations for India of my imagination, I should be content to regard Ceylon as an absolutely independent State; but I should not hesitate to accept Ceylon as part of free India if  the Islanders express their wish to be so in an unmistakable language.

  SPEECH AT MADHI, MANDVI TALUK 
 March 15, 1927 Many thoughts occur to me on entering this taluk. I forget my misery by poking fun at you, but it is a sign of my pain that I resort to
 that. There was a day when not only Gujarat but the whole of India respected Surat district, and its contribution to the swaraj effort was considered to be the best, from the point of view of monetary help, silent work as soldiers’ and work in the field of education and for the service of Antyajas. There was a friendly competition between two districts. Even now I have memories of that friendly strife in which Bardoli had excelled itself, What a contrast between that day when Bardoli had become famous in the world, and today? If we go to Bardoli today, we would see only a few white caps and a few Antyajas. We would be reminded of the tragic events in Sarbhan and wonder if we would ever get swaraj. And how can I ever forget the pledge we had taken, the oath the forty-eight men had taken with God as their witness and, relying on their word, the ultimatum I had sent to the Viceroy? And now I have to come here to inaugurate this Ashram, The lesson we should draw from this is that we should not lose heart, should not lose faith till death and should not retreat—that is the significance of the starting of this Ashram. It is not a matter of pride that we have started it with money from the Gujarat Provincial Committee. If you wish that an Ashram should be established here, then you should not be reluctant to give the necessary money. You should raise the money and then ask me for men. It is a wrong procedure to get money from the Provincial Committee for  work  here. Anyone who depends only on the blood in his brain for his work is bound to fail. One should rely on the blood in every part of one’s body. Instead of functioning as our brain, the Provincial Committee has become our feet, and we let ourselves be dragged behind it. This is an unhappy state of affairs.
 When I see national schools and depressed communities in any place, I am reminded of Gujarat. I wonder, then, if Gujarat is not out of the competition. But I am an optimist, and see rays of hope even in the face of countless disappointments. One such ray, of course, is this modest Ashram, for there are still earnest workers to run it. May it prosper, and may Bardoli, broken in spirit, and Surat in ruins, shine again and shed lustre on Gujarat and the country.

 Kaka Saheb had suggested that the Managing Committee should see all relevant letters so as to know my views on various matters. This is right and so henceforth I shall write separately on business matters so that everyone can go through the correspondence. Again I find you as uncharitable as before. I agree it is unavoidable since you are not aware of it. Shake off this attitude. You will be able to do so if you try. You must participate in the work of the School Committee. If you wish to be nominated to the Education Committee, it can be done. Do not stand on prestige. More when I get your letter. Try to pacify Ramachandra. You should have a better appreciation of the diffi- culties of the lift.

  SPEECH AT RANIPARAJ CONFERENCE, VEDCHHIlibtech_282_footnote 
 March 16, 1927
 Gandhiji asked:
 Those who pledged themselves to wear khaddar, raise their hands—all. Those who pledged themselves to abjure  drink—all. Those who have kept their vows—all. Those who have broken their vow-—none.
 The earlier part [of his speech] was by way of appeal to the money-lender and the liquor-seller, the Bania and the Parsi, to reform their ways, as the latter part was one of congratulation to the Hillmen and urging them to carry on self-purification more extensively. There was a quaint appeal about the way in which he commended to them the new appellation of “Hillmen”.
Why should you be  called “black” people? We  are all black,
 the God who coloured our skin being the same, and his brush being the same. You will be called Hillmen from today. Be you brave as the
 
 lions and tigers in the hills, so that none may cheat you, or oppress you, or violate your purity. The denizen of the forest is either a wise man, a rishi or a dacoit or a beast of prey. You are neither of the last two, so you have to become rishis. And there is no lack of opportunity for you. None of the wicked temptations of the towns lie in your way. You are fitted by nature to live on fruit and root and to eat in order to live, not to live in order to eat, and therefore best fitted to teach us that healthy way of living. Learn our sacred lore and with your innate purity of heart tame the lion and the tiger, as did the rishis of old. To the women I would say just a word. I am glad you have taken to khaddar, I now want you to give up your ugly ornaments which disfigure your limbs, are receptacles of dirt, and badges of slavery.

  MR. SPEAKER’S DONATION 
 It was not without regret that I had to withhold the pleasure from the readers of sharing the news contained in the following corres- pondence between Sjt. Vithalbhai Patel and myself. . . .
 IVlibtech_283_footnote
        MY 	DEAR MAHATMAJI,  20, AKBAR 	ROAD, 	NEW DELHI,  March 	9, 1927 
  I 	have decided, as you are already aware, to remit to you as before 	such amount as I think I can reasonably save every month from my 	salary for the purpose mentioned in my letter to you on the subject 	in the month of Aprillibtech_284_footnotelast. I propose to 	continue this arrangement as far as possible during the whole period 	of my office as President of the Assembly.

 administration in the hands of men of known standing. If the object is to be attained, the board of trustees should, whilst it ought to be completely national, be representative of as many parties as it is possible to bring at a common board. I therefore invite criticism and suggestions from those who approve of the plan. I have no desire to take sole charge of the funds or to use them only for the purposes to which my life is devoted. I know that I shall be best fulfilling the purpose of Vithalbhai’s great gift by seeking the co-operation of as many as would help.
 Young India, 17-3-1927
 
  NO AND YES 
 “Comrade” Saklatwala is dreadfully in earnest. His sincerity is transparent. His sacrifices are great. His passion for the poor is unquestioned. I have therefore given his fervent open appeallibtech_285_footnotelibtech_286_footnoteto  me that close attention which that of a sincere patriot and humanitarian must command. But in spite of all my desire to say ‘Yes’ to his appeal, I must say ‘No’ if I am to return sincerity for sincerity or if I am to act according to my faith. But I can say ‘Yes’ to his appeal after my own fashion. For underneath his intense desire that I should co-operate with him on his terms, there is the emphatic implied condition that I must say ‘Yes’ only if his argument satisfies my head and heart. A ‘No’ uttered from deepest conviction is better  and greater than a ‘Yes’ merely uttered to please, or what is worse, to avoide trouble.
 In spite of all the desire to offer hearty co-operation, I find myself against a blind wall. His facts are fiction and his deductions based upon fiction are necessarily baseless. And where these facts are true, my whole energy is concentrated upon nullifying their (to me) poisonous results. I am sorry, but we do stand at opposite poles. There is however one great thing in common between us. Both claim to have the good of the country and humanity as our only goal. Though therefore we may for the moment seem to be going in opposite directions, I expect we shall meet some day. I promise to make ample amends when I discover my error. Meanwhile however, my error,  since I do not recognize it as such, must be my shield and my solace.
 
 For unlike“Comrade” Saklatwala, I do not believe that multi- plication of wants and machinery contrived to supply them is taking the world a single step nearer its goal. “Comrade” Saklatwala swears by the modern rush. I whole-heartedly detest this mad desire to dest- roy distance and time, to increase animal appetites and go to the ends of the earth in search of their satisfaction.  If  modern  civilization stands for all this, and I have understood it to do so, I call it satanic and with it the present system of Government, its best exponent. I distrust its schemes of amelioration of the lot of the poor, I distrust its currency reform, I distrust its army and navy. In the name of civili- zation and its own safety this Government has continuously bled the masses, it has enslaved the people, it has bribed the powerful with distinctions and riches and it has sought to crush under the weight of its despotic regulations the liberty-loving patriots who would not be won over either by flattery or riches. I would destroy that system today, if I had the power. I would use the most deadly weapons, if I believed that they would destroy it. I refrain only because the use of such weapons would only perpetuate the system though it may des- troy its present administrators. Those who seek to destroy men rather than their manners adopt the latter and become worse than  those whom they destroy under the mistaken belief that the manners will die with the men. They do not know the root of the evil.
 The movement of 1920 was designed to show that we could not reform the soulless system by violent means, thus becoming soulless ourselves, but we could do so only by not becoming victims of the system, i.e., by non-co-operation, by saying an emphatic ‘No’ to  every advance made to entrap us into the nets spread by satan.
 That movement suffered a check but is not dead. My promise was conditional. The conditions were simple and easy. But they pro- ved too difficult for those who took a leading part in the movement.
 What “Comrade” Saklatwala believes to be my error and failure  I regard to be the expression of my strength and deep conviction. It may be an error but so long as my conviction that it is truth abides, my very error must, as it does, sustain me. My retracing my steps at Bardoli I hold to be an act of wisdom and supreme service to the country. The Government is the weaker for that decision. It would have regained all lost position if I had persisted after Chauri Chaura in
 carrying out the terms of what was regarded as an ultimatumlibtech_287_footnoteto  the Viceroy.
 My “Comrade” is wrong in saying that the South African movement was a failure. If it was, my whole life must be written down as a failure. And his invitation to me to enlist under his colours must be held to be meaningless. South Africa gave the start to my life’s mission. Nor do I consider it to be wrong to have offered, during the late War, the services of my companions and myself, under my then convictions, as ambulance men.
 This great M.P. is in a hurry. He disdains to study facts. Let me inform him that the khadi movement is not on the wane. It did last year at least twenty times as much work as during 1920. It is now serving not less than 50,000 spinners in 1,500 villages besides weavers, washermen, printers, dyers and tailors.
 Mr. Saklatwala asks what khaddar stands for. Well, it stands for simplicity not shoddiness. It sits well on the shoulders of the poor and it can be made, as it was made in the days of yore, to adorn the bodies of the richest and the most artistic men and women. It is reviving ancient art and crafts. It does not seek to destroy all machinery but it does regulate its use and check its weedy growth. It uses machinery for the service of the poorest in their own cottages. The wheel is itself an exquisite piece of machinery.
 Khaddar delivers the poor from the bonds of the rich and creates a moral and spiritual bond between the classes and the masses. It restores to the poor somewhat of what the rich have taken from them.
 Khaddar does not displace a single cottage industry. On the contrary, it is being daily recognized that it is becoming the centre of other village industries. Khaddar brings a ray of hope to the widow’s broken-up home.
 But it does not prevent her from earning more if she can. It prevents no one from seeking a better occupation. Khaddar offers honourable employment to those in need of some. It utilizes the idle hours of the nation. The esteemed comrade quotes with pride the work of those who offer more lucrative employment. Let him know that khaddar does that automatically. It cannot put annas into the pockets of the poor without putting rupees into the pockets of some.
 
 Whereas those who begin their work in the cities, though they are no doubt doing good work, touch but the fringe of the question. Khaddar touches the very centre and therefore necessarily includes the rest.
 But the whole of the impatient communist’s letter concentrates itself upon the cities and thus ignores India and Indian conditions which are to be found only in her 7,00,000 villages. The half a dozen modern cities are an excrescence and serve at the present moment the evil purpose of draining the life-blood of the villages. Khaddar is an attempt to revise and reverse the process and establish a better relationship between the cities and the villages. The cities with their insolent torts [sic] are a constant menace to the life and liberty of the villagers.
 Khaddar has the greatest organizing power in it because it has itself to be organized and because it affects all India. If khaddar rained from heaven it would be a calamity. But as it can only be manufactured by the willing co-operation of starving millions and thousands of middle-class men and women, its success means the best organization conceivable along peaceful lines.
 If cooking had to be revived and required the same organi- zation, I should claim for it the same merit that I claim for khaddar.
 My communist comrade finds fault with my work among the labourers in Jamshedpur because I accepted an address in Jamshedpur not from the Tatas but from the employees. His disapprobation is due,  I expect, to the fact that the late Mr. Ratan Tata was in the chair. Well, I am not ashamed of the honour. Mr. Tata appeared to me to be a humane and considerate employer. He readily granted, I think, all the prayers of the employees and I heard later that the agreement was being honourably kept. I do ask and receive donations for my work from the rich as well as the poor. The former gladly give me their donations. This is no personal triumph. It is the triumph of non-vio- lence which I endeavoured to represent, be it ever so inadequately. It is to me a matter of perennial satisfaction that I retain generally the affection and the trust of those whose principles and policies I oppose. The South Africans gave me personally their  confidence  and extended their friendship. In spite of my denunciation of British policy and system I enjoy the affection of thousands of Englishmen and women, and in spite of unqualified condemnation of modern materialistic civilization, the circle of European and American friends
 
 is ever widening. It is again a triumph of non-violence.
 Lastly about labour in the cities. Let there be no misunder- standing. I am not opposed to organization of labour, but as in every- thing else, I want its organization along Indian lines, or if you will, my lines. I am doing it. The Indian labourer knows it instinctively. I do not regard capital to be the enemy of labour. I hold their co-ordina- tion to be perfectly possible. The organization of labour that I under- took in South Africa, Champaran or Ahmedabad was in no spirit of hostility to the capitalists. The resistance in each case and to the extent it was thought necessary was wholly successful. My ideal is equal distribution, but so far as I can see, it is not to be realized. I therefore work for equitable distribution. This I seek to attain through khaddar. And since its attainment must sterilize British exploitation at its centre, it is calculated to purify the British connection. Hence in that sense khaddar leads to swaraj.
 The Mahatma I must leave to his fate. Though a non-cooperator I shall gladly subscribe to a bill to make it criminal for anybody to call me Mahatma and to touch my feet. Where I can impose the law myself, i.e., at the Ashram, the practice is criminal.

 your experiences at the India Office. I am quite sure that the steps you are taking to equip yourself for the task are the proper and necessary steps. They alone can give you the knowledge, experience and confidence required for the struggle that is in front of you.
 I have read your interview with The Observer. It was reproduced in one of the Indian dailies. I certainly agree with you that if you had not given that interview it would have been better. But, if the reporter has correctly reported you what does it matter even if it contains some erroneous deductions. It would be terrible if at every step we hesitate because of the possibility of erroneous judgement.

  	It was very good that you came to the Ashram. The training the women 	get at the Ashram at present is not being provided any- where in the 	world. Do whatever work you can while taking care of your health. 	Look after the children well, as if they were your own children. 	Keep Vimu with you if she agrees. I do not know where you have 	decided to stay. If you are going to stay in the hostel, Vimu will 	have to live away from you. Take particular care of her even if she 	lives away.

N. 4186     CONVOCATION ADDRESS AT GURUKUL KANGRIlibtech_291_footnote   March, 19, 1927 The Gurukul was Swamiji’s best 	creation and though he is physically not with us he lives amongst us 	in his Gurukul. It was his     
 most original contribution to education, inasmuchas when we had lost our heads over Western education he decided that we should think and act and educate ourselves in the Vedic way. Swamiji will live with us so long as his Gurukul lasts and the Gurukul will last so long as there is a single graduate of the Gurukul prepared to serve it with truth and self- sacrifice, and with the courage which was Swamiji’s and which is a synonym for forgiveness. Then there is brahmacharya on which Swamiji laid the greatest emphasis and without which all  your education will come to naught. Avoiding lustful contact with women is not the last word on brahmacharya. It is only the beginning and the perf ection is reached when the brahmachari refuses to be ruffled or angry, no matter what provocation is offered him. For anger is the destruction of virya,  the vital essence.libtech_292_footnote
 I appeal to you to carry on the work, by forgetting which you will forget Swamiji and by killing which you will kill Swamiji. Remember Abdul Rashid has not murdered Swamiji, he has made him a martyr. The day you forget the Swami’s mission will be his day of death. The Swami was a great lover of untouchables. All who love him are in duty bound to carry on his mission. It will be a great misfortune if the Swami’s beloved cause is given up because of lack of funds or workers.
 Continuing, Mr. Gandhi said that Malaviyaji has pleaded more strongly for khaddar than he could do, but he too wanted to appeal as khaddar helped the solution of the problem of untouchability. Khaddar and charkha provided food to the teeming millions, mostly the depressed classes. Hence khaddar and the removal of untou- chability were interwoven and could not be separated.
 If you want to save our ancient civilization and if you feel it a duty to save the villagers from destruction, then take up the message of khaddar from village to village.
 Concluding, Mr. Gandhi said :
 Truth is the bedrock of happy live. Be true to yourselves and the country.

 We khadi workers make our collections in handkerchiefs, yours you would do in buckets. . . .
 If I have criticized the Arya Samaj, I am also anxious to give my tribute of praise for its work. And those who give hearty praise have a right to criticize too. Of all religious and political bodies that have come into being of late years the Arya Samaj has made probably the greatest contribution to bridge the gulf between the classes and the masses that had been widening ever since the advent of the British in India. No institution is perfect, and I could, if I would, point out some of the defects of the Gurukul. But there is no questioning the fact that it has rendered substantial service to the country. Whenever I see a Punjabi youth capable of reading and writing Devanagari, I imme- diately conclude that he must have had his training in one of the Gurukuls. They have done more than any other institutions in these parts to revivify Sanskrit learning and Aryan culture.

  SPEECH AT NATIONAL EDUCATION CONFERENCE, HARDWARlibtech_295_footnote 
 March 20, 1927 It is the duty of every Indian student to  learn Sanskrit.  It certainly is the duty of the Hindus, but it is also the Muslims’ because,
in the final analysis, their forbears too were Rama and Krishna and
 they ought to know Sanskrit in order to know them. However, to maintain contacts with the Muslims, it is also the duty of Hindus to learn the former’s language. Today we run away from each other’s languages because we have become mad. Take it for a certainty that an institution which teaches fear and hatred of others surely is not a national institution.
 Gandhiji said that national institutions should produce messengers of Hindu-Muslim unity. Institutions producing fanatical Hindus and Muslims were worth destruction. Educational institutions were not meant to produce bigoted persons. He was sure that there was no reason for disappointment and still the cause could prosper if self-reliant and self-sacrificing teachers were available.libtech_296_footnote

 BHAISHRI FULCHAND,
 Your letter about Rs. 2,000 has been referred to me. I have not a cowrie left with me. Whatever had been saved has been spent, so I shall have to go abegging once again.
 I have written to them to send you the amount this time, what- ever their difficulty. But what about later?
 Now you will have to get your budget approved by me. You— i.e., you and Devchandbhai—should have the influence to raise the funds needed to run the Parishad. If this cannot be done, how long can we hold on?
 Budgets for all the other centres should also receive prior approval. You should show to Nanabhai the budget for your school in particular. He should inspect the school and I shall try to raise the amount that he approves of. I am always thinking of affiliating all the national schools to the Vidyapith, because it is now becoming difficult to ask for separate funds. Of course we do collect from a great many donors in the name of khadi. I had hoped to accomplish something at the Parishad; but it did not come off. So now we have to think anew since it has been postponed to August. So get your budget first sanctioned by me before you put in your next demand. Ultimately each [institution] will have to stand on its own as in the rest of the country. Or we shall have to draw up some special scheme for educa- tion in Maha Gujarat. You should contact Nanabhai and consider all

 The matters. We may be said to have taken up three tasks, viz., the khadi movement, work among the Antyajas and national educa- tion in general.
I see all the three combined in khadi; education it certainly
 covers. I have not yet discovered any final solution for the Antyaja problem. I write all this for your co-workers to think over. You should write to me for clarifications, which might solve some of your prob- lems.

I am very 	glad that pujya Malaviyaji is being progressively drawn to 	the charkha. I shall want large amounts for the charkha work. With 	his help I can raise larger funds.    
 Bhaiji and Rameshwarji have decided to donate money for the construction of reservoirs of water for the Antyajas; it will be spent as directed by them.
 I did not know Parasram collected scraps of paper. I  have warned him against this fault. He will write to you. He had no wrong motive. He is a simpleton but I can get work out of him. He wishes to live with pujya Malaviyaji and Rabindranath for some days. I have asked him to try on his own to get himself admitted to their service.
 In my opinion the following rules of conduct must be observed to safeguard one’s health while staying in Europe:
 We should not take food to which we are not used.  In 	Europe they 	eat six or seven 	times a day, 	but we must 	not eat more 	than thrice. Do not 	get addicted to 	taking chocolate 	or other 	such things between meals.  They 	eat even at 1 o’clock 	at night. 	But we must  eat  	nothing after 8 	in the evening. When 	visiting people and 	places we 	are, it 	is believed, expected to take tea, etc. This is not true.  One 	should go 	walking at 	least six 	miles daily. One 	should walk 	both in the 	morning and 	in the evening.  It 	is not right 	to wear 	too many 	clothes, secret 	being that one 	must not 	feel cold. Walking 	shakes off cold. It is not at all necessary to put on European dress.  One 	should try 	to get 	acquainted with 	the poor people of 	Europe; walking helps 	such acquaintance. 	When there 	is time 	at your 	disposal, it is better 	to walk.  Do 	not persuade 	yourself for a 	moment that since you 	have gone 	to Europe 	you have 	got to 	do something, Attempt 	only what 	clean and 	spontaneous efforts can accomplish.  Your 	stay in Europe 	will, I 	feel, result 	in at least 	one good thing. 	You can certainly 	build up your body.  May 	God save 	you from mental 	debauchery; very 	few Indians escape it. 	While their way 	of living 	is natural 	to them, 	it only 	helps to 	intoxicate us.  The 	practice of 	reading the 	Gita and 	the Ramayana  must 	in no case 	be given 	up. If 	you have 	not been 	doing it already, 	the sooner 	you begin 	the better. 
 I am sure you did not expect advice in such minute detail. This I am giving because I have great faith in the goodness of yourself and
 your brothers. Few rich people possess your goodness and humility. I seek an intense growth in these qualities and I want to put them to use in the service of the nation. I have no faith in the principle of shatham prati shathyamlibtech_300_footnote. Therefore, wherever I see purity, truth and non-viol- ence, etc., even in the smallest degree, I start collecting the treasure with the care of a miser, and it makes me happy.
You can ask for any further advice.

      ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS    [March 21, 1927]libtech_301_footnote  [QUESTION:] 	1. Do you feel it unbearable to live under the present political 	thraldom or not?  [ANSWER 	:] I do.   If 		so, are you yourself 		individually prepared 		to get 		rid of it 		and gain political 		freedom or not?  I 	am.   Is 		there any objection 		to suppose 		that ""your being 		prepared"" means 		that you have acquired two spiritual qualities, viz., soul-force and love of freedom ?  You 	may suppose so.   Does 		not ""preparation 		for the attainment 		of freedom"" 		mean making the 		Indians endowed with the 		qualities and power necessary for such attainment which you 		respectively have acquired?  It 	does mean.   Is 		not intellectual 		and moral education 		necessary for 		acquiring such qualities?  It 	is.     
  If 	so, what are 	the ways of 	educating the 	whole nation and 	how much time 	will it 	take to 	do it? 
Through spinning.
  Is 	not the creation 	of a feeling 	of thorough 	disgust for political 	subjection extremely necessary? 
It is.
  If 	so, what may 	be in your opinion the 	percentage of 	people having such a 	feeling among the 	three hundred millions of Indians? 
Difficult to estimate.
  To 	create the 	consciousness of 	bondage is 	it not necessary 	to have 	the knowledge 	of the past 	glory of the motherland 	and to feel 	real restlessness on 	account of 	the present 	painful condition? 
It is.
  Is 	it possible to 	create soul-force in 	the absence 	of the 	said knowledge or 	the said 	restlessness ? 
Hardly.
  Do 	acquisition of 	soul-force and 	the possession of 	the power to 	suffer any 	pains boldly and calmly constitute the chief pillars of your spiritual activities or not? 
To an extent, yes.
  Where, 	under what circumstances and 	how are the people to 	make use 	of their 	soul-force for wresting power from the rulers ? 
Throughout the country by non-violent non-co-operation.
  What 	kind of intellectual, 	moral and physical 	preparation is necessary 	on the 	part of 	the people 	for the accomplishment 	of these 	two objects, 	viz., civil disobedience 	and refusal to pay Government taxes? 
Hand-spinning gives them an idea of non-violence and self-
confidence.
  If 	our preparedness 	be looked 	upon as being 	complete, i.e., 	16 annas, 	what proportion 	of the 	preparedness in 	terms of 	annas is 	necessary, in 	your opinion, 	on the 	part of your 	followers or 	the general 	public to bring 	about the attainment of 	freedom? 
Eight annas one pie.
  Is 	the public 	so prepared 	today? If 	not how much 	time do you 	think, it 	will take to be so prepared? 
Not yet; unable to prophesy.
  What 	percentage of 	people in 	the country 	knows the 	fact that there is 	a unique personality like 	Mahatma Gandhi in India? 
I have no idea.
  If 	it is taken for 	granted that one 	among a 	thousand may 	know it, 	how many 	persons per 	hundred thousand may 	have, in 	your opinion, 	the knowledge 	of Mahatmaji's 	ideas of freedom 	and his activities? 
1/1000th of those that know.
  It 	seems that 	there is 	complete darkness with 	respect to 	such knowledge; 	if the darkness is to be dispelled, how long will it have to be done? 
As long as is necessary.
  Do 	you say that 	it is impossible 	to attain 	swaraj even if, in 	the absence 	of unity between the 	Hindus and 	Muslims, people of 	both communities 	should feel the 	miseries of 	political bondage to 	be unbearable and 	should struggle to 	be free from it, 	and even 	if a feeling 	should arise in both 	the communities 	that life without freedom is 	worse than death? 
I do not, if both feel as you suggest.
  Do 	you say that 	a painful 	consciousness of 	the unbearable political 	condition has 	not the power to 	bring into being the 	union of 	the communities belonging 	to two different 	cultures ? 
It has the power.
  The 	religious persecution of 	the Hindus 	by the 	Mohammedans was 	the principal 	cause which contributed to 	the attainment 	of freedom 	in the 	days of 	Shivaji and 	people belonging 	to different 	castes became united to 	free themselves from 	religious persecutions. 	Readers of history 	do know 	the fact that the establishment 	of maths 	by Ramdas 	proved very useful in 	this respect. Is 	it not the fact that the 	freedom which 	the people want 	today is for 	freeing themselves from 	the political, industrial 	and commercial oppression? 
Yes; indeed.
  Whether 	untouchability goes away 	or not, 	whether the 	Hindu- Moham- 	medan disunion disappears 	or not, 	if, in 	spite of 	the existence 	of these 	two things, 	we could 	have two thousand 	persons maddened with the 	desire for 	freedom and 	endowed with 	soul-force, will 	you say that these men will not be 	able to 	gain the freedom 	of the country? 
 These two thousands will sweep away disunion and untou- chability and bring swaraj.
  If 	1,400 civilians 	can hold such a vast 	country like 	India under subjugation 	will you say that the 	said two thousand persons 	endowed with the said 	qualities will not 	be able to 	take back India? 
 Vide answer 22.
  In 	short, do 	you say that 	it is not 	possible to 	attain swaraj even if 	the one 	emotion of 	feeling a 	strong disgust for 	bondage and 	regarding life without 	liberty to 	be unbearable, pervades the whole of India? 
Mere emotion will never bring swaraj.
 
  If it is seen that the said emotion is quite indispensable and that it would lead to the attainment of swaraj, can it be created by your present lectures on khaddar? 
 My   lectures   on   khaddar  are   converting   that   emotion into
energy.

            CHI. 	MIRA,    LETTER TO MIRABEHN    ON 	THE TRAIN, 	 AFTER BHARATPUR  March 	22, 1927 
  	The parting today was sad, because I saw that I pained you. And yet 	it was inevitable. I want you to be a perfect woman. I want you to 	shed all angularities. All unnecessary reserve must go. Ashram is 	the centre of your home, but wherever you happen to be must be your 	home. Without being a burden on people with whom we come in contact, 	we must get the things we need from them. We must feel one with all. 	And I have discovered that we never give without receiving 	consciously or unconsciously. There is a reserve which I want us all 	to have. But that reserve must be a fruit of self-denial, not 	sensitiveness. Yours is due to sensitiveness. This must go. I 	thought I would draw your attention. But I saw that I should have 	waited. However, the thing is done.  	Do throw off the nervousness. You must not cling to me as in this 	body. The spirit without the body is ever with you. And that is more 	than the feeble embodied imprisoned spirit with all the limita- 	tions that flesh is heir to. The spirit without the flesh is 	perfect, and that is all we need. This can be felt only when we 	practise detachment. This you must now try to achieve.  	This is how I would grow if I were you. But you should grow along 	your own lines. You will therefore reject all I have said in this    
 that does not appeal to your heart or head. You must retain your individuality at all cost. Resist me when you must. For I may judge you wrongly in spite of all my love for you. I do not want you to impute infallibility to me.

      SPEECH AT SANTA CRUZ, BOMBAYlibtech_306_footnote    March 	23, 1927 Replying, Gandhiji 	began to address the gathering in Gujarati when he was requested to speak in 	Hindi as there was a large section of Madrasis and others, who  could 	not understand Gujarati. Gandhiji, however, took votes and according 	to the majority began to speak in Gujarati but assured the minority 	that their claim would not be neglected. He said: The 	fear entertained by Mr. J. K. Mehta is well-founded and I  	am really going to hit as hard as a man with non-violence as his 	creed can do for the wide difference between the amount given at 	Santa Cruz six years ago and the onelibtech_307_footnotelibtech_308_footnotegiven 	today. It was only on account of the pressing invitation of Mr. 	Mehta that I agreed to come here instead of going to Rewari as was 	originally fixed. You perhaps know that though I am not neglecting 	the cities I have been going to the villages very often these days 	because India resides not in her handful of towns but in villages. 	Even there it is not difficult to collect Rs. 3,000. You will 	perhaps be surprised to learn that the villages in Maharashtra and 	Bihar contributed a lakh and a quarter each during my last tour 	there. And khaddar too is spreading fast and wide in villages. I 	shall quote figures which will prove, in spite of all the odd     
 rumours that khaddar is extinct, that khaddar is produced 20 times more than it was being manufactured in 1920, i.e., in the beginning of the movement. In 1926, khaddar worth at least Rs. 20 lakhs was manufactured and at least 50,000 women scattered in 1,500 different villages of the country were given work of spinning for which they were paid over Rs. 9 lakhs. But this position is not at all satisfactory. It does not satisfy me. I have found that khaddar is rarely seen in Bombay and other cities. In Bombay in 1921, the case was quite different. I can account for the present slackness on two grounds that either those who were wearing khaddar before have changed their opinion or that they were playing a false part in 1921.
 Although this is not the occasion on which I can speak either on non-co-operation or Hindu-Muslim unity, I should state clearlythat my faith in those things is as great and as firm as it ever was. I should say it is greater. If I want swaraj and swaraj of the type I have been struggling for all along the last few years, I cannot help feeling that Hindu-Muslim unity is absolutely necessary. But as one who  can  know human nature, I have found that the whole atmosphere is changed. But it is not so with khaddar. The result of the khaddar work is not disappointing. I have found that people are not tired of it. And for this we need not rely on newspapers which as a matter of fact are read only in cities. I have found no newspapers in Hardwar and yet Rs. 2 lakhs were easily collected there. That place is not like Bombay which seems to me to be an offshoot of England.
The money that I have been collecting at present goes to the

The fitting memorial to the late Deshbandhu would be a thorough organization of villages and I dare say that charkha is the only way to organize the villages of India. I can give you an example of the Raniparaj community of the Surat District where through the message of the charkha the community in about 104 villages has been thoroughly organized.libtech_309_footnotelibtech_310_footnoteThe illiterate women of that community have given up wearing heavy ornaments and all of them—-men, women and children wore pure khaddar.

 contribute the greatest amount for the great movement of khaddar.

   FROM HIS TREASURE CHEST  
 I cull the following from gems the friend whom I have already introduced to the reader sends for my day of silence:
 The tongue of man reveals so imperfectly the secret mysteries of God, that words would have been to us rather a hindrance than a consolation.
 BROTHER GILES
 Settle yourselves in solitude and you will come upon God in your- selves.
 TERESA
 Thou needst not call Him to thee from a distance, thy opening and His entering are but one moment. It is harder for Him to wait, than for thee.

   KANGRI GURUKUL  
 Kangri Gurukul was the body in which the soul of Shraddhan- anji resided, no matter where its temporary earthly tabernacle wandered from time to time, and Shraddhanandji lives so long as the Gurukul lives The best memorial therefore that can be erected to the memory of the deceased martyr is to perpetuate the Gurukul. No doubt the really permanent memorial will have to come through the
 
 character of the professors and the scholars of the Gurukul and thr- ough their determination to retain in it the predominance of ancient teaching and conduct based on it. Shradhanandji used with ample justification to plead that his Gurukul was a  national  institution  in  the non-co-operation sense long before the birth of Non-co-oper- ation. He believed that to belong to a Government educational insti- tution was to subscribe to the predominance of Western influence whether we willed or no. He did not object to assimilating what was useful of the West on his own terms and in his own time. To be a fitting memorial of the Swami the Gurukul must therefore keep its complete independence of the Government. And it is a matter of no small satisfaction that the Gurukul in spite of its independence of Governrnent aid or influence continues to grow in numbers as I hope too it does in character, in the spirit of its revered founder.
 But if the memorial depends for its real existence ultimately on the character of the scholars and the professors it has to depend presently upon financial support from the public. Acharya Ramadeva has issued an appeal for three lakhs of rupees. I understand  that  nearly two lakhs are already subscribed. The scene I witnessed when the appeallibtech_313_footnotelibtech_314_footnotewas made in that huge pandal on the Gurukul ground on the 19th instant was a never-to-be forgotten sight.libtech_315_footnotelibtech_316_footnotePeople—men and women—vied with one another in pouring their rupees and notes into the buckets with which voluntecrs moved about among the visitors. There were hardly any coppers to be seen. I heartily commend this appeal to the attention of the public. I have stated my differences with the Arya Samaj and its doctrines. They abide. I have my differences about the conduct of Gurukul. But I am not blind to the services of the Arya Samaj and the necessity of Gurukuls. They have revivified religion, if they have also limited its growth. Every reform has that tendency in it. The wise sift the good from the bad and conserve what is good. The Gurukuls has much in it to conserve and those who would want it to be better than it is have but to prove their friendliness before they seek to introduce changes for its betterment. I have therefore no hesitation in identifying myself with  the  appeal  for funds. There should be no delay or difficulty in making  up  the modest sum required.

   PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION OF “SELF-RESTRAINT  
 v. SELF-INDULGENCE”libtech_317_footnote
 That the first edition was sold out practically within a week of its publication is a matter of joy to me. The correspondence that the series of articles collected in this volume has given rise to shows the need for such a publication. May those who have not made self-indul- gence a religion, but who are struggling to regain lost self-control, which should under normal conditions be our natural state, find some help from a perusal of these pages. For their guidance the following instructions may prove useful:
    Remember 			if you 			are married that 			your wife is your 			friend, companion 			and co-worker, 			not an 			instrument of 			sexual enjoyment.  Self-control 			is the 			law of your 			being. Therefore the 			sexual act 			can be performed 			only when both desire 			it and 			that too subject to rules which in 			their lucidity both 			may have 			agreed upon.  If 			you are unmarried 			you owe it 			to yourself, to 			society and 			to your future 			partner to keep 			yourself pure. 			If you 			cultivate this sense 			of loyalty, 			you will find it 			as an infallible 			protection against 			temptation.  Think 			always of that 			unseen Power which though we 			may never 			see we all feel 			within watching and 			noting every impure 			thought and 			you will find that 			Power ever helping you.  Laws 			governing a 			life of 			self-restraint must 			be necessary 			different from 			a life 			of self-indulgence. 			Therefore you will 			regulate your society, your reading, your haunts of recreation and your food.   
You will seek the society of the good and the pure.
 You will resolutely refrain from reading passion-breeding novels and magazines and read the works that sustain humanity. You will make one book your constant companion for referen- ces and guidance.
 You will avoid theatres and cinemas. Recreation is where you may not dissipate yourself but recreate yourself You will therefore attend bhajan mandalis where the word and the tune uplift the soul.
You will cat not to satisfy your palate but your
 
 hunger. A self-indulgent man lives to eat; a self-restrained man eats to live. Therefore you will abstain from all irritating condi- ments, alcohol which excites the nerves, and narcotics which deaden the sense of right and wrong. You will regulate the quantity and times of your meals.
    When 			your passions threaten 			to get 			the better of 			you go 			down on 			your knees 			and cry out to 			God for help. 			Ramanama is my 			infallible Help. 			As extraneous 			aid take a 			hip-bath i.e., 			sit in a 			tubfull of cold 			water with 			your legs out of it, 			and you will find your passions 			have immediately 			cooled. Sit 			in it for 			a rew 			minutes unless you 			are weak 			and there 			I danger 			of a chill.  Take 			brisk walking exercise 			in the 			open air 			early in 			the morning 			and at 			night before 			going to bed.  			“Early 			to bed 			and early to 			rise, makes a 			man healthy, 			wealthy and wise,” 			is a 			sound proverb. 			9 o’clock 			to bed 			and 4 o’clock 			to rise 			is a 			good rule. Go 			to bed on 			an empty stomach. 			Therefore your last 			meal must not 			be after 			6 p.m.  Remember 			that man is 			a representative 			of God 			to serve 			all that 			lives and thus 			to express 			God’s dignity 			and love. 			Let service 			be your sole joy and you will need no other enjoyment in life.

 217. TO A READER OF “YOUNG INDIA”
 I do not propose to publish your letter in defence  of the  purdah. I am of opinion that the purdah in India is recent institution and was adopted during the period of Hindu decline. In the age when proud Draupadi and spotless Sita lived there could be no purdah. Gargi could not have held her discourses from behind the purdah. Nor is the purdah universal in India. It is unknown in the Deccan, Gujarat and the Punjab. It is unknown among the peasantry and one does not hear of any untoward consequences of the comparative freedom which women in these provinces and among peasantry enjoy. Nor will it be just to say that the women or men in the other parts of the world are less moral because of the absence of the purdah system. “A reader of young India” seeks to defend everything that is ancient. Whilst I hold that the ancients gave us a moral code which is not to be
 
 surpassed, I am unable to subscribe to the doctrine of their infallibility in every detail. And who shall say what is really ancient? Are all the hundered and eight Upanishads of equal sanctity? It seems to me that we must test on the anvil of reason everything that is capable of being tested by it and reject that which does not satisfy it even though it may appear in an ancient garb.

 218. ‘IN SEARCH OF KNOWLEDGE’
Thus writes Sjt. S. D. Nadkarni :
 In October 1921, to a correspondent asking the question, “Is your ‘soul-force’ attainable by the masses?”, you replied : “They have it already in abundance. Once upon a time an expediton of French scientists set out in search of knowledge and in due course reached India. They tried hard to find it,  as they had expected, among the learned ones, but failed. Unexpectedly they found it in a parish home” (Young India, 27-10-1927, p. 342).libtech_318_footnote
 I had then thought in my innocence that you were referring to some real incident you had read of; and so being as curious as the French expedition itself, I approached you for details. You kindly answered my query personally, saying that you thought the article made it sufficiently clear that it was a purely imaginary account.
 Thereafter in 1925, at a meeting with the Christian missionaries in Calcutta you said: “I am not able to say that here in this fair land ...libtech_319_footnoteman is vile. He is not vile. He is as much a seeker after truth as you and I are, possibly more so. This reminds me of a French book translated for me by a French friend. It is an account of an imaginary expedition in search of knowledge. One party landed in India and found Truth and God personified in a little pariah’s hut” (Young India, 6-8-1925, p. 274).libtech_320_footnote
 Now, if you are not going to deal with the topic in the further reminiscences of your life, I should be obliged if you could tell us through Young India (or communicate to me personally) the names of the book and its author,  and  say   who   translated  it   for   you,   and  when   and  where.   Is  the
 translation published and available? I wish to ascertain whether the book is one of the two referred to in Yule and Burnell’s  Hobon-Jobson  (s. v.  pariah) as
 
 “Bernardin de St. Pierre’s preposterous though once popular tale,  La Chaumiere Indienne (i.e., ‘The Indian Cottage’), whence too the misplaced halo of sentiment which reached its acme in the drama of Casimir Delavigne, and which still in some degree adheres to the name (‘pariah’)”. (There is no question , of course, of my agreeing with the English crities’ judgment of the French authors).
I wish I could give Mr. Nadkarni the full information he wants. I
 forget the name of the story. The book was specially translated for me by an Anglo-French friend when he was staying with me at Tolstoy Farm near Johannesburg about 1910. I had intended to pubnlish it but my treasure of books has suffered the same fate as my other treasures. I lost many valuable books and manuscripts during transit in 1915 and this precious translation was among them. But some of my readers will probably give the information Mr. Nadkarni desires. I have a recollection that the gifted author of the book makes his otherwise admirable story end in a girl of the pariah home marrying a Charistian, as if the home where his scientists found knowledge was not complete without a love affair and without a marriage that must tear the girl away from her surroundings and make her less useful for the service of her neighbours.

  INTERVIEW TO “THE BOMBAY CHRONICLE” 
 BOMBAY,
 March 24, 1927
 QUESTION: Comrade Saklatvala has asked you to be the leader of Trade Union movement in India. What is your answer to that call?
 ANSWER : I do not consider that I am qualified for leadership.
 But Mr. Saklatvala says that you are the best qualified man for the work.
 It flatters my pride but it does not convince me.
 How do you say that the Government is weakened by your Bardoli decision?libtech_321_footnote
 Had I continued the campaign, Bardoli people would have been done, and our cause would have suffered. There would have been much more tension than there is today. The fact is that the people were not prepared for non-violence and the campaign would have ended in a widespread terrorism. The Government know that Non-co-
 
 
 operation is not dead. They dread nothing so much as non-co- operation. They know how to deal with a violent outbreak but they don’t know how to deal with non-violence and non-co-operation. The Bardoli decision was an orderly and deliberate withdrawal, not a panicky rout. The weakening of Government prestige that had taken place at the time of the so-called ultimatum, still continues. It is open to us to undertake a forward movement at any time we choose. The awe of the Government is gone for ever.
 The general consensus of opinion is that your reply to Comrade Saklatvala ought to have been a little more detailed. Do you propose giving him any more reply?
 In my opinion I have given a sufficient reply. I could not treat each and every subject in detail. If there is any obscurity about my reply I should be prepared to remove it.
 You have said in your reply that you have your own independent ways of organizing labour. Can you explain that viewpoint a little further?
 Yes, I should organize labour by efforts from within. It is not so much discontent with capital that I want to inculcate as discontent with themselves. I want real co-operation between labour and capital. I shall convince the labourers that in many things they are to blame themselves instead of blaming the capitalists. As in the political so in the labour movement, I rely upon internal reform, i.e., self-purifica- tion. Such reform will command equitable treatment from employers. Throughout my experience both in South Africa and India, I have always laid the greatest stress on the principle that labourers must evolve strength from within. Then capital will become a real servant of labour. I seek to achieve co-operation between capital and labour, in the same way as I seek to bring co-operation between India and England .
 Regarding the Muslim proposal for joint electorate, Mahatma Gandhi said that the joint electorate was a happy sign and augured well. He was not willing to hazard any detailed opinion before considering the question in all its aspects. He said the proposed All-India Convention should finally settle the matter.
 [Q:] Do you intend visiting any foreign country in the near future?
[A:] I have no such intention at the present moment.
 But what about China?
 I cannot say anything definitely just yet, but I know I am not visiting China this year.
 Did the khaddar message impress the pilgrims and sadhus at Hardwar?
 It is very difficult to say. In fact, Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviyaji had been trying his best to enlist the sympathy of those pilgrims and sadhus for khaddar propaganda. He is more in tough with them than I am. He is staying at Hardwar for 10 days during the mela and he will be doing all he can to interest the sadhus in the khaddar movement.
 Would you arrange more conferences with them to secure their services for khaddar and prohibition work and also for the removal of untouchability?
 Of course, the sadhus can do a lot in all those things but at present I have no idea whether I shall arrange any special conferences with them. Pandit Malaviyaji has taken the initiative in the matter and he will exercise greater influence on them than I can.
 What specific methods of propaganda would you suggest to hasten prohibition in India? What do you think of renewing peaceful picketing with proper safeguards?
 If picketing with proper safeguards is possible I shall welcome it at any moment but I do not know whether it can be renewed at pre- sent. Picketing requires an atmosphere of peacefulness but the ques- tion is whether that kind of atmosphere really exists in the country. I am personally ready to start picketing the moment I acquire confidence in a peaceful atmosphere, which I don’t possess at present.

  SPEECH AT SARVAJANIK JIVADAYA KHATAlibtech_322_footnotelibtech_323_footnote, GHATKOPAR 
 March 24, 1927
 Accompanied by Sir Chunilal Metha, the Finance Member to the Government of Bombay, and Mr. Vallabhbhai Patel of Ahmedabad, Gandhiji paid a visit to the Sarvajanik Jivadaya Khata at Ghatkopar on Thursday morning. After Gandhiji was
 shown round the stables of the institution and the cattle,	the Secretary of the
 institution . . . accorded a sincere welcome. . . .
 [Replying,] . . . Gandhiji expressed his immense pleasure and congratulated the Committee for the Jivadaya Khata. Since he undertook  the cow-protection  work at  Belgaum  in 1925, he  had  longed  to  pay  a  visit to the institution, but he had not been able to do  so  because  of  his  preoccupations. His  tour  in  1925 had  given him many opportunities to study the subject of the protection of milch
 
 cattle in India and he had come to the conclusion that slaughter of milch cattle could not be effectively prevented unless those who wanted to do so took to hide industry. The question of industry was very important in view of the fact that hides worth about nine crores were exported from India every year. It was not a sin even for Hindus to trade in hides and Gandhiji hoped to find a tannery in the Sarvajanik Jivadaya Khata when he visited it next. Concluding, Gandhiji advised the Committee of the  institution to give up breeding buffaloes and concentrate all their resources on breeding cows.
 Mahatmaji said that if he were Governor of Bombay he would have those stables removed to a distance of 20 miles and given not 10 but thousands of acres of land with ample grass meadows. He argued the establishment of a leather factory attached to the association stables in order to run an institution on economic lines. The association should also link itself to agricultural institutions so that the manure might be utilized most profitably.libtech_324_footnote

  INTERVIEW TO A.P.I. ON MAHARASHTRA TOUR 
 POONA libtech_325_footnote,
 March 24, 1927 I never shared the fears of some of my friends that Maharashtra would   receive  the   message   of  charkha-spinning  coldly.  So   far as
 collections were concerned, they went beyond my expectations as my estimates were only one lakh, while total collections came to Rs. 1,20,000 excluding khadi sales which were quite as good as in Bihar.

  SPEECH AT BOYS’ MEETING, KOLHAPURlibtech_326_footnote 
 March 25, 1927
 The little boys of the school had all been waiting in the sun with the hand- some purse they had collected and they had the lesson of fearlessness from Gandhiji’s lips:
 Fearlessness is the foundation of all education, the beginning and not the end. If you do not build on that foundation, the edifice of all your education will topple over.
 And to send the lesson home to them he told them the story of Prahlada and exhorted them to declare the truth courteously and bravely without regard for the consequences as the twelve-year-old Prahlada did.

  SPEECH TO CHRISTIANS, KOLHAPURlibtech_327_footnote 
 March 25, 1927 At Negala, Mahatmaji was given a cordial welcome by the Christian community. The Principal of the Girls’ Christian High School in his welcome address
 assured  Mahatmaji  that  the   Christian  community  was   one   with   him   in  all   his
 activities. In his reply, Mahatmaji said:libtech_328_footnote
 My experience tells me that the Kingdom of God is within us, and that we can realize it not by saying “Lord, Lord,” but by doing His will and His work. If therefore we wait for the Kingdom to come as something coming from outside, we shall be sadly mistaken. I am glad you are with me in my programme. I may assure you then that whatever I do is done with the object of that realization. Untouch- ability, you say, you would like to see removed as much as I. Well, then, I may tell you that you cannot remove untouchability without whole-heartedly taking up khadi work, for that work includes removal of untouchability, and goes beyond it. Do you know that there are thousands of villages where people are starving and which are on the brink of ruin? If we would listen to the voice of God, I assure you we would hear Him say that we are taking His name in vain if we do not think of the poor and help them. Mr. Sam Higginbottom, a Christian missionary friend, came to see me the other day to discuss this very thing. Fortunately he met me just in that area where the spinning- wheel and khadi had done their work. I ask you to go and visit such parts, and if you cannot do so, to take my word for it, that there is no better subsidiary occupation for the poor than khadi. If you cannot render the little help that they need, it is no use talking of service of God and service of the poor. Please go to the   exhibitionlibtech_329_footnoteand  see things for yourselves, and try to identify yourselves with the poor by actually helping them.

  SPEECH AT KOLHAPURlibtech_330_footnote 
 March 25, 1927
 The Diwan saw him during the day, and he had a long talk with him. Gandhiji asked him if there was anything like a ban on khadi in Kolhapur State. There may have been something like it, he said, but there was nothing now.
 Have I your permission then to say to the people at the public meeting in your name that people may go to the palace and all State offices and attend functions dressed in khadi?
 The Diwan had no objection, and Gandhiji declared the thing at the public meeting and thanked him for the assurance. He said:
Do not have any illusion about khadi. It is not that khadi invests
 the wearer with any sort of saintliness. It is the duty of everyone who has the good of the poor at heart to wear it. Even an adulterer and a prostitute may wear it. This is how I would approach them. ‘As to our conduct,’ I would say to them, ‘you are answerable to God. But whe- ther you are able to mend your ways or no, you can certainly wear khadi and do some service to the poor. He who wastes money on liquor is a sinner. He who wastes money on tobacco is a smaller sinner, if you will. The one who wastes money on foreign cloth is as great a sinner as the second if not the first, and the one who uses Indian mill cloth has neither virtue nor vice to his credit or debit. But the khadi- wearer has distinctly something to his credit inasmuch as he serves both the poor and his country. Khadi immediately takes him up from a lower level and makes him the friend of the poor.’

  DISCUSSION WITH DR. WANLESSlibtech_332_footnote 
 [March 26, 1927]libtech_333_footnote
 That is an instance where the doctors fortunately succeeded in prevailing upon Gandhiji. There have been instances in which they have failed. For Gandhiji, who in many respects is an ideal patient, as many doctors have certified, also at times becomes the despair of his doctors. The doctor immediately after the collapse prescribed undis- turbed bodily rest, including cessation from spinning.libtech_334_footnote
 Well, then, take my blood-pressure, before spinning and after spinning, and if you can convince me that after spinning it hasgone up to an alarming extent, I shall accept your advice. On the contrary, I assure you spinning is a positive relaxation, it soothes the nerves. And then, doctor, you must know that mine is a code of life far different from yours. For instance, you would prescribe all sorts of medicines. Now I have laid down a course of life, which, in certain respects, I may not change. So if you give me a medicine which is composed of five ingredients I would take it, provided you agree to my forgoing my meal which may under no circumstances exceed five articles a day. So you must either convince me that the medicine is more essential for my health than the diet, or must reconcile yourself to administering no medicine. Then there is another thing. Spinning is a thing l cannot live without. If I must eat and live I must spin. And what a glorious death it would be if you came and found me spinning and collapsing in the midst of it. You would abuse those about me to your heart’s content, if you insisted on your discipline as a doctor, but if you are
 
 good you will say it has been a welcome death. You must know that I would be conscience-stricken and make myself most miserable if I continued to live on and was not able to spin. Yes, I may stop reading, writing and even spinning, provided I stop feeding too. Will  you permit me that?
 No, doctor, I may not implicitly obey you, unless you can claim infallibility.
 “If we could claim it,” rejoined the doctor with justice, “we should not be administering drugs, but be oracles sitting in temples.”
 No wonder Dr. Wanless frankly said that no treatment was necessary excepting rest for an indefinite period.

 DEAR SATIS BABU,
 Well, it is not much use inquiring about you now that I am myself in the mire. I am trying to pull myself out. But if God wills otherwise what is my trial worth? Anyway I do not expect to go beyond 13th April, 1928. I have nothing new to say or give. I may collect more, give a little more guidance and patch here and patch there. But really the clock has struck for me. To reduce the message to execution is left for you. You have therefore to live and work. If I survive I shall not be of much use for active work evidently. Let us see: “Thy will be done, not ours, oh Lord!” What is the use then even of peeping into the future? Just for the moment I appear to be as fit as  a fiddle. And so I amuse myself by sending love messages to friends I can think of and have no time to talk to.
My love to you and Hemaprabha Devi.

  	I have been waiting for your letter. I know you have been 	deliberately refraining from writing. But now there is no need for 	it. How far have you progressed in Sanskrit? And would you now be 	ranked first in carding and spinning? No 	news from Karachi. How is your health? I 	am improving every day. There is no cause for anxiety.  Blessings 	from  BAPU [From 	Gujarati]  Bapuna 	Patro—Manibehn Patelne, 	pp. 54-5     NATIONAL WEEK AND GUJARAT   	I hope that Gujaratis will heartily respond to the appeal made by 	Shri Vallabhbhai Patel on behalf of the Gujarat Provincial Congress 	Committee in connection with the National Week. One can say that 	collecting a sum of Rs. 1 lakh is child’s play for Gujarat. This 	amo- unt, moreover, is required for work among the suppressed 	classes, which include Antyajas and the Raniparaj community. 	From now on, we will describe Antyajas too as dalit. The 	term was first used by Swami Shraddhanand. Swami Vivekananda chose 	an English word having the same meaning. He described the 	untouchables not as “depressed”libtech_338_footnotelibtech_339_footnotebut 	as “suppressed”libtech_340_footnotelibtech_341_footnoteand quite rightly. They became, and remain, what they 	are because they were suppressed by the so-called upper classes. The 	Hindi word for this is dalit. Among all the suppressed 	classes, the untouchables are the most suppressed. The Rani (Kali) 	paraj community is also suppressed, and so are other communities, 	like Oghra, etc.. It is the object of the Provincial Com- mittee to 	serve all these communities to the best of its resources. This      
 is constructive work which will win swaraj; it is a philanthropic activity and is a part of dharma. I hope, therefore, that everyone will enthu- siastically respond to this appeal and the sum of one lakh will be collected in no time, and also that honest people will come forward and enroll themselves immediately as volunteers for this work.

  CONDITIONS OF COW-PROTECTIONlibtech_344_footnote 
 It has been a matter of sorrow for me to have taken up the burden of cow-protection during the ending years of my life. But there need be no sorrow when burdens come not of one’s seeking but when they seek one irresistibly. And so has been for me the case with cow-protection.
 Recently at Ghatkopar, Bombay, I had the occasion to visit the institutionlibtech_345_footnoteof the humanitarian society ably managed by its secretary Sjt. Nagindas. It is now conducting an experiment in dairying with the laudable object ultimately of replacing the illmanaged and disease- breeding private dairies of Bombay which are situated in the heart of the city and where there is no exercise ground for the cattle, and where the best cattle are prematurely given to the butcher’s knife.
 
 But though the institution is ably managed, it has some inherent defects to which upon its invitation I had to draw the Society’s atten- tion. Incidentally I ventured to lay down the conditions of cow-pro- tection which are well worth repeating:
  Every 	such institution 	should be 	situated out 	in the 	open where 	it is possible 	to have 	plenty, i.e., thousands 	of acres, 	of open 	ground capable of 	growing fodder and 	giving exercise to 	the cattle. 	If I 	had the management 	of all 	the goshalas, I 	should sell the 	majority of 	the present 	ones at 	handsome profits and 	buy suitable plots in 	the vicinity 	except where the 	existing places 	may be 	needed for 	mere receiving depots.  Every 	goshala should be turned 	into a 	model dairy and 	a model 	tannery. Every single head 	of dead 	cattle should be 	retained and 	scientifically treated 	and the hide, 	bones, entrails, etc., should be 	used to the 	best advantage. 	I should 	regard the hide 	of dead 	cattle to be 	sacred and 	usable as 	distinguished from 	the hide and other parts 	of slaughtered 	cattle, which should be 	deemed to 	be unfit for 	human use 	or at least 	for Hindu use.  Urine 	and dung in many 	goshalas are 	thrown away. 	This I regard as 	criminal waste.  All 	goshalas should 	he managed 	under scientific 	supervision and guidance.  Properly 	managed every goshala 	should be 	and can 	be made self-supporting, 	donations being used for 	its extension. The 	idea is 	never to 	make these 	institutions profit-making concerns, all 	profits being 	utilized towards buying maimed and 	disabled cattle and 	buying in 	the open market 	all cattle destined for 	the slaughterhouse.  This 	consummation is 	impossible if the goshalas 	take in buffaloes, 	goats, etc. So 	far as 	I can 	see, much as I 	would like 	it to be 	otherwise. not 	until the 	whole of 	India becomes 	vegetarian, can goats 	and sheep be 	saved from the butcher’s 	knife. Buffaloes can be 	saved if 	we will not insist 	upon buffalo’s 	milk and religiously 	avoid it 	in preference 	to cow’s 	milk. In Bombay 	on the 	other hand, the 	practice is to take 	bufffalo’s milk 	instead of 	cow’s milk. Physicians 	unani- mously 	declare that cow’s 	milk is 	medically superior 	to buffalo’s 	milk and 	it is the 	opinion of 	dairy experts 	that cow’s milk can 	by judicious 	management be 	made much 	richer than it 	is  at  present  found 	to be. 	I hold 	that it is impossible 	to save 	both the buffalo 	and the cow. The cow can be saved only if buffalo-breeding is given up. 
 
 The buffalo cannot be used for agricultural purposes on a wide scale. It is just possible to save the existing stock, if we will cease to breed it any further. It is no part of religion to breed buffaloes or for that matter cows. We breed for our own uses. It is cruelty to the cow as well as to the buffalo to breed the latter. Humanitarians should know that Hindu shepherds even at the present moment mercilessly kill young male buffaloes as they cannot profitably feed them. To save the cow and her progeny—and that only is a feasible proposition—the Hindus will forgo profits from the trade concerning the cow and her products, but never otherwise. Religion to be true must satisfy what may be termed humanitarian economics, i.e., where the income and the expenditure balance each other. The attainment of such economies is just possible with the cow and the cow only with the assistance of donations for some years from pious Hindus. It should be remembered that this great humanitarian attempt is being made in the face of a beef-eating world. Not till the whole world turns predomi- nantly vegetarian is it possible to make any advance upon the limita- tions I have sought to describe. To succeed to that extent is to open the way, for future generations, to further efforts. To overstep the limitation is to consign the cow for ever to the slaughter-house in addition to the buffalo and the other animals.
 Hindus and the humanitarian societies in charge of goshalas and pinjrapoles, if they are wisely religious, will bear the foregoing condi- tions of cow-protection in mind and proceed immediately to give effect to them.

MY DEAR SATIS BABU,
 I know you are thinking of me. To say “don’t” would be cruel. But to say “pray” would be just. Ill or well, living or dying, should not matter to you or to me. Anxiety would not add  one moment to my allotted time. Nothing is yet fixed as to what I am to do next. I am allowing myself to be guided by the doctors as much as is possible for me to do.
 “Take no thought for the morrow” is a beautiful saying recorded of Jesus.  libtech_346_footnotehas a powerful appeal for me at the present moment. The underlying thought is the same in both the sayings.
 Yours sincerely,

 It is good that you gave up your vow of taking salt-free food. Sharadabehn says she would do four hours’ spinning and carding, and whatever sewing there may be as also help in the kitchen as much as she can. Now let me know how much she has been able to carry out.
 If I can hold on till June I want to come over for the Parishad I can do so even earlier.
 Kaka must have himself read to you my letter to him. I have letters in this connection from Kaka and the other  teachers.  Kaka  has withdrawn his  attack  on  hearing  of my indisposition.  I  wish you would all take decisions on merits. You should attach no impo- rtance to my illness. You will not find it in my writing. Today it is just an illness, tomorrow there may be death. Why think about it? Or let us make our decisions after reckoning on the inevitability of death. So that it is no special factor to be considered.

    LETTER TO ASHRAM WOMEN       NIPANI, 
  Silence 	Day [March 	28, 1927]  DEAR 	SISTERS,  	Do not worry if I tell you that I have been ill. Today it is only a 	small illness. In a few years life itself will pass away. But what 	does it matter? The Gita clearly teaches us and we too see 	daily ourselves that those who are born die and those who die are 	born again. Everyone repays his debt more or less and passes away.  	I don’t say this lightly, but quite seriously. If it were not for 	human passion there will be no disease. A person who has no passion 	has also to die. But he drops gently down like a ripe fruit. I hope 	and pray that I should drop like that. I ever have this hope and 	wish. But who knows? Passions I still have and they play their part. 	The state of complete freedom from passion can be realized only 	through perso- nal experience.  	Devote yourselves entirely to your duties. Youth is given to us to 	conquer passions. We should not allow it to pass away fruitless. 	Safeguard your purity. Do not give up the spinning-wheel. As far as 	possible do not leave the Ashram either.

  	Don’t waste a thought on my illness. We take no note of the years 	passing by. Now, like advancing age, is not disease too written into 	men’s destiny, prone as they are to passion? Some pass away in the 	natural course; but go all of us must. Where then is the sense in 	lamenting over it?

 Here is one sick person asking another why the latter has fallen ill. Now never mind if you have fallen ill. I hope you are cheerful as ever; or are you not?

So never lose spirit, though ill, and always remember Rama.

   LETTER TO ASHRAM CHILDREN  
 March 28, 1927
 BOYS AND GIRLS,
 You are all students of the Gita, and this study should always weigh with you. If therefore you are alarmed at the news of my illness you should look to the Gita for assuagement. I am stuck after I finished translating the second chapter. I am therefore dwelling with delight on that chapter. You too should do  the  same—the  body cannot escape due chastisement. What is there to lament over life and death? Those who die are to be born again and those who live are destined to die. Why then be glad about life and lament over death? Yes, there is one thing to remember. Having known this we should discover our duty and then stick to it till the end. You for your part have found out your goal in life, by reasoning perhaps or through faith. Now beware of slipping. You will then continue to play as usual without being affected by news of my collapse, not to speak of just being laid up. If anyone talks of my total collapse you should prove it to be incon-sequential by carrying on your task. May I expect this from you?

    LETTER TO AMRITLAL V. THAKKAR        AMBOLI, 
    HIGH 	PRIEST OF THE LOWLY,  Friday, 	April 1, 1927 
  	My health has tied me down to the bed; yesterday therefore I could 	go through your [draft] speech from one end to the other. A person 	like me could learn a little from it but it is my humble opinion 	that as a presidential address it will not do. I do not write this 	in exercise of any right of “veto” that you have conferred on 	me. I am only arguing with you as a friend.  	The speech gives no evidence of a sense of proportion. We seem to 	have lost it. Another reason is that it violates the implicit under- 	standing with the Rana Saheb. A third reason is that the speech does 	not suit the kind of audience we are going to muster.  	I say there is no sense of proportion because this speech does not 	take into account the past convention. There is a breach of our 	implicit understanding with the Rana Saheb that there should be no 	personal criticism, etc. And the speech will be neither appreciated 	nor read by the sections whom we are at the moment trying to rouse. 	If you follow Gulliver’s Travels and conceive an imaginary 	country in which to apply your correctives, you could say all that 	you have said; or if you emulate Aesop you could have a bird of your 	choice 
 perched on every tree in Saurashtra to expound your  doctrines through their chatter. And then you could have instructed us while you amused us. Or like Vyasa you may create sub-human and super- human characters, reject the past, compile a history of mankind and then give us a miniature Mahabharata of Saurashtra.
 We needs must train a new class of audience for the speech that you have drafted or that has been drafted for you. Our first task therefore will be to annul the constitution adopted at Bhavnagar. I may perhaps agree to this. And then we should call a conference of such select people as would be competent to appreciate and also act upon the thoughts contained in your speech. We should place before them your suggestions and have them implemented.
 I would therefore make the following suggestions: You should call a small committee and place your ideas before them. You may then lay the foundation of your speech as was the practice followed by the Congress in the past. Speeches by  Wedderburn,  Webb, Bradlaugh and others used to be placed before Pherozeshah, Gokhale and others for approval. In this way a tradition was maintained. This state of affairs, I know, came down to the times of Sinha. Your speech belongs to that tradition. I do not suggest that it is of no use; we want  a new society to make use of it. You cannot address such speeches to peasants.
 Whatever happens to me the Conference must be held in June. I suggest that at the same time we should decide upon the constitution of the Conference and first put our own house in order. And then start immediately a new era by convening the newly constituted Con- ference. But I cannot explain all this in a letter. I think there is no sense in discussing individual points when I am recommending a radical revision of your draft.
 Though of course I write this, at the moment I am so weak I cannot invite any one of you to come here soon. You should there- fore confer with Devchandbhai, Fulchand and Amritlal and do whatever you have to. I would also invite Patwari, Pattani Saheb and Shukla Saheb to this meeting. I would acquaint myself with every- one’s opinion and do what appears good for us. But then that is how I think. If you go ahead you should also obtain Vallabhbhai’s advice. Whatever you do let it be based on solid foundations.
Wishing success in all your noble efforts,
 BAPU

   DISCUSSION WITH DR. JIVARAJ MEHTAlibtech_364_footnote  
 April 3, 1927libtech_365_footnote
 GANDHIJI: How long may I accept the hospitality of a Chieflibtech_366_footnotewho has been kindness itself ? And apart from the climate, I can be as restful at Sabarmati as at any other place. It is not the heat that matters, though I am confident of dodging even that heat by various devices. And if we are to identify ourselves with the poor, surely we should understand that a vast mass of our people live and work and toil in excessive heat of the sun, and never think of going for a change when an illness overtakes them.
 The argument is unanswerable though the doctor who concerns himself mainly with physiological considerations may brush it aside. But Gandhiji has had always the good fortune of having as his friends doctors who, at least so far as he is concerned, are prepared to consult not merely the needs of his body, but the needs of his soul, and try to suit their advice as regards keeping of the body to his mental and spiritual predilections.
GANDHIJI: If then I am merely to vegetate, I must be content to
recuperate in my own place.
 DR. MEHTA: But you will not vegetate. Your rest is work itself, for it will set you up and make the body stand another spell of strain.
But that rest I can have at Sabarmati.
 Yes, you may have it, and yet the heat might affect the blood-pressure, and retard recovery.
 
 If you can find me some sort of work at the hill-station you propose, or if there is near prospect of my taking up the thread of my interrupted programme, I might reconcile myself to Bangalore  or some such place.
 Work is there enough for you and always. I am not going to cut you off from your normal activity. The strain you were putting yourself to was abnormal. As soon as you begin to feel better people may see you, offer the purses they may have collected, workers may present you reports of work, and receive suggestions and advice from you. All I want you to do is to continue to direct, without taking any actual share in the work yourself. You do as much light reading as possible, and write your autobiography but not attend to piles of correspondence.
 I am glad. But what is light reading? Reading that does not tax me, isn’t it?

 Twelve hours’ is all right, I shall also contribute my hour. But you must go to Savantwadi and hawk khadi there during the week, you must try to go to the untouchables’ quarters, inquire about their welfare, see if they have schools, wells, etc. Even when Devdas and you go to Savantwadi, I shall see that the wheel is kept turning.

 Dr. Mehta came all the way from Bombay to examine the body. He is emphatically of opinion that all touring should be given up for some months to come. He does not forbid reading in the bed or even occasional letters to friends. If I take full rest he thinks that I would regain most of the lost strength but never be strong enough to undertake the exacting tours such as the one that came to an abrupt end on the 25th ultimo. We shall see. If the tour is finally cancelled, I must take my rest at the Ashram. I shall come to a decision today or tomorrow. The probability is that it will be cancelled. Even so I shall not move out before Tuesday next week.

I like your co-operation with the teachers, but only if  it  is 	sincere and spontaneous. If it has come about owing to my illness 	there will again be some snags. I yearn for such involuntary 	co-ordi- nation as there is between one eye and the other. This is 	possible only if we look upon all people as our own. Experience 	tells us that a team of good men is better than a mere 	conglomeration of good results. Disinterested action consists in the 	faith that everything will ultimately lead to good results.  	Did you do anything about penetrating the villages?  Take immediate 	action with regard to the water problem.     
 How is the dairy working? Examine coolly Bhai Purushottam’s arguments against the Ramachandra lift, before you dispose of them.
I shall be there soon.

 CHILDREN,
 Look here, make the Satyagraha Weeklibtech_372_footnotea success. Those who cannot be interested in the Gita, those who have no ear for the music of the spinning-wheel, do not at all understand life. Since we ourselves are the fountains of delight, we should know how to derive it from tunes which would bring us felicity. Therein lies real art. It is servile to seek delight from without; true happiness lies in evoking delight from within. If we cannot impart this knowledge to you now, all of us would be adjudged not as teachers but as mere barbers. How can anyone call you unworthy disciples?
 I am fine. [From Gujarati]

   LETTER TO S. D. SATAVALEKAR  
 AMBOLI,  SAVANTWADI STATE,
 April 6, 1927
 BHAI SATAVALEKAR,
 I am confined to a sick-bed. I could therefore easily get the time to read your book on brahmacharya. I liked the book. For years I have regarded you as a devotee of truth; hence this letter.
 Do 	you regard 	the asanas [postures] 	as an infallible 	means 
 to brahmacharya?
  If 	this is 	true does it 	not mean 	that a man 	who practises asanas 	retains his 	vital fluid under all 	circumstances? Does it 	also mean that such an 	aspirant becomes free 	from passion 	? You are perhaps 	aware of a 	certain process in 	Western medicine 	by which 	a man 	can retain the 	fluid but 	is not 	freed from 	passion. This 	method is 	followed by those 	who propose to 	enjoy sex without 	losing the fluid. 	Do our 	systems mean 	this thing 	when they 	speak of becoming 	urdhvareta? If 	it were so, the state of 	the urdhvareta 	would be detrimental 	to pure 	brahmacharya. And 	then there would be 	a lurking danger 	of harm 	in retaining 	semen with the 	help of 	the asanas. 	A friend 	from Delhi 	writes to me saying 	that with the help of 	asanas he 	has attained 	brahmacharya to 	such an 	extent that 	he can 	take any 	kind or 	quantity of 	food and enjoy 	almost all pleasures 	without losing his 	vital fluid. I 	did not continue 	further correspondence with him 	as I was 	not impressed by 	his letter. 	Another friend writes to 	say that 	with the  help  of 	 pranayamalibtech_378_footnotelibtech_379_footnote,  asanas  and  the  like  the  final  stage  of 	brahmacharya can 	be attained within six 	months. Him 	I know. He 	is a simple 	straightforward man 	with no 	guile. And 	he goes 	on insisting 	that I 	should practise asanas 	and the like. 	I have 	not yet acted 	on his 	advice but 	your book has 	moved me. 	I came 	in contact 	with many 	students and 	I cannot satisfy them 	all by my own 	experiments. Besides 	restrictions of 	diet, etc., all 	my experiments are 	purely psychological. I 	write this as 	it appears to 	me that a 	section of 	the student 	community has fallen 	so low that 	asanas and 	the like can [alone] be 	of any help 	to them. 
 
 
  Do 	you have 	personal experience of 	what you 	write about 	brahmacharya 	 in  plants,libtech_380_footnotelibtech_381_footnoteetc.?  You 	 would 	 be  aware  that  Western 	scholars of 	natural sciences 	nowadays write against brahmacharya. 	I have 	refuted their arguments with the 	help of 	my little experience and 	by the 	exercise of 	whatever talents I 	have. But 	it is essential 	that these Western 	treatises are examined 	by our 	own experts since they 	greatly influence our 	young men.  I 	have also gone through your book Suryabhedan Vyayam. 	Do you 	think there is 	no harm if 	a man 	like me 	takes that 	exercise merely with the 	aid of the book?  Am 	I right if 	I find a 	slight difference 	between  your 	 method and 	the rules laid down in 	the commentaries 	on the 	Rigveda and 	the other texts for 	interpreting the hymns? 
I shall be in Amboli till the 18th of this month.
 Yours,

    261. LETTER TO FULCHAND K. SHAH  AMBOLI 	[via] BELGAUM,  Satyagraha 	Day [April 	6, 1927]  BHAISHRI 	FULCHAND, I 	have written to you but have had no reply.  	Please see that my capacity to raise funds has gone down 	considerably owing to my failing health. I had made some provision 	but it is not available at the moment.  	Had I not had the attack I could have somehow coped with the 	situation.  	I had asked Mahadev to write to Devchandbhai about the speech 	[drafted] by Bhai Amritlal Bapa. It has to be examined carefully. I 	think the [Kathiawar] Political Conference and the charkha movement 	should be kept apart. Let it be like this. There are three heads of 	expenditure which can be arranged as follows:    
  Entrusting 	khadi activity to 	the Charkha 	Sangh as it will 	survive me 	and carry on 	in whatever manner it can.  The 	schools and 	the Antyaja work 	be handed 	over to 	the Vidyapith 	which too will survive me. 
And an independent activity for Kathiawar.
 We have not yet been able to make separate arrangements to run these three programmes on their own. I can therefore make only these suggestions. Khadi activities can also be entrusted  to  the  Gujarat Khadi Mandal. This can be finalized after we have a discussion with Bhai Lakshmidas. Besides these three, no other programme is, at present, likely to engage my attention. I see however that there ought to be an independent institution for those pursuing other interests and the Political Conference may serve this purpose. But then these are the sick thoughts of a sick man.
 You should contact Devchandbhai and others and find out a way after cool deliberation. If you want to see me you should all come at your own expense; that too a fortnight hence. I think at the moment I have not the strength to discuss the matter at length.
 God willing, I hope to keep the appointed date in the month of June. But I can say nothing definite just now.
 What you do, do unhesitatingly and dispassionately like volu- ntary trustees.

  From 	the Gujarati original: C.W. 8825. Courtesy: Gangabehn Vaidya      WHAT SHALL I DO?    	The Satyagraha Week has come again. By the time this appears in 	print, one day of the precious week will have gone. I would urge the 	reader not to fritter away the week by asking the question, ‘What 	shall we do?’, but to make the best possible use of it by 	asking, ‘What shall I do?’ There was a time when we could 	usefully ask and did ask the other question. And if each one will do 	his or her duty to the fullest measure possible, we shall soon be 	able to ask, ‘What shall we do next?’  	The foundation of satyagraha as of nation-building is undou- btedly 	self-purification, self-dedication, selflessness. Let each one ask 	oneself: ‘How then can I purify myself in terms of the nation?’ 	Rectitude of private character is surely the beginning of the 	structure. If my private character is foul, I am like “a sounding 	brass and tinkling cymbal”. If then I am not right inside, I must 	this very instant purge myself and be a fit vessel for dedication. 	Government cannot    
 help me or interfere with me here. I must be the sole author of my making or unmaking.
 Having ensured a pure personal character I must ask the next question, what shall I do as a national servant? If a Hindu, I hate the Mussalman or a person of another faith, I must at once make an honourable peace with him. If I regard any single person as an untouchable, I must blot the sin from my heart and hug the one whom  I have hitherto in my arrogance or ignorance regarded as untouchable and as a token I must render him some personal service, be it only going to his quarters and calling the children together and playing with them. In these things again, I need no support from the Government and yet in doing these things whole-heartedly I have surely brought swaraj nearer for the effort and rendered myself fitter for joint service whenever the occasion arises.
 Is there a drink shop near me? I must try to wean an erring brother from going to the house of his own destruction. We began this work gloriously in 1921. Our violence brought it to an inglorious end. Individual effort in this matter is still possible even though the atmosphere for wholesale mass action is for the moment wanting.
 And last but not least, I must do my share of spinning, if I have but faith in its capacity to serve the poorest, so graphically described in Markham’s words reproducedlibtech_387_footnotelibtech_388_footnotein last week’s  Young India.  I must hawk Khadi. If I have the power, I must induce my neighbour to spin for the sake of Daridranarayana and if he or she wears foreign cloth,  I must induce him or her to discard it.
 Shri Vallabhbhai has approached, during this National Week, the Gujaratis living in Kathiawar, Gujarat and in foreign countries for donations for the benefit of the suppressed classes in Gujarat. His appeal is for one lakh of rupees to support the activities being carried on at present for the uplift of the depressed classes in Gujarat. I would like to enrol myself as Vallabhbhai’s volunteer and move from house to house, begging bowl in hand, to plead with my dear friends to fill it, and also persuade them to enrol themselves as volunteers for the collection, and persuade also school-going girls and young women to do likewise, with the permission of their parents, and help in swelling the contents of Vallabhbhai’s purse.libtech_389_footnote
 
 This is by no means an exhaustive list. I have simply given an indication of the enormous possibilities of individual effort. Let each one find out for himself or herself the best way of service during this week of privilege. The seeker will be amazed to discover in the search after individual action, the immense possibilities of silent, sustained and fruitful common action. Let not the immensity of a common programme daze or paralyse us. What is true of the individual will be tomorrow true of the whole nation if individuals will but refuse to lose heart and hope.

  	You must have seen my letterlibtech_395_footnoteto Amritlal Bapa. I want you to look into it. After 	all, his speech has been drafted by you.

And if it is a question of my 	feelings I am all for what suits the atmosphere in Kathiawar and is 	ultimately good for its people. I am for khadi because I see 	advantage in it; but how could it prove beneficial if the climate is 	against it? Oxygen is vital for our breathing but what is it to the 	trees? And you all are the life of Kathiawar. If I cannot convince 	you all about a thing, either I should not do it at all or do it in 	a different way.  	I am aware of your ability. I very much appreciate some of the 	things you do. I count you among those serving the motherland. You 	have courage which you should exercise to encourage others and 	contend with me, if you have to, without hesitation. Do what you 	want to do, not what I want you to. That alone will be the right 	thing. Surely we cannot shine in borrowed feathers.  	At the moment I can take no interest in activities other than khadi 	or similar constructive work. Being thus engaged, if I have any more 	to live, it might some day occur to me to offer battle within the 	limits of satyagraha and if the struggle does not come off in my own 	lifetime it will be taken up by such of my successors as can do it.  	Bloody revolutions just do not appeal to me. I never wish to kill 	even a venomous snake, not to speak of a venomous man. I know the 	world has gone in for bloody revolution too for winning freedom. I 	wish to spend all my life trying to prove its futility. I take 	delight in this only and so I never lose patience. All the ways that 	occur to me are but ways of peace. That for me is the straight and 	therefore the shortest path. You should lend me your support only if 	it appeals to you and to those who look to you for guidance; 	otherwise, it is best to leave me alone as it has been said: “One’s 	own dharma is superior to” libtech_396_footnote, etc. Lying in a sick-bed, I get more time to think 	and therefore I am trying to clarify our views and my own.

 I would suggest that a  serious  student  like  you  should  not draw hasty conclusions. And a pure activity like khadi deserves closer study.
 Visit the Ashram, look around for yourself, speak to Narandas, Maganlal and Shankerlal, see what Lakshmidas has been doing and then come out with your suggestions.

   LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI  
 Friday [April 8, 1927]libtech_399_footnote
 CHI. NARANDAS,
 I have not been writing to you at all, but I keep myself informed all the time about your activities.
 I had preserved one of your letters drawing my attention to the expenditure on khadi work in Gujarat. I intended to discuss it with Lakshmidas and you. But that could not be. Let us see if we can take it up some time. I believe your contention is that in enabling the spinners to earn Rs. 29,000 as wages we have spent more than an equal amount and that this is too much. Does this amount also include the expenditure incurred on our work amongst the Raniparaj community? The answer to this question should be that at this stage the work on khadi includes awakening and educating the masses. If this is really so, it is part of our policy; and so long as this policy is followed sincerely we should bear with it as an experiment. But this is only my view. If you enlighten me on this point I shall discuss it with Lakshmidas in case he meets me sooner or when all three of us meet.
  At 	the present 	moment, at any 	rate, I 	am afraid, 	I have 	no time 	or energy 	to raise 	separate funds for khadi 	work in 	Kathiawar. I, 	therefore, think 	that we 	should entrust it 	to the Charkha 	Sangh and carry 	on such 	work as can 	be done 	subject to its 	rules and 	regulations. In this 	connection I 	have written 	to Bhai 	Fulchand. You 	may also 	think over 	it. Perhaps it 	had better 	be merged 	with  the  work  in 	Gujarat. As 	it is, I only see 	this much, that it 	cannot be 	carried on 	as an independent 	unit. You 	may, if you 	want to, discuss the 	matter with 	Lakshmidas, in 	case he 	is there, and 	with Shankerlal. In 	the meanwhile you 	may look after and 	promote the 	work in 	Kathiawar according to 	facilities available in 	the Ashram 	and keep 	me informed. 	We should 	be careful 	and see that 	whatever work has been 	or is being 	done is not 	undone.  Of 	late you have not been 	publishing in 	Young India facts 	and figures 	[about khadi]. Figures of 	production, at 	any rate, 	ought to appear. 	You should 	also keep sending any 	interesting details 	about the yarn 	you receive from 	the members. 
 
 
 As I have now resumed working gradually, you need not spare me. Do write to me and ask me whatever you want to.
 I had a talk with Chi. Purushottam and we are in corres- pondence. I could not speak to you about this; but the boy seemed to have a pure heart. Surely, God will look after him.
How is Kanu getting on?

           CHI. 	RAMDAS,    LETTER TO RAMDAS GANDHI       BOMBAY,  April 	10, 1927 
  	I received your letter of complaint only today on my arrival in 	Bombay. A detailed letter may never get written because of my 	procrastination, so I write a brief one right away. You still 	continue to regret that you have no formal education. You must get 	over it. In my programme of action it is of least importance. If you 	come, you can be of help in innumerable ways. You can even work on a 	salary if you so wish. I would make use of you in spinning and 	weaving and make you independent. I would also use you for the 	service of the country. But there are many other jobs apart from 	these. There is the work of the press, of the school, of Hindi. Many 	people, big and small, are helping me. I am sure that you too can 	join them. But I wish that you should do only what gives you 	satisfaction. Chi. 	Jamnadas has returned from England.

  	I have your letter. Of course you were quite right in delivering 	your whole soul to me. I quite agree with you that we have to evolve 	an organization and that therefore there should be method about the 	business. But in your affection for me perhaps there is a trace of 	impatience with the people who organized the tours. However, all 	will profit by the warning received. I am taking all the necessary 	rest amid these very lovely surroundings and shall have more when I 	am taken to Mysore. Rest is not to be taken at the Ashram. Dr. Mehta 	insisted on a cool placelibtech_401_footnotebeing selected. And I am to remain where I was to tour 	during April.  	You can see from the handwriting that I am getting stronger day by 	day. I had quite a fair walk yesterday. So much for myself.  	I like this idea of your riding. It should brace you and enable you 	too, to go to the villages and see something of rural life. Have 	they provided you with a proper saddle? You should try to follow all 	the shades of village Hindi. I am not going to be satisfied till you 	have mastered Hindi so well as to be able to follow and speak the 	villagers’ Hindi. Do not be frightened. It will come because of 	your love of your work. I shall not be impatient. But, for your work 	a thorough knowledge of Hindi is a necessity. You will therefore 	seek every occasion for speaking and knowing it. Insist on 	understanding all that goes on about you.  	Here is a letter for you from Noorbanu whom you must recognize, the 	fat, fair lady. She recently gave over to the Ashram several 	thousand rupees worth of her jewellery. She and her husband are just 	now living at Mahabaleshwar. They have just come in to see me. Do 	write to her in reply. Their address is Mahabaleshwar College, 	Mahabaleshwar. Mrs. Noorbanu Pyareali is her full name.  	I am anxious to know how the new wheel is working. Have you good 	wheels there?

 I am glad you met the Commissioner, etc. You are getting your deserts—those of one adopted by a scavenger. You must forget what you have been. You have to realize what you are. These poor officials really do not know where they are when they see you. They cannot forget your antecedents and naturally get perplexed. You have to put them at ease. When the present King—so tradition says-—was enlisted as a sailor he was treated as such and had in common with the rest black coffee and black bread for breakfast. This was the least part of the affair. He was taken for a common sailor. So one day will you be taken for a common village girl. That would be your pride and mine.

  	I have your letter. If you get leave thence do go to Nathji and to 	Wardha. Undoubtedly the study of hygiene is most essential.

He does not seem to have much faith in it. 	Having discussed it with a few people I was led to believe that 	asanas, etc.,      
 were of no avail in curing the sick. I have not personally reached this conclusion. If you want to learn them I would send you to Pandit Satavalekar. There is a swami in Hardwar who also has promised to train an ashramite if one goes to him. I have not met him though Mahadev has. Nowhere have I found the purity that I would expect but then we want to associate only to the extent  of  learning the asanas, etc. Write to Nathji and obtain his opinion.

   FAITH v. 		REASON  
 An M.B.B.S. from Mandalay sends a string of questions of which the first is:
 You once expressed your opinion in the pages of Young India that faith begins where reason ends. Then I expect you will call it faith, if a person believes in a thing for which he can give no reasons. Is it not then clear that faith is believing unreasonably? Do you think it is truth or justice if anybody believed in anything unreasonable? I think it is folly to believc in that way. I do not know what your barrister mind will call it. If you think like me I hope you will call faith as nothing but folly.
If the worthy doctor will excuse my saying so, there is in his
 question a clear failure to understand my meaning. That which is beyond reason is surely not unreasonable. Unreasonable  belief  is blind faith and is often superstition. To ask anybody to believe without proof what is capable of proof would be unreasonable, as for instance asking an intelligent person to believe without proof that the sum of the angles of a triangle is equal to two right angles. But for an experienced person to ask another to believe without being able to prove that there is God is humbly to confess his limitations and to ask another to accept in faith the statement of his experience. It is merely a question of that person’s credibility. In ordinary matters of life we accept in faith the word of persons on whom we choose to  rely although we are often cheated. Why may we not then in matters of life and death accept the testimony of sages all the world over that there is God and that He is to be seen by following Truth and Innocence (non-violence)? It is at least as reasonable for me to ask my correspondent to have that faith in this universal testimony as it would
 
 be for him to ask me to take his medicine in faith even though many a medicine-man might have failed me. I make bold to say that without faith this world would come to naught in a moment. True faith is appropriation of the reasoned experience of people whom we believe to have lived a life purified by prayer and penance. Belief therefore in prophets or incarnations who have lived in remote ages is not an idle superstition but a satisfaction of an inmost, spiritual want. The formula therefore I have humbly suggested for guidance is rejection of every demand for faith where a matter is capable of present proof unquestioned acceptance on faith of that which is itself incapable of proof except through personal experience.
The correspondent’s next question is:libtech_411_footnote
 In Young India of December 9, 1926,libtech_412_footnotethere appeared a press-cutting that one Doctor Harold Blazer, who chloroformed his daughter because he felt that his own end was near and there was no one to care for her when he was gone, was fully acquitted. Dr. Blazer’s counsel, Mr. Howry declared: “Blazer did a right and moral thing by keeping the poor girl [for whom he had cared for thirty-two years] from becoming a charge on others.” To this you expressed your opinion that Dr. Blazer was wrong in taking the life of his daughter because it betrayed want of faith in the humanity of those round him and that there was no warrant for him to suppose that the daughter would not have been cared for by others. I would request you to think over it again,
 for I think this is not an ordinary matter. For it is evident that you have got no scruples to put a useless burden on society simply because you have got enough faith  in the society to shoulder the burden. For God’s sake please excuse us from believing in that useless, nay, extremely harmful, faith. Such a faith of yours, I sincerely believe, is very harmful to the best interests of India.    If after many more years of
 faithful service of India, you become       absolutely useless to society, will you like
 the society to feed you because you have got still life left in you or because you served  so well? . . .
 I do believe that whilst the jury was right in acquitting Dr.  Blazer, considered from the strictly moral point of view Dr. Blazer was wrong. My correspondent in his utilitarian zeal has overlooked the frightful consequences and implications of the doctrine he lays down. Indeed his doctrine would belie his own profession. What would he say if a young practitioner chloroformed to death a patient whom he, the junior practitioner, considered to be incurable and therefore a useless burden to society and whom another as a senior subsequently found to be a case quite capable of cure ? Is it not the boast of
 
 medical science to treat no case as finally incurable? As for myself, well, I do expect my countrymen to support me when I become a useless and burdensome article, assuming of course that I shall still want to live. What is more, I have full faith in my countrymen suppor- ting me if that event comes to pass. I wonder whether my corres- pondent will have all the lepers, the blind, the deaf, one fine night to be chloroformed to sweet, everlasting sleep. And yet Damien was a leper and Milton was a blind poet. Man is not all body but he is something infinitely higher.
The correspondent’s third question is:libtech_413_footnote
 In the same article, i.e., “The Greatest Good of all”, you wrote that a votary of ahimsa cannot subscribe to the utilitarian formula. He will strive for the greatest good of all and die in the attempt to realize the ideal         May I conclude then that you will
 prefer to be bitten by a poisonous snake and die rather than kill the same in trying to save yourself? If I am right in my conclusion,       that way you will be doing the
 greatest possible harm to India by trying to save a harmful living creature and by dying willingly in trying to realize the ideal of your so-called greatest good of all . . .
 . You admit that you are an imperfect mortal. So it is impossible for you to benefit the whole world. It is even impossible for you to benefit the whole of India in all possible ways. Therefore it is quite reasonable to be contented with the greatest good of the greatest number rather than pretend to do the greatest good to all without exception the good and the wicked, the useful and the useless, man, animal, etc., etc.
 This is a question I would fain avoid answering, not because of want of faith but because of want of courage. But I must not conceal my faith even though I may not have the courage to act up to it when it is put on its trial. Here then is my answer. I do not want to live at the cost of the life even of a snake. I should let him bite me to death rather than kill him. But it is likely that if God puts me to that cruel test and permits a snake to assault me, I may not have the courage to die, but that the beast in me may assert itself and I may seek to kill the snake in defending this perishable body. I admit that my belief has not yet become so incarnate in me as to warrant my  stating emphatically that I have shed all fear of snakes so as to befriend them as I would like to be able to. It is my implicit belief that snakes, tigers, etc., are God’s answer to the poisonous, wicked, evil thoughts that we harbour. Anna Kingsford saw in the streets of Paris tigers in men already taking shape. I believe that all life is one. Thoughts take definite forms. Tigers and snakes have kinship with us. They are a
 
 
 warning to us to avoid harbouring evil, wicked, lustful thoughts. If I want to rid the earth of venomous beasts and reptiles, I must rid  myself of all venomous thoughts. I shall not do so if in my impatient ignorance and in my desire to prolong the existence of the body I seek to kill the so-called venomous beasts and reptiles. If in  not  seeking to defend myself against such noxious animals I die, I should die to rise again a better and a fuller man. With that faith in me how should I seek to kill a fellow-being in a snake? But this is philosophy. Let me pray and let my readers join in the prayer to God that He may give me the strength to live up to that philosophy. For philosophy without life corresponding is like a body without life.
 I know that in this land of ours we have enouh phiosophy and but little life. But I know also that the laws governing the conduct of man have still to be explored and the condition of exploration is imperative and unalterable. We shall explore them only by dying, never by killing. We must become living embodiments of Truth and Love, for God is Truth and Love.

    LETTER TO S. D. SATAVALEKAR       AMBOLI, 
    BHAI 	SATAVALEKAR,  April 	14, 1927 
  	I thank you for your prompt reply. I shall try and send you a good 	student. From the consideration you have been showing me I see that 	you are treating me as a fellow-seeker. I shall certainly try to 	become one. I read your book on the Isopanishad and was 	extremely pleased.  I shall write to Bhai Bapulallibtech_416_footnotelibtech_417_footnotein connection with 	 Brahmacharya  and 	Suryabhedan Vyayam. 	He must not suffer 	any financial loss.    
 I am acquainted with Kuvalayanandji. I had sent a young boy to him who being weak was not taught pranayama and other disciplines but was instead treated with medicines. Despite the prevailing climate I have not lost hope regarding the practice of brahmacharya, etc. There will rise from our midst a true aspirant who will clear the prevailing atmosphere. As yet I have come across no such aspirant. My own tapascharya is hopelessly imperfect. I have been observing external, physical brahmacharya for nearly 30 years. I have, however, not freed myself from passion; I am trying to. I think complete control of all the five sense-organs is essential for the observance of perfect brahmacharya. It will not suffice to have control over the six-fold passion libtech_418_footnote; it has to be rooted out. I believe in every word of the verse: “The yearning too departs   when  he  beholds  the  Supreme.”libtech_419_footnotelibtech_420_footnoteThe world is prone to hero-worship. The unhealthy climate prevailing around will soon clear when such a person emerges. Let us work with all our faith for the advent of such a person amidst us. And have not you yourself said that if the message of the Upanishads, etc., is eternally true—and so it is —even today we can come across Uma, Hemavati and Yaksha and, God willing, we shall. I too have read about rubbing in semen and consuming it.libtech_421_footnotelibtech_422_footnoteI   regard  this  as  a  demoniac practice. There may be some truth in it but the experiment deserves no consideration, because we want the brahmacharis to master their senses. Preserving and retaining the vital fluid is a means to an end and not an end in itself. Consuming semen does not bring about freedom from passion; it might to some extent remove the debility consequent upon ejaculation. This is what the Western method achieves. ‘The root cause of seminal discharge lies in the rising of passion, [And] we aim at annihilating all passion.
 That is why I enquired about the asanas, etc, Now I understand that asanas, etc., are a stage on the way [to brahmacharya] and it may be deemed necessary for the aspirant to pass through them.
Have I made myself clear ?
I have understood what you say in your book about the asanas
for retaining semen. Your cautions put one  on  guard.  Even  for  a
 
 married man I see no harm in the siddha and other asanas. With the help of siddhasana a married man’s semen may possibly be retained, the secretion however does not stop. How many men can we come across today who go to their wives purely for the sake of progeny? If the term ‘calming down’ can be used of passion etc., a married man may calm down his passion with the help of siddha and other asanas. But then it is another thing if his aim is absolute eradication of desire.
 I was relieved to find that you do not reject the Puranas. I was afraid you would be disdainful of the ancient Puranas. Indeed I am convinced that at a time when people were growing sceptical the authors of the Puranas aroused in them a love for dharma with their rich poetic appeal, Our Shastras need to be re-interpreted as you are doing, in the light of modern knowledge and for the young people of today.
 When I am settled somewhere I would like to give you  the trouble of coming over to me so that we can compare notes.
 I am now reading the Kenopanishad after which I shall take up your Mahabharata Samalochanalibtech_423_footnote.
 Yours,

They were as usual very nice and asked if it was not too 	late to persuade Gandhiji to stay a little longer at Amboli. 	Gandhiji said he wished very much he could continue his stay in that 	scented spot surrounded by picturesque scenery, in fact, he was 	distressed to leave it, but he could not help it as he wanted to 	combine rest with work. And then Gandhiji proceeded to ask the 	questions I had not asked the other day. GANDHIJI: 	Mahadev has been telling me all the good things he has 	been hearing about you. One of these I should like to be verified      
 by you. Is it true that you draw Rs. 2,000 only from the public  revenue for your private purse?
 H. H. OF SAVANTWADI: Not Rs. 2,000, but Rs. 2,500; but expenses incurred on all State occasions are met from the State revenue.
 That is all right. Now you will stay at Amboli  during  the summer months. Will the expenses be borne by the State?
 No, they will be borne by me.
 And I hear you are keeping with you a number of orphans. You find their expenses too out of your purse?
 Yes, Gandhiji. But they are not all orphans. Some of them are. They come of poor but respectable families. There are many more applications but I am sorry I cannot afford to have more.
 Well, yours is the only instance I know of a ruling  prince drawing a fixed allowance from the public revenue.
 No, you might expect to see many more. The Mysore Maharaja draws a fixed allowance.
 Then it is lucky that after having stayed under your roof I am going to enjoy the hospitality of one like you.
 Yes, and Gwalior did not draw anything from the State Treasury.
That is to say?
 He had his private income and lived on that.
But what is private income but earned from the State itself?
 And now turning to the Rani, who, by the bye, is a princess of the Baroda family, Gandhiji said:
 Yes, I know one as simple as you, the Maharani Regent of Travancore. I was fascinated by her simplicity,libtech_430_footnotelibtech_431_footnoteher dress could not be simpler, and I looked in vain for an ornament on her person, except the mangalamala. The furniture in her room was as severely simple as could be. I was introduced to the young Maharaja whom it  was difficult to recognize as such. But there the comparison ends. They do not live on paltry wages like you.
 The Rani smiled thankfully, whilst Gandhiji continued:
 And I was not surprised at the small quantity of khadi that you purchased, knowing as I did that your means were limited and that you must live within your income. And now that I know that like His Highness you also mix very much among your people, may I suggest that you will enhance your power of service by mastering the art of
 
 spinning?
 The spinning-wheel was all the while going on. The Rani nodded assent, and the Chief said: “That’s not all the khadi we have. We purchased some at the last year’s Khadi Exhibition, and we shall get more from you whenever we want.” All this while His Highness dressed in a short coat and knickers was squatting on the floor.

 I 	have your letters.  	You must not put yourself under over-strain. If the teaching 	overtaxes you, it must be reduced and so the learning. You may make 	it clear to the people about you as to your physical capacity. On no 	account must you lose your health. Do you get proper fruit and milk? 	I am getting on famously. For the last two days I have been taking 	walks both morning and evening without suffering any harm., As 	you know I have replaced one fruit with a vegetable and am taking  bhakhari.  	We leave Amboli today and leave Belgaum tomorrow if all goes well. 	Nandi Hills, Mysore, will be the address for the  next  two  months.  	I shall not leave this place without much regret. The spot itself is 	delightful. But what has attached me to this place is the 	exceptional character of the Chief. From all the accounts received 	by me he appears to be an ideal Chief. He draws a fixed sum from the 	State revenue for his personal expenses. He mixes freely with his 	people. He has visited every one of his 125 villages.

 CHI. GANGABEHN,
 I have your letter. May all your devout wishes be fulfilled and may God grant you the strength to observe your vows.
 Your attitude towards the children is correct. If Damodardas entrusts custody of the children to you, you being in the Ashram, it would be your duty to look after them. But it must suit the Ashram too. Discuss the issue with Kaka. It is a different matter if your heart refuses to do so. In such cases one does not know instantaneously what one’s dharma is.
 Today we leave this place for Nandi Hills. Now on you should write to that address. I presume you will for the time being stay with Kaka, so I send this to his address.

   LETTER TO ASHRAM WOMEN  
 Silence Day, Chaitra Wad 2 [April 19, 1927]libtech_433_footnote
 SISTERS,
 I am sending this letter to your secretary in the absence of Gangabehn. In Gangabehn’s absence you should appoint an acting president. Your work should now be so perfectly regulated that it goes on automatically as in other institutions. In order that this may happen, a leader is absolutely necessary. A leader should have fewer powers but greater responsibilities; she should always be thinking of the good of the institution, and try to increase its capacity for service.
 It appears that your observance of the National Week was quite successful. It was good that you cleaned the latrines. As time passes you should take up more and more responsibilities, provided always
 
 that you have the strength.
 Maintain your contact with women who do outside work. You must also be in touch with Rajibehn and Champavatibehn. Write to me, if you know, how Rajibehn is getting on with her work.
 My health appears to have improved. To this end I am making a simple experiment. If it proves successful, it will have many uses. But I do not want to take your time now by telling you more about it. I will perhaps tell you about it next week.

           DEAR 	FRIEND,    LETTER TO KUVALAYANAND    NANDI 	HILLS, MYSORE,  April 19,1927 
  	I thank you for your letter to Baba Saheb Soman offering to come to 	Mysore at once if necessary and in any case after 26th if required. 	I would like you to come to Nandi Hills as soon as possible after 	26th. If you will kindly send a wire, arrangements will be made to 	bring you to Nandi Hills from the nearest station.  	The growing self-abuse among the students has, as you know, 	attracted me to the yogic asanas, as possible cure of the 	evil habit. In the course of my reading I saw that asanas were 	recommended as a remedy for the cure of many other ills. During my 	illness I read Pandit Satavalekar’s writings. And I thought that I 	would experiment with myself. Copious laudatory notices of 	shirshasana drew me to it. And for the last five days I have 	been trying shirshasana for a few seconds each time. I do it 	in the morning before the meal twice at intervals of two minutes. 	The practice is preceded by neti, cleansing the nostrils by 	means of strips of thin cloth. I remain absolutely passive during 	the practice of the asana. Sjt. Gunaji assists to lift the 	body and sustain it on the head. The same thing is repeated at 9 	p.m. before retiring. The last meal—milk and fruit is taken at 5 	p.m. I have noticed no ill effects. On the contrary, I feel fresher 	and stronger and am able to take short walks. My appetite has 	improved. Now the question is whether shirshasana thus 	passively practised is likely to 
 ease the blood-pressure or to increase it. I take it that neti can do no harm at all in any case. My blood-pressure is at present 180 by auscultation. During the five days the pressure has not increased. Will you advise me to continue the practice or discontinue pending your arrival?
 Please wire if you want me to discontinue. I do not want the
 asanas to be blamed through any hasty action on my part.
 Yours sincerely,
 M. K. GANDHI

   ALL-INDIA COW-PROTECTION ASSOCIATION  
 I had fully intended to report the proceedings of this business Association, which is known by the few, whose origin was practically accidental and which ever since its origin has been trying in the face of odds to solve the very difficult problem of cow protection in terms of religious economics. A meeting of the managing committee of the Association as also its general meeting were held together at the
 
 Ashram on the 11th March last. But through my hurried departure and subsequent illness, the proceedings have remained unreported. The following resolutionlibtech_436_footnotewas  however  passed  unanimously  at  this meeting:
 Inasmuch as a resolution was passed at the last meeting of the managing committee of the Association (at Wardha) to the effect that a sum  not exceeding one lakh rupees might be spent for conducting a model dairy and a model tannery, it is hereby resolved that the said experiment be conducted by and under the supervision of the managing committee of the Satyagraha Ashram, Sabarmati, in accordance with the objects of the All-India Cow-pro- tection Association, and to that end a sum not exceeding one lakh rupees, earmarked for the purpose, be donated to the managing committee of the Ashram out of the funds of the Association, with instructions to that commit- tee to furnish an account of the progress of the experiment from time to time. The following office-bearers of the managing committee of the
All-India Cow-protection Association were elected at the meeting:
 Chairman—M. K. Gandhi
 Treasurer—Sheth Revashanker Jagjivan Jhaveri
 Members—Sjt. Baijnath Kedia; Sjt. Mahavir Poddar; Sheth Jamnalal Bajaj; Sjt. Parameshwari Prasad Gazipuria; Sjt. Narayandas Poddar; Dr. B. S. Moonje; Sjt. Balakrishna Martanda Chonde; Sjt. Shankar Shrikrishna Dev; Sjt. Narayana Balakrishna Kelkar; Sjt. Nagindas Amulakharai; Sjt. Manilal Vallabhji Kothari; Sjt. Maganlal Khushalchand Gandhi
 Secretary—Valji Govindji Desai
 I had hoped during my tour to collect, from lovers of the cow, funds for the Association. The resolution contemplates the expendi- ture of one lakh of rupees. But the Association has not more than 15,000 rupees in its possession. The resolution has been taken in the hope that the Association will receive sufficient donations from the public. Now that I must be confined to my rooms for some time to come, I appeal to those who are interested in and approve of the method adopted by the Association for the protection and preserva- tion of India’s cattle, to send in their mite, without a personal appeal. Everything received will be acknowledged in these columns. Readers know that the terms of membership of the Association are Rs. 5 or 24,000 yards of well-twisted self-spun yarn per year. I expect, how- ever, substantial donations from those who believe in the method and
 
 management of the Association.libtech_437_footnote
 I hope that cow-protection workers will not let Jamnalalji bear the burden of collecting this fund.
 To look after the dairy, an experienced gentleman named Parn- erkar has been appointed. An Indian tanner who has taken training in America has been entrusted with the tannery work. I hope to publish shortly an account of the work done by them. I suggest to cow-pro- tection workers that they should visit the Ashram and see for them- selves the work being done in both the fields.

   TRUTH IS ONE  
A Polish Professor writes:
 I am reading with intense joy your fascinating articles in Young India and wish to impress upon you the truth that they are the source of power not only for your own country but for the world. And as you have such a wide spiritual experience, may I ask you one question to be answered if possible in Young India? It is a very important fundamental question to which an answer from
 you would have a great value. Do you admit that there is in human thought some absolute certainty, as for instance as to God and prayer, where we might be said to have reached perfect unchangeable truth ? Do you also confess that some particular experience led you to change your first opinion, for instance, as to the right of killing certain dangerous animals? Now my fundamental question is, on what particular points do you change your opinion? And what guarantee can these changes leave as to the unshaken truth of what remains certain ? How can we distinguish opportunistic change of opinion from the permanence of an absolute certainty in essentials? Can you define in what things we may change and what kind of things remain unchangeable? Is independence of each country or people one of those absolute truths, or is there some innate incapacity in some nations for self-government and in others an innate capacity for governing such incapable nations, as the Ger- mans profess to have a capacity for governing other nations and thus justify their ruling ambition?
 I have taken the liberty of altering a word here and there in this letter for the purpose of making the writer’s meaning clearer than it appears to be to me in the original. Without in any shape or form endorsing the claim to the powers that the writer ascribes to me, I
 
 would in all humility endeavour to answer his questions. My own conscious claim is very simple and emphatic. I am a humble but very earnest seeker after truth. And in my search, I take all fellow-seekers in uttermost confidence so that I may know my mistakes and correct them. I confess that I have often erred in my estimates and judgments. As for instance, whereas I thought from insufficient data that the people of Kheda were ready for civil disobedience, I suddenly discovered that I had committed a Himalayan miscalculation and saw that they could not offer civil disobedience inasmuch as they had not known what it was to tender willing obedience to laws which might be even considered irksome but not immoral. Immediately I made the discovery, I retraced my steps. A similar error of judgment was committed by me when I presented what has been described as the Bardoli ultimatum.libtech_438_footnoteI had then believed that the country, that is the people, had been awakened and touched by the movement, had understood the utility of nonviolence. I discovered my error within twenty-four hours of the delivery of the ultimatum and retraced my steps. And inasmuch as in every case I retraced my steps, no permanent harm was done. On the contrary, the fundamental truth of non-violence has been made infinitely more manifest than it ever has been, and the country has in no way been permanently injured.
 But I am not aware of having changed my opinion about the necessity of killing certain dangerous animals in certain circumstances specifically mentioned in my articleslibtech_439_footnotelibtech_440_footnote. So far as I am aware of my own opinions, I have ever held the opinion expressed by me in those articles. That however does not mean that the opinion is unchange- able. I claim to have no infallible guidance or inspiration. So far as my experience goes, the claim to infallibility on the part of a human being would be untenable, seeing that inspiration too can come only to one who is free from the action of pairs of opposites, and it will be difficult to judge on a given occasion whether the claim to freedom from pairs of opposites is justified. The claim to infallibility would thus always be a most dangerous claim to make. This however does not leave us without any guidance whatsoever. The sum total of the experience of the sages of the world is available to us and would be for all time to come. Moreover, there are not many fundamental  truths, but there is only one fundamental truth which is Truth itself,
 
 otherwise known as Non-violence. Finite human being shall never know in its fulness Truth and Love which is in itself infinite. But we do know enough for our guidance. We shall err, and sometimes grievously, in our application. But man is a self-governing being, and self-government necessarily includes the power as much to commit errors as to set them right as often as they are made. I do not know whether this will satisfy my correspondent. But whether it does or not,  I have no power in me to give him a more satisfactory answer. After all each one must be a law unto himself, the invariable condition being that he must then walk in the fear of God and therefore continually keep on purifying his heart. A man to be a man must be twice-born as Hindus would say, reborn as Christians would say.
 The concluding questions of the correspondent are easily answered. In fact, the answers can be inferred from the foregoing remarks. I do think that independence of each country is a truth in the same sense and to the same extent that independence of each man is. There is, therefore, no inherent incapacity for self-government in any country or nation and therefore no inherent capacity for governing other nations. No doubt my correspondent honestly thinks that Germans profess to have a God-given capacity for ruling over other nations. But if there are German imperialists, there are also humble German democrats, who are content if they can quietly govern them- selves.

   KHADI STORES  
 The following listlibtech_441_footnoteof khadi stores in the four provinces of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Maharashtra and Bihar will be read with interest. I propose to publish a list of similar stores in the other provinces as soon as they are available. The list is a sign of the very substantial progress made by khadi since 1920. Measured by what we seek to achieve, the progress no doubt leaves much to be desired. 110 stores in four provinces should, when khadi becomes current like grain or ghee, read 110 stores in a city like Bombay alone and then they would not be too many. And why should it be surprising or unthinkable to have khadi as universal as grain or ghee? Or, if such universality for
 
 khadi must be unthinkable, why should it be unthinkable to have, say twenty years hence, as many shops for Australian butter and American wheat as we have today for our own ghee and wheat? If it is patriotic enough to buy foreign cloth because it is cheaper or more pleasant to the eye, why will it not be patriotic enough, when that time comes, to buy cheaper foreign butter and foreign wheat, even though our ghee manufacturers and wheat-growers may become idle and starve for want of other occupations to take the place of the lost ones? These are reflections presented for the edification of wearers of foreign cloth.
 But what is the lesson these stores teach us, khadi organisers? In my opinion, by honest and able organization, we can create  a  universal demand for khadi,
  if 	those who 	are engaged 	in khadi 	production will 	pay attention 	to the 	manufacture of 	stronger and 	more even yarn equal at 	least to 	the mill-spun yarn;  if 	they will also study the 	tastes of 	the people 	and produce 	sufficient variety of khadi;  if 	by efficiency in 	other directions 	they bring 	down the price 	of khadi;  if 	those who 	are engaged in 	the distribution 	of khadi 	will gain 	greater knowledge of 	the tastes 	of the 	people and 	will learn the 	art of selling;  if 	both the producers 	and the sellers 	will realize 	that they 	must give the 	maximum of 	efficiency with the 	minimum of 	wages and 	that self-sacrifice 	is the one 	imperative condition 	of successful 	organiza-tion of 	khadi on 	a universal basis. 
 I note that private depots assume names after their owners or some other name. For greater convenience, I would suggest  their having one name—simple Khadi Bhandar or Vastralaya, with A.I.S.A. or Congress or Private as the case may be in parenthesis. Where there are more than one in the same place they may have consecutive numbers. This is desirable so long as khadi has to be organized and nursed and so long as the various depots are either directly owned by the A.I.S.A. or are certified by and affiliated to it.

MIRA,  	I have your four letters of which three were received together 	yesterday.  	You must have got the wire of departure sent to you from Belgaum on 	19th.  	One of your letters yesterday prompted me to send you a peremptory 	wire asking you to come to Nandi. But I  restrained myself. The 	other two letters were less gloomy. But even so, if the separation 	becomes unbearable, you must come without waiting for an answer or 	any prompting from me. The love of the people round you should 	really strengthen you and keep you there. Your letter describing the 	affection of the people there is most touching and it    
 would be a matter for sorrow if you cannot be at peace with yourself there. But no one can suddenly change one’s nature and if your effort to compose yourself there becomes fruitless, you should tell the friends there so plainly and come away here without the slightest hesitation. On no account should there be a breakdown there. You must not try your nerves to the breaking point.
 This is the sixth day here. I am not yet acclimatized. I have not retained the energy and the strength I felt at Amboli, but doctors assure me that Nandi must in the end be more beneficial than Amboli. They say that this is an ideal place for blood-pressure men. There is no cause whatsoever for worry or anxiety.
 Since you were so worried about the forgetfulness about the two fasts, it was well that you fasted.libtech_443_footnotelibtech_444_footnoteThere is no doubt that fasting is a good thing even physically whenever there is a nervous strain.  It would certainly have been well, if I had fasted before the collapse came. The strain of that day was terrific. But this is wisdom after the event. We may profit by that stupid mistake of mine. I call it stupid because I was aware of the strain and of the merit of fasting in such circumstances. But the Devil is ever after us and catches us at our weakest. He found me weak and wanting and trapped me. Your fast therefore does not worry me. Only you will know when to take it and how to take it.
 You must develop iron nerves. It is necessary for our work. God be with you.

      LETTER TO MURIEL LESTER    ASHRAM, SABARMATI,libtech_445_footnote  April 	25, 1927  	I have your letter of the 29th March. I must dictate this letter as  	I must keep as much on my back as possible.  	I see you want me to give you the name of an Indian friend who could 	lay the foundation stone for your new hall. The only one I can think 	of and thoroughly recommend and whom I know personally very well is 	Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. His address is: Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, 	Clinique Stephani, Montanas Sierre, Switzerland. And  you must write 	to him. Use this letter and draw him. He will come if you want him 	and you will be pleased to have him. He is one of the truest men I 	know in India. I am writing to him.  	I do not like your resolution at all. Here is the text that I would 	recommend. I know it will be difficult for you to pilot my text. But 	really that alone will answer if it is backed by corresponding 	action. The resolution you have given is very vague and will be 	accepted by the Government of India without any difficulty. For, 	they will say that they do not thwart any action which the Indian 	people by their accredited representatives may desire to carry 	through. They will say, ‘we have transferred this department to 	them. Let them adjust the finances as they like.’ Do you see what 	I mean? Our case is that the    
 Government is not sincere, that the people have really no hand in the matter, and that the transfer of excise revenue to the elected representatives is itself proof of the Government’s insincerity. Edu- cation is a transferred subject and the financial assistance given to them is from the excise revenue. The Government have thus created a tie. If the accredited representatives shut up liquor shops, they must starve education or impose fresh taxation upon a people who are in no way able to bear the weight even of existing taxation. The remedy, therefore, is, if the position stated above is correct, for the Government to keep the excise department themselves and carry the prohibition policy through and recoup themselves for the loss of revenue by cutting down the military budget. They have as much right to raise revenue through liquor as they would have to raise revenue through legalized prostitution. If this is your position independently of me and if you can support the position by your own study of facts, figures and other literature, your resolution would run thus:
 In the opinion of this meeting it is wrong for the people of this country to be party to the maintenance of the liquor traffic in India and that therefore it was wrong on the part of the Government to have made the liquor revenue of India a ‘transferred’ (provincial) subject and consequently a principal source of revenue on which the spending departments of education and development have to depend, thereby rendering it practically impossible for the Ministers responsible for these departments to undertake a policy of prohibition. In the opinion of this meeting the Government of India should have retained the Liquor Revenue as a Central subject and carried out a policy of complete prohibition, the loss of revenue thus sustained being made up for, by retrenchment in the ever-growing and largely unnecessary military expenditure. This meeting therefore calls upon the Government to take the steps necessary to enforce the wish expressed in this resolution.
 You may lick the resolution into shape in any manner you like so long as you retain the substance of it unimpaired. I fear that you will find it difficult to carry through the resolution of this character. But really it is the only thing worth having. And if you find that there is no atmosphere yet in England for such a drastic resolution—and I admit that it is drastic—merely put your case before the educated public, and wait for the resolution. The resolution given to you by
 your friends gives a wrong lead and you know how difficult it is to undo the mischief done by a thing wrongly begun.
 I am getting better though I must still take extra-ordinary care to give myself as much rest as is possible both for body and mind.
 Yours sincerely,

 My own reason refuses to work in this matter. You may there- fore use your reason and come to a decision leaving the responsibility to me. About Gariyadhar, do what you think best on the whole. As regards the Panch Talavadi matter, if your reason does not approve of either Maneklal or Chhaganlal, pay them their due salaries and ask them to stand on their own feet. About Vajeram, do what you think proper. Draw the money that you may need from the khadi account in the Ashram. If the total amount exceeds Rs. 1,000, ask me.
 I will continue to be concerned so long as you two brothers do not give me a satisfactory explanation as regards the accounts of the dairy. For, it is a question of adhering to truth. If you think it necessary, I will correct what I have written in Navajivan about it. Therefore, look carefully in the matter and let me know. Purshottam must have fully recovered.

 CHI. MAGANLAL,
 I have your letter. Do as you please about Bhuvarji. You must have noticed that he does not get along with Sitla Sahai. I got the notes from the Working Committee. I wish everything is settled amicably. I am at the moment concerned about the safety of our persons and property. I think it is not right for us to hire the services of a watchman. I can understand having paid assistants from outside the Ashram for other jobs. But just as we have to offer our own prayers so we shall achieve our aim only when we are able to take care of ourselves. Or we shall have to have recourse to the practice [of employing watchmen], in which case our experiments with truth and non-violence would suffer. We cannot have a watchman who commits violence [against the intruders] nor can we let him suffer violence [at their hands]. If there is to be violence we should inflict it ourselves and also suffer it ourselves. Women and children too should acquire this strength. Just see what an absurd result we get if we visualize a magnified picture of the reports that have reached me. Let us decide, on the basis of merit, our course of conduct since we have not yet lost control of the situation. The East India Company built fortresses and employed mercenaries simply because they had to submit to the circumstances. Should we be swayed by circumstances or should we have them under our sway ? I think we should train workers who would keep an all-night vigil. They will have to think of some means of winning over the thieves without having to act in a way contrary to dharma. Let them stay awake at night and sleep for eight hours in the day. Sailors do it without their health being affected by it. They may take turns at this task. But then you may look upon this as a sick man’s wonderings. Being at a distance, I am building castles in the air. But you should all think over this individually and collectively and find out a remedy to your liking. But do come to some final decision in the matter. We ought to know who the intruders were this time. We ought to be able to follow their trail since there were so many of them. Those that were injured can be traced. I shall agree with you even if
 
 you all came to the conclusion that we should wind up all our activities, because ultimately it is up to all of you there to run the show. Now we must immediately have our accounts audited. You can invite Nathji’s auditors or those of the Charkha Sangh or anyone else you like, but it should no more be left pending consideration. Ask the auditors to examine the accounts minutely and critically and to make any suggestions they would like to. Chi. Narandas should sit with them so that he can help them with information.
 This letter is for all of you. I am improving though not very fast. Yesterday I walked a lot so that I could take rest today.

PS.
 After writing this, I read in the other letter from you about the arrangements, etc. So according to our practice, the enclosed letter should be addressed to Chhaganlal, shouldn’t it? It is all right if the changes have all been introduced after due deliberations.
 I have noted what you say about Sir Gangaram. The description fails to make a favourable impression on me. It is all to the good that you could learn something about agriculture. Ours is an absolutely unique way. Our aim is to ensure  that  we  follow  our  dharma  till the end.

I send you an extract from Mirabai’s letter about the travelling 	charkha. I too have found the parts to be weak.

           MY 	DEAR GOVIND,    LETTER TO R. B. GREGG        NANDI HILLS,  April 	26, 1927 
  	Do not be alarmed. Though I reply to your letter so promptly, it is 	not by way of courtesy, but for pleasure; for, I do not yield to you 
 in my zeal for dietetic reform. Only my lot having been during the last 20 years cast in a rigid mould, I have not been able to wriggle out of it in spite of my intense desire to prosecute dietetic research. But now that nature had laid me low, the appetite which was never eradicated, but was only under suppression, has become active and I go for everything in this direction with avidity.
 Now to the point. For the last two days I have made one impor- tant change prompted by a fellow crank. He suggested my taking the juice of fresh neem leaves by mixing it with milk. He says my case is not one of blood-pressure but of flatulence. Blood pressure there certainly is; but I am inclined to agree with this friend, that blood-pressure is a temporary effect of flatulence which is the root cause, and he thinks I could deal with the latter by taking the juice of neem leaves with my meals. These leaves are bitter. He says they contain the necessary vitamins. I am watching their effect now. Your letter was received yesterday and the change I have made today is to take unboiled milk. This was suggested by some medical friends at Amboli. But I was not responsive. But your letter has evoked the necessary response. My hosts have brought some goats on to this hill and they are milked under supervision. Milk was therefore brought this morning fresh from the udders. It was mixed with neem leaves juice and hot raisin water was added to the milk. This in accordance with your letter gives me the vitamins from the milk and in accor- dance with that friend gives me the vitamins from the neem leaves. I am therefore at the present moment omitting fresh vegetables because  I am not yet satisfied that these vegetables are necessary especially as I am taking those bitter leaves and unboiled milk. At what point are vitamins destroyed when you boil leafy vegetables ? What is the virtue of vitamins? What is the quantity of leafy vegetables one should take in order to get the required measure of vitamins? What quantity of unboiled milk will give the vitamins required? Is it true that mere heating the milk does not destroy vitamins? Or they are only des- troyed when milk is brought to the boiling point?
 I have tried the nuts in the manner you suggest. I had them reduced to butter. The pulp was as fine as butter. I had almonds turned into milk. But I could not cope with it, no matter how far you pulverized the nuts. They must, it appears, pass through the double process of digestion like all non-flesh foods. It is only animal food which does not tax the large intestines. Before nuts, therefore, can
 
 attain the digestibility of milk, the first process of digestion must be gone through outside the human system. I was told when I was in London, that melted nuts had that effect. I do not know how far this is true. I want to succeed in non-milk experiment because I am convinced that milk, apart from mother’s milk, is not human food, nor is cooking essential. A perfect food therefore for human needs has yet to be found. From the spiritual stand-point, I have a horror of animal milk, and that it is goat’s milk I am taking does not lessen the horror. It merely enables me to respect the letter of my vow, though I know that the spirit of it is hardly kept if not already broken. I have reconciled myself to goat’s milk under the delusive belief that I must have for my work on the earth in this body and so I cling to it at the expense of my innermost conviction. He, therefore, who can wean me from milk, will be in a way a deliverer. There are spiritual experiences which I know have been interrupted because of my taking milk. When I was living rigidly on sun-baked fruits and sun-baked nuts without using fire and this was for several years—the animal passion was not merely under conscious subjection and control, but it was, so far as my memory serves me, thoroughly absent and I believe that I had almost entirely conquered it. All that has been changed since my return to milk diet. I can no longer claim that immunity. I can only say in all humility that though I am conscious of that passion, I can keep it under subjection and appear before the world a respectable human being from whose lust no woman need fear. But it cost me all my strength to keep the brute in me under disciplined subjection and control. I am positive that a full-grown man does not need all that effort to keep his passions under check. On the contrary, the energy that set free when the passions are kept under control can, if he wishes, be transferred into unconquerable power for the good of mankind. But somehow or other, I fancy that I shall never attain that freedom, that personal swaraj, so long as I have to struggle against the effect of the highly exciting unnatural food; whereas, nuts are fine muscle builders without being stimulants in the sense in which I have used them. Now you can understand why I reply to your  letter  so promptly.
 It is a great pity that you have not yet got rid of your piles. No mere dietetic change will give you relief. Medicine will be only a palliative. I am making explorations into which I must not enter now, because, I am merely on the threshold of them. I am collecting round me friends who have experimented. I shall give you a report if I see
 any signs of real success. It hurts me however to think that you did not have an operation for want of means. Dr. Ansari is a first-class surgeon. I could send a note to him if you don’t know him. He will, I am sure, gladly perform the operation and put you either in his own house or in some place where you will have to pay nothing. You could also have the operation performed by one of the cleverest of surgeons in India, that is, Dr. Dalal in Bombay. There are not one but more than one hospitals that I know will admit you with greatest pleasure. You may not know that Dr. Dalal operated on me, Devdas, Mrs. Jamnalalji and, last but not the least, Andrews. You have only to let me know what arrangements you would like and they shall be made. Do not hesitate please to write to me of your discoveries about the spinning-wheel and machinery. Of course I am interested in your scholastic researches, and, as a matter of fact, this enforced rest gives me just the time to read letters and to reflect upon topics in which both you and I are interested. From the length of the dictated letter you can infer that I am not badly off though I need to lie on my back as much as possible. There is no difficulty about dictating letters and even sitting up for a time to write as I did yesterday, it being my silence day.
With love to you all,

 I have forwarded to Chi.

 I have been writing to Narandas about the khadi work. Now about the Satyagraha Dal.
 There will never be too many satyagrahis;  my blessings therefore even to those who would try to become one. But are we likely to gain any special advantage by forming a Dal? There could be recruiting for an immediate task on hand. Will the Dal be useful as  a stand-by when an occasion comes up? Or if we have such an organi- zation, it should, I am convinced by experience, be engaged in some constructive activity. In the event of a struggle, we can draw from it the required number of workers and the rest can come and join of their own accord. What will these 18 persons do as long as there is no occasion to launch a struggle? Of course they do carry on their spinning; when I speak of constructive activity I mean that which would keep them occupied all the time. All these 18 persons have their own business to attend to. At the moment they have no social activity to take up collectively.
 Who will build up faultless character? How is it defined? You for one know well that the Satyagraha Ashram exists just for it. And even there, who could certify faultless character?
 Satyagraha and the satyagrahis are like the sun and its rays, you cannot hide them under a bushel, they cannot be unmade by your refusing to recognize them.
 Everywhere today I see occasions for satyagraha; but where are those who would offer it? Those that would are ever ready. They are preparing themselves and when they have the confidence they will never wait for my permission or anyone else’s.
 In spite of all this cautioning, I would ask you to let all that you have done stand as it is. It would not have mattered had you not worked it up, but where the intention is noble there is no room for disappointment or for undoing what has been done.
 
 Think of something that would strengthen the bond among the workers. As for my criticism in the first instance you should think it over yourself and then make such additions and alterations as you think right.
When we meet we shall again discuss it further.
 This Dal is certainly not in response to those who are pressing us to take up political activity. Their point of view too deserves to be understood. It is a different thing that you and I are not interested in it. They maintain that even today we should carry on a movement, as far as we can, over all the issues that are believed to have a political aspect. Satyagraha may or may not come off, but let us at least present a petition regarding our present miseries. If nothing more, let us come together for discussions since we are allowed to. If nothing else, let us at any rate exchange views and so on.
 This line of thought cannot certainly be dismissed; we too had been thinking this way in the past. Your Dal does not answer this expectation. You should find out some simple way for them, or help them find it. One of the ways to do this is to willingly leave the organization of the Political Conference to them and help them with it as much as you can.
 As I write, more comes to my pen. But if I set out to “print” all of it I would tire my hand and my doctor will warn me that my blood-pressure may rise.
 You should therefore strike the ‘t’s and dot the ‘i’s in what I have written today. And if you cannot, you should get me to do it on some other occasion.

  	I have your letter. It appears the Godhra Ashram has at present a 	good number of students. But then you also could be said to have 	done good work. You must have noticed however that the Ashram 	children did more spinning in that way. Did you read Ramachan- 	dran’s report of Jamia Millia?  	It may be said the boys there did absolutely no spinning for six 	years. Just a knowledgeable, affectionate teacher who had faith in 	it has changed the entire atmosphere of the Ashram. Many such 	stories come to me. I do not write all this as criticism of you but 	only to strengthen your faith if I may.  	But I do not want to tell you things, I want to hear what you have 	to say. How do you feel about Ramanandji’s work? What about that 	of the Punjab? Did you cope with that task?  	Everyone believes I should be all right. The doctors here say that I 	have no illness as such, but that I must have long rest. The weather 	here is fine. The view cannot compare with the one at Chin- chpokli.  	If it were your responsibility, what would you do about the nuisance 	of prowlers round the Ashram? Think long before you answer.

   LETTER TO MIRABEHN  
 Unrevised April 27, 1927
 
CHI. MIRA,
 I have your cheerful letter. If you can realize every word of what you have written, all your trouble is over and also my anxiety. We really live through and in our work. We perish through  our perishable bodies, if instead of using them as temporary instruments, we identify ourselves with them. The more I observe and study things, the more convinced I become that sorrow over separation and death is perhaps the greatest delusion. To realize that it is a delusion is to become free. There is no death, no separation of the substance. And yet the tragedy of it is that though we love friends for the substance we recognize in them, we deplore the destruction of the insubstantial that covers the substance for the time being. Whereas real friendship should be used to reach the whole through the fragment. You seem to have got the truth for the moment. Let it abide for ever.libtech_460_footnote
 I do not know how Krishnanandji came to think that I was coming there in June. What I did say—I think in letter was that I would like to come as early as I could. I note your warning. There is little chance of my being able to leave the place before June, if then.

   UNTOUCHABILITY AND UNREASON  
A correspondent from Mahad writes:
 It gives me much sorrow to let you know that there was a riot on the 20th of March last between touchables and untouchables at Mahad. There was held a conference of the Colaba District depressed classes on the 19th and 20th ultimo. The meeting was quite successful. But whilst the crowd was dispersing, Mr. A. V. Chitre of the Social Service League of Bombay told the people as they were thirsty and as the sun was very hot that they could go to the public tank and drink water. There were some who tried to dissuade the men from going to the tank. But Dr. Ambedkar the president decided to march the men to the tank. Even the police inspector could not feel the gravity of the situation, and instead of stopping the crowd from proceeding to the tank, went with them. The tank is situated in the midst of the Brahmin locality. As however no
 
 Navajivan, 8-5-1927
 one was aware that the untouchables were going to the tank there was no disturbance, and hundreds of them quenched their thirst at the tank with cries of “Hara Hara Mahadev”. Meanwhile the touchables came to the scene and they watched the incident with rage. The crowd of untouchables then went back to
 the pandal for their meals. Within an hour of this the Mahad public was suddenly awakened by the wild cry Gurava and they were told that the untouchables were thinking of entering the temple of Vireshwar.
 It was a false cry; but in no time the temple was filled by an infuriated mob of touchables who had sticks in their hands. The poor untouchables had no intention whatsoever of going to the temple. But the touchables finding no untouchable attempting to enter the temple practically ran amuck, went to the bazaar and began to beat any untouchable they came across in the street. All the while this beating was going on on the part of the touchables, not one untouchable offered any resistance. A few touchables who sympathized with the untouchables tried to protect them; but the furious mob would not be checked. They even rushed into the huts of shoe-makers and such others and beat them severely. The helpless untouchables ran wildly for help; but none was offered by the shopkeepers. The untouchables who were in the pandal were derided by the touchables for not coming out in the open to fight. There were nearly 1,500 of the former in the pandal and if they had offered to fight there would have been a great calamity and Hinduism would have been disgraced. Dr. Ambedkar justified the advice that he had given on the strength of the resolution that was passed in the Bombay Legislative Council and on the opinion expressed by the Mahad Municipality that the untouchables were lawfully entitled to take water from public tanks and wells.
I have omitted from the correspondent’s letter several passages
 giving further details. But the letter appears to me to be genuine and does not in any way appear to be an over-estimate. Assuming then that the incident is correctly reported there can be no question about the unprovoked lawlessness on the part of the so-called higher classes. For, it should be remembered that it was not the drinking of water at the tank which had brought together the “touchables” to the temple but the false report that the untouchables were wanting to enter the temple. But one can hardly expect sanity to exist side by side with unreason. Untouchability itself has no reason behind it. It is an inhuman institution. It is tottering and it is sought to be supported by the so-called orthodox party by sheer brute force.
 The so-called untouchables have brought the question a step nearer solution by their exemplary self-restraint under most provo-
 king circumstances. Had they retaliated it would have been perhaps difficult to distribute the blame. As it is, the blame is all on the side of the “touchables”. Brute force will not sustain untouch-ability. It will bring about a revulsion of feeling in favour of the suppressed classes. It is a sign of the times that there were at least some “touchables” who tried to defend the poor untouchables. One could wish that there were many more in Mahad. Silent sympathy on such occasions is not of much use. Every Hindu, who considers the removal of untouch- ability to be of paramount importance, should on such occasions  prove his sympathy by publicly defending the suppressed classes and having his own head broken in defending the helpless and the down- trodden.
 I cannot help thinking that Dr. Ambedkar was fully justified in putting to test the resolutions of the Bombay Legislative Council and the Mahad Municipality by advising the so-called untouchables to go to the tank to quench their thirst. No incident of this character should pass by unnoticed on the part of associations like the Hindu Maha- sabha interested in this reform. Let them investigate the statements made by my correspondent and if they can be substantiated, let them condemn the action of the “touchables”. There is nothing like the growth of enlightened public opinion for eradicating everything evil, which untouchability undoubtedly is.

   SASTRI AS FIRST AMBASSADOR  
 Very considerable relief will be felt by the Indian settlers in South Africa over the announcement that the Right Hon’ble V. S. Srinivasa Sastri has consented to become India’s first Agent-general in that sub-continent, if the post is finally offered to him by the Government of India. It is a great sacrifice that Sastri and the Servants of India Society have made. It is an open secret that left to himself he was not inclined to undertake the responsibility and to leave his work in India. But he has yielded to the pressure of friends, especially when it was urged upon him that he alone could successfully inaugurate the working of the Agreement in bringing about which he played not an inconsiderable part. We know from the cables that were sent from time to time from South Africa that the Europeans were anxious that he should accept the honour. Sjt. Srinivasa Sastri had by his eloquence,
 
 transparent sincerity, sweet reasonableness, and extreme earnestness won the esteem and respect of the Union Government and the Europeans in South Africa during the short time that he was there as a member of the Habibullah Deputation. I know how nervously anxious our countrymen in South Africa were that he should become the first Agent. It was impossible for Sjt. Srinivasa Sastri whom God has endowed with a generous nature not to respond to such a unanimous call from South Africa. It is almost a foregone conclusion that the appointment will be duly made and very shortly announced.
 The first Agent-general will have his work cut out for him. Both the Union Government and our countrymen have no doubt high expectations of India’s first ambassador. The Union Government no doubt think that being an Indian and a person of great distinction he will make their path smooth with the Indian community in connection with any measures that they may take. In other words, they will expect him to be their sympathetic interpreter both to the Indian community and to the Government of India. Our countrymen equally surely expect him to insist upon an honourable and even a liberal inter- pretation and fulfilment of the Agreement. It is any time a delicate task to please rival claimants, more so now in South Africa where the clash of conflicting interests is simply bewildering. But I know that if anybody can hold the scales absolutely even and thus give satisfaction to all parties concerned, Sjt. Srinivas Sastri is certainly the one to be able to do so. I feel certain that the Union Ministers do not expect the new Agent to surrender an inch of what is justly due to the Indian community. All he can be expected to do is to persuade the Indian settlers not to go behind and travel beyond the Settlementlibtech_462_footnotelibtech_463_footnoteof  1914, for some time to come at any rate, until they have proved themselves entitled, by exemplary self-restraint and behaviour, to an enlargement of the position attained by the Agreement of 1914. Our countrymen in South Africa, if they intend to make the Agent’s position fairly easy and their own position secure, will not expect him to work wonders. It will be wrong to look forward to a complete transfor- mation of the old position, because an honourable Agreement has been arrived at and because a great countryman is going to South Africa to see to the fulfilment of that Agreement. They must remem- ber that the Rt. Hon. Srinivasa Sastri is not going there as their counsel briefed to attend to every individual grievance. To smother him with
 
 detailed individual grievances would be to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs. He goes there as a trustee for India’s honour. He goes there to safeguard the rights and liberty of the general body of Indian settlers. He will be there to see that no fresh restrictive legislation is embarked upon by the Union Government and that the existing restrictive laws are administered liberally and with due regard to the vested rights. Any individual grievance therefore that he might be called upon to tackle will have to be in terms of the position I have set forth, that is to say, it will have to be illustrative of some general principle of wide application. Unless therefore the Indian community exercises prudential restraint upon themselves in approaching him for redress of their individual grievances, they will make the Agent’s position intolerable and even useless for the high purpose for which it is intended. Indeed such an ambasador’s usefulness lies not so much in work appertaining to his official capacity as to the indirect service he can render by his sociableness, and by his character, which leaves its impress upon anything and anybody that it comes in contact with officially or otherwise. And if our countrymen desire to make use of the great qualities of head and heart that Sjt. Sastri posseses, they will bear in mind the limitations I have endeavoured to set forth.
 I understand that if Sjt. Sastri goes, Mrs. Sastri too will accom- pany him. This will be a great gain to the settlers. Let the Indian sisters in South Africa gather round Mrs. Sastri and surround her with every affection. They will find in her an invaluable instrument of social service. She will act as a leaven in their midst to raise the general tone among the many thousand Indian sisters who are scattered throughout South Africa.

   A TERRIBLE CONTRAST  
 A friend having for the first time seen New Delhi and the Assembly Hall in March last writes:libtech_464_footnote
 I was the other day for the first time in the Assembly Hall and it was for the first time then that I saw New Delhi also. I could see how millions must have been poured into the construction of New Delhi to make it so imposing. The Assembly Hall too presents an equally imposing appearance. But as I
 
 
 came out of the Assembly Hall, I saw dilapidated huts which turned out to be the labour camp where I thought must be living the coolies working at the construction of New Delhi....
 The contrast between the palaces built in New Delhi for wealthy people and the miserable huts allotted to the people whose labour was responsible for the palaces was too terrible for contemplation....
 How, I thought to myself, could the members of the Assembly day after day miss the horrible contrast which I could see even during the few moments that I was in New Delhi? . . .
 I have said nothing to any of the members. But could you not do anything in this matter? I have said nothing because I could influence no one; but you may think it worth while doing something. You are a friend of the poor and might be able to secure some relief. Anyway I could not help disburdening myself to you.
I have summarized the main contents of the letter which my fair
 correspondent has written in Hindi. The criminal disparity that exists between the condition of labour and that of capital is no new thing in modern times. The discovery made by the friend reminds one of the discovery said to have been made centuries ago by Gautama Buddha. It was no new thing he saw. But the shock received by the sight of old age, disease and other miseries of life transformed his life and materially affected the fortunes of the world. It is well that this lady has received her first shock. If she and the other cultured women of India, who have received their education at the expense of the very poor people of whom the correspondent writes so pathetically, will dive deeper and make some slight return to these poor people by making common cause with them, some alleviation in their distressful condition will not be long in coming. Every palace that one sees in India is a demonstration not of her riches but of the insolence of power that riches give to the few, who owe them to the miserably requitted labours of the millions of the paupers of India. We have a Government which is based upon and which only exists by the exploitation of the toiling millions.
 A friend sent me the other day a cutting from an English newspaper which considered Rs. 1,500 for an Englishman to be not enough for his wants in India, and it warned Englishmen from venturing out to India if they could get not more than Rs. 1,500 per month. There is no need to quarrel with that standard. From the writer’s own standpoint, Rs. 1,500 per month is demonstrably
 inadequate because he regards club life, a motor-car, migration to a hill-station during the hot months, education of children in England to be the necessary minimum. All one can say and one must say about this standard is, that if it is the indispensable minimum, it is a standard too expensive for India to afford; and however beneficial in  the abstract may the services of English officials be demonstrated to be, if the toiling millions are to live, they must get along without these beneficial services for the simple reason that the benefit is beyond the reach of their pockets. I suppose it is possible to demonstrate that if the millions of India could be translated to some bracing Himalayan plateau, they would be able to double the length of their days on earth. But it is a proposition which they will laugh out of court as beyond their reach.
 What the lady observed in New Delhi is but a tiny symptom of an ever-growing and deep-seated disease which is daily destroying the lives of thousands of people. It is quite possible to imagine that if an energetic member of the Assembly moved a resolution calling upon the Government to provide better housing accommodation for the labourers, the resolution would be carried, that it would not be vetoed and that the Government would gladly give effect to it at the expense of millions poorer still than these labourers. I am sure that this is not what the fair friend really desires. What she desires in common with every Indian who knows anything of the country is a radical change in the system of government which is top-heavy and which under its intolerable weight is crushing day after day the poor inhabitants of this country who are groaning at the bottom. I have pointed the way out of this difficult situation times without number. I do not know another.

   NOTES  
 KHADDAR AND PREM MAHAVIDYALAYA
 Acharya Gidwani has been slowly but surely revolutionizing the mentality of the boys learning in Prem Mahavidyalaya at Brindaban. In the course of a letter he says:
 I do not boast of my khaddar work in this Mahavidyalaya; but I can safely assure you that you will not be disappointed when you see it. Beginning with gentle pressure I have arrived at a stage when every teacher and student
 wears khaddar without grudging and everyone spins on takli for 45 minutes daily. Carding is done by turns and weaving is taught to select students. Dyeing has been started. About Rs. 2,000 worth of khaddar has been sold through the Prem Mahavidyalaya during the session, and everyone in Muttra and the neighbourhood looks upon the Prem Mahavidyalaya as a stronghold of shuddha khaddar. Two tailors have been busy sewing exclusively khaddar for
 months in the Mahavidyalaya and will continue doing so.
 I congratulate Acharya Gidwani and his staff and students. His performance reminds me of a similar performance reported in these columns with reference to the Jamia Millia of Delhi. These two instances and more can be quoted to show that where there are earnestness and faith there is no difficulty about response from students. I have said repeatedly that it is the easiest thing to popularize khaddar and hand-spinning in schools if the teachers have faith combined with knowledge and perseverance. I know of no school where these three conditions being fulfilled there has been failure.

           DEAR 	DR. ANSARI,    LETTER TO DR. M. A. ANSARI       NANDI HILLS,  April 	28, 1927 
  	It was a treat to receive your letter. But you will remember that 	you owe me a medical visit—can’t call it professional because a 	professional visit will carry with it Rs. 1,000 per day if not more, 	now that you have been twice to Europe since the promise of a visit. 	And, is not each European visit supposed to add to the capacity of 	doctors and lawyers and therefore also their daily fees? Meanwhile, 	I shall bear your instructions in my mind. My chief difficulty is 	how to control the mind and not to let it think, unless I develop 	dementia. If you say I may not reduce my thoughts to writing 	or not even give utterance by speech even in the shape of 	conversation, I can somewhat understand; but I do not know how I can 	prevent the  doings  of Hindus and Mussalmans from making me think 	furiously. Nor do I know how to prevent the growing starvation of 	millions acting upon my mind. I do not need to read papers and get 	information to make me continuously think of these things. The ony 	way to prevent me from thinking of these things is for Hindus and 	Mussalmans to behave like human beings rather than sub-human animals 	and for all of us 
 who get more than our share of our daily bread to think of the vast majority of the teeming millions and for their sakes to discard foreign cloth and for their encouragement to spin during every idle moment.
 If it is really a fact that high blood-pressure is due to an over- wrought brain, I seriously contend that the only way to remove this tension would be to prescribe a starvation cure. Deep down in me I do feel that a prolonged fast is the only radical cure because during the 21 days fastlibtech_465_footnotelibtech_466_footnote, I could see that after 10 days I has ceased even to think of the outside world. The starvation had created that temporary mental adjustment. Whilst I am eating even if it was possible the mind refuses not to think. But under starvation the mind will co-operate in ceasing to think and worry. And, if in spite of the care that I am myself taking and in spite of the army of medical friends who see me and examine me, in spite of the quacks whose opinion I voluntarily seek and in spite of the undivided attention of devoted nurses, blood-pressure refuses to yield and weakness persists, I shall certainly risk causing temporary pain to many friends and impose a fast upon myself either to end or to mend this vegetating and vexing state. But there is no cause for any alarm. It seems that the pressure will go down. For the last two days I am feeling stronger than when I came to Nandi. The highest pressure during last week was 188. On Tuesday last it was found to be 180. This was the first decline yet noticed after the collapse.
 This hill is 4,850 feet, therefore, not so high as Ooty nor so cold; but it is cool enough and Doctor Mehta considers that I should not [go] to a higher altitude. Others again say that higher the altitude the better it is for . . .libtech_467_footnoteWhen doctors differ what is a poor patient to do? Some day when you are free I shall certainly expect you when we shall talk not merely of my health but about several other things of infinitely greater importance.
 Please give my love to all who think of me and accept it for yourself.

  	Your letter is a tonic for me. You are realizing all my expec- 	tations. I am delighted that the kitchen is in a perfect state now. 	Who is your right-hand man? How is Giriraj doing? Are you keeping 	perfect health? Your kitchen must become a treasure store of health 	of mind, body and spirit. There must be all about it and for all 	times a sweet- ness, restfulness and peacefulness which should be 	capable of being detected by any passer-by. Everything in its place, 	everything clean, no foreign smells of a multiplicity of condiments, 	only the natural smell of simple edibles and workers working 	harmoniously, conten- tedly and smilingly in their own persons 	showing perfect health. Do you know that the rishis of old 	were poets, philosophers, cooks, sca- vengers all rolled into one? 	Nalaraja was a wise ruler, an ideal husband and a finished cook. 	Every occupation may become disgraced by bad associations and every 	occupation can become a stepping-stone to salvation when it is 	undertaken by a wise man.

  	Your latest letter is still more cheerful. I hope this mood will 	last.   I very nearly sent you a card in Hindi today. But it was too 	late. This [is] written after the receipt of the post, but also 	after its departure which precedes the receipt  	I have made a slight change in the food here which is approved by a 	distinguished doctor who is living nearby. I am now taking raw milk 	and adding now and then juice of a few neem leaves and have 	omitted chapatis and vegetables for the time being. I may revert to 	the latter two if it becomes necessary. There is now noticed a 	decline in 
 the blood-pressure for the first time since the collapse. I am feeling altogether better.
 The rest through Mahadev. With love,

 29th Morning You should certainly translate Rolland’s book. But if you are at  peace with yourself now your permanent attainment of internal peace
is far more important than anything else. You like the people there.
 You can therefore give them much and take also. I would like you if you can to grow to your full height there before you leave. My suggestion then is that you should set apart religiously an hour daily for translation and make such progress as you can. Meanwhile, God might open the way for me to stay there for the necessary time and the facts may be revised in consultation with Mahadev. Or when you feel that your work there is finished you can come wherever I am if I do not come there soon enough. But you shall decide what to do. I have told you you are free to come here whenever you like. Only do not please regard the translation work more important than what you are doing there. If a man is to be judged by his deeds and not by whatever the sanest man of the age may from a distant study of him say of him then the lives of co-workers will be the best judgement on me. You understand what I mean, do you not?
 I fancy I have forgotten to answer a question you asked in one of your letters. Undoubtedly the interpretation of your vow is that your last meal should be finished before 7 p.m. or dusk whichever the vow is. You are therefore right in your interpretation. The rule regarding vows is when in doubt interpret against yourself, i.e., in favour of greater restriction.

  	Next year you will be married, and begin a new life. I want you and 	Ramdas to get ready and prepare yourselves for it. I write this to 	you after I have written to Ramdas. I have long since been 	corresponding with Ramdas. Go through the enclosed extract from 	Ramdas’s letter.  	I wish both of you would devote your lives to service; Ramdas does 	wish to. You should earn your livelihood too from it,  as  Maganlal 	does and many others too. I wish you two could become an ideal 	couple, for which you should begin your efforts from now on. 
 Whatever time you can spare from your household duties you may devote to khadi work, for which you too would be paid. I have been doing it in two cases; one of Chi. [Kishorelal] and Gomatibehn and the other of Thakkar and his wife. But you can surpass them both. The job that you are required to do will be easy but you will get the satisfaction that you can earn on your own, and one should always try to prove that one can. You can run your home along with this occupation, and, I think, you can also look after your children when you have them. Thousands of husbands and wives from poor families earn their living in this way. You know yourself the cases of Dudabhai and Danibehn, of Ramjibhai and Gangabehn. We shall also remain poor alongside of them. Only then shall we be fit to realize God.
 For accomplishing this you ought to improve your ginning, carding and spinning. Side by side, you must improve your know- ledge of Gujarati and pick up some book-keeping. You can find time for all this. You must improve your health too. Sanskrit and so on are of course to be there.

   LETTER TO SITARAM PURUSHOTTAM PATWARDHANlibtech_476_footnote  
 April 30, 1927 In   my   articlelibtech_477_footnoteabout   buffaloes   I   have   said   nothing   about destroying them; on the contrary an attempt should be made to raise
 their  breed.  Where  the   need  for  a  thing  is  real   it   will  surely  be
 
 protected. What I mean is that cow-protection alone can be part of dharma. It includes compassion for other animals. But these are not being destroyed. There is no need to take up the stupendous task of stopping their destruction. And if we are able to protect the cow, all else that needs to be done will be accomplished automatically. It is not the purport of my writing to ignore the buffalo. I only indicate the limit of our ability. Even the villages ought to have something in the nature of a tannery, a dairy. In other words, the tanning process in the villages needs to be improved. There is need for some sophistication in the manner of skinning. There should be some expert experi- menting with regard to the cow; there has to be knowledge of the methods of increasing their yield. It is our misfortune that today we can only carry this knowledge from the town to the country. At the moment we are not even aware of this science. I mean, we shall be able to do nothing before those who have learnt it in the West evolve it anew with an appreciation of the local environment and in an assimilable form. So, for the time being, we shall only be experi- menting, the point being that an industry which is today handled mainly by ignorant men for earning a livelihood should be taken up by the educated class, keeping in view our country’s welfare, as is being done in the case of spinning and weaving. Efforts in the direc- tion have now been initiated in the Ashram.

   LETTER TO RAMDAS GANDHI

 CHI. RAMDAS,
I have your letter. It is very good that you have started.
 The letter from Khushalbhai is nice; please let me know what you wrote in reply to him. Service does include one’s interest. One who serves with a pure heart is always provided for by God. It  certainly is an inexhaustible source of learning. No sincere worker has
 
 
 ever starved. Maganlal and others have lost nothing, on the contrary they have ennobled their lives and attained their goal.
 If you feel that you lack aptitude for doing a thing, this shortcoming can certainly be removed by trying hard. Experience will bring all the knowledge one needs. There will be no difficulty what- ever in raising a grand edifice on the foundations of noble character.

   LETTER TO CHHAGANLAL GANDHI  
 Chaitra Vad 14 [April 30, 1927]libtech_479_footnote
 CHI. CHHAGANLAL,
 We all deliberated a lot this morning about Prabhudas. Along with other places you are thinking of, keep in mind Nandi too. However, Rajaji and others are of the opinion that it would be better if no sick person is sent there. I do not put Prabhudas in the category of such persons. For him, it is better if we take a decision soon. Why cannot he go to Doctor in Dholwad? Gangabehn will look after him also. And at Panchgani, there is the facility of Mathuradas’s room and he could stay with him. Instead of my asking Mathuradas, it is better if you ask him. He will be a little confused if I ask him. Or, instead of going there, he should come here. Gangadharrao says that he can go to Hubli. It is at a height of 3000 ft. Prabhudas has seen the place. Pundalik is there. So he would not need any other companion. Out of all these places, choose one. I find it somewhat difficult to accept Almora. Jamnadas himself needs looking after. What is the good of putting two sick persons together. An added reason for my preference for Panchgani is the possibility of Pyarelal being there. Write to me whatever decision you take or send me a telegram.
Mathuradas’s address is: Panchgani Castle

  	I wrote to you a postcardlibtech_488_footnotein Hindi just to tell you that I was thinking 	constantly of you and to see whether you could read and understand 	my Hindi. Do not be alarmed. I do not propose to write to you always 	in Hindi. But if you can follow my Hindi, I do want now and then to 	write my extra letters in Hindi, i.e., if you like the idea, not 	otherwise.  	Now for your disturbing wire. I wonder what in my letters has 	prompted it. You can have no notion of the energy I have already 	regained. I have written for Navajivan four articles this 	week. For Young India I wrote three last week. I am really 	doing almost the    
 normal work for the papers now. And I do a fair amount of love letters.
 But all this is nothing compared to the result of medical examination yesterday. The pressure dropped from 188 to 155, and 155 to 160 is the normal for my age. I have been walking for the last three days over one mile per day in two periods each extending to 30 minutes. This is more than Amboli. So there is now no anxiety about my health. There can be no question now of leaving Nandi. It would be foolish to think of leaving it till my previous strength is attained, if it can be at all or till the season for Nandi ends which it does about July.
 I observe from your wire that in spite of your previous letter of attainment of peace, the pendulum has swung back and that you are again perturbed. This does not surprise me. If our lucid moments were lasting, nothing further will remain to be done. Unfortunately or fortunately, we have to pass through many an ebb and flow before we settle down to real peace.
 I have therefore left you free to do as you please.  Better  certainly if you can keep your peace and stay. Equally certainly come away if you cannot keep your peace. Only, in any decision you come to, please eliminate the question of my health. For if you come, you would find little difference between me as you saw me in Kangri and me as I am now. Dive deep into yourself then and find out if you can where you are and act accordingly irrespective of what I would like you to do. Or put it another way. I would like you to do what your inner spirit tells you to do.

 I find your progress in another direction also praiseworthy. Last week I raised the problem of protecting yourselves against thieves.libtech_491_footnoteDo not lightly brush it aside. I wish you to falsify the epithets ‘weak’, ‘timid’ and so on that are specially used about women. They do not apply to all women of course. Who would say the women of Raniparaj are ‘timid’? How can you call them weak? The women of the West, of course, take part these days in everything. I do not mean to say that they should be imitated; but at least they have been falsifying many of the assumptions of men. The Negro women of Africa are not at all ‘timid’. Perhaps there is no such epithet in their language to be applied to them. In Burma, it is the men who appear timid and as it were the weaker sex. Women themselves carry on business of all kinds.
 I raised the problem of thieves, not to frighten you, but to make you think calmly about it. In the Ashram we all wish to realize that we have a ‘soul’. Now the soul is neither male nor female; neither young nor old. The scriptures as well as our own experience tell us that these are the attributes only of the body. The same soul pervades you and me. How then can I protect you ? Is it not by learning the art of how to protect oneself? Only then can I teach you.
 There is enough for you to think over here. If I feel inclined, I will take up the subject once again.
 If any of you wish to write to me, do so without hesitation. I learn that Valjibhai has frightened all of you. Do not get frightened.

  CHI. MATHURADAS,  	I have been wanting to write to you for a good many days, but can do 	so only now. Hardly a day passes when I do not talk about you or 	think of you.  	You had asked Pyarelal to find out about Nandi. In my opinion Nandi 	will not suit you. It is not a place where you can stay through- out 	the year. The weather changes greatly within 24 hours. And the 	variations are too great in winter and summer. All provisions have 	to be secured from the plains. The season is over by June. So I 	think only Panchgani would suit you.  	It is another question how long we should occupy the bungalow at 	Panchgani. This season is already past. So it is all right to spend 	the monsoon there. Then perhaps it will be better for you to go to 	Mahabaleshwar. From October onwards the weather there is said to be    
 very good. If we have to undergo the same sort of thing next year also we have time enough to decide what to do.
 Revashankarbhai lives in Solan. I have asked him to let me know how things are there.
 My health is gradually improving. Hence there is nothing to write on that score.
 I can see that Taramati will not write unless she is provoked. Tell her in my opinion she is lazy. I want her fully to benefit physically, mentally and spiritually by her stay at Panchgani. Dilip appears to be deriving the fullest benefit from staying there.
 This morning Pyarelal started out on his way to join you. I now have your wire, and so I have sent a telegram to Pyarelal at Bangalore to stop him.
 From your letter it appears that I alone was responsible for detaining Pyarelal. I wanted to keep him with me for a few days. After your telegram yesterday he asked my permission to leave and I gave the permission.
Now I will wait for your letter. And I will do whatever is proper.
 You had wished that I should stay at Panchgani. But that was not possible. Work demanded that 1 should be in this province. Once my health is normal I shall certainly finish the work. True, it will be done in a somewhat novel manner.
Are you reading anything?

   MAN’S INHUMANITY TO MAN  
 In another column will be seen an extract from Navajivan of a most disgraceful case of calculated inhumanity of a medical man towards the dying wife of a member of the suppressed class in Kathiawar village. Sjt. Amritlal Thakkar who is responsible for giving the details of the case has withheld the names of the place and parties for fear of the poor suppressed class schoolmaster being further molested by the medical man. I wish, however, that the names will be disclosed. Time must come when the suppressed class people will have
 
 to be encouraged by us to dare to suffer further  hardships and tyranny. Their sufferings are already too great for any further sufferings to be really felt. Public opinion cannot be roused over grievances that cannot be verified and traced to their sources. I do not know the rules of the Medical Council in Bombay. I know that in other places a medical practitioner, who refused to attend before his fees were paid, would be answerable to the Council and would be liable to have his name removed from the Council’s list and be otherwise subject to disciplinary action. Fees are no doubt exactable; but proper attendance upon patients is the first duty of a medical practitioner. The real inhumanity, however, if the facts stated are true, consists in the practitioner refusing to enter the untouchable’s quarters, refusing himself to see the patient, and refusing himself to apply the thermometer. And if the doctrine of untouchability can ever be applied in any circumstances, it is certainly applicable to this member of the profession which he has disgraced. But I am hoping that there is some exaggeration in the statement made by Sjt.  Thakkar’s correspondent and, if there is none, that the medical practitioner will himself come forth and make ample amends to the society which he has so outraged by his inhuman conduct.

     DEAR 	FRIEND,  [Before 	May 7, 1927] 
  	Owing to my sudden illness, I have not been able to reply earlier to 	your letter of the 17th ultimo. The remarks quoted by you and 	ascribed to me in the Minority Reportlibtech_497_footnotelibtech_498_footnote, which of course I have not seen, are substantially 	correct but they have been torn from their context. In the speech, 	the report of which I have not read, from which I suppose the 	remarks quoted by you have been taken, I was drawing a distinction 	between Ayurveda and Ayurvedic physicians of today and I do hold the 	opinion that they do not do justice to the profession they seek to 	represent. But these remarks should not be  used in support of any 	proposition designed to prevent Government’s assistance being 	given for Ayurveda research. I believe that Ayurveda is a field for 	much research work. For want of research  scholars, unlike Western 	medicine, it has practically come to a standstill.     
 Therefore, I should not discountenance aid being given to Ayurveda research under given circumstances and to honest and industrious  men who love research work and who have the necessary qualifi- cations. I should add that the remarks attributed to me were made at the ceremony of laying the foundation of an Ayurvedic College. Had I been averse to any aid being given to Ayurvedic work, I should certainly have declined to lay the foundation of an Ayurvedic College at Calcutta, to open the Tibbia College in Delhi and very recently, to open an Ayurvedic Hospital at Ahmednagar.

It is therefore 	my constant prayer that one should devote every moment of one’s 	life to service. One can practise it in two ways: first, by reading 	good books and meditating on them; secondly, by constantly engaging 	oneself in altruistic activities.     
 As for asceticism, it is this that weakens our attachment to worldly objects and strengthens our love of things spiritual. One attains asceticism by reasoning, while one succeeds in practising it by persis- tent effort. For this very reason one may describe practice as sustained effort.
 Nikhil still seems to have a weak heart; what, in the opinion of the doctors, is the reason for this?

   COW v. BUFFALO OR COW-CUM-BUFFALO?libtech_504_footnote  
A worker in the cause of cow-protection writes from Konkan:
 In your recent articlelibtech_505_footnotegiving the conditions of cow-protection you said that the question of the protection of the cow should not be mixed up with that of the protection of the buffalo. At the back of this suggestion seems to be the fact that the buffalo bull is not useful for agricultural purposes. But in Konkan he is fairly useful. It is the buffalo bull which draws the municipal refuse carts, which works water pumps and even draws the plough, especially when there is a heavy downpour disabling the bullock and most of the agriculture in Konkan is being done under monsoon conditions. The buffalo bull has therefore his place in Konkan.
 The Konkan cow does not yield more than one pound of milk, whereas the buffalo yields 5 to 10 lb. It may be possible, after systematic breeding, to make the cow yield more and richer milk, but the buffalo needs no special culture at all. Does not therefore the buffalo in Konkan at any rate need as much protection as the cow? Please correct me if I am wrong.
 The buffalo, I admit, has no place on the ghats where the temperature is higher, fields are bigger and water scarce. He needs much water both to drink and bathe in. Konkan is the place for him.
 Your tannery and dairy are for cities. For the villages you must suggest some more practical ways and means. Let every village possess a studbull, maintain him partly from the common fund and partly from contributions from those who make use of him. This can be done everywhere and it will improve the stock. Could you not suggest similar other remedies?
 
 These are appropriate questions. My article was not intended to throw the buffalo by the board, it suggested the stopping of buffalo-breeding in her own interest. In other words it meant freedom of the buffalo from its bondage. We have domesticated the cow for our own uses and therefore it has become part of our religion to protect her. It was my object to show that in trying to breed the buffalo, as we do the cow, we might lose both.
 The Konkan example does not affect my proposition. We must, of course, make use of the existing stock of buffaloes, and let it be done in parts like Konkan. But our duty is clear. We must not increase our responsibility by breeding the buffalo where we can do with the cow alone. We must therefore content ourselves with the use of cow’s milk only. It should not be necessary in a city like Bombay to use buffalo’s milk in preference to cow’s milk. An endeavour should be organized on a large scale to cheapen the supply of pure cow’s milk, and to improve the milk yield of the cow. It is possible too to make cow’s milk richer. All these things have been developed into a science in Europe, especially in Denmark. Cows in those countries yield richer and more milk than our buffaloes. I have heard from vaidyas that buffalo’s milk lacks and can never be made to have the hygenic and health-giving properties that cow’s milk possesses. Pious people have told me that cow’s milk is sattvic (possessing finer qualities) whereas buffalo’s milk is tamasic (gross). I do not know how far this is true. I am trying to ascertain the truth through the proper channel. But it does seem to me, that all that the buffalo can give and even more, the cow also can or can be made to give. If this is true, why should man, having regard to his own needs, make himself  responsible  for breeding the buffalo ? And having regard to the need of the buffalo, why should we needlessly keep her in bondage ? Or to put it more simply, why should we press her into our service?
 The fact that some people make a pecuniary gain out of buffalo-breeding can have no place in this religious discussion in which we have in view the good of all. In thinking solely of the narrow interest of the self or of the moment, we have ruined ourselves, i.e., our country and our religion. We can be a nation, only when we try to think in terms of the wider interests of the country. If we cannot even think in those terms, it is no use talking of religion. From the national point of view, the good of the country is the supreme consideration. From the religious point of view the good of all living
 
 beings from the cow down to the ant is the supreme consideration.libtech_506_footnote
 Let the reader now turn to the table given elsewhere in this issue. The table relates to the income from and expenditure on the cattle maintained at the Satyagraha Ashram. The names are  those  of different cows. The manager in his covering letter says:
 It is by no means the rule that the buffalo yields more than the cow. Some of the cows in the table yield a net profit, some just pay their way and some are boarders. These last we shall prevent from breeding and propose to take light work from them. A sterile cow has already been trained to do some work. The buffalo calves sell cheap, whereas some calves of the cow are worth Rs. 100 each. Two or three have taken the place of the horse with the result that we have dispensed with our horse-carriage.
 The Ashram has decided to have no more buffaloes. We may not draw large deductions from the table, but it is certainly obvious that if the cow is fed properly she compares favourably with the buffalo in her yield, she does not cost more, and her calves are much more useful.
 I propose to publish in Navajivan the results of the further experiments that are being conducted in the Ashram.
 The Konkan friend is not right when he says that the dairy and the tannery are useful only in and for the city, and have no place in the villages. The cow has become a costly proposition even in the villages. It is as essential to keep proper accounts of her yield and to improve her stock and her milk in villages as in cities. And the skinning of dead cattle and the prompt and skilled treatment of the hides is more essential in villages than in cities, and that is the work to be done in tanneries. It is a painful fact that in our present condition we have to cultivate the science of tanning in the cities and then take it to the villages. For one thing it is impossible to conduct big  experiments in the villages, and cattle that are slaughtered in the cities come from the villages. If we can therefore conduct experiments in dairying and tanning from the religious and national point of view in the cities, we can easily give the benefit of them to the villages, and the cattle wealth of India which is at the present day being destroyed because of our ignorance will be saved, and man and animal will both be less unhappy than now.

   WHAT CAN PERSEVERANCE NOT ACHIEVE?  
 In the West we sometimes see a man performing club-swinging continuously for twenty-four hours. These shows are held to demons- trate how far a man’s endurance can go. Thousands of spectators give money and fill the theatres to see that. I have my own doubts whether these kinds of shows are of any use.
 But readers will recall that something like this, though with a different, i. e., religious motive was organized in the Ashram during the National Week. Some youths insisted on plying the charkha continuously for twenty-four hours, forgoing their usual sleep. The letter written by the one who spun the largest quantity of yarn is interesting and, therefore, I give it below:libtech_507_footnote
 Those who welcome any manifestation of enthusiasm by the young or have faith in the charkha yajna will feel happy to read this letter. Those students who happen to read this letter should learn a lesson from it. It is good to have interest in games, but it is better still to have the same interest in philanthropic work. They should also observe that such uninterrupted work is quite within the capacity of those who safeguard their health and observe brahmacharya. It is an abuse of one’s education to use it for earning money. Education proves its worth when used for the service of others. Moreover, a student needs to have faith also. Reason will certainly help a little to understand that India’s poverty can be banished through a simple thing like the charkha. But, in the end, it is only faith which will sustain the student’s love of it. I realize every moment, from what I see of students, that without faith education is of little use.

 Unrevised  Sunday	[May 8, 1927]libtech_508_footnote
 
CHI. MIRA,
 I hope you are getting all the letters I have been writing to you of late. Probably one letter every other day on an average.
 I have your further letter. But I see itlibtech_509_footnotewill be some time before you regain your balance. I do not mind the ups and downs so long as you retain the elasticity. My own opinion is this: it will be perfectly natural for you to come to me wherever I am after finishing your allotted task, whenever that happens. An ordinary person may not give up a self-imposed programme. But if you become highly emotional and your nerves remain under tension, you should come even though your course may not be finished.
 Naturally I am anxious for you to finish your course. I should not like to have to think that it was beyond you. But your health is more precious to me than your studies or any other preparation .
 You must not think of coming to me for my health. For it is good and I cannot be looked after better even if you came. If I  needed your nursing, I should wire for you. But such an event will not happen, if only because I have got into the habit of taking nursing from anybody and I train new nurses to my requirements. There are more nurses than I need here. So if you come in the hope of doing some personal service, you would feel idle and yawning.
 Now for the necessity of personal touch. My own opinion is that it is necessary in the preliminary stages. And then the touch comes through joint work. You come in daily touch with me by doing my work as if it was your own. And this can, must and will outlast the existence of this physical body of mine. You are and will be in touch whether I am alive or dead. And that is what I want you to be. You have come to me not for me but for my ideals in so far as I live them. You now know how far I live the ideals I set forth. It is now for you to work out those ideals and practise them to greater perfection than has been given to me to do. He or she who does that will be my first heir
 
 and representative. I want you to be the first if only because you studied me from a distance and made your choice. And when in the course of the work, God brings us physically together, it is well, but it is well also when he keeps us apart in pursuance of the common object.
 But this is counsel of perfection. Having listened to it and understood it, you are free to do as you choose. If you cannot contain yourself, you must come and not feel that I shall be displeased. I should be displeased if you did violence to yourself and became prostrate.
With love,

             DEAR 	FRIEND,    LETTER TO GANGARAM    NANDI 	HILLS 	(MYSORE STATE),  May 	8, 1927 
  	I got your letter too late to enable me to write to you so as to 	reach you. It was impossible for me to travel to Bombay because 	medical orders are peremptory—as peremptory as your own —and 	seeing that the medical orders were prior in point of time, they had 	to be obeyed.  	I have really begun now to despair of your ever teaching me. You 	promised to turn my Ashram ground into a paradise if I sent you  a 	map and all the details of past successes and failures. Well, I have 	given you all the information, I sent you my best man and the Ashram 	ground still awaits the magic touch. All the information about the 	poverty of the masses that you can give me can never be first hand 	because all you can tell me is stories of witnesses. You have not 	tasted the sweets of poverty. And, what is a millionaire, a 	successful engineer and a business man to teach one who knows the 	sweet, as well as the bitter, of poverty and who has come in direct 	touch with the masses about the latter’s poverty? Thirdly—but I 	must not  say  anything about the third thing at the present moment.  	Your connecting my bad health with a breach of promise which I never 	made to you or to anybody is in keeping with your lavishness 
 in promising a poor man like me all kinds of El Dorado. I am not aware of having made you any promise that I shall never take part in politics and what is more, I have not taken part in politics as yet. But I do promise that if favourable opportunity occurs, I should not hesitate to plunge into them. For the present I am content to sit at the wheel and sing the praises of God in that He gives me strength enough to perform that little bit of service to the masses of India in whose exploitation you are taking such a prominent part be it ever so unconsciously.
 I do not expect any reply to this letter whilst you are in the West. When you do come to India I shall be glad to receive a further instalment of your promises with the certain knowledge that you will continue to break them as heretofore and like the wolf that swore at the lamb turn against me and accuse me of breaking promises never made by me. I shall take all such rebuke in good grace as in spite of your arrogation of universal knowledge, I have great regard for the qualities of your heart.

 DEAR FRIEND,
I thank you for your letter of the 4th April last.
 When the interim volume is published, I shall see that no efforts are made to obtain orders outside of India.
 I am unable to tell you when the autobiography will be finished.  I have to write from day to day. I have mapped out no fixed plan. I write every week as the past events develop in my mind on the day allotted for writing the weekly chapter. I am now dealing with events of 1903-4 and I have to cover the stormy period in South Africa extending to the middle of 1914 and the equally stormy 12 years of
 
 India. If therefore there is really any demand for these chapters in America or Europe, it will be advisable to publish them in volumes as they are being published here. If the MacMillan Company do not propose to publish the autobiography in instalments, it will be impossible to prevent sales outside India assuming of course that there is a natural as distinguished from stimulated desire in the West for reading these chapters.
 Yours sincerely,

 Sunday [May 8, 1927]libtech_511_footnote
 CHI. MATHURADAS,
 Pyarelal is on his way to join you. You will receive this letter the day offer his arrival. I could not send the letter with him. I have sent Pyarelal because he felt that he had got to go back there for accounts, etc. Your decision to carry on without him is fine if it does not mean any harm to your health. We must be grateful that your health has improved to that extent. But do not hesitate to write to me any time you feel the need for help. I think it would be good to spend the present monsoon there. Panchgani is definitely better than Deolali. It is said to be particularly good in the rainy season. It would be all right spending the winter near Bombay after you have fully recovered. But the doctors would know better.
You must have received my previous letter.

 Monday [May 9, 1927]libtech_512_footnote
 
CHI. MIRA,
 I had two letters again. How is it that letters bearing different dates are received the same day in different packets ?
 I have nothing more to say today. I am glad you  have completely regained your balance.
 My idea about the translation is that you should make it at first without reference to any other translation and then for your difficul- ties turn to the English version. It is right for you to be diffident but I have no misgivings and I do not want you to lose your originality by concurrent reference to any aid save that of a dictionary. Mark the passages you may not understand and refer to the other translations subsequently as I am doing with the Gita.
 What has brought Valunjker and Gangubai? Remember me to them. I am glad for your sake that they are there. With love,
 Yours
 BAPU

   LETTER TO ANASUYABEHN SARABHAI  
 [Before May 10, 1927]libtech_513_footnote
 CHI. ANASUYABEHN,
 I have your letter. Stop worrying about me. I am improving in health. I shall stay in Nandi Durg as long as the doctors consider it necessary. Afterwards I shall go to Bangalore because in June Nandi is quite cold, while Bangalore is moderately so. Left to myself I do not want to travel. But when it cools down a little and when I have improved my health, I should like to stay quietly in two or three places in Madras and Karnataka in order to collect funds. No one sees any harm in short comfortable journeys in which I do not have to address people. I have consulted many doctors but no one imposes restrictions such as those you suggest. And if I may not speak, may not think and may not do anything at all, then for what purpose do you intend to save my life? I have not so far developped such powers that I can lie in bed and serve by sheer silent thought. Asking me to care for my health much more than the others generally do amounts to misusing me. Dr. Mehta has not forbidden me from writing for Young India and Navajivan. The only thing that everyone says is that  I should not work at the same tempo as before. And I cannot do that. Certainly, I must do as much as I comfortably can. What is more, Dr. Mehta believes that if I do not work as much as I can, I shall be completely bed-ridden.
 It is because of this I wish that none of you should worry too much about me. I shall write to Panditji about Saklatwala. What is his address in England?

 If we are not financially strong enough to provide money to Fulchand for the conference, write to him frankly to that effect. Tell Vallabhbhai to give him a loan if it is possible and make sure that he accepts the loan only if he is capable of repaying it.
 The documents are to be given to Ramachandra as they are. They are to be given to him only to fulfil his requirements. I believe it is necessary to pay off the debts due to West. We have to write to him that the debts will be paid off gradually as the goods are sold. How can Ramachandra himself pay? The right over the patent is ours. I have understood the dealing to be his way that we have to deal with the situation if West claims money from Ramachandra. I have accordingly convinced Ramachandra. If you want me to write to him to this effect, I will do so
I have a letter from Shankerlal about handing over the charge to
 
 
 Jamnalal. I will take action on it immediately. Do not hesitate in the least to write to me or ask me anything. My health is no doubt good.

              DEAR 	FRIEND,    LETTER TO SHAPURJI SAKLATVALA    NANDI 	HILLS 	(MYSORE STATE),  May 	10, 1927 
  	Shrimati Anasuyabai has sent me your letter herself and your joint  	letter  to  her,  Gulzarilallibtech_516_footnoteand   Desai.   I   have   read   them   both 	carefully. I had your own letter also. I could not reply to you 	earlier for want of your address.  	As soon as I heard from Anasuyabai, I put myself in Communi- cation 	with Motilalji. I am daily expecting his reply. You shall know it as 	soon as I receive it. I thank you for the confidence you repose in 	me and it will be a joy to me if I can render any personal service 	to you; but I am afraid my longing and ability to render service 	have to stop there.  	So  far  as  our  ideals  are  concerned,   we  stand   apart.libtech_517_footnoteWhilst Anasuyabai and Banker as also Gulzarilal 	and Desai are absolutely free agents, they have exercised their 	choice of accepting my guida- nce in framing their labour policy and 	administration. I must there- fore shoulder my share of the 	responsibility for what is happening about labour in Ahmedabad. I 	have certainly advised them to keep Ahmedabad labour aloof from the 	other labour movements in India so long as Ahmedabad labour chooses 	to remain under their guid- ance. My reason is exceedingly simple. 	Labour in India is still extre- mely unorganized. The labourers have 	no mind of their own, when it comes to matters of national policy or 	even the general welfare of labour itself. Labourers in various 	parts of India have  no  social contact and no other mutual ties. It 	is provincial and even in the same city it is highly communal. It is 	not everywhere wisely guided. In     
 many places it is under selfish and highly unscrupulous guidance. There is no absolute cohesion amongst provincial labour leaders, and there is little discipline among sub-leaders. The latter do not unifor- mly tender obedience to their provincial chiefs. Leaders in different provinces have no single policy to follow. In these circumstances, an all India union can only exist on paper. I hold it to be  suicidal therefore for Ahmedabad to think of belonging to it. My own conviction is that Ahmedabad is rendering a service to labour all over India by its abstention, or as I call it self-restraint. If it can succeed in perfecting its own organization, it is bound to serve as a model to the rest of India and its success is bound to prove highly infectious. But I am free to confess that there is as yet no assurance of success in the near future. The energy of the workers is sorely tried in combating disruptive forces that ever continue to crop up. There is the Hindu- Muslim tension; there is the question of touchables and untouchables in Hinduism, etc. Add to this extreme ignorance and  selfishness  among the labourers themselves. It is a marvel to me that labour in Ahmedabad has made the progress it has during the last 12 years of its corporate existence. If then Ahmedabad remains isolated it does so not selfishly, but for the sake of labour as a whole.
 One word as to the policy. It is not anti-capitalistic. The idea is to take from capital labour's due share and no more, and this not by paralysing capital but by reform among labourers from within and by their own self-consciousness; not again through the cleverness and manoeuvring of non-labour leaders, but by educating labour to evolve its own leadership and its own self-reliant, self-existing organization. Its direct aim is not in the least degree political. Its direct aim is internal reform and evolution of internal strength. The indirect result of this evolution, when, if ever it becomes complete, will naturally be tremendously political. I have not therefore the remotest idea of exploiting labour or organizing it for any direct political end. It will be of itself a political power of first-class importance when it becomes  a self-existing unit. Labour, in my opinion, must not become a pawn in the hands of the politicians on the political chess-board. It must by its sheer strength dominate the chessboard. And that can only happen if I can retain the intelligent and voluntary co-operation of the  workers in Ahmedabad and if our joint effort ultimately succeeds. This is my dream. I hug it because it gives me all the consolation I
 
 need; and the policy I have outlined, you will recognize, is a direct outcome of my implicit belief in and acceptance of non-violence. It may be all a delusion; but it is as much a reality with me as life itself so long as I do not see it as delusion but see it as the only life-giving force. You will now see why I cannot, even if I had the power, respond to your appeal for dividing the funds collected by me in accordance with your suggestion. But I may tell you that I have not even the power. The funds have been collected purely for khadi work and it would be criminal misappropriation on may part to divert them to any other use.
 This letter may not please you. I shall be sorry if it does not. But I regard you as a fellow-seeker after Truth and if my reading of you is correct, there is no reason why my having told you the whole truth and nothing but the truth should not please you immensely. It is not given to all of us to agree with one another on all our opinions; but it is given to every one of us to tender the same respect for the opinions and actions of our fellows as we expect for our own.
 Yours sincerely

For the present, it is enough 	if you try to forget that you are “weak”. You should on no 	account make the mistake of taking me to mean that men should give 	up their duty of protecting [women] . Because woman tries to come 	into her own, man should not think that she has already become 	capable of protecting herself; a man, who by thinking so, fails to 	protect women, is nothing but a shameless coward. He may be  	regarded as less than a man. Man has kept woman in subordination and 	in a state of dependence; so it is his duty to protect her. We are 	trying in the Ashram to make both men and women vigilant and 	self-reliant. But our goal is still far off. Till then my trying to 	awaken and put courage into your heart is one thing and men’s duty 	towards you is another thing.

   LETTER TO FULCHAND K. SHAH  
 Wednesday, May 11, 1927 I have your letter. It is not satyagraha in the true sense of the  word if people outside the State of Gondal agitate against the ban on
entry  of  newspapers  into  the  State.   People   not   belonging   to  the
 Gondal State can offer satyagraha there only when the cause  of Gondal subjects is common to all the States and if success in the Gondal case would mean an improvement in all the other States. Moreover offering satyagraha against a ban on entry of journals is like killing a buffalo for the sake of a thong or like citing scriptures for eating carrots while swallowing whole camels. Even if the satyagraha in Gondal is to be offered by the State subjects they ought to have a stronger reason.
 The Wadhwan well case is slightly stronger no doubt, but before you take it up you should be prepared to bear the loss of the school. You should try some preliminary remedies, e.g., you should carry on negotiations, bring in the good offices of intermediaries, give the matter sufficient publicity. You ought to prove that the ban is due solely to ill will. In short, a satyagrahi’s case has to be self-proven. If there is any scope for doubt, if the other party has anything to say, a satyagrahi should hold his patience for the nonce. If you look at all the occasions when I had offered satyagraha you will be able to see this condition as well as others.
 You have rightly laid down the limit that satyagraha cannot be offered without my permission. Observe this limit steadfastly, and obtain my written approval before starting anything. This will be good for you and the principle of satyagraha will not be compromised by your action.

   NOTES  
 
EVILS OF MACHINE-MILLING
 Mr. Andrews, who is working himself almost to death in the interest of the Indian settlers of South Africa, cannot forget things that he has at heart in India itself. Having read Mahadev Desai’s account of the Bihar tour, he cabled some time ago:
 Tell Mahadev delighted accounts Bihar tour. Give love Rajendraprasad. Sug- gest your emphasizing hand-milling. Have witnessed evils rice mills, inclu- ding destruction of vitamins. Warn public against unauthorized cables from South Africa.
 The reader can see that the foregoing cablegram was sent in order that I may warn the public against accepting everything that comes from South Africa, unless it bears Andrews’s own hallmark. But I hardly think that the caution is required. Naturally the public here will discount anything sensational that may come from South Africa, unless it is duly countersigned. But let us hope that the Rt. Hon’ble Srinivasa Sastri will soon be on his way to South Africa, when all cause for alarm or anxiety will be set at rest. Without, therefore, dilating upon the South African part of the cable, I return to the rice mills, whose evils have distressed him so much as to prompt  the cabling of his opinion. The reader will appreciate Andrews’s anxiety when I inform him that he has to live whilst in India in the midst of rice mills. For whereas when he first went to Shantiniketan near Bolepur, there was no rice mill in Bolepur, at the present moment several such mills are working in that once quiet place. He often spoke to me about the din, the dust and the smoke and the fraudulent trafficking that has been going on in Bolepur since the advent of rice mills, and spoke also of the deprivation of a useful cottage industry by reason of the installation of these mills. There can be no doubt that hand-husked rice is infinitely superior to mill-husked rice. Medical men can, however, speak on the evil with greater authority than I can. The moral evil of those mills stares one in the face, as soon as one goes to places where these mills have found a place. In spite, however, of my knowledge of the evil of this growing destruction of cottage industries, had I not been bed-ridden, I should not have undertaken the task that Andrews out of his good nature and out  of  the  abundance of love that he has for India suggests that I should do. For
 I regard myself as an economical worker, fully cognizant of my own limitations. In trying to revive hand-spinning I feel that I am touching the root of the evil, that it is enough to occupy all my energy, and that if that movement becomes successful, as I am daily becoming more and more convinced that it will, the undulated evils of rice mills, to which Andrews draws attention, and others which can be named will automatically disappear. Let us not make the mistake of thinking that what has happened in India about the spinning-wheel, and what is now happening about other cottage industries, such as hand-milling of rice, need cause no harm to national life, because such things have  happened in the West without the West having come to grief. In the first place it is yet too early to say positively that the destruction of village life in the West has been either a benefit to it, or to mankind in general. In the second place, and this is more pertinent, assuming that the new life that has come into being in the West is calculated to benefit mankind, let us understand that whereas in the West  the villagers whose industry was destroyed readily found another occupation, and were, therefore, somehow provided, with us only an infinitesimal portion of those whom the erection of these mills deprives of their occupation is otherwise provided, and that the vast majority are left idle and penniless. Let not the reader also rush to the conclusion that the hand-spinning movement is an indiscriminate onslaught upon machinery. This movement is intended to displace only such machinery worked by power as is harmful to the moral and material welfare of the starving millions. The fact is that we are too much obsessed by the glamour of the West, and the ready-made literature that is poured down upon us from week to week. We forget that what may be perfectly good for certain conditions in the West is not necessarily good for certain other, and often diametrically opposite, conditions in the East. Free Trade which may have been good enough for England would certainly have ruined Germany. Germany prospered, only because her thinkers, instead of slavishly following England, took note of the special conditions of their own land, and devised economics suited to them. And both England and Germany will have to revise their policy in economics immediatelythe nations that are now being exploited by them come to their own, and refuse to be exploited. The civilization of both is based upon the exploitation of other lands. Let us remember that even if we have desire, we have not the power to exploit any single nation on earth.
 Hence if we are to live as an independent nation, we must evolve economics and conditions suited to our growth.
 MOST ECONOMICAL
 A friend, who fell ill about the same time as I became incapa- citated, writing out of sympathy, and herself in search of it, says in her letter:
 I had time to philosophize and there was one thought I was working at ever since I lost my voice. And I have discovered that there is no necessity for living, and that Fate in giving us death early is most economical. For thereby she economizes the power that abides in us whereas we waste it by living when living becomes manifestly unnecessary. I spun the thought out until I felt exhausted, and I said to myself, “After all what is the good? The call somehow or other has not come. And so I must be wasted till there is nothing more left to be wasted.’’libtech_522_footnote
 What a comforting thought it is to think of death, whenever it comes, as a wise plan in the economy of Nature? If we could realize this law of our being and be prepared for death as a welcome friend and deliverer, we should cease to engage in the frantic struggle for life. We shall cease to want to live at the cost of other lives and in contempt of all considerations of humanity. But to philosophize, as this friend has done, is one thing; to realize at the required moment the truth of the philosophy is totally another. Such realization is impossible without a due conception of the definite and grave limitations of the body and an abiding faith in God and His unchangeable Law of Karma.
 Young India, 12-5-1927
 
   YOUNG AT 75  
An English friend writes:
 I want just to tell you of a letter and photographs I have had from a dear old Swiss peasant woman of over 70, who spins and weaves away up in the mountains above Villeneuve. She writes in answer to letters that she has had of mine, and then she says (in French dialect),
 “We are commencing the winter and the snows are coming down to keep us company for many months. I shall have plenty of time to occupy myself with my loom. And I have now got an order for two pieces at 59 metres,
 
 so I shall need the time, as I get tired easily in these days” (at 75 years old!). Her life is a perfect example of the full, yet peaceful and contented existence, which should be the lot of all peasantry. In the summer she works in the fields, with just a few odd hours of spinning and weaving put in here and there when the days are wet, and in the winter when the land is under snow, she works away at her wheel and her loom all day. Take this hand industry away from her, and she would be lost in complete misery. As it is, she is the happiest and sweetest-natured person on the mountainside. Why? Because she alone, of all the peasants in that place, has retained the old industry, and she alone has a full and true life. I enclose you one of the little photographs which shows her sitting on a log of wood caressing one of her goats, which may give you some slight idea of her dear old face. The younger woman is her daughter-in-law.
 I have the beautiful photograph which I am unable to reproduce in Young India, but the imaginative reader will have no difficulty in filling in the picture. The point of the letter however is that even in that machine-ridden country, there are people who find their true peace in this, at one time universal, home industry of the wheel and the loom. And if this old woman, who for her industry is young at 75, finds her solace, not her livelihood, in the wheel and the loom, how much greater is their need in this land where very few women reach the age of 75, where the majority needlessly are old at 50, and where millions of women need not merely the solace of an innocent cottage industry to occupy their idle hours but who need it even more to keep the wolf from the door?
 ‘If that is so, why do not the millions take to the home industry, even as the dear old Swiss sister does, and find from it their solace and their food? What is there to prevent them from doing so?,’ asks the ignorant scoffer. But somewhat similar was the question put by a burly, rough-looking Englishman to Surendranath Bannerjea in 1889 or 1890 when he was haranguing an English audience. This worthy member of the firm of John Bull and Company asked the then uncrowned king of Bengal, if what the latter said was true that India desired freedom, what prevented her from taking it, how was it that they, members of this numerous and powerful firm, never heard of breaking of window-panes, let alone heads, as they the members were wont to do when they could not get what they wanted? So far as my memory serves me right, the papers recorded no answer from the orator. There was only a ‘hear, hear’ from the audience. But what the honest Englishman said to Surendranath may be safely repeated even today, and we know that such a question will be no answer to the cry
 
 for freedom. We may not know how to win it. Knowing the way we may not have the power or the will to adopt it. Nevertheless the cry for freedom is both just and natural. Be it ever so ineffective, it is the first step to freedom.
 In the instance of the starving millions the scoffers forget in their ignorance that the millions have not even the wish to cry out for work or bread. Hence we join the English historian in calling them “dumb millions”. We (including the scoffers) have to be their voice. We have to teach the dumb millions the first lesson. We, not they, are responsible for their awful poverty and ignorance. They don’t know what they want or need. They are living corpses.
 Who shall dare say to the untouchables that if they want their freedom, who prevents them from taking it? God is long-suffering and patient. He lets the tyrant dig his own grave, only issuing grave warnings at stated intervals.
 We would say, and justly, that though the taunt of the English- man could be theoretically justified, it would ill become Englishmen to beg the question in that manner, when anyone of us, though feeling helpless, is yet expressing the natural desire for freedom. So will it ill become us, middle-class men and women, to hurl the taunt put by me in the mouth of the imaginary scoffer in answer to the crying need of the millions—a need which they may not even feel but which a few of us feel for them. The way to answer the need is to  multiply  the number of such representatives who would not only be the mouth-piece of the dumb millions but would adopt corresponding measures by themselves taking up the wheel, by throwing  away  foreign fineries, by wearing khadi and by not resting till every idle hour of the nation is usefully occupied. Then, but not till then, shall India’s women be young, happy and godfearing at 75, even as the Swiss sister of 75 is represented to be.

   FOR SUBSCRIBERS, SOUTH INDIA FLOOD RELIEF  
 The following letterlibtech_523_footnotewas received by me last year, and has been lying with me ever since. One of the signatories Diwan Bahadur M. O. Parthasarathi Aiyengar unfortunately died sometime after signing the
 
 letter. The contents of the letter and the distinguished nameslibtech_524_footnotelibtech_525_footnoteattached to it speak for themselves. I heartily endorse the appeallibtech_526_footnotelibtech_527_footnote. But before I can formally give effect to it, it is necessary to ascertain the wishes of the donors. In answer to the appeal issued in these columns and Navajivan, some sent their donations to the Satyagraha Ashram, some to the Navajivan, office, and some to the office of the Gujarat Provincial Congress Committee. The funds were sent from time to time to Sjt. Rajagopalachari upon requisition. Audited accounts were published by him in the papers. The catastrophe was so sudden that it appealed to the imagination of the philanthropic public and a liberal response was made to the various appeals that were issued. The result was that practically everywhere there was a surplus. The agencies created were unable to spend the full amount with due regard to the proper discharge of their duties. As the signatories to the following letter inform me, the other agencies have disposed of the surplus in some beneficial manner or other. I have not been in a hurry to use up the surplus of the amounts received in answer to the appeal made in these columns. It is deposited in banks and is bearing interest. India is unfortunately a land of almost perpetual famines, and the  chief activity of the All-India Spinners’ Association at the present moment is directly to deal with such causes of famine as are within the power of man to control. Man cannot control and regulate floods beyond a certain limit. They will take their toll in spite of the exercise of all the ingenuity that man may be capable of. But floods always leave a legacy behind, which man can and is bound to deal with. In a similar manner man cannot bring water beyond a certain point when the rains fail. But man can produce conditions whereby people who are willing to work can find work enough to buy food with, when Nature leaves enough scope for transferring grain from one place to another. It is exactly these causes that the All-India Spinners’ Association is endeavouring in a humble manner to deal with through its growing army of workers. The method adopted is to establish spinning centres in places where there is the greatest need for work during off-seasons. The largest amount of such work is being done, as is now well known, in South India. And the letter I have reproduced is a recommendation
 
 
 for the use of this surplus of the Flood Relief Fund through this agency. When I made an appeal for directing the funds for use in Orissa, no subscriber objected and several wrote to me approving of the suggestion. I now invite the subscribers, if they wish, to signify their own opinion. In the absence of any opinion to the contrary from them within a fortnight of the publication of this note, I propose to utilize the surplus in the manner suggested by the distinguished signa- tories. Needless to say I have consulted all my co-workers, and they approve of the suggestion.

   THE SKELETONS OF ORISSA  
 According to my theory, if khadi work cannot be  made  a success in Utkal, it cannot be made a success anywhere. Yet, strange though it may appear, nowhere have the khadi workers experienced a greater difficulty in organizing hand-spinning than there. The eyes of the living skeletons of Utkal are unlit by a single ray of hope. What interest can the means of livelihood have for one who has despaired of life itself? Those who have taken to spinning in Utkal are men who still retain some hope of life, The khadi worker there has not yet been able to touch the vast majority who have lost all hope. The people are dying under our very eyes. We could see it clearly if only we had the eyes to see. We would then take up spinning for sacrifice and give away all our hoarded money for khadi work, or in case we had none, we would cut down our luxuries and superfluous expense and devote the savings to the same end.
 It is only if we ourselves spin that we will be able to create the spinning atmosphere necessary to quicken these skeletons to life. But a spinning atmosphere by itself cannot do more than merely touch the fringe of the problem. Progress depends upon funds. No yajna can be complete without  dakshinalibtech_528_footnotelibtech_529_footnote.  And it is clear to me   as  daylight  that spinning is the one true yajna today and to contribute funds for its advancement is the only dakshina. For those who have not yet
 
 realized this simple truth, the following letterlibtech_530_footnotewill serve as an eye- opener.

   LETTER TO MIRABEHN  
 May 12, 1927
 
 CHI. MIRA,
 Again I have your two letters delivered the same day. I am so glad you seem to have settled down. But whenever you feel unsettled, you will not hesitate to tell me about it, as you now know from experience that I shall be patient. I am most anxious that you should not appear to be what you are not. I must take you as you are and help you to be what you should be. That I can only do if I give you no cause to fear me. That is why I told you once I wanted to be not merely in the place of father but mother also to you.
 You will not leave the D.C. alone so long as he entertains your letter. Answer politely all his doubts and queries. Tell him if you know the difference between the Persian wheel which we have and the Ramachandra lift as also why spinning is not merely one of the industries but is the key industry of the nation.
 There seems to be still some misunderstanding about  my coming there. I am anxious to be there for two reasons. I want to see the place about which I have heard so much and I want to be with you. But the time I do not know. I am not likely to leave the South yet for four months, I fear. But it is no use forecasting events. I[t] should be enough for me to be able to say that I long to be there just as much as I long to be at Sabarmati. Please gently tell Krishnanandji this thing.libtech_531_footnote
 Let Valunjker write to me. You should get hold of the correct spelling of his name. Let him write it [in] the Hindi character. Are they making a long stay there?
 
 I am well.
 With love,

 BAPU
    NANDI 	HILLS 	(NEAR BANGALORE),  May 	13, 1927  LOWER 	HOUSE,  	As I lie in bed and look up old undisposed of correspondence and 	revive old and sacred memories, I chance upon your letter of 27th 	February sent with Andrews’s letter from your home at Inanda, and 	I revive so many pleasant and sacred memories. Every letter that you 	have written during the last two years—and you have not written 	many—has been a despondent letter, distrustful of yourself; but as 	long as I live I am not going to lose faith in you. I am hoping that 	some day as before you will have a fatigue of the exciting things 	that give you momentary pleasure and that you will at least come to 	India to meet an old friend and renew many old acquaintances. You 	have made a provisional promise to do so next September or October. 	Do come if you can and then stay as long as you like or as little as 	you like.  	I am glad you are having short spells of Andrews’s company. I have 	not come across a humbler or more godfearing man throughout my 	varied experience.  	You don’t want me to say anything about my illness; because I see 	you do get Young India and read it. I am at the present 	moment taking my cure in a little hill in the State of Mysore where 	an army of devoted volunteers and many of my closest co-workers are 	looking after me. Mrs. Gandhi and Devdas are with me. The names of 	others would mean nothing to you. So I do not give them. But when 	you do come, you will see them all and recognize them as having been 	with me on this hill. This 	loss of strength came in the twinkling of an eye. Latterly I 
 had put such terrific strain upon the brain that I was afraid of a crisis and it came just when I was arranging to have a lighter programme. But God seemed to say, ‘I shall demolish your pride before you recognize your mad method and show you that you were utterly wrong in rushing as you have been doing, thinking that it was all well because it was for a good cause. You fool, you thought that you would work wonders. Have your lesson now and learn whilst there is yet time that God alone is to wonder-work and He uses whom He pleases as His instrument.’ I am taking the chastisement I hope in due humility and if He raises me from this sick-bed, I am making Him promises that I shall reform my ways and shall seek still more strenuously to know His will and do it.
 I hope you are keeping in touch with Manilal. He has got a girl with a strong character as his wife. She is the best girl I could possibly have found for him. Chance put her my way. She belongs to a godly family. Remember you are one of the trustees for Phœnix and I look to you to discharge your trust.
 Sastri will be in South Africa probably within a month of your receipt of this. I have had long chats with him about you and your associations with Gokhale. Do try to be close to him and bring all our old companions in touch with him.
 Yours sincerely,

  	I have your letter for which I thank you. I did receive the cable- 	gram from the Chinese Students’ Association and whilst I was 	touring in Bihar.

   LETTER TO H. CLAYTON  
 
 NANDI HILLS,
 May 13, 1927
 DEAR MR. CLAYTON,
 Mr. A. V. Thakkar of the Servants of India Society has sent me a cutting from The Times of India of the 4th instant containing the report of a debate in the Corporation in which you are reported to have said in reference to Mr. Thakkar’s investigation as follows:
 Proceeding, the Commissioner said he was not going into the question of general administration. Mr. Horniman had referred to the investigations of Mr. Thakkar. Now, he (the speaker) had great admiration for Mr. Thakkar. During the last ten years every opportunity was given to that gentleman to make inquiries and once in conjunction with Mr. Gandhi. The result was that Mr. Gandhi reported that the class of witnesses was so unreliable that he could not believe one single allegation made by them !
 I shall be glad if you will kindly tell me whether you  are  reported correctly, and I shall thank you if you will kindly let me have a copy of the report which I am said to have made. I do remember an interview or interviews with the late Mr. Turner in connection with the complaints of Bhangis. But I have no recollection of my having made either in conjunction with Mr. Thakkar or otherwise any enquiry of the type suggested in the paragraphs quoted above.
 I must thank you for the kind enquiries that you made about me
 when Dr. Mehta visited me at Amboli. As you know I am now taking my rest at the above hill which is a higher elevation than Amboli, therefore cooler.

         MY 	DEAR GOVIND,  NANDI HILLS,  May 	13, 1927 
  	I have your typed letter. Though typewritten letters are undoubtedly 	easier to read, I have still a weakness for hand written letters. 	This however does not mean that I want you to write to me in your 	own hand. Your typewritten letters are quite as welcome as the 	handwritten ones and for the time being I have myself mostly to rely 	upon shorthand and the typewriter.  	I have not yet got the book on vitamins. If you had given me the 	name of the book and the author, I would have tried to procure it in 	Bangalore which I am sure has very good bookshops.  	I shall look forward to your manuscript on khadi. I  won’t discuss 	now the theory you have sketched in your letter.  	Almonds I treated in two ways. I had them roasted and pounded 	through a nutmill into pulp and took this in the shape of butter. I 	had them also soaked overnight in water, the skin was removed and 	then it was pounded very fine, mixed with water and turned into 	milk. This milk was warmed and raised to boiling point and then 	eaten. Even this I could not digest. This was however now nearly 	eight or nine years ago—after the attack of dysentery. I have not 	dared to try the experiment again and after taking to goat’s milk. 	But I should gladly make the experiment on my own responsibility if 	I had no other 
 undertakings and should try it in spite of the  other  undertakings under skilled supervision.
With love to you all,

  	I have your letter. You both did well to volunteer your services for 	patrolling the Ashram at night. I wish you did it to the full extent 	of your physical capacity (even if as assistants to some other 	person). Fear is a mere figment of our imagination; there is nothing 	real about it. It vanishes as a result of facing it often enough and 	by the grace of God. When the thieves realize that even our paid 	watchman will not beat them up but would suffer beating at their 	hands and that the volunteers belong to a different class altogether 	and are ordinary householders, they will cease to trouble the Ashram 	folk. I am sure that someone of you will employ soul-force some day 	and win them over by love. But there is no doubt that this is like 	placing one’s hand in a pit occupied by a snake. Someone will be 	beaten up or even killed. What man is there who is not afflicted by 	disease? Men, women and children, all fall a victim to it. How often 	was Radha knocked down? What happened to Rukhi? How many girls were 	taken to the Hospital at Juhu? If we can stand it, why should we not 	also take a beating from thieves and others, with courage? This idea 	may be strange for those who expect to be protected by the police 	but not for us at the Ashram.  	I received the slivers prepared by you just as I was spinning and 	tried them at once. The thread did not break even once, and today I 	have found out a way to determine the strength just by myself and no 	sliver has yet given me a thread comparable to that from you. I have 	come across no sliver better than yours. Equally good slivers might 	have come my way only once or twice before. But I do not think    
 anybody can make better slivers than yours. Indeed after once having tried my hand at yours, it may be difficult to spin with any other. I wish and hope that you will be first in the first class in writing a good hand and in spinning as well as carding.
 I had a letter from Karachi yesterday.  Your  appointment appears to have been delayed on account of Narandas’s absence. So they have asked for a month’s time. I wrote that if they really wanted you, I would wait for a month longer, but they should do nothing just by way of courtesy or just to get you there, i.e., merely to oblige us. I also asked for a reply by wire. I would like you to go only to a place where you are really wanted; only this would be seemly. We are in no hurry. Meanwhile you have to become perfect in every department of your studies.

 Vaishakha Sud 12 [May 13, 1927]libtech_536_footnote
 BHAISHRI JETHALAL,
 I have your letter. If you persevere, you will succeed in your efforts. In this age such efforts do not bear quick fruit, but hereafter you must observe this one rule. Whatever the vow, once you take it, you must keep it. You may pile up all the barricades you need for safeguarding [your vow] and for protecting yourself [against breach]; one of the essential and fundamental safeguards is this. During the period of your vow, the two of you should live absolutely apart from each other and under no circumstances allow yourself any privacy. If you have neither the inclination nor the strength to keep a vow, you may not take it, but having taken once you must-abide by  the necessary conditions. You should go through Pandit Satavalekar’s book on brahmacharya. His address is Oundh (District Satara). A copy of the book has already come to the Ashram, from where you
 
 can borrow it for reading.

        LETTER T0 MOTILAL NEHRU      NANDI HILLS,  May 	14, 1927  DEAR 	MOTILALJI,  	I must dictate. Writing regularly with my own hand causes too much 	strain and it is not possible to sit up long. This, however, does 	not mean that I am not getting stronger, but the strength comes very 	slowly. And I do not want to be in arrears with such correspondence 	as I would like to attend to.  	I prize your first letter as a gift. It shows you in all your great- 	ness and goodness.  	You are living for your children. I envy them. But Krishna’slibtech_537_footnotewedding must not be after Jawahar’s type. It must be 	as humble as Sarup’slibtech_538_footnote. 	Otherwise I must apply for a warrant of attachment. Or, if I feel I 	must enter into collusion with Krishna.  	I read the public printed report from beginning to end. And I have 	now read the confidential reportlibtech_539_footnote. Both are worthy of Jawaharlal. I appreciate the view 	he presents about foreign propaganda. But somehow or other I still 	feel that our way lies differently. I feel that we will not get the 	support of Europe beyond a certain point, because after all most of 	the European States are partners in our exploitation, and if my 	proposition is correct, namely, that we must resist this 	exploitation in every shape and form, we shall not retain European 	sympathy during the final heat of the struggle. However, for the 	moment my view is merely academic. And you will vote Congress funds 	as you please.      
 The idea of Jawaharlal presiding has an irresistible appeal for me. But I wonder whether it would be proper in the  present atmosphere to saddle the responsibility upon him. It seems to me to be a thankless task. All discipline has vanished. Communalism is at its height. Intrigue is triumphant everywhere. Good and true men are finding it difficult to hold on to their position in the Congress. Jawahar’s time will be simply taken away in keeping the Congress house tolerably pure and he will simply sicken. Till your letter came, I had no thought of interfering this year in the choice of the President. My instinct still goes that way. But, being out of touch, I may be taking too gloomy a view of the situation. You know better. And seeing that you are taking your head, and I suppose heart also, to Bombay, you will know the situation at first hand and guide me.  There will be still time enough to move.
 I return Krishna’s copy of Jawahar’s confidential report as also the first page of his letter. I have only just received papers regarding Saklatvala which I shall go through in due time.
 Yours sincerely,

    LETTER TO DR. B. S. MOONJE       DEAR 	DR. MOONJE,      NANDI HILLS,  May 	14, 1927 
  	I was looking forward to a copy of your address. I have now received 	the same with your covering letter for both of which I thank you.  	Acharya Gidwani wrote to me preparing me for the receipt of your 	address. I had not read it but he told me that you had imputed to me 	a view of untouchability which I have never held or expressed. And, 	when he told me so, I wrote to him saying that if you had done any 	such thing, it would not surprise me as your philosophy admitted of 	any means for beating an opponent with. I have now read your address 	and I see that it confirms Acharya Gidwani’s opinion. I suppose it 	is unnecessary to tell you that the view you ascribe to me is not 	mine. For, it is conceivable to me that you did not know my repeated 	declarations that I do not regard untouchability as is now 
 practised as a part of Hindu religion, and that if I could persuade myself that it was, I should disown Hinduism. But this very palpable misrepresentation of my view does not affect our friendship. For, mistaken though I regard your philosophy to be, love of the country is good enough bond between you and me. Some day of course I expect to convert you [to] my view that it is a good policy even to treat an opponent fairly and justly. And my conversion of you will be my contribution to the shuddhi movement.
 Of course you want to know my opinion about your address. I congratulate you upon your frankness and fearlessness; but the substance of your address makes no appeal to me. Your address is a powerful and eloquent plea on behalf of Islam not as its best exponents know it, but as you know it, and if I do not know better my own Hinduism, I do not know what I should do. You have also put yourself to immense pain in demonstrating that untouchability is an integral part of Hinduism, a view which I repudiate and have always repudiated in toto. Happily for me, my Hinduism does not bind me to every verse because it is written in Sanskrit, because it is supposed to be a part of some of our scriptures. If your portraiture of events is true and if your view of Hinduism is also true, the outlook is only gloomy both for Hinduism and for the country. But let me tell you with all deference that in spite of your literal knowledge of the Shas- tras, yours is a distorted view of Hinduism. I claim in all humility to have lived Hinduism all my life. But I can’t convert you by argument. And I know you will sweep me off my feet with a mere gesture if I endeavour to convert you by means of lathi blows. I shall therefore be content with what I know to be the Hindu way and wait patiently for my opportunity.
 Yours sincerely,

  	I have your letter. Writing to persons like you is  no  strain. 	Lately I have changed my way of working. Instead of writing myself, 	I dictate letters lying down. That way I am able to attend to more 	letters. Write to Pattani Saheb regarding the bungalow and give him 	your last date. If you wish, I shall write to him. It is better to 	spend November- December only there. If all is well you may come 	down in January. If you really wish to write about tuberculosis in 	Gujarati, go to a medical college when you are ready and study the 	subject without any desire for a degree. Do you know that that is 	what Dr. Anna Kingsford did? She also had tuberculosis. While 	studying the subject, she discovered something altogether new. She 	cured her disease by taking to vegetarian diet. It is another matter 	that the cause of her disease was different. You can also discover 	something.  	Now for Pyarelal. If you send away Pyarelal in a hurry, you will 	earn a severe rebuke. I had decided for Pyarelal the programme that 	he should be with you and do his work. Pyarelal is learned, yet is 	reticent. Because of his undue timidity, he is not able to give of 	his best. That is why I had given him the responsibility of writing 	regularly while he stayed with you. In one of your letters you had 	mentioned that Pyarelal was feeling bored. That is not true. As soon 	as he came here, Pyarelal sought my permission to go back. But  I 	detained him because I wanted to have a leisurely talk with him and 	to cure his mental troubles. Do not send back Pyarelal because you 	want to make the experiment of carrying on without help. Discuss the 	matter further with Pyarelal and then write to me as you consider 	fit.

    BHAISHRI 	CHINAI,  Vaishakha 	Sud 13 	[May 	14, 1927]libtech_541_footnote 
  	I have your letter. Even before this I got the news from Bhai 	Kalyanji and Pragjibhai. Your letter however throws more light. I 	congratulate you on the fortitude you displayed in receiving the 	blows without either returning them or running away. I have no doubt 	that your action will bring benefit to you as well as to the people. 	We should entertain no doubt about it just because we cannot 	ourselves see its good results.  	I shall now answer your questions. It cannot be stated categorically 	whether or not one may participate in the activities of the Hindu 	[Maha]sabha. Those who are capable of having  their  own ideals 	implemented may surely do it, or those who are in agreement with the 	ideology of their local leaders will join them anyway. I find 	nothing wrong with the Hindu [Maha]sabha’s aims and ideals. There 	can be nothing wrong in organizing a community. Abolition of 	untouchability is everyone’s dharma.  Shuddhi is a very wide term. A part of what it 	connotes may be acceptable to us, some of it may be rejected. I 	think their manifesto gives no rigid definition of shuddhi. 	People therefore have to make their own individual choice after 	considering the activities carried on in their respective province 	or city. As a matter of fact you have therefore to act as directed 	by your own inner self in view of the local situation. There is no 	absolute dharma that you must attend all the meetings convened by 	the Mahasabha, nor are you bound by dharma to take active part in 	any meeting which you happen  to  attend. Dharma consists in 	undertaking an act only if it is likely to advance what one regards 	as one’s dharma. I would have no objection to taking part in a 	procession launched by the Hindu [Maha]sabha if it is done with a 	pure motive and not expressly with the intention to create trouble. 	If we get news of a riot we should certainly exercise our strength, 	such as it is, in bringing about peace. It is everyone’s dharma to 	make every pious effort to stop riots breaking out. I employ the 	adjective “pious” with a purpose because in this age of 	cowardice men are presumed to be observing their dharma of peace by 	remai- 
 ning indifferent merely with a view to saving their own skin. Thus by pious efforts, I mean, no one is required to check the riots at the cost of his dharma. If there is an attack on my temple coming up and I just disappear or if I am advised to run away, neither I nor the person who counsels flight can be said to have been trying to stop the riot.
 Social boycott can be justified in principle. I  have  however never seen a clear reason for a social boycott of Muslims; nor is a general social boycott possible, as far as I can see.
 Please do write to me if you need further elucidation. I hope your pain has subsided; that Raiji too must be all right by now. One of your doubts remains to be cleared. There is absolutely no reason to believe that the Government has a hand in the functioning of the Hindu [Maha]sabha. The Government, nonetheless, is wont to make use of every sabha or samiti with a view to consolidating their own position, as it does with the Hindu [Maha]sabha, the Muslim League and even the Congress.
 Let Bhai Kalyanji and Bhai Pragji too read this letter so that I need not write to them separately.

I am pleased that 	none of your girls is scared of the thieves. I wish that we while at 	the Ashram do not live in fear.  	If Surajbehn invites you to have a look at the Shravikashram at 	Palitana, do go and visit it when you get the time. I think, 	however, that you were absolutely correct in expressing your 	unwillingness to stay there. I would wish you to gain 	self-confidence and be better trained, and your convictions to be 	more firm before you decide to serve individually. 
 Surendraji’s candour can never fail to have a good effect. Those of the girls who come to know him have improved, and I wish you to utilize his presence more. I regard Surendra as an unblemished brahmachari.
It is very good that you have taken Ramanama into your heart.
This name alone averts all ills.
 I am steadily improving. For the present I propose to make it a practice to dictate my letters instead of writing them myself because of the temptation to deal with too many letters and also to conserve my energy.

   APPEAL TO SOUTH AFRICAN 		INDIANSlibtech_543_footnote  
 The Rt. Hon. Srinivasa Sastri has yielded to the pressure of friends in accepting the office of the first Ambassador for India in South Africa, at the sacrifice of his cherished wishes, solely with the object of serving you. It rests with you to make the best use of his services and his presence amongst you. You cannot do so unless you fulfil the following conditions:
 You 	will not 	expect too much.  You 	will not try to seek 	relief in 	purely individual 	cases through him. 
 
 Navajivan, 15-5-1927.
  You 	will not swerve from 	truth in your 	dealings with 	him. To be false to him would be to be false to yourselves. You 	will remain completely united.  You 	will put your own house 	in order 	and purify yourselves. 
 You will not assume that all your grievances will disappear with the coming of the Rt. Hon. Sastri as first Agent. He will have done enough if he succeeds in seeing that no new restrictive legislation is passed against you, that the operation of the old restrictive enactments is not made unnecessarily harsh and that the spirit of the new Agree- ment is carried out by the Union Government.
 The Rt. Hon. Sastri is going there as the representative, not of individuals, but of India as a whole. He is going there to uphold the prestige of India. Therefore you will not run to him for relief in every individual case. If you do, you will make the mistake of expending a pound for the matter of a penny.
 Our strength depends solely on truth. No matter  how  you behave in your business dealings, you will never in the interests of the community think of swerving from the path of truth in your dealings with the Rt. Hon. Sastri. In attempting to deceive him you will be working your own ruin.
 We here constantly receive reports of dissensions amongst you. If you go on creating different and conflicting interests,  e.g.,  the rights of the rich as distinguished from those of the poor, the rights of the North Indians as distinguished from those of the South Indians, of the Colonial-born as distinguished from those of the merchants, of the latter from those of the indentured, of the Transvaal Indians as distinguished from those of the Cape Indians and Natal Indians, you will lose the little that you have gained. If you want to better the position of the whole community, you will always stand united.
 We are ultimately to win by our own endeavour which does not mean sharp practice, but self-purification, which again means reform from within and purging ourselves of evil customs and superstitions, educating our children, and contributing money for education as well as other measures of social reform. In this work of self-purification, the Rt. Hon. Sastri’s profound experience as an educationist and reformer should be very helpful, and the presence of Mrs. Sastri  should be an inspiration to our women.
 You will never get such another opportunity in the near future of ameliorating your condition. In my opinion it was impossible to
 find a worthier, abler and more impartial representative than the Rt. Hon. Sastri. Let us believe that the Hand of God has brought about this happy consummation. It rests with you entirely to benefit or not by the chance which God has in his mercy given you. May He show you the right path.

   NOTE  
 RAMACHANDRA LIFT
 The lift has now been in use in several parts of Gujarat since the management of it was taken over by the Satyagraha Ashram. With reference to one that was recently put up in Palanpur, Sheth Amritlal Raychand Jhaveri writes:libtech_544_footnote
 I print the substance of the Gujarati letter received by me as preliminary evidence of the successful working of the lift, and in  order to invite the opinion of others who have already got the Ramachandra lifts. I should not have concerned myself about it but for its very great humanitarian aspect. However, I am anxious to move cautiously. I have heard some criticism about the lift and I invite all the testimony for and against the lift. Up to now all the criticism that I have received has made no appeal to me; but if there is any criticism worth noticing I shall not hesitate to take the reader into confidence. I need not repeat that the spirit of this enterprise is not commercial in any sense of the term. Mr. Ramachandra Iyer has sold his patent rights for a royalty of Rs. 25 per lift up to 1,000. This was due to him as he has incurred considerable debts and as he must live. But beyond that, nothing but actual expenses are added in counting the cost....
 Those who desire to see the lift at work may visit the Ashram for the purpose.libtech_545_footnote
 Where the only object is absolute religious activity and pursuit of truth, there is no reason to hide anything. The object of the appreciation printed above is thus clear. If the lift has the merits described above then all must take advantage of it. We started with only one lift in the Satyagraha Ashram and have now provided four lifts. Out of these three are in working condition; but I do not
 
 
 consider this to be sufficient proof. If those who have bought the equipment are satisfied, and if they feel that because of this there is some saving of cattle as well as money, then nothing can be said against it. It can be said that experience gained so far is in favour of the Ramachandra lift.

    LETTER TO V. S. SRINIVASA SASTRI        NANDI 	HILLS, 
    DEAR 	BROTHER,  May 	15, 1927 
  	I must dictate this letter. I forgot to mention one thing to you. I 	think I gave you the name of Umar Hajee Ahmed Jhaveri, one of the 	most truthful men I have met in my life. If he has thought ill of a 	person, I have known him to tell him so and apologize. He is the 	brother of the very first Indian merchant who went to South Africa, 	the late Abubakar Ahmed. Umar Hajee Ahmed has considerable property 	in Durban and has a plot of land with handsome buildings in a 	central place in Church Street, Pretoria. This property was the only 	property registered in the name of an Indian in the Transvaal. It 	became a point of honour with us to insist upon that property 	remain-    
 ing in the ownership of Indians. Mr. Jhaveri was telling me that there was some dispute about it. I don’t remember the exact circumstances in which the matter stands at present, though of course the past history  I know well. This is a matter that might come before you. You will then recall the fact that I mentioned it to you. This is no individual matter but one of national concern. There is correspon-dence about this between General Smuts and myself. You will see all the papers if the case ever comes before you.
 I saw Dr. Malan’s cable. It was splendid. I am glad you are going so early as 8th June. Poor Andrews is being torn to pieces, and you will not reach South Africa a moment too soon.
 The Natal Provincial Council’s vote is indeed a bad beginning. But in the Cape Parliament the Natal vote counts for little. I have no doubt that you will have no difficulty with the Natal members some of whom are good, and all of them, unlike as in  the  Transvaal,  the Orange and even the Cape, are proud of the British connection. But, probably, you already know all such things.
 Yours sincerely,

           DEAR 	FRIEND,    LETTER TO C. NARAYANA RAO        NANDI HILLS,  May 	15, 1927 
  	Owing to my illness your letter has remained unanswered all this 	long time. Do you still desire to leave the Excise Department? And 	are you prepared to go to the Ashram and submit to its discipline 	without any pay? Though you do not know cooking, it will be 	necessary for you to take part in the kitchen work. What you do not 	know will be taught to you. If you are admitted you will be expected 	to learn Hindi. You will be expected to get up at 4 o’clock in the 	morning and from 4 o’clock till 7-30 in the evening you will be 	expected to take some part in the joint work at the Ashram. Of 	course necessary leisure for ablutions, etc., is provided. Thus you 	will see that before 8 o’clock in the evening you will have little 	time for doing private reading. There will be an hour’s rest 	during the day; but after  strenuous  labour, you will hardly feel 	up to reading anything. Thus strictly speaking there is no such 	thing as 8 hours’ day in the Ashram for 
 volunteers who come under the Ashram discipline. You will be expected to retire to bed at 9 o’clock at night. In fact one motto at the Ashram is that work for the common good is prayer and work is devotion to God. If you feel that you can go through the Ashram discipline, please let me know and I shall forward your letter to the Manager of the Ashram with a recommendation to admit you. Whether you may be finally admitted or not will depend upon the Managing Committee who has full control over everything in the Ashram.

If you join the training class, your 	own expenses will be paid, provided, of course, that you enter into 	an agreement after the training is finished to serve the All-India 	Spinners’ Association. If you show considerable aptitude, it is 	possible that you will get a pass certificate before the ordinary 	time and might then be admitted to the service at once.

 CHI. BENARSIDASJI,
 I have your letter. Before I got it, I had no knowledge of all that had been written from the Ashram. You are no doubt aware that I am lying ill in bed. I can only guess why such a letter came to be written from the Ashram. Thus, as I have found Totaramji very systematic in all his work, this letter too must have been written at his instance. If this is true you have no reason to feel unhappy about it. As for me, I have full faith in your truthfulness. But when a particular job....libtech_547_footnotea man should willingly act in conformity with the common rules.
 Whatever the best man does. . .libtech_548_footnote
 Again you may not be aware that a managing committee has now been formed in the Ashram and all business is transacted through it. And it has relieved me of all my responsibilities after I fell ill. Consequently it is implied that I should claim or exercise no prerogative. If I have not been able to satisfy you even after writing all this please write to me what else I should do.
 What are you doing these days? What means have you adopted for earning your livelihood?
My health is now improving.

 CHI. MIRA,
 I have your letter. You may be declared to be a discharged patient now I suppose and so I have eased down a bit in my sending you love letters.
 
 I am making steady progress. Bangalore doctors came today and they found the blood-pressure to be only 150 and the general condition quite good. They now want me to eat more. I shall see what is possible in that direction. I have been obliged to omit bread and vegetable because I thought them to be too heavy. I must now make another attempt. But there is no doubt about my getting better.
 I see you are making headway with your work. How many women are there and how many girls? How many men and how many boys? Give me, when you can, a general idea of the Ashram and its inmates.
 I do not know if anybody has told you that at Sabarmati of late we have been having much too much attention from thieves. Once our watchman suffered bad injuries in a scuffle with them. That woke me to a sense of our duty. And I thought that this work of guarding was as much our duty as a common kitchen. I therefore suggested that we must become our own watchmen and watchwomen and that we should seek not to beat the thieves out of the Ashram, but try to wean them from their error if they could be got at and that we should risk being beaten by them. The suggestion has been adopted and there are now over thirty volunteers including five women. This is a good begin- ning.
 The common kitchen is daily improving. Shankaran has proved an ideal chief and chef. There are over twenty dining at the kitchen. All this will delight your heart when you return.
With love,
 Yours,

   LETTER TO ASHRAM WOMEN  
 Vaishakha Sud Purnima [May 16, 1927]libtech_549_footnote
 SISTERS,
 I am very glad to know that you are not afraid. A person who knows that God is the Protector of all, why need he fear? By saying that God is the Protector of all, I do not mean that none would be able to rob or harm us. If this happens, it is not a reflection on the capacity of God to protect us; it is an indication of our lack of faith in Him. The river is ever ready to give water to all. But if one does not approach it with a pot in which to fetch water, or avoids it thinking its water poisonous, how can that be the fault of the river? Fear is a sign of lack of faith. But faith cannot be developed by means of reasoning. It comes gradually through reflection, meditation and practice. To develop such faith, we pray to God, recite bhajans, read good books, seek the company of the good and take to sacrificial spinning at the wheel. He who has no faith will not even touch the spinning-wheel.
I am getting better.

 I have your letter. I am steadily regaining the vigour. Do not worry in the least. I will try to take complete rest.
 It would be good not to saddle Jamnalalji with more responsibility for the present. Whatever the problems, I shall be able to take quick decisions and perhaps you too will be able to explain to me. I am afraid Jamnalalji might fall ill. I like Rajaji’s suggestion. If you can work in the Nandi Hills for two months, the work can get done quickly and conveniently. Houses are plentiful and so it would be no trouble for me at all. Please consider and if you feel the need come over. It would be good if you too could have some peace.
 I had a fairly long discussion with Bhai Dhirajlal at Bombay. He talked to me quite frankly and openly. He wants to have training at Bardoli and then work in Bombay. He does not seem to have found a clear direction yet. But it is just as well that he should spend a little time at Bardoli or Sabarmati.
 I have received Anasuyabehn’s letter. She will definitely be coming to the Nandi Hills. It will not cause any trouble or congestion for me.

   LETTER TO SATIS CHANDRA DAS GUPTA  
 NANDI HILLS,
 May 17,1927
 DEAR SATIS BABU,
 When my illness is fast becoming a thing of the past yours seems to be obstinate. Whilst it remains so, you must not stir out. But why does it persist like that? Are you undergoing any treatment there? What exactly is the food you are taking? I ask this question as Mr. Gregg has sent me a book containing the latest researches on food and its relation to health. One thing does appear to me, however apart from the book. May it be that your vegetarian food does not agree with your body that has been built up upon flesh foods? While the change may not have done any visible harm, may it have undermined the constitution or may it be that the change of diet does not serve for rebuilding a shattered constitution? So it happened in my case. I went on famously on fruit and nut alone for more than six years. But after that severe attack of dysentery I could not rebuild the body without milk to which in some shape or other the constitution was used up to 45 years or rather 40 years. You know my rigid predilection, bord- ering on fanaticism, for vegetarianism. But my fanaticism exhausts itself with my own person for the simple reason that it is a mater of lifelong habit and of deep religious conviction. But religious convic-
 
 tion is a matter personal to every individual. Therefore, even being a vegetarian, I never enforce my conviction on friends but leave them free to do as they choose, even when they are under my influence, as I did for instance for Prabhudas, Chhaganlal’s son. I had an English friend living with me in Durban. He had become a vegetarian under my influence. After some time he became ill. I could see that he could not get on well without his usual diet. I begged of him to procure meat from outside and become well. I could not introduce it in my own home. I want you to seriously consider the question therefore. You have to think not only of yourself but of Nikhil also and even Hemprabha Devi if she is still as bad as you are and Tarini if he is a vegetarian. If you are eating pulses, they are of course a fatal thing for weak persons and those with sedentary habits. You saw with what agitation Andrews cabled to me all the way from South Africa about milled rice. And my concern about your food became enhanced upon reading the book sent by Mr. Gregg.
 If there is any particular book on Buddhism that you require please tell me and I shall try to procure it.
 The paragraph about yoga in Navajivan was unfortunate. I did think of yoga practices, but only from two sides, their reputed helpfulness in restoring health and in aiding brahmacharya, the latter for the sake of helping the student world whose mind is cut up to pieces under dissipating practices, and the former with reference to my own health. Having read a book on brahmacharya, during my illness and having heard copious references to use of asanas I began further research. I do not hope to get much help for acquiring greater purity. Not that I do not need all that I can get, but I do not feel that I shall get it through these practices. One who considers himself proficient in yoga told me that in their final stages Raja Yoga, Hatha Yoga and Karma Yoga were one and the same and that it was only in the final stage that conquest of passions in every shape and form was at all possible; and that in Hatha Yoga the final stage was difficult of attainment and required extensive practice. I was not surprised to hear this. For, I knew it before I was so authoritatively told. For that conquest therefore I have only to continue along the path I have so long followed. But I am taking gentle exercise by way of some of these asanas and am eager to take more as I become stronger. You need not therefore think any more about the yoga practices. Some day in order to remove expectations and misunderstandings, I propose
 to write about this thing in the pages of Young India. If I make any discovery about the simple use of asanas for regaining health, I shall certainly write to you.

But I know him very well. He treated Kaka and Uttam Chand—whom you do not know. And at present it appears that both of them have recovered. That is what the two of them think too. I know that others also have faith in him. His treatment consists essentially of injections in which he has profound faith. I do not think he has talked to you about the injections. But I can talk to him if you wish. But I think that if he wants to give you injections and you want to take them you will have to stay at Ahmedabad.

 Please do write to Ramdas and tell him whatever you think he ought to do. I believe khadi work to be both a business and a form of national service. When the use of khadi has become widespread, the very men who have now taken possession of the Mulji Jetha Marketlibtech_556_footnoteand send crores of rupees abroad and make profits of lakhs for themselves, will compensate the thirty-three crores of Gods of Indialibtech_557_footnoteto the tune of crores of rupees and retain lakhs for themselves. And, in
 
 this way, both the Gods and the cloth merchants will prosperlibtech_558_footnotelibtech_559_footnote. Today, these cloth merchants are making their profits, as they believe them to be, at the expense of the Gods. I do wish that Ramdas, and to the extent possible Nimu, should take full part in helping the change that is currently taking place in cloth trade, transforming it from an imm- oral trade into a moral one. But that wish is of secondary importance to me. The more important thing is the freedom of Ramdas  and Nimu. I myself am content telling them what I think, and will be satisfied with whatever course of action they adopt. You have as much right as I naturally have to take a share in promoting their good. You are as much in place of a respected elder to them as I am. I, therefore, wish that you should guide them. It is your right and also your duty to do so. It would of course be very good if we both held the same views. But I would see no harm even if our views differed. Sincerely held differences of views conduce to our good. I hold that we harm each other’s good by suppressing our views out of false regard for each other. Therefore, please do tell Ramdas whatever you think.

   NAGPUR SATYAGRAHA  
 I see an Associated Press telegram in the papers, in which Mr. Manchershah Awari is reported to have said, that he had my consent and full sympathy for his movement of civil disobedience with regard to the Arms Act and the Explosive Substances Act, designed for the release of the Bengal detenus.
 If my recollection is correct, either the Associated Press repre- sentative has misunderstood Mr. Awari, or the latter has misunder- stood me. I have no recollection of having given my consent  in advance to Mr. Awari’s proposed launching out on civil disobedience in any connection whatsoever. It is really contrary to my practice to give such consent in advance. I did discuss the theory of civil disobe- dience with Mr. Awari, for whose patriotic spirit and self-sacrifice I have great regard. I drew his attention to the grave limitations of civil disobe-dience. He spoke, and rightly, with great warmth and concern about the Bengal detenus, and I remember having said, that if some move-ment in the shape of civil disobedience could be conceived and successfully launched, it would be a great thing. I hold that view even at the present moment. For I regard the indefinite detention of the Bengal patriots without any trial of any sort as a grave injustice. And if I have remained dumb, it is not because I do not feel the wrong as keenly as the closest friends of the detenus, but because I do not desire to make a fruitless exhibition of my powerlessness. A public worker has to learn to endure with fortitude what he cannot cure. And bed-ridden though I am, if I could think of any feasible civil plan for securing the release of these prisoners, I should embark upon  it without the slightest hesitation. But I confess that I have none in view. My own personal opinion is that there is no atmosphere in the country for civil disobedience. We have fallen upon evil times. The atmos- phere today is one not of non-violent disobedience but of very violent and suicidal disobedience.
 I have no knowledge whatsoever of what is being done in Nagpur. I can pronounce no judgment upon Mr. Awari’s movement. I have given no consent for the movement. I had intended to say not one word about the movement, and it would have been well if Mr. Awari had not dragged in my name. If he thought that his movement had my consent, he should have laid the whole of his plan  in  a concrete form before me and secured it in writing. If I had approved of it and if I could not have taken an active part myself, I would at
 least have backed it with all the force at my command through these columns. He must now thank himself if my disclaimer harms his movement in any way.
 And let it be a warning in future to everyone concerned against using my name in connection with any movement without my pre- vious consent in writing. Indeed it is necessary for workers to become self-reliant and dare to prosecute their plans if they so desire without hankering after the backing of names of persons supposed to be great and influential. Let them rely upon the strength of their own convic- tion and the cause they seek to espouse. Mistakes there will be. Suffering even avoidable there must be. But nations are not easily made. There will have to be rigid and iron discipline  before  we achieve anything great and enduring, and that discipline will not come by mere academic argument and appeal to reason and  logic.  Discipline is learnt in the school of adversity. And  when  zealous young men will train themselves to responsible work without any shield, they will learn what responsibility and discipline are. And out of this army of candidate leaders, will arise one real leader, who will not have to plead for obedience and discipline but who will command it as a matter of course, because he will have been tried in many a skirmish and will have proved his right to undisputed leadership.

   HORRIBLE PRACTICES  
Mr. Andrews in the course of a letter from Durban says:libtech_560_footnote
 I know the temple at Umbilo, which may really be called a suburb of Durban. Even years ago, when the temple was erected, I had my misgivings. Bitter experience has taught me that all temples are not houses of God. They can be habitations of the devil. These places of worship have no value unless the keeper is a good man of God. Temples, mosques, churches are what man makes them to be. I am therefore not surprised at the painful and horribly superstitious prac- tices going on in this so-called temple. The origin of these practices is easy enough to trace. There are three classes of Indians in South Africa. The free Indian trader has nothing to do with these practices.
 
 Nor have the large number of Colonial-born Indians who have received in the face of terrible odds a tolerably liberal education. The third class is the indentured Indian, now become free. He is drawn naturally from the poorest class here. Nothing has ever been done by the Government or the employers or by the free Indian community to help these unfortunate men and women out of their ignorance and superstition. The result is that they are preyed upon by superstitious and even evil-minded men who pose as priests and holy men. They mutter a few Sanskrit verses whose meaning they do not know and which they horribly mispronounce, and resort to all kinds of awe-inspiring practices. And what can be better than a temple, where simple people congregate and where every kind of superstition derives a halo from associations attributed to temples? I think that  the  common law of South Africa is wide enough to deal with these prac- tices if the Government desires to put them down.
 The fact is, unfortunately, that the prejudice against Indians in South Africa is not ascribable to these practices, nor is it directed against the men who are victims of this barbarism. It  is  directed chiefly against the free trading class who have nothing to do with these practices. And therefore these practices have gone without any notice or comment. And if they are now being noticed, it is in order to prejudice the European mind against the Habibullah Agreement and against what little relief is sought to be given by it to the Indian settlers. It should also be borne in mind that these practices are by no means common amongst Indians throughout South Africa. They are confined only to the part of the coast of Natal where indentured Indians are to be found in their largest numbers. If therefore the Government intend to put these practices down, they can do so under the common law with ease, and they can be dealt with also through municipal bye-laws. I am sure, that if action is taken, not a voice will be raised against it in the name of religion falsely so called for sheltering these practices. No cultured Indian will have anything to do with them, and the ignorant people who witness these tortures with awe will not dare to defend them in a court of law. What we can do here is to encourage cultured Indians in South Africa to  fight the superstition. They should, without seeking Government intervention, work in the midst of the poor people, and wean them from these barbarisms, and advise them to help the Government, if they choose to prosecute those who take part in those practices, thus showing their desire not to reproduce in South Africa all that is bad in our life, but
 to reproduce only that which is good in our civilization. It is our duty to advise and encourage our countrymen in South Africa  to  do nothing that will give a handle to the agitation against them.

   LETTER TO SATCOWRIPATI RAY  
 NANDI HILLS (MYSORE STATE),
 May 19, 1927
 DEAR SATCOWRI BABU,
 I got your letter day before yesterday after that day’s mail was closed. I could not possibly over-take your letter yesterday.
 You have my deepest sympathy with you in your troubles. But I have much fear it is out of my power to help you in the direction desired by you. All the same please let me have a full description of your property, where it is situated, what is its extent, whether there are any buildings on it and if there are, their dimensions. Possession of this information will be useful for me. But your case is not out of the ordinary. I know many who are passing through the same difficulty. It is also one of the things we have to go through in our march towards our goal. And I want you to bear your troubles with philoso- phic calmness as I know you will do.
 But why do you say insolvency is not to be thought of? Honest insolvency is no crime if a borrower [borrows] in good faith for investing in a prosperous enterprise. Suppose that through no fault of my own the enterprise fails and the loaner knew that I had no other means of repayment. Surely if he is impatient, insolvency is the only honourable course left open for me even if I desired as I should to repay the loan in spite of insolvency. For, insolvency would be the only way of my doing further business. As a lawyer you know the genesis of insolvency law. It was created to protect honest but unlucky enterprise and to encourage trade and enterprise. No doubt the golden rule is not to borrow. But so few of us follow the golden rule. The next best therefore is not to accept a defeat but to seek the protection of the insolvency court and open a new leaf, and if successful, in the next enterprise, repay of one’s own free will the original loaner. There are such celebrated instances of men having deliberately become insolvent and then repaid their creditors. In my own practice, I advised
 one of my nearest clientslibtech_561_footnote, who  because  he  had  taken  part  in  the satyagraha movement, was forced into the insolvency court. I called a meeting of the debtors. They were unbending. I challenged them to do their worst. The consequence was insolvency. But after the insol- vency, the client paid the creditors in full to their agreeable astonish- ment. They apologized and they showed their sincerity by giving him afterwards unlimited credit which they had no occasion to regret. I therefore strongly advise you to meet the creditors, place the position frankly and fearlessly before them and tell them that you will repay if you earned. If they don’t listen, let them make you insolvent, or if the insolvency law here admits of voluntary surrender you may even surrender voluntarily. Then you will have breathing time and then if you do not want to resume practice, you will join the Khadi Service. Khadi Service will never give you Rs. 25,000. But if the movement goes forward with a leap, khadi will become a commercial proposition, and when it does become that, there will be a moderate amount of money in it also. This may seem to be all far-fetched; not so to me. I regard khadi as a far sounder proposition even from a commercial standpoint than the least that can be made by our merchant princes. After all sound commerce is of slow growth. But my confidence in khadi is such that, though it is of slow growth, in the long run, it will prove to be the shortest route to healthy commercial prosperity of individuals as it certainly will be of the nation.
 I do not want you [to] succumb therefore under the influence of false pride or [a] false sense of honour. I want you to be a pattern for others, and therefore please follow my advice and get rid  of  the burden which is evidently bearing you down. Then make a firm resolution not to borrow a single farthing henceforth. Public workers must not borrow. And insist upon your numerous family dependants to work for their livelihood and let them all work for khadi, and if they don’t want to do that, the male members may make their own choice; females may grumble but will submit to the inevitable. This regulation of family obligations is also a necessary corollary to national uplift. We must break through this family crust if we are to grow to our national height. These falsely assumed obligations I know are hampering the progress of individuals and the nation in a way very few things are doing. It is wrong, I almost want to say immoral, to support men and women who have some capacity for work. Even a
 
 rich nation, if it madelibtech_562_footnotean attempt to support one half of its members without taking any work from them, it will go to the dogs. But we are doing infinitely worse and still expect to become a strong, self-reliant and self-respecting nation; it is an impossible proposition.
 Do let me know your final decision and do not hesitate to write to me as often as you like. It will be a terrible thing if you are lost to public work.
 Yours sincerely,
 SATCOWRIPATI RAY, ESQ.

   LETTER TO S. SRINIVASA AIYENGAR  
 NANDI HILLS,
 May 19, 1927
 DEAR FRIEND,
I must dictate in order to conserve my energy.
 I appreciate your considerate telegramlibtech_563_footnote. I haven’t enthused over it because of the wretched atmosphere about us. Our best resolutions come to naught because we seem to have lost the power of taking the people with us. Of what use will be our resolutions if the people continue savagely to break one another’s heads? But I have said of you that where others have failed, you may owing to your invincible faith succeed. I wish therefore all strength to your elbow and shall rejoice if you succeed in putting an end to this disgraceful civil war and make men out of beasts that we have become at present.
 I am making steady progress and trying to follow your move- ments as carefully as I can.
With all good wishes,
 Yours sincerely,

 CHI. CHHAGANLAL,
 You write it would be better if Manibehn stayed [at the Ashram] instead of going over to Karachi. God alone knows whether or not she would have the opportunity to go. But if she is not to go there, still she has to be sent out somewhere because I wonder if she has  yet  developed any attachment to the Ashram. The girl is extremely candid and honest; so wherever she is, she is sure to do the work, but it is for you all to create in her affection and interest. Do keep her there if you can. And if this is possible [for the time being], I need not arrange to send her elsewhere. I would let the [chance] at Karachi materialize if it is to happen. But She can also be called back from there after a short period. I am [glad] that the [Ashram] women have [taken up] the mess. Please congratulate them all and tell them that they must fulfil with credit what they have undertaken.

  Vaishakha Krishna 3 [May 19, 1927]libtech_565_footnote  BHAISHRI 	PULCHAND,  	Your letter. It has always been my view that we should on no account 	bring in the British Government to mediate in the affairs of the 	native States. But we cannot say that this principle is to be 	followed on every occasion, because as I expect a man who would 	neither ask for nor want the mediation of the British to possess the 	strength to resist oppression peacefully or otherwise or acquire the 	capacity to suffer it silently. But a man who is unable to fight, 	who cannot put up     
 with oppression and either enlists the aid of the British or loses his manhood by abject submission to oppression should certainly seek the help of the British.
 According to my concept of the Kathiawar Political Conference, there is no question of seeking British help; and hence if it works in accordance with my idea, it would consist of only the simple unsop- histicated people offering non-co-operation and satyagraha and wear- ing only khadi.libtech_566_footnote

  	I have your letter for which I thank you. Besides the writings 	mentioned by you, there is a monograph by the late Rev. Joseph Doke, 	also by Dr. P. J. Mehta, and by H. S. L.

Most   of   these publications I think can be secured from G. 	A. Natesan of the Indian Review, Madras. Young 	India is edited by me and is published at Ahmedabad. Ethical 	Religion is not an original book. It is a translation of 	an adaptation in Gujarati of an American publication called Ethics 	of Religion by Salter which I read years ago. In 	its translated form I have not read it. It will be therefore risky 	to derive a knowledge of my belief through that book. If you desire 	any further information, you will [not] hesitate, please ask for it.  	I thank you for your enquiry about my health which is steadily 	improving.

  	I was grieved to hear of your illness. I hope you will soon recover. 	Why not come here to regain your strength? The climate here as you 	know is very nice.  	Somehow or other the resolutionlibtech_570_footnoteof the A.I.C.C. does not fill me with immediate hope, 	much less, enthusiasm. The hope deep down which is born of implicit 	faith is there. But it receives no added impulse from the 	resolution. For, I feel the few who have a detached mind and who are 	keeping their heads cool, can produce at present no impression upon 	those who are fighting or those who are at the back of the fighters. 	I don’t know if you think that you have any influence.  I see 	nothing but devilry going on under the garb of religion. Not until 	we learn to become men and therefore instead of breaking heads for 	the vindication of supposed rights, we learn to refer to arbitration 	matters even of attacks upon our rights supposed or real and until 	we cease to think of Government interference, shall we have real 	peace or real swaraj. Anything short of that gives me no 	satisfaction. My only hope therefore lies in prayer and answer to 	prayer.  Yours 	sincerely,  DR. 	M. A.

   CHI. 	MANI, I 	have your letter.  	You have surely heard the song with this first line “Never give 	up, even it you lose your life”. That is to say, we may lose our 	life but    
 never lose heart. And where is the sense in admitting defeat as regards spinning, for instance, and writing a good hand, especially when I am by your side to encourage you? “Stone upon stone a dam is built and drop by drop the lake filled up.” Nothing is impossible for the industrious. So do not lose heart. By regular spinning you are sure to increase your speed and you will improve your hand by constant practice in writing clear and bold letters. I know of a great many people who have thus improved their handwriting. You have done well in taking up the work of the Ashram stores. Now do not give it up but do it perfectly. Never mind if you don’t have to keep accounts, but you should acquaint yourself with the general principles. If this work takes up so much of your time that you cannot spin for two hours every day, you may spin for a shorter period but with concentration. It is better to spin for a short time with application than to spin longer and impatiently; for you will thus spin stronger and more uniform yarn and that too faster.
Do keep me informed about Gangadevi.
   [From Gujarati]  Bapuna 	Patro—Manibehn Patelne, p. 	62      LETTER TO MAGANLAL GANDHI    Yours,              NANDI DURG, 
    CHI. 	MAGANLAL,  May 	21, 1927 
  	I have your letter. I have read your letter to Jamnalal and also 	those to Chhaganlal. I understand about Ramachandra and Ganesh. Do 	what all of you think proper.  	It occurs to me that there is one thing I should write to you about. 	Ramchandra and Ganesh are both good and honest persons. Such persons 	should be retained if possible. But while they are retained, we must 	be firm with them as well as gentle. We should not have the 	slightest hesitation in pointing out their faults. That is what I 	mean by firmness. You must frankly tell Ramchandra: ‘You 	exaggerate. You are hasty and hot-tempered and never willing to see 	your own faults. You can stay here only by recognizing those faults 	and overcoming them. It is no use appealing to Gandhi, because he 	has delegated all powers to us.’ If he stays on even after such 	frank 
 talk, he should be allowed to stay and if he wishes to go, he should be allowed to go, whatever the inconvenience caused thereby. You must also tell Ganesh frankly: ‘We suspect that you do not wish to teach the others the craft you know. We can carry on only if you teach others and train them. If not, you are free to go. But we shall not drive you away if you should wish to continue here even after you have trained somebody. You will continue to receive the help you  are  having today. We want you to stay. But you can stay only on our conditions.’ In other words, firmness lies in telling a person what we think about him. We should be gentle in conveying this and it should not be an expression of hasty judgment. Gentleness also means an effort to see whatever good may be seen in a fault. But ultimately, we can proceed correctly and carry on our work only when we have fully expressed our view about a fault of which we are convinced. Then alone can we consider ourselves true satyagrahis. I see that relations among people are not smooth. At present there is hesitation in frankly expressing our views on the faults of others which are clear to us. If that veil of hesitation is removed, much of the work can become easy. This is intended only by way of guidance.
 I am returning the letter from Ramachandra in case it is of use to you.

  	Jamnalalji is here since a couple of days ago. He has conveyed your 	message to me. I can think of nothing further to write to you than 	what I have already done. Regarding an audience with the Emperor I 	think you should not try for one. You should not, however, refuse it 	if the Secretary of State for India or the Prime Minister proposes 	to arrange it. As far as I know I think political matters are not 	discussed with the British Monarch. Only formal greetings are 
 exchanged. Do meet the ministers and talk with them whatever you want to. Observe closely the British jails and also visit the poorer districts of London with some knowledgeable person and study the condition of the poor. Once or twice, on a Saturday evening, stand near the pubs of the poor and the bars of the rich and watch their doings.
 I am improving day by day.
 I wrote to pujya Malaviyaji long ago. I expect no reply from him as answering letters is contrary to his nature. But he does send a telegram in reply to one. I am going to write to him again all the same.

        HE SHOULD BE DISMISSED    	I have now got the name and the address of the doctor, the account 	of whose inhuman treatment of an Antyaja woman was given to 	us by Shri Amritlal Thakkar.libtech_571_footnoteNow an inquiry is being made into the case and in the 	mean time I do not see any necessity of disclosing his identity. A 	well-known doctor friend writes :libtech_572_footnote  	My reason for publishing this letter is that the  inhuman treatment 	of the Antyaja woman was such as no one can possibly condone. I do 	not believe that if the doctor is a private practitioner, the only 	alternatives before us are to grieve over the incident in helpless 	silence, if we wish to follow the path of non-violence, or, if not, 	give the doctor a thrashing. A thrashing is not likely to make the 	doctor change his ways. Antyaja brethren will not benefit in any 	way, and we will probably fail either to do justice to the doctor or 	win redress for the cruel ill-treatment of the woman. One who 	follows non-violence need not feel helpless. The path of 	non-violence is neither for the coward nor for the stupid. It is for 	those who are ever     
 vigilant. The law of violence concerns the body and its requirements, while the law of non-violence appeals to the heart. Through non- violence we can arouse religious consciousness among the people, which means cultivating bold and true public opinion. If the true spirit of compassion were alive in the village in which this incident occurred, such cruelty would never have been possible. The poor doctor was only an agent. The spirit of cruelty was in the atmosphere and that is why he had the courage to demand two rupees in advance and, though he got the money, felt afraid that he would be polluted by touching the Antyaja woman, even for treating her. It is the duty of men who follow the path of non-violence to be always vigilant and educate public opinion so as to create an atmosphere in which men like the doctor would find no encouragement for the evil in them.

   THE COW AND THE BUFFALO  
A votary of non-violence writes:libtech_573_footnote
 When writing the article on the cow and the buffalo, I had assumed that no clarification was called for about the matter of swaraj to the buffalo. When we domesticate an animal, we deprive it of its freedom, however good our intention in domesticating it may be. Hundreds of Englishmen feel happy in the belief that they rule India with a good motive and, even if we reject that rule, they think us to be fools and do not relinquish what they consider to be their duty of ruling over us. But if a judge were appointed between us, this state- ment by us would suffice: ‘How can these self-appointed protectors of ours understand our sufferings. Only the All-seeing God and we ourselves know them. And we of course say that our good lies in being released from our bondage.’ Similarly, if the buffalo could speak and if an impartial judge were appointed between her and us and the buffalo entered a similar plea, and I do believe she would do so—the verdict would be in her favour. And so I said that by giving up our fancy for rearing buffaloes, we would not be forsaking her,
 
 that is, would not be doing her any harm, but would be granting her freedom. There is no question in this of our disowning an accepted responsibility. We must accept responsibility for those buffaloes which we have reared, but, if I am right in my view, no duty like that which we have accepted in regard to the cow, of adopting ways and means of increasing and improving the progeny of the cow, devolves upon us in regard to the buffalo. Hence it is not necessary to regard the  protection of the buffalo as included in our special duty of cow-pro- tection. If people accept my suggestion, it will naturally be our duty to collect together all the buffaloes we have reared in regions where the cow and the bullock cannot, but only the buffalo can be maintained, and provide for the protection of her male progeny as well.
 It was not my intention to suggest that there should be separate dairies and tanneries for villages, but the fact is that in the existing circumstances, it is only after making experiments in the cities that we can take to villages the science of cattle-rearing, of extracting the maximum quantity of milk from the cow without torturing her, and that of tanning her hide and so on. Such is our pitiable condition at present. In these days, when village pasture lands have disappeared and oilcake, hay, etc., have become dear, the villagers maintain their cattle with great difficulty. We rest content with whatever use the illiterate tanner can make of the hide. The bones, etc., are wasted. As a consequence, this living wealth perishes and, if the cattle do not die, they live on as skeletons, often become a burden to the owner and in the end, land in slaughter-houses in Bombay and other cities. I know that, in these circumstances, important changes need to be adopted, but I am at present unable to say how to bring them about, what methods we should adopt from the West, and so on. This whole thing is at the moment in an experimental stage. If I have been able to explain what needs to be done, it is for every individual worker to experiment on his own and discover how to do it. There was a time when appropriate changes could be effected in our civilization and people accepted the need for such changes. As long as  these conditions of progress were accepted, so long, we can say, our civilization was living. Now we believe that whatever is written in a book which is published as a Shastra and which finds its way into our hands is the Lord’s word and cannot be altered in any way. We must get out of this horrible mental death. We can see with our own eyes that there have been changes in our ways of thought and life in every age. Accepting this truth, cultured workers should enter the villages
 with confidence in themselves. It is necessary for all of them to accept certain general principles; there will be differences in the methods of implementing them. That is inevitable and should be welcomed. From that we shall find the best ways of implementing those principles. From this point of view, the question whether we should introduce Western machines and, if so, to what extent, becomes secondary. The general principle is that we should produce or make whatever we can in the villages themselves, and while we can do with the indigenous razor, should not bother to introduce the German Krupp  razor because it is regarded as superior. If, however, we cannot make the sewing needle in the village, we should not set our face against the easily available and cheap needle from Austria. I see nothing wrong in accepting from any quarter whatever is good and is worth accepting and which we can assimilate.

           DEAR 	FRIEND,    LETTER TO ISABEL BAMLET    NANDI 	HILLS 	(MYSORE STATE),  May 	22, 1927 
  	I have your letter. When I saylibtech_574_footnotethe problem is not so simple as it appears to you, I 	mean two things. It is not enough merely to take the name of God or 	believe in this thing or the other or even in this man or the other; 	but it is necessary ever to wait upon God and find out what His will 	is. I have found this to be a most difficult, though very agreeable, 	task. It is often a question, and a very delicate one, when what we 	may consider to be His will is really His and not ours. Thus we come 	to what St. Paul has said: “Work out your own salvation.”  	The second difficulty is that all religions have more or less 	similar formulae, and all have produced, and continue to produce, 	good, true and godfearing men and women.  	In the circumstances, it is not a simple matter for a humble student 	of all the faiths of the world to find out by prayer which is the 	truest religion. But it is not difficult to say, as I do say, that 	all  religions are more or less God-given and that therefore one 	must work out one’s own salvation in the religion of one’s own 	forefathers; for, a    
 seeker after Truth finds out that all religions melt and become one in God Who is one and the same for all His creatures.
 I shall bear your caution in mind if I write anything in Young India. I shall certainly not make use of your name.

  	I must dictate this although it is a love letter, as I better 	conserve my energy if I dictate stretched on my bed. There is 	nothing however to be concerned about my health, as I am making 	steady progress though it will be some time before I regain the 	strength that I lost in the twinkling of an eye. It may not be 	possible to regain all that I have lost; but the doctors are of 	opinion that much of it, it is perfectly possible to get back.  	Please give my congratulations to Sohaila and Professor Muhammed 	Habib. Though I cannot be with you in the body, I shall be with you 	in the spirit. I wish them both a happy life of useful service to 	the country. Sohaila must remember that she is not going to be 	married to become a mere doll and become lost to the country. But 	she would be expected, like her grey-headed young father, who is 	daily getting younger, to serve the country with the same devotion 	that her young father is doing; and if her husband is at all 	lukewarm, to touch him with her spirit and make him joint partner in 	such service, as he would be joint partner in all the joys and 	sorrows of life. It is no use my even wishing that there should be 	no sorrow and all joy. It would be a flat and dull picture without 	any beautiful shades. There may be joys but they must be relieved by 	occasional sorrows. So my wish and hope is that God will give them a 	fair measure of joys of life if He must also give them doses of 	sorrows to remind them that He is not to be forgotten in the midst 	of life’s joys. 
 I was wondering what you were doing and how you fared in Rangoon. You have kept me without a letter now for a very long time. I suppose it is all deliberate and out of considerateness for a bed- ridden friend. Raihana also has followed suit. But you should know that neither your letter nor hers can possibly be a tax on my energy.
 Give my love to the bride and the bridegroom and  all  the friends and members of the family who may have gathered there to celebrate the coming event and accept the same for yourself and Mrs. Abbas.
 Yours sincerely,

 DEAR MISS SCHLESIN,
 As you know I am just now bed-ridden and I must therefore dictate my reply to your letter of the 20th April just received. It is difficult to recall what I wrote in all my letters to you. So far as my memory serves me, there is not a single letter of yours which has gone by without an acknowledgement. There are many compliments which I do not and cannot appropriate; but the one about  my  being  a prompt correspondent, I can ever claim in spite of your different experience. For, everybody else of my acquaintance has paid me the compliment of being a prompt correspondent, that is of course comparatively to many others.
 I have no letter of yours dated 4th January. But I have one dated 3rd January in my file. I do not think that I gave you, if I did at all, a detailed reply to that letter. It was received at the Ashram on the 3rd February. It was then redirected to me during my tour. Soon after, I became incapacitated.
 Mr. Stanley Jones’s booklibtech_576_footnoteI read but only cursorily as during the tour I was able to do very little of reading. Indeed, it was not even possible for me to look at the many books that came to me. This I did
 
 as it was accompanied by a letter from Mr. Stanley Jones whom I knew very well. I do not remember his suggestion and I have not his book by me.
 I quite agree with you that karma and the cross may well go together. If you have followed the pages of Young India, you must have noticed that last year I read the New Testament every Saturday to the students of our National College. I did stumble over the words “without a cause”libtech_577_footnote, and in explaining it I simply rejected the thing as redundant. But I was agreeably surprised on turning to Moffat’s and Weymouth’s translations which I had by me to make the discovery that you made. In reading all religious works, I have learnt one thing. Never to take them literally, but understand the drift and catch the drift also by means of what is to me an infallible canon of interpretation, and reject those which cannot stand the test of Truth and Ahimsa. I know that even in spite of this canon of interpretation difficulties do arise; but they are solved if one has patience and if one has a living faith in God.
 I am sending your letter to Mr. Jones as I have no doubt he will like to see your argument. I am not likely to meet him in the near future as I shall be for some months still in the South. Your letters should be addressed to the Ashram as usual.
 The autobiography is not yet complete. Ganesan cannot send you a copy of the autobiography. The three parts that have been completed are in course of publication in book form. But for the present, you have to rely upon the numbers of Young India which contain the chapters to date. You may borrow the volumes from Manilal or you should wait till the three parts are published in book form. You may know that before I commenced the autobiography I finished the history of the South African Passive Resistance. The original is in Gujarati. Its translation is now being published in instalments by Ganesan. I am afraid it will be some time before the whole history is available in English.
 Do see Mr. Sastri, India’s first Agent for South Africa. He is an extremely fine man. As you know he is Gokhale’s successor. He knows all about you and is himself eager to see you.
 
 
 I am getting better. Of those you know Mrs. Gandhi and Devdas are with me.

            DEAR 	FRIEND,    LETTER TO REV. STANLEY JONES    NANDI 	HILLS 	(MYSORE STATE),  May 	22, 1927 
  	Here is a letter from Miss Schlesin, a dear friend  in  South 	Africa. You will be interested in it. Please return it after 	perusal.  	I must ask you to tell Mrs. Jones again that the pamphlet addressed 	to boys and girls on purity of life is still being hatched in my 	mind and I have not despaired of being able to write out something 	or rather dictate something from this sick-bed. I 	am now gradually regaining the lost strength.  Yours 	sincerely Enclosure 	1  REV. 	STANLEY JONES 	SITAPUR, 	U.P.  From 	a photostat: S.N. 14127      LETTER TO DEVESHVAR SIDDHANTALANKAR    NANDI 	HILLS 	(MYSORE STATE),  May 	22, 1927  DEAR 	FRIEND,  	I have carefully preserved your letter of 29th January in the hope 	some day of being able to write to you. It was received during my 	tour and I was not able to read the cuttings till during the last 	three days. Lying on my sick-bed I have been gradually overtaking my 	correspondence and I have now gone through the cuttings. They are 	valuable. In some places your translation does not do justice to the 	original. But the pains you have taken to be just leads me to hope 	that the mistake is due to inadvertence. 
 The extracts you have collected certainly makes one sink. I am not a critical student of religious books including the Koran. I have read these books with sympathy and with a view to deriving religious consolation. The effect therefore produced upon yourlibtech_578_footnotelibtech_579_footnotemind  by  the passages collected by you was naturally not produced upon my mind. The commentary you have given upon the text, “there should be no violence in religion,” is quite new to me and gives a  different  meaning from the one which the text bears without the commentary. I would however like to consult Mussalman friends about it. But after all the careful thought I have given to the passages extracted by you, I adhere to the conclusion that Islam is not a religion of the sword; but it is like all other great religions a religion of peace. I say so for this reason. I have met numerous Mussalmans who no more think of slaying men of different faiths than you or I do. And these Mussalmans are by no means scoffers. They are devout followers of their faith. The long line of Sufis whose veneration for the Koran cannot be questioned owe their illuminating philosophy of peace and love to the Koran. I have read Maulana Shibli’s Life of the Prophet as also portions of his Al Kalam. I have read also his Leaves from the Lives of the Companions of the Prophet. The sum-total of the impression left on my mind by these writings is of an elevating character. I hope you do not wish to suggest that Maulana Shibli and such other writers on Islam have written what they did not believe and in order to throw dust in the eyes of others. All this does not however mean that I regard the life of the Prophet to have been perfect or that the Koran itself is a perfect book. Like all other religious books including our own, there are passages which cause difficulty. But the difficulties caused in reading the Koran are not greater than those caused by reading books of other faiths. Christianity, I surmise, admittedly is a religion of peace; but the Old Testament which is part of Christian teaching is full of blood and thunder, and the history of early Christianity is also by no means creditable to the Christians.
 You ask me to quote from the Vedas passages alike to those in the Koran. You have yourself admitted the reference to the dasyus. The gloss you put upon the passages relating to dasyus may be quite all right; but that is precisely how sympathetic commentators of the Koran explain similar passages. Dasyus do not consider themselves to be wicked.
 
 Everybody justifies his description of practices by imputing wickedness to those whom he distrusts. General Dyer himself surely believed that English men and women were in danger of losing their lives if he did not take the measures he did. We who know better call it an act of cruelty and vengeance. But from General Dyer’s own standpoint, he is justified. Many Hindus sincerely believe that it is a proper thing to kill a man who wants to kill a cowlibtech_580_footnoteand he will quote scripture for his defence and many other Hindus will be found to justify his action. But strangers who do not accept the sacredness of the cow will hold it to be preposterous to kill a human being for the sake of slaying an animal. Guru Nanaklibtech_581_footnotewho undoubtedly read the Koran and is reported even to have gone to Mecca, returned with lofty regard for Islam. Kabirlibtech_582_footnotedid likewise. So did Dadu. I cannot therefore help thinking that it is a fruitless and undesirable effort to show that the Koran is a wicked book and that followers of the Koran are still more so. I suggest that the better method is to find out the good points and the beauties of these writings which have transformed the lives of those who have believed in them. It is unsafe and even dangerous to judge Islam and Mussalmans by the conduct of many of those who are misrepresented here in India and then to seek to ascribe their conduct to the teachings of the Koran. In order to defend the general trend of the Koran in favour of peace I am not required to disprove any atrocity by a single Mussalman or to explain away the few misdeeds that I see going on before me, But my liberal estimate of the Koran thus enables me to extend to the Mussalmans the justice that I would have extended to fellow-Hindus. It is an easier task to sympathize with the different religions of the world than to pick up one and seek to prove it as the only true religion and then set about demolishing all the rest.
 I have entered into a long reply to your letter because I believe you to be a seeker after Truth. If you want any further explanation from me, I shall gladly give it.

  	Throughout the week I have not written to you though I have received 	more than one letter from you. And for the most part for the present 	I propose not to write more than once per week. I want to conserve 	my energy for the work for Young India, Navajivan and Gita. 	I am doing now at least five times as much as I used to on the Gita. 	I want if possible to finish the translation before the end of 	August. And during this rest I would like to give more attention to 	Young India and Navajivan without feeling in any way 	responsible for filling the columns. But of course I shall write 	oftener if necessary or if you again have those moods returning. But 	you will not now.  	I am so glad you resisted the bhang. It is as bad almost as liquor. 	In any case you will remember what I wrotelibtech_584_footnotelibtech_585_footnoteover 	the betel leaf offered by Hakimji—never to eat a single thing 	without knowing it and its quality. In case of doubt always refrain 	and refer to me if     
 necessary. I understand from Jamnalalji to whom I mentioned the matter that Maharajji himself took it. Unfortunately many religi- ously-minded people take for feeling exalted. The exaltation is all false I know. However, you have done your duty by mentioning the thing to him. The things must take their own course now.
 Jamnalalji showed me your Hindi letter to him. It was quite good. The writing was very good. J. leaves for Bombay tomorrow.

  	You have taken on yourselves the management of the store. I regard 	it as a great step forward. Now stick diligently to the work. God 	will help you to succeed. There are plenty of other such duties that 	you can undertake by which you can bring credit to the Ashram. But  	I am in no hurry about it. Since your minds are pure, you will  	gradually take up many new duties of your own accord. Concentrate 	for the present upon making the management of the store a complete 	success. Do not neglect even the smallest detail connected with it. 	You must of course learn how to keep accounts. Do not imagine that 	it is difficult. It is very easy to keep and understand accounts. 	Addition may be difficult. If one does not know the multiplication 	tables or addition, one would certainly experience some difficulty. 	But addition comes with practice. Learn addition, subtraction, 	multiplication and simple division, whichever it is that you do not 	know. All this does 
 involve a little trouble, but once you have mastered these processes the rest is all very easy. If one has the will, one may even  find  it interesting.

   LETTER TO ASHRAM CHILDREN  
 Monday, May 23, 1927 Bal remembers that God was the first brahmachari. The idea seems extremely beautiful to  me.  A  perfect  brahmachari   must   be
perfectly pure. Who else but God can  be   so?   But  we  must   try  to
 become pure like Him. All Shastras proclaim that that is possible. There is nothing but joy in trying to become like Him. It is my experience that we do not get even one-ten-millionth part of that joy from the things of this world which are supposed to give us pleasure. Hundreds of yogis have said the same thing from their experience. Have faith in their experience and try to observe brahmacharya to the best of your ability.

   LETTER TO RADHA  
 May 23, 1927
 I was glad to know that you were not frightened by that lump of earth. It was good that it did not cause you any great hurt. But what even if it had? If at all, such a lump of earth will hurt only the body. The body is like a glass bangle. The glass bangle which is the human body is of no account whatever in the eternity of Brahman, as life of a glass bangle is of none in comparison with the human life-span of a hundred years. What does it matter if it perishes today or tomorrow, or if it develops a crack? The intellect grasps this idea very easily, but one will never know fear if it sinks into one’s heart. Such a person would never do wrong. He would oppress no one. We should return to this thought whenever faced with any danger, and, in order that it may
 come to us unfailingly at such times, we should constantly meditate on it.

    BHAISHRI 	MAMA,  Vaishakha 	Krishna 8 [May 	24, 1927] 
  	I have your letter discussing the problem. It is well written 	indeed, but you will see that I have written no word about Surat and 	Baroda in Navajivan. There was a purpose in this. If I were 	to say that mischievous elements deliberately indulge in hooliganism 	that would have on them the opposite effect [to that intended]. I 	even go to the extent of believing that if the newspapers write 	nothing about the disturbances, they will subside by themselves. But 	not all news- papermen want it, so it will not come to be. But let 	those of us who know remain silent. Let those who want to fight do 	it. If we happen to be present there and feel like sacrificing 	ourselves and if we have the strength let us do it. That’s enough. 	And if we can sacrifice ourselves with a detached mind, let us be 	confident that its result will definitely be good.  	If you ask for your article to be returned you can have it; I have, 	therefore, saved it till now. If I do not hear from you, I shall 	destroy it, after waiting for a while. I 	am steadily improving.

   LETTER TO JAWAHARLAL NEHRU  
 NANDI HILLS (MYSORE STATE)
 May 25, 1927
 MY DEAR JAWAHARLAL,
 I had your letter whilst I was on the sick-list and unable to do much correspondence. I am still convalescing and am able to do only  a moderate amount of work; but I am making steady progress.
 You have been there a long time now; but I know you have not wasted it. I hope however that Kamala will become  completely restored when you return. If her health requires a longer stay, I presume that you will remain there.
 I read most carefully your public report as also your private confidential report about the doings of the Oppressed Nations’ Conference. I myself do not expect much from this league, if only because its free activity depends upon the goodwill of the powers that are partners in the exploitation of the oppressed nations and I feel that the members of the European nations that joined the league will not be able to sustain the last heat. For, they will not be able to accom- modate themselves to what they would consider to be an injury to their self-interest. On our side there is danger of our people again looking to external forces and external aid for salvation instead of seeking to achieve it by evolving internal strength. But this is mere academic opinion. I am not at all carefully  following  European events. You are on the spot and you may see an altruistic improve- ment in the atmosphere there which I miss altogether.
 
 
 There is some talk of your being chosen as President for the coming Congress. I am in correspondence with Father about it.libtech_587_footnoteThe outlook here is not at all happy in spite of the unanimous resolution of the A.I.C.C. on the Hindu-Muslim question. I do not know whether the process of breaking heads will in any way be checked. We have lost hold upon the masses, and it seems to me that if you became President, you will be lost for one year at any rate to the masses. That, however, does not mean that Congress work has to be neglected. Someone has got to do it; but there are many who are willing and eager to do that work, maybe, due to mixed motives, even selfish motives; but they will keep the Congress going on somehow or other. The institution will always be, at their wish, at the disposal of those who may be qualified for mass work and may have gained control over the masses. The question then is how your services can be best utilized. What you yourself think, you should do. I know you are capable of taking a detached view and you will say quite unselfishly like Dadabhai or MacSwiney “put the crown on my head”, and I have no doubt that it will be so put. I do not myself see the way so clear as to make me force the crown on you and plead with you to wear it. Father will be writing to you also by this mail, if he has not done so already. I am sending a copy of this to him.
 It might be as well for you to cable your wishes. I am likely to be in Bangalore till the end of July. You may therefore send your cable directly to Bangalore, or to be absolutely certain send it to the Ashram and it will be repeated to me wherever I may be.
With love to you all,

  	Jamnalalji delivered your letter to me and he told me you were 	sending a long letter. Ever since the receipt of your first letter, 	I have    
 been constantly thinking over the matter. The President is here and he broached the subject yesterday. I mentioned Jawaharlal’s name. He had not thought of it. He, however, preferred Ansari and I told him that if Dr. Ansari could be induced to accept the honour, there was an end to all talk about Jawaharlal and that I thought it would be good luck if Dr. Ansari could be induced to shoulder the burden. However, I have written to Jawaharlal and I send you a copy of my letterlibtech_588_footnotelibtech_589_footnoteto him. It expresses my opinion to date. At first I thought I would let you send my letter so that you could stop it if you liked; but I then thought that after all there was no harm in my letter going to Jawaharlal before you had seen it. You could add whatever you liked to my letter so as to enable Jawaharlal to form a correct judgement.

            DEAR 	MR. CLAYTON,    LETTER TO H. CLAYTON        NANDI HILLS,  May 	25, 1927 
  	I am extremely grateful to you for your prompt and exhaustive reply 	to my letter of the 13th instant. I have carefully gone through the 	cutting from the Municipal Corporation Proceedings of 1918; but  I 	see nothing wrong there to warrant the suggestion that I made any 	inquiry or that I made any report to the late Dr. Turner. As I was 	interested in everything connected with untouchability and as I was 	closely in touch with the Servants of India Society, so far as I 	recollect,   I went with Mr. Thakkar at his instance to see the 	chawls and see the unfortunate people. On hearing that I had gone, 	Dr. Turner sent me a message and I gladly met him and told him what 	I had been doing in the chawls. You will not call this an inquiry by 	me or a report. If I had conducted an inquiry, it would have 	naturally taken a proper shape, I would have taken the evidence of 	men in writing, I would have seen the officials who were charged 	with corruption and made a proper written report. As it was, I 	happened to be in Bombay at the time in the course of my touring and 	Mr. Thakkar took me to the chawls as other people took me to many 	other places. I do not think that this    
 visit of mine and my conversation with Dr. Turner should for ever be used to damage Mr. Thakkar’s reputation as a careful investigator. However, I want to turn this account to a useful purpose. I do not propose at this stage to say anything in the papers. But I am in correspondence with Mr. Thakkar. I am taking the liberty of sending a copy of your letter to him making suggestions to him so that this matter of alleged corruption might be once for all set at rest.
 I quite agree with you that there should be no unfounded accusations made against anything or person and no general accu- sations made against the Corporation staff without adequate evidence to support them. With your permission, after finishing the corres- pondence with Mr. Thakkar, I hope to revert to the subject-matter of my letter.
 Thanking you for your enquiry about myself. I am making fair progress and I shall certainly be delighted when I next pass through Bombay to meet you to revive the pleasant recollections  of our meeting in Godhra.
 Yours sincerely,

  	I have your letter. Now I understand the true nature of Gangadevi’s 	disease. Other things may well continue but she must be taken out. 	She cannot walk by herself. Therefore, either some boys should take 	her out in a chair for half an hour in the open air or even a wheel 	chair may be used. The wheel chair can be managed by one or two boys 	only. She can also lie down in it. Rest is imperative but so is open 	air. You should not hesitate to arrange for this. Ba seldom writes 	to anyone nor am I in the habit of mentioning her in my letters. 	Nevertheless she always remembers everyone. Gangadevi 	should take it that my blessings always include  Ba’s.

      HIGHLY UNSATISFACTORY    	I wish it was possible for me to tender the  Government of Bengal 	congratulations upon the release of Sjt. Subhas Chandra Bose. The 	release has been granted, not because public opinion demanded it, 	not because Government considered the Chief Officer of the Calcutta 	Corporation to be guiltless, nor because they considered that he had 	been sufficiently punished for a crime of which neither he nor the 	public has any knowledge, but because their own medical officers 	considered the distinguished prisoner to be seriously ill, so 	seriously ill as to cause fear about  his  life.  If   Sjt.  Subhas  	Chandra  Bose  is  a danger to society or to the life of anybody, 	and if he is a man of determination as he is reputed to be and even 	believed by the Government to be, he is no less dangerous because he 	is seriously ill. Why should the Government be afraid of his dying 	in their prison? Surely it is not customary with them to release 	every prisoner who becomes dangerously ill. And if it was right to 	discharge him for his illness, why was he not discharged when he 	first showed signs of tuberculosis? Papers have been for a long time 	full of information about the alarming character of his disease. His 	brother repeatedly warned the Government about the prisoner’s 	illness.  	It is, I venture to suggest cowardly to fling a dying man in the 	face of his relatives and wash oneself of the guilt of his death. 	This release brings us no nearer to the solution of the question of 	imprisonment or indefinite detention, without trial, of prisoners 	whom Government choose to suspect. The Bengal Regulation remains 	where it was. More or less healthy detenus must continue to rot, and 	are now deprived of the support of an agitation which was kept at a 	fairly high pitch because a powerful man was under detention. No 	doubt some sort of agitation will still continue for the release of 	the other detenus. But there is every fear of its lacking strength. 	Indian nature is grateful for the smallest mercies. It is easily 	satisfied. And the public will condone the detention of the other 	prisoners for the release of Sjt. Subhas Chandra Bose, forgetting 	that the release is due not to any 
 relenting on the part of the Government but due to Nature’s supreme intervention.
 It may seem cruel, but I must confess that I would far rather not have any release at all than have a release on false issues, which merely complicate the main issue and make it more difficult to deal with than before; for behind the agitation for the release of the detenus is the great question of the liberty of the citizens and the question of extraordinary powers exercised over the lives of people by an utterly irresponsible Government. The one consolation that the public can derive from this painful affair is, that Sjt. Subhas Chandra Bose up to the very last moment manfully declined to accept the humiliating conditions from time to time proposed by the Government for his discharge. Let us hope and pray that he will be soon restored to health and that a long life of service will be vouchsafed to him.

   AN APPEAL TO INDIAN HUMANITY  
 In another place will be found a substance of the observations made in the columns of Navajivan by Sjt. Kishorelal Mashruwala. He is a worker of long standing and was up to recently Registrar of the Gujarat Vidyapith, and it was only due to illness that he was obliged to relinquish the post. He is one of the most thoughtful among the silent workers we have in India. He weighs every word he writes or utters. I mention these qualifications of his; for I am anxious that  his reflections should not be dismissed out of consideration as so many writings nowadays have to be.
 The story of the abuse of the helpless women of the Raniparaj community is a blot upon the nation. Sjt. Kishorelal Mashruwala has made his appeal to the Parsis, and from his standpoint, rightly too. For it is the Parsis who will be better able, if anyone is, to influence the Parsi men who are said to be corrupting innocent womanhood. But I am painfully aware of the fact that it is not the Parsis alone who hold so cheap the honour of poor sisters. Indians belonging to the other faiths, placed in similar circumstances, have been known to behave exactly as the Parsi canteen-keepers are reported to be doing. But that is no justification whatsoever for the inhuman crimes of the latter. The lust for money, which drives these adventurers to a trade which they know saps the manhood of the otherwise fine forest-dwellers miscalled
 Kaliparaj, i.e., black people, tempts them to the worse crime of defilement.
 The British Government or rather the Government of India and the Baroda State must be held primarily responsible for the tragedy described by Sjt. Mashruwala; for it is they, who for their wretched revenue allow liquor shops to be opened or to exist in the midst of these simple people. These people have never asked for these shops, and even if they had, it would be still criminal to open liquor shops for them, even as it would be to allow a little child to play with fire because he desires it. But a reformer does not stop before commencing action to philosophize or to distribute blame through golden scales. He begins his reform wherever the opportunity offers itself. And now that the corruption has been brought to light, it  behoves Parsi reformers to go to the delinquents and appeal to their sense of honour and try to wean them from the crime of violating the womanhood of the simple, innocent and guileless Raniparaj, even if they cannot also be weaned from trafficking in liquor.
 Unfortunately, there is much truth in the taunt levelled at us as a nation, that we have not sufficient regard for the honour of our women. It is no use false patriotism seeking cover under tu quoque argument; nor must we mix up sexual immorality, in which depraved men and women of equal status indulge of their own free but unbridled will, with the instances of crime quoted by Sjt. Kishorelal Mashruwala.
 Immoralities of the first kind are bad enough and do incredible harm to mankind; but the crimes like those of the Parsi canteen-kee- pers are infinitely worse and have not yet, thank God, received the tacit endorsement of fashionable society. In the instances quoted by Sjt. Kishorelal Mashruwala, the canteen-keepers are in the position of trustees, and it is insufferable that they should induce ignorant women in whose midst they are living to become instruments of their criminal lust. It is this kind of indifference to the honour of ignorant sisters who come under the influence or protection of the so-called better class men, which has been justifiably criticized, and which we must, if we want to become a self-respecting and independent nation, outgrow at any cost. The honour of the least among our sisters must be as dear to us as that of our blood-sisters.

   NOTES  
 ALL-INDIA SPINNERS’ ASSOCIATION
 The Council of the All-India Spinners’ Association has, owing to the necessity of prolonged rest that I must take from active and routine work, relieved me of the burden of directing the affairs of the Association and appointed Sheth Jamnalal Bajaj as officiating Chairman. Whilst, therefore, I still nominally remain President of the Association, the whole burden of directing its affairs will now fall upon Jamnalalji, and correspondents will henceforth, whenever they find it necessary, write to him rather than to me. The proper course certainly is to write to the working Secretary Sjt. Shankerlal Banker to whom naturally Jamnalalji will have to refer all correspondence before coming to any decision. This does not mean that I shall take no interest in the affairs of the Association. On the contrary, whenever in the opinion of the Council or the officiating Chairman or the Secretary, any matter should be referred to me, it will come before me for guidance and advice. But the Council’s decision and the arrangements I have come to with it are that I should not worry myself as hitherto over details and over every individual matter trifling or otherwise. They have taken an undertaking from me to refrain from doing so and to throw the burden on them and leave it for them to refer to me matters which they may consider to be important enough for referring to me. The test of a living organization is that it depends upon no single individual, however important, however able he may be. A living organization goes on irrespective of persons. The endeavour of the members of the Council is to make the Association a living and efficiently working organization. I trust, therefore,  that khadi workers and khadi lovers will fall in with the new arrangement and render all the help they can to the Council  in  working  this growing organization to the fullest extent possible.
 AN EXAMPLE TO COPY
 The State of Jaora seems to be noted for its dyeing and printing.  I understand that His Highness the Nawab Saheb is interested in the khadi movement and, in order to make khadi more attractive  by putting it through the dyeing and printing processes and thus to encourage it, he has exempted khadi from any tax. I congratulate the State on this praiseworthy step, and hope that other States will grant favoured treatment to this great and growing national enterprise which
 is fraught with tremendous economic benefit to the starving millions.
 VIVEKANANDA AND SPINNING
 A correspondent sends me interesting extracts from Viveka- nanda’s answers to his American questioners. I take the following from them on spinning:
 Speaking of Indian village life he says: “In some places the common village girl with her spinning-wheel says: ‘Do not talk to me of dualism, my spinning-wheel says, So’ham, So’ham, I am He, I am He.’ What is the value of these machines and sciences? They have only one result; they spread knowledge. You have not solved the problem of want, but only made it keener. Machines do not solve the poverty problem; they simply make men struggle the more. Competition gets keener. The value of everything is to be decided
 by how far it is a manifestation of God.

   LETTER TO SATIS CHANDRA DAS GUPTA  
 NANDI HILLS,
 May 26, 1927
 DEAR SATIS BABU,
 I have your letter and I have one from Kshitish Babu also. You already have seen my notelibtech_590_footnotelibtech_591_footnotein  Young  India.  I  had  assumed  when Jamnalalji who was here told me that I should write a paragraph in Young India about the new arrangement that all the members of the Council had agreed to it. The original idea was to have my resignation in its entirety. The resolution already passed adopts the middle course.  I thought that my ceasing to be the President of the Association would be too hasty and might damage the cause, and it was not warranted by anything in my health. But I thought that it was quite a good idea to relieve me of the responsibility of routine work and let the Council evolve independently of me, whilst my advice and guidance were available wherever necessary.
 Personally, I think that the tour had nothing to do with the collapse. It was the very exacting nature of the work that I myself voluntarily undertook. No one pressed me to go through the hurri-
 
 cane touring. I let the co-workers think and thought myself that my constitution would somehow or other stand the pressure that was put upon it, and do you know that the collapse came upon the very last day of this severe trial? For, I had intended to turn over a new leaf after finishing the Maharashtra tour  and  had  given  due  noticelibtech_592_footnoteto Rajagopalachariar that I would no longer be hurried and was looking forward to finishing the rest of the tours during the year in easy stages. If the collapse had not occurred, I would have thought in my pride that I could tax my constitution to any extent. Nature took her vengeance and she did it so gently that, as Dr. Wanless put it, “it was Nature’s first fairly severe warning”. He thinks, many other doctors think and I think also that, if I regain, as I think it is possible to do, a fair measure of the strength I lost in the twinkling of an eye, I should be able to do a moderate amount of touring. Doctors even think that it might do good, though the condition is imperative that there must be daily rest; no hurry; no bustle; no working to time and order; only one meeting per day, and not much speaking even then and so on. I am trying to adjust my mind to this new mode of life. If I succeed, it may be possible to prolong the life and still do a moderate amount of work. Please, therefore, do not worry about what has happened. Later on, I may even resume the routine work.
 You should regularly give me a weekly letter and tell me how you and all the others are faring. As for myself, I am making steady progress daily. In a month’s time, I might be able to do a little of gentle touring in Madras Presidency in order to take charge of the purses already collected.
 With love, Yours sincerely,
 BAPU

 May 26, 1927
 MY DEAR FRIEND,
 I have your letter now after a long time. I always think of you. You need not be anxious about my health. I am making steady progress. The collapse, though it was temporary, left me very weak. I am however able to attend to a moderate amount of work daily.
I shall look forward to your account of your meeting with Mr.
Ranchhodlal Amritlal.
 I note what you say about the two publications. We should not however mind them. We cannot prevent people from holding what views they like. We have to respect other people’s opinions even though they may not be to our liking even as we expect them to respect ours.

  	I was delighted to receive your letter redirected to me from the 	Ashram. Your yarn is passable, and you should enlist yourself as a 	member of the Spinners’ Association without any misgivings.  	In the hot days, I can understand the takli giving you 	trouble. It would then be best to do it at dawn when you can see the 	thread clearly without artificial light at all. At that time there 	is even in thedriest climate a certain humidity which makes the 	slivers more workable. And, at the time of doing the takli, if 	you are doing it in quiet, you can recite all your Bhagavad Gita 	or any other favourite    
 shlokas.
 Herewith receipt for Rs. 265-3-0 which they have sent me from the Ashram.
 I am glad you have decided to make khaddar wear and spinning compulsory in the Vidyapith.
I hope you have not abandoned the idea of passing some time at
the Ashram.
 
   Enclosure 1  From 	a microfilm: S.N. 19776      LETTER TO R. B. GREGG       MY 	DEAR GOVIND,  Yours sincerely,            NANDI HILLS,  May 	27, 1927 
  	The occasion for writing this letter is supplied by your capital 	letter of the 17th instant to Maganlal of which he has sent me a 	copy.  	Your suggestions are all perfect, if the premises can be accepted by 	us. Probably Maganlal has not even thought of what I am about to 	tell you; though I shouldn’t be surprised if he has also thought 	of the same thing, for I think that he has assimilated the 	inwardness of the spinning movement. What I want to state is this: 	the movement is bound to fail if we expect to succeed by adopting 	the same methods, or very nearly the same methods with necessary 	adaptations, as the adversary, if such a term can be properly used 	under a plan of life which admits of no enemies. In my opinion, we 	have to devise other ways of making the movement a living and 	universal force at least so far as India is concerned. The adversary 	believes in the latest appliances and therefore is bound to adopt 	the methods of those who are adepts in using those appliances; but 	in the spinning movement, modern appliances are largely discarded 	and the few that are retained are used in a different way. 	Typewriters, shorthand assistance and the like are taken in our 	movement as a temporary measure. Immediately one goes to the 	villages, these become a hindrance rather than a help. If the 	movement has to depend upon first-class stenography, it will fail 	before long. For, it cannot make any headway under those conditions 	beyond the cities. It cannot succeed even if it has to depend upon 	the English language for its spread. And so you find that at the 	Ashram, in the Association office and even here we are managing with 	most 
 indifferent stenography. Even if we advertised, we shall probably not get the best stenographer, because he will know that there is room only for half a dozen stenographers in the movement, and then we shall have to pay not 100 or 125, which is the most I think that is being paid, but we should have to pay anything between 200 and 400 for getting the assistance such as you have in mind. I should quite agree with you if you argue that even that salary would be economy even if only one man has to be obtained. Experience, however, shows that it is not possible to retain the services of such a man unless you are prepared to allow him to become the master and to dictate his own terms in every respect. Thus it would be useless to have an able stenographer who has no faith in the movement, who would disdain to wear khadi and who would require polished furniture before he will settle down to work. The spinning movement, so far as I can see, will never afford the high wages that are demanded by good men in such a line of business. Do you know that if in khadi service we offer high wages even to one man, there is immediately and naturally a ferment throughout the rank and file and they would all begin to compare their low wages to the high wages given even to one single man? The proper working of the spinning movement is still being evolved. It is in a state of flux, and it will be some time before it can be said to be stabilized. It is a movement which has to grow from within. It is a movement which requires a fair measure of continuous sacrifice from those who have become accustomed to city life. The class of men and women required for the movement have got to be trained and brought up. They cannot therefore be had by advertising. The reason why we have not got efficient stenography is because no endeavour has been made to train stenographers. It is quite possible for instance to make of Chhaganlal, Mahadev, Krishnadas, Pyarelal and many others whom I can name first-class stenographers. But it was considered not worth- while doing so. It would have been like throwing away a rupee for a pice, and so we are managing with fourth-rate stenographers hoping that if they assimilate the spirit of the movement they will distinguish themselves in the work they have undertaken by coming up to the highest level. I have entered into this elaborate argument—very badly expressed because it is for the first time that I am reducing to writing this thought about the movement—because I am anxious that you who are saturated with the spirit of the spinning movement should understand all that is at the back of my mind and then give me the benefit of your criticism. If I have not expressed myself clearly, as I
 am afraid I have not, do not please hesitate to ask me for further explanation and by an interchange of a few letters, probably, I shall be able to express myself more clearly than I have done. But of course apart from what I have said above, there is much to be said for your view.
 Young India and Navajivan are not all I want them to be. There are reasons for it into which however I need not enter just now. Some are avoidable and some are unavoidable. I hope to be able to cope with those that are avoidable.
 I got the book on vitamins. I read it through as soon as I got it. It is a good book. But it failed to convince me. The  subject  of vitamins has still, so far as I can see, to be investigated. The author’s statement does not appear to me to be the final word. Their ruling out all the nuts and the pulses in preference to meat foods goes against the grain and is contrary to all I have read in the vegetarian literature. If what the authors have said be the final word about them, it is a severe blow to vegetarianism. But the authors could not possibly have sufficient data about the effect of nuts and pulses to enable them to come to a just decision. Accurate observation about the efficacy or the inefficacy of vegetable protein foods can only be made on an  extensive scale in India, where alone one meets thousands of born vegetarians. Their diet and their habits have to be  scientifically observed and analysed before safe deductions can be drawn; and then, too, there are so many disturbing factors. Climate, harmful customs and suchlike have to be taken into account before using the values of foods taken by them. I am therefore taking all the statements in that book with a great deal of caution. The late A. F. Hills was President of the Vegetarian Society in London. He was a good man. I do not know the extent of his scientific knowledge. But he indulged in bold speculations about diet. He carried on a series of experiments himself. He wrote a number of articles on what he called “vital food”. He divided foods into three or four divisions: one for those whose occupation was pre-dominantly body-labour; another for those whose occupation was predominantly intellectual; third for those whose occupation was predominantly spiritual and the fourth for those who were not in a healthy condition. His reasoning used to appeal to me in those days. I do not know whether it would now if I read all his writings afresh. I followed also keenly the controversy going on in the medical profession in those days about food values, and I know that
 one army of doctors defended white bread for all they were worth, and another army suggested that white bread was the staff of death and that the brown bread alone was the staff of life. There was even a Bread Reform League with Miss Yates as its energetic Secretary. I used to come in close contact with the lady. But I learnt even then that either side was fanatical, either produced statistics and analysis of various types of bread. No one had sufficient data for its absolute conclusions. For they could not set a large number of men, who would for the sake of their observations, live purely on brown bread and water or white bread and water. I remember one example that was given by a doctor. I think it was Dr. Allinson. He said he put one of his dogs upon white bread for one month and it died; and another upon brown bread for one month and it lived. The irresistible inference was that white bread was the staff of death and brown bread was the staff of life. He did not state whether both the dogs were kept under restraint the whole of the time, nor did he state whether both the dogs started with the same stamina. Let me confess that in those days, that is nearly 40 years ago, I sided with Dr. Allinson and I swallowed his testimony about the dogs and used to eat nothing but brown bread, and in the brown bread variety also, largely Allinson’s brown bread; because, the worthy doctor took care to emphasize the necessity of taking Allinson’s brown bread, for that alone contained the whole wheat-meal ground to the necessary fineness. He was a good man. I read all his writings. Even in 1914, I consulted him when I was suffering from pleurisy when I constantly refused to take even milk. Probably the worthy doctor is still alive. All the same I came to discount, as experience ripened, most of the argument of the type I have mentioned. The upshot of all this is to tell you that I have not made many changes in my food beyond what I reported to you. I still take unboiled milk. I dilute it with water. The milk that comes fresh from the goats is poured over boiling water; that gives the necessary warmth to the milk and addition of water makes it lighter. I am taking yet a little bread or a little bhakhari made of home-ground wheat, and I am taking one green vegetable. The authors of the book say that addition of soda destroys the vitamins in the vegetables. But without soda, the vegetables refuse to be soft. I have therefore decided to add soda to the vegetable. It is difficult to digest it unless it is thoroughly cooked. Uncooked green cabbage, my system rejects. You will have observed that all the four vitamins are to be found in milk. They are to be found also in the fruits I am taking and therefore I do not lose
 much by adding soda at the time of cooking cabbage or Indian marrow. There is no difficulty about the cooking of spinach without soda and so whenever I get spinach, soda is not added. There is no occasion for worry about my health; for, I seem to be getting better though slowly. No food will give me personal satisfaction unless I can revert to fruits and nuts. But it seems to me that I shall have to close this earthly life without getting that personal satisfaction.

  	I have heard what you wrote about Ramachandra to Mahadev. I have 	nothing to say about it at this moment. Since you have handed over 	my letter to him, watch its effect. Talk over the matter with 	Jamnalalji when he comes there and do what is necessary. Then if 	there is anything for me to write, let me know.  	Govindji’s letter is very nice. I have conveyed to him the 	thoughts  it  raised  in  me.  Herewith  a  copy  of  my  reply.libtech_596_footnotelibtech_597_footnoteRead 	 it yourself and let Narandas too read it. If he has not read the 	original letter, let him do so. If any ideas occur to you on reading 	my reply, write to me. If there is in it anything that you do not 	understand, please let me know. We would obviously be imperfect in a 	field where we do not at all wish to compete with the other party. 	But where we do so or where we claim to specialize, we should try 	and be as perfect as possible. There will be no difficulty in 	publishing in Navajivan or Young India any material 	that you think should appear, if you send it to me and if I approve 	it. If you let me have a draft of an advertisement of books that 	ought to be taken notice of in Young India or 	Navajivan, I shall do what is necessary.     
 I had prepared a note about Henry but I held it back after I had your letter and Jamnalalji’s. Now get it from Swami and examine it; and, if you think it can be included, after making the necessary changes, send it to me. If it is not to be included at all, nothing need be done.

            CHI. 	MIRA,    LETTER TO MIRABEHN        NANDI HILLS,  May 	28, 1927 
  	I have your two letters as also your telegram. In order not to delay 	replying for two days I am resorting to dictation. I do not want to 	break the rule as far as possible of not writing letters myself 	except during silence. Both your letters are precious. I now 	understand the Ashram much better than I ever did before. It is 	almost like having been there myself and seen it. So characteristic 	is your account, and it is usefully supplemented by Valunjker’s 	letter.  	You did well in not entering into the comparative merits of 	respective parties, and I do hope that you will remain unmoved even 	if you hear comparisons that may not please you. Those who enter 	into comparisons do so honestly. That it is improper to enter into 	such comparisons they do not know. And what is the use of being 	ruffled by listening to an expression of views honestly held?  	This use of bhang is a disturbing factor, and if it is not checked 	in time, it will prove the undoing of that institution. But you are 	again right in not insisting on the reform. You have not gone there 	as a supervisor or an inspector to make reforms. You have gone there 	to perfect your study of Hindi and in so doing to give such service 	as you can and as may be acceptable. And that brings me to your 	Hindi. You have been quickened into action yourself. Of course our 	formula has been Hindi first, everything else after. I had felt that 	the formula was being somewhat overlooked. In  my  letters  whilst   	you  were  in  	Delhi, I had emphasized this thing when you were discussing the 	various limitations of the Delhi Gurukul. But I thought that to 	bring the formula up and further in my letters would be undesirable, 	and I 
 knew that you were yourself on the watch and would pull yourself up if you found yourself napping. This you have now done, and I am glad and quite satisfied. Of course there are innumerable things you can do usefully wherever you are placed. And the test of the  possession of the religious sense really consists in one’s being able to pick out the ‘rightest’ thing out of many things which are all ‘right’ more or less. This is the meaning of a verse in the Bhagavad Gita which says: “Better even to die doing one’s duty, however lowly it may be, than doing some other’s however grand it may be.’’libtech_598_footnotelibtech_599_footnoteAnd so, I have myself not a shadow of doubt that you will be entitled to pass by many things which you can easily do, if the one thing for which you have left Sabarmati has at all to be sacrificed or neglected. And, if there or at any other place, you become an unwelcome visitor because of your insistence upon that one thing, that is sufficient warning for you to leave the place. And when you feel that imperative call, you will simply not listen to any other suggestion. But that burning overpowering desire must come from within. I must not goad, I will not goad. I shall be entirely satisfied with what progress you can make, no matter how slow it is. You will do your Hindi in the way that you think is best, and if you find that it is more conducive to your peace of mind to have several other occupations side by side with Hindi, you will take them up. Do not therefore please continuously think of what I would like, but do what you think you can easily, without impairing your health, of both body and mind; and in the execution of your plan when you want my assistance or advice, you shall fall back upon it immediately, as for instance about going to Brij Kishan. Your telegram leads me to think that now there is no occasion for you to leave that Ashram. But you evidently do not know that Brij Kishan has not been keeping well and has therefore been sent to Mussoorie. But if you desire to go to Delhi, I doubt not that you could go to Brij Kishen’s house although he himself is not there. And of course there are many places where you can be sent for your Hindi, if Bhagwadbhakti Ashram does not give you all you want in the shape of Hindi,
With love,
 Yours,
 BAPU

   LETTER GULZARILAL NANDA  
 
 
MY DEAR GULZARILAL,
 
 
 NANDI HALLS,
 May 28, 1927
  	I was delighted to hear from you. Whilst lying on my bed, I have 	constantly thought of so many like you in whom I am deeply 	interested and from whom, I expect many large and big things if only 	God will give them the requisite health for the task before them.  	Your description of a truly religious life is accurate. I have not a 	shadow of a doubt that this blessed state of inward joy and freedom 	from anxiety should last in the midst of the greatest trials 	conceivable. It admits of no exception whatsoever. Naturally, it is 	unattainable except by the very fewest. But that it is attainable by 	human beings, I have also no doubt. That we do not find in history 	evidence regarding the existence of any such person merely proves to 	me that all the record that we have has been prepared by imperfect 	beings, and it is impossible for imperfect beings to give us a 	faithful record of perfect ones. The same may be said of our own 	experiences. We have to be very nearly perfect in order to meet 	perfect souls as you have described. Nor need you think that I have 	laid down an absurd proposition inasmuch as it is incapable of being 	recorded, or being experienced by the average man. To raise such a 	doubt would be begging the question, for we are here picturing to 	ourselves extraor- dinary mortals, though mortals nevertheless, and 	surely extra-ordinary powers are required to find out these 	extraordinary mortals. This statement is true even of much lesser 	things, things almost ridiculous, and yet very difficult of 	accomplishment, such, for instance, as the discoveries of Sir J. C. 	Bose or the finest paintings. Both these, we average beings will 	have to take on trust. It is only the privileged few who have got 	the special faculty for understanding and appreciating either those 	discoveries, or those paintings. These do not appear to us to be 	incredible and we are able to accept them on faith only because in 	favour of these we have the testimony of a larger number of 	witnesses than we can possibly have for the things of permanent 	value, such as human perfection of the utmost type. Therefore the 	limitation that you have accepted is quite a workable thing for the 	time being. For, even inside the limitation, there is ample scope 	for widening the field for the progress of the state of being and 	remaining unruffled in the face of the onslaught of sorrows and 	trials, which before regeneration would have paralysed us. I 	am glad you have intensified your devotions. I do not know 
 what you are reading at present. And I do not know whether I told you that we must arrive at a time when we do not need the solace of many books but that we make one book yield us all we want. In the last stage, of course, when life becomes one of perfect surrender and complete self-effacement, the support of even one book becomes unnecessary. At the present moment, though I am reading  many things, the Bhagavad Gita is becoming more and more the only infallible guide, the only dictionary of reference, in which I find all the sorrows, all the troubles, all the trials arranged in the alphabetical order with exquisite solutions. I think I did tell you that the Song Celestial was the best rendering I had come across of the Bhagavad Gita. But if you do not know Sanskrit, I know that a knowledge of Sanskrit to enable you to understand the Bhagavad Gita is easily within your power. You can almost in a month’s time know enough Sanskrit to understand the original text. For, though the English rendering is grand and though you might be able to get some Hindi or Urdu translation also, of course there is nothing like the original. The original will enable you to give your own meaning and gloss to the text. That book is not a historical record, but it is a record of the concrete experiences of its author, whether it was really Vyasa or not I am not concerned. And if it is a record of anybody’s experience, it must not be beyond us to be able to test the truth of it by repeating the experience. I am testing the truth almost every day in my life and find it never failing. This of course does not mean that I have reached the state described, for instance, at the end of the Second Chapter. But I know that the more we carry out the prescription given in it, the nearer do we answer the description given of the perfect state.
 I hope you are keeping good health. I am of course making steady progress.
 Yours sincerely,
 BAPU

 DEAR FRIEND,
 I have your kind letter with your subscription for Young India. If you do not get it regularly, please report it to the manager and let me have a line also.
 Please do not have any anxiety about my health. I am taking all the necessary care and am giving myself as much rest as it is possible to give.

    LETTER TO MAHARAJA OF NABHA        NANDI 	HILLS, 
    DEAR 	FRIEND,  May 	28, 1927 
  	I have your letter of the 20th instant. I do not know why you 	considered my letter of the 1st January to be insulting. I can only 	give you my assurance that no insult was intended.  	The paragraph you have copied in your letter, I do not understand.  	You are wrong in inferring that the letter of 1st January was either 	dictated or prompted by Pandit Motilalji. I had left  the  Congress 	before the session was over, and I did not know that Pandit 	Motilalji was in Calcutta on the 1st January. But whether he was or 	not, he certainly knew nothing even of the fact that I was writing 	to you. I simply felt that I would be doing a friendly turn by 	writing to you as I did.    
 I know nothing about the Lakhna Raj case. Your letter was the first information to me about even the existence of Lakhna Raj. That there was any case in connection with it, I had no knowledge whatsoever.
 I venture to think that your description of Pundit Motilalji is, to say the least, ungentlemanly. He may be all the things you have said of him, but the code of honour prevalent in good society debars one from impugning before a stranger the character of any man, whoever he may be. And, after all, I am a perfect stranger to Your Highness. In spite of your imputations on the character of Pundit Motilalji he remains for me a high-souled, able, self-sacrificing patriot enjoying in the country a position not attained by many public workers. As it happens at the present moment, his politics are not my politics. But if they were mine, I should certainly deem it an honour to allow my judgement to be influenced and tested by his.
 
    HIS 	HIGHNESS 	THE 	MAHARAJA 	OF 	NABHA 	DEHRA 	DUN 	(U.P.)  From 	a photostat: S.N. 12581  Yours 	sincerely, 
   
             DEAR 	DOCTOR,    LETTER TO DR. M. S. KELKAR        NANDI HILLS,  May 	28, 1927 
  	I have your letter. Though I do not propose to trouble you to come 	over here, I would like you definitely, if you can, to write out 	what you will have me do, and I shall incorporate as many of your 	suggestions as it is possible for me.  	I cannot get distilled water in Nandi. I know that it can be made by 	oneself. But I have not got the proper tubes and utensils for it 	here. When I go down to Bangalore, I shall see whether I can procure 	distilled water.  	As it is, I take raw milk diluted with boiling water. This seems to 	agree with me better. I am taking 30 ounces of raw milk and about 	two ounces of whole-meal flour turned into bhakhari to which 	is added a little butter, soda and salt. I take also one vegetable 	well boiled and added to it a tea-spoonful of fresh butter from 	goat’s milk.  I add to the morning milk the juice of 10 full-grown 	leaves of neem 
 tree. I sleep well and I do about four hours’ dictation daily, one hour’s writing and at least one hour’s reading. This is fair amount of work for a patient who is convalescing. In addition to this, I have half an hour’s fairly brisk walk in the morning and half an hour in the evening. And I retire at 9 in the night and get up at 4 in the morning. Of course the morning and the evening prayers are there. I do also deep-breathing morning and evening. I sleep about an hour and half during the day with an earth bandage on the head. Now you may make any suggestions you like.
 Now about yourself. I am really most anxious to help you. But, in spite of all the goodwill in the world, I have not been able to enthuse over your treatment. I think it is wrong to say that all the patients I placed at your disposal were those who had passed through many doctors and had almost been given up. You had Prabhudas, you had his grandfather, you had Gomatibehn, you had Navin, and many others whose names I can recall if I tax my memory. Your insistence upon eggs and your great partiality for astrology are two serious drawbacks. I respect your insistence upon eggs. But they don’t suit my religious sense. I respect also your partiality for astrology. But I cannot get rid of my scepticism about it. Therefore I can only make a limited use of your attainments.
 I wonder whether you have studied the use of asanas as part of treatment of disease. My attention has been recently drawn to them. But as you have a fair knowledge of physiology, I would like you, in the light of that knowledge, to examine the claims made on behalf of the various asanas. Have you also studied the newest researches made about vitamins?
 Yours sincerely,
 DR. M. S. KELKAR 342, SADASHIV PETH POONA CITY

  	Your letter. I learn from Surendra’s letter that you have grown 	very weak. Strength which is lost will come back only gradually. 	Need I tell you to have patience? Moreover, the presence of Nathji 	is for you a soothing balm. I write this not with the expectation of 	any reply from you but only to bring you peace, if I can. Ramniklal 	will write, if necessary; if you want to convey anything to me, tell 	him about it. But on no account should you write yourself. I find 	from my own experience that good fresh milk, that is, pure milk if 	available there, is easier to digest, when mixed with boiling water. 	Moreover, all doctors here agree that if a cow is free from disease, 	if its udders are washed, if the container is clean and the milkman 	washes his hands well with hot water before milking the cow, such 	fresh milk when taken without boiling is more nourishing and easier 	to digest. If it is boiled, the vitamins are destroyed.  	We have already a long tradition of drinking slow-boiled milk.  	So if it is available, give it a trial. Ba 	sends her blessings.

          BHAI LAKSHMIDAS,    LETTER TO LAKSHMIDAS      May 	28, 1927 
  	Your letter. I have read Bhai Jethalal’s letter. We have been 	doing khadi work in the native States. But I have always had a fear 	that when the impact of khadi begins to tell on foreign cloth, it 	will be attacked from all quarters; I doubt whether at that time we 	shall be able to carry on our work in the native States. If our 	tapascharya is prolonged and sincere, we might 	perhaps survive such attacks. Now the question naturally arises what 	stand we should take in the native States during this transitional 	period. My inner voice tells me that we should plainly reject [their 	favour] if it means giving undertakings which would compromise our 	honour. How can we give in writing anything that would seem like 	ignoring Pathik and Ramnarayan? We should talk to them politely and 	try to persuade them. ‘We propose to do only khadi work in your 	territories. That too as a matter  of business. We have no wish to 	interfere in the affairs of your State.’ This we shall state, if 	you like, in writing. ‘We wish to do khadi work in your State 	merely from the business point of view. But we do not want this to 	be interpreted to mean that even outside your State we will have 	nothing to do with politics or that we have no line of thought on 	the subject. We have no political affiliations with Pathik and 	others, but we do not wish to by-pass them in any way; nor do we 	regard them as traitors. But we do not wish to be instrumental in 	harming them in their relations with you.’ I think we should 	boldly say something to this effect. If we do not act in some such 	way khadi will lose its power. If the Government takes away khadi 	work from us and gets it done arbitrarily through its own machinery, 	shall we be able to attach all the power to khadi that we do today? 	In short, we would swallow many a bitter pill for the sake of khadi. 	We may put up with personal insults, but even khadi work may not be 	carried on under such circumstances as would compromise our 	principles. The fact is that under such circumstances, khadi work 	simply cannot be done. Perhaps you are not aware that an attempt was 	made to get the Charkha Sangh registered. The Charkha Sangh is  an  	independent limb of the Congress enjoying the power to secede from 	the parent body. The officials agreed to register it if this 	spiritual bond were broken. We decided against getting the Charkha 	Sangh registered and 
 declined to snap that bond.
 Well, I am dictating this from a height of 5,000 feet; you may therefore look at it in the right perspective after making the necessary allowances. I write not for being acted upon, but only because it may help you in finding some solution. I have discussed this matter with Jamnalalji to some extent. He will soon be at the Ashram when you too should see him and do what you all wish to. But then “the master’s advice must be left at the door’’.libtech_601_footnote

   WELCOME DONATION FOR CAUSE OF SUPPRESSED CLASSES  
 A telegram has been received from Shri Vallabhbhai saying that a generous gentleman has donated Rs. 50,000 for the benefit of the suppressed communities, and another has donated Rs. 2,500. I saw in the papers that the name of the first donor is Mansukhlal Chhaganlal. It seems that the other has not thought it proper to let his name be known. I congratulate both these gentlemen. My conviction grows stronger day by day that such thoughtful  donations  are  alone religious charities. It is a happy sign that the desire to make donations for religious causes is still alive among us. But we hardly know what is religion. I have often said that in this age much adharma is done in the name of dharma. On the one hand, therefore, we have to nurse the religious sentiment of the people and, on the other, we have to point out the right way for the exercise of that sentiment. Good intentions by themselves do not take one to heaven. There is a saying in English that the path to hell is paved with good intentions. There is much truth in this. Many thieves steal with good motives. Many are those who tell lies with good motives. Even a religious person like Yudhishthira makes the mistake of uttering a falsehood with a good motive, and for that he had to suffer the stink of hell. We see ourselves that numerous murders are committed with good motives. Hence, good intentions by themselves are unavailing. They should be accompanied by good deeds, and that is possible only if we have right knowledge. It would
 
 be good, therefore, if religious-minded men and women follow the example of these two donors, find out religious causes and support them.

   MEANS OF COW-PROTECTION  
 Shri Pragji Mavji, manager of the pinjrapole in Nasik, makes the following suggestions in a letterlibtech_602_footnotewhich he has written:
 In these suggestions there is not much that is new and has not been said in Navajivan. But I have printed them to show  how  a devoted servant of mother cow and experienced manager of a pinjrapole supports the suggestions which have been made earlier in these columns. The letter also contains some useful information. For instance, the information about the use which contractors make of dead cattle, if these are handed over to them, is such as will shock us. Such wicked things happen because, in the name of religion, people themselves do not make use of the dead animals but hand them over to others. The suggestion in regard to bones needs some modification. Burying bones as they are does not produce manure; they have to be ground into powder. The flesh and intestines need not be buried. Intestines are used even now for making leather strips, strings for musical instruments and catguts, and the fat obtained from flesh is used in great quantities for lubricating machinery. So there remains very little to be buried in its natural form. But this concerns the future. If we accept in principle that by making in goshalas and pinjrapoles all those things against the use of which we have no  religious objection, we can save the maximum number of cattle, other discoveries will follow.
 The reproach to cow-protection workers implied in the last suggestion deserves attention. Every such worker should bear in mind that there is a greater need for workers who will devote themselves to active work of service and make themselves proficient in their field of work than for preachers who go round exhorting others.
 But, along with this  letterlibtech_603_footnote,  I  have  before  me  a  press-cutting containing a long interrogatory addressed to me on the question of
 
 cow-protection. The underlying suggestion obviously seems to be that the methods of cow-protection advocated by me are not consistent with my profession of Hinduism. For in his introductory remarks to his questions the writer has tried to make light of the basic principle of cow-protection that I have formulated, viz., that what is economically wrong cannot be religiously right. In other words, if a religion cuts at the very fundamentals of economics it is not a true religion but only a delusion. My critic on the other hand believes that  this  view  is opposed to the teachings of our ancient scriptures. I, at least, am not aware of a single text in opposition to this view nor do I know of any religious institution that is being maintained in any part of the world today in antagonism to the elementary principles of economics. As for Nature, anyone who has eyes can see, that it always observes the principle that I have stated. For instance, if it has implanted in its creation the instinct for food it also produces enough food to satisfy that instinct from day to day. But it does not produce a jot more. That is Nature’s way. But man, blinded by his selfish greed, grabs and consumes more than his requirements in defiance of Nature’s principle, in defiance of the elementary and immutable moralities of non-stealing and non-possession of other’s property and thus brings down no end of misery upon himself and his fellow-creatures. To turn to another illustration, our Shastras have enjoined that the Brahmin should give knowledge as charity without expecting any material reward for it for himself. But they have at the same time conferred upon him the privilege of asking for and receiving alms and have laid upon the other sections of the community the duty of giving alms, thus uniting religion and economics in a common bond of harmony. The reader will be able to find further instances of this kind for himself. The religious principle requires that the debit and credit sides of one’s balance-sheet should be perfectly square. That is also the truest economics and therefore true religion. Whenever there is any discrepancy between these two it spells bad economics and makes for unrighteousness. That is why the illustrious author of the Gita has defined yoga as “balance” or “evenness”. But the majority of man- kind do not understand this use of economics to subserve religion; they want it only for amassing “profits” for themselves. Humanita- rian economics, on the other hand, for which I stand, rules  out  “profits” altogether. But it rules out “deficit” no less for the simple reason that it is utterly impossible to safeguard a religious institution by following a policy of dead loss. That is the reason why in spite of
 our 1,500 goshalas we have not only failed to protect the cow, but its slaughter is day by day on the increase. If in spite of this we delude ourselves into the belief that we have done our duty by the cow by establishing these homes for cattle, and remain smugly self-satisfied there, whatever comfort it may give us, it won’t bring us one whit nearer the goal of cow-protection, whereas it can be demonstrably shown that by adopting the policy that I have suggested we can easily realize this goal. It does not require much effort to see that but for the fact that the cow yields us milk, the duty of cow-protection would not have come into being at all. There are a host of  other  innocent animals besides the cow in the world but nobody has ever thought of setting up their protection as a religious obligation, and if somebody had attempted it, it would have simply remained a dead-letter. We have use for the cow. That is why it has become religiously incumbent on us to protect it.
 To turn now to the questionnaire drawn up by my critic, I will embody the questions in my answers without reproducing them separately:
  Every 	goshala or Pinjrapole 	should have 	a  tannery adequate 	to its 	needs attached to 	it. In 	other words, the 	manager in 	charge of 	every such institution 	should have a thorough 	knowledge of the 	immediate steps 	necessary for utilizing 	the remains 	of dead 	cattle. If 	this is 	done, the 	question, viz., 	how many 	heads of cattle 	should a particular 	goshala contain, won’t arise at all.  I 	do not 	know what the rate of 	mortality of 	cattle in goshalas 	is, nor is 	it relevant to 	my proposition. So 	long as 	there is 	a single 	head of cattle 	in a 	goshala, its 	manager ought 	to know 	how to 	dispose of 	its remains 	after it 	is dead, just as 	he is expected to 	know how 	to look after it while it is alive.  Such 	humanitarian 	institutions for the 	protection of 	cattle as 	I have 	described should 	normally take charge 	of the 	remains of 	the cattle 	that might 	die in 	the village. 	Therein lies the 	interest of the 	cattle, the 	depressed classes and 	the general public 	alike. In villages 	where there are no 	goshalas or 	the concomitant 	tanneries, some local 	person who 	believes in 	cow-protection should 	take it 	upon himself 	to get 	the carcasses removed to 	the nearest tannery or 	get the preliminary 	processes performed upon it 	and send 	the useful 	parts there.  The 	establishment of 	such tanneries 	as I have described 	does not require much capital outlay. Only some initial expenditure 
 would be needed to train up workers for this work.
  It 	is true that 	at present the 	leather prepared 	from slaughtered 	hides is 	superior in 	quality to 	that prepared 	from dead 	hides. But 	during the 	late War the Government 	of India spent enormous 	sums of 	money to 	improve the 	quality of 	leather from 	dead hides; 	and tannery 	experts have told me 	that dead hides 	can be 	tanned into 	as good 	leather as 	leather from 	slaughtered hides. 	I myself 	am conducting 	experiments in this 	direction. In Cuttack, 	Sjt. Madhusudan Das has 	been doing the same for a 	number of 	years and with success as he tells 	me. The Calcutta 	Government Research Tannery is 	also at 	present engaged in 	similar experiments. 
 But the tragedy of it today is that we annually export crores worth of hides to foreign countries, and by ignorantly using leather goods made from the hides of slaughtered cattle, become indirectly participators in the sin of their slaughter.
 It rests in our hands entirely to prevent the export of hides of our dead cattle to foreign countries. And this we can easily do by bringing the export trade in hides under our control through the establishment of tanneries on altruistic lines. We cannot only save nine crores of rupees annually to our country but by employing that sum properly save a countless number of cattle.
 I need hardly say that the humanitarian tanneries that I have suggested would also be utilizing the bones and other useful parts of the dead cattle. In fact it is more necessary than ever.

  	I sent you a fairly long reply to your two letters and wire. I have 	not heard in continuation of your wire. This dictation enables me to 	overtake much work without tiring me, as I can do the dictation 	lying down. It is likely that in the course of a few days, we shall 	remove to Bangalore, as it is getting very windy here and the 	climate seems to be too bracing for me. I must not yet take brisk 	walks. You may there- 
 fore safely write your letters now addressed to Bangalore. Coomara Park will very probably be the address. You will say Bangalore City because there are two watertight divisions, Cantonment and City, and unless ‘City’ is mentioned, the letters first go to the Cantonment as they do all over India where there is also a Cantonment.
 There is nothing new to report so far as health is concerned. I think I did tell you that I had reverted to bhakhari and a vegetable.

Only it facilitates my work and therefore recovery if I do what 	little I can from day to day and have no arrears weighing upon my 	mind.  	Letters like the one you have sent me I rarely publish. The rule is 	to publish such letters when there is something in them which 	requires a public discussion.

I see that your letter is three letters rolled into one. Please tell 	Perin and Khurshed that you are not there to encourage their 	laziness.

 MY DEAR GOVIND,
   LETTER TO R. B. GREGG  
 
 
 NANDI HILLS,
 May 29, 1927
 
  	I have your very important letter. It crossed mine. I cannot 	appropriate the credit you give me for gentle criticism of your 	hand- writing. What I wanted to say was that although I liked 	handwritten letter, there was no occasion for you to revert to 	writing your letters for my sake and that you should continue 	type-writing as you believe in it, and as I know it does result in 	economy of time. Nor do I consider your handwriting to be bad. It 	might be clearer. But fortuna- tely for my friends I have my own 	writing as the criterion and that being so, I know very few whose 	writing is worse than mine, and yet because of my dislike of 	typewriters, if I could possibly write with my own hand, I will 	inflict that illegible hand in preference to having my letters typed 	or typing them myself. The reason underlying is this. If I have any 	concern for my friends, I should endeavour to write a better and 	more legible hand. Typewriter is a cover for indifference and 	laziness. Moreover I believe in the dictum —handwriting reveals 	the writer. Typewriting certainly results in economy of time. But 	whilst I admit that time is money, I do not admit that money is 	everything, and therefore I can conceive innumerable occasions when 	economy of time would be misplaced. And the inroads that the 	typewriter is making have all but destroyed the magnificent art of 	calligraphy. I wonder if you have seen old handwritten manuscripts 	when people used to pour forth their very soul into their work. But 	I must not stray away from the subject on which I want to write.  	Your suggestions about selecting a few untouchable boys and making 	them ideal farmers does great credit to your heart. But it betrays 	your  ignorance of the situation. Even if half-a-dozen untouchables 	could be trained as you suggest, that will in no way bring us nearer 	the solution of the problem of untouchability. To petrify on this 	matter—Hindu mind will immediately say, we shall touch every 	untouchable who qualified as these six men have. You perhaps know 	that there have been many and many pariah saints, but their 	sainthood has not saved this suppressed class. The orthodox mind 	again argues the pariah saint becomes so because of his past karma 	and he naturally commands our respect. When the others do likewise, 	they will also command the same respect. It is this immoral 
 deduction from the theory of karma which has got to be combated at every step and the Hindu mind has got to be educated by fierce penance and understanding that the theory of karma is not intended to kill all reform and all efforts, but that it is intended for mankind to work out all evil karma and he who does not do so is not entitled to belong to the human species. The Hindu mind has therefore to be educated to regard intrinsically as equals the lowest, the fallen and the downtrodden and to give them a helping hand so as to make them level with the rest. And why, apart from the question of untouc- hability, should not the most promising young men be sent out to become accomplished farmers and try the experiment suggested by you? Surely you do not wish to imply that the touchables in their pride will not care to learn farming with a view to utilizing human excreta as manure. If that is your argument, it would be wrong to expect untouchables to handle work which others would consider as degrading. As you know at the Ashram, we have untouchable boys. We do not even ask them to do the sanitary work. The initiative is taken by the so-called high-caste men; for, on such points  the  so-called untouchables would be very touchy. I am having that experience everywhere. Underlying your suggestion, therefore, is the question not of untouchability but of improved farming methods  along simple lines. But I have simply not handled this question energetically because I believe in the doctrine of one thing at a time. There is much scattered work here, so much laziness, so much blind imitation, so little concentration that it is necessary to hammer away at one very simple but fairly universal thing, and if that succeeds, the rest can follow. And agriculture is an industry which  can  only  be improved when it receives state assistance. In an ill-governed country, I think with Thoreau that the citizen who resists the evil government must ignore property rights. And without assurance of settled ownership, it is impossible to do much in the way of agriculture. I do not want to elaborate this thing. I have said sufficient to enable you to fill in the rest. Whilst your suggestion does not seem to me to be feasible so far as the untouchables are concerned and difficult of accomplishment, even as a general scheme the extract sent by you is valuable and I propose as soon as I find space to reproduce it in Young India so that those who are at all inclined in the direction might take the matter up.
I did not get the larger volume about vitamins. What I got was
 Food and Health. But that book also gives enough information about
 vitamins. Dr. Kellogg’s writings I know. I have read his book, and if it has not been lost as many of my books have been, it must be in the Ashram library. However, you seem to know him personally, and I shall look forward to what he has to say. Have you put the whole case before him and asked whether he can suggest an effective vegetarian substitute for milk in the case of patients?

If Mirabehn talks to them of the 	spinning-wheel, they are surprised. They cannot of course understand 	that spinning is necessary in the interests of the poor. Their idea 	of religion is visiting the temple. They hardly know what ‘service’ 	is. It may be that some of this is a result of Mirabehn’s lack of 	experience.

 May 29, 1927
 I hope you will get from this work all the intellectual and spiritual nourishment you need. I have no doubt that once you have mastered the elements of this science you will get thoroughly interested in it. Learning the elements of anything is always difficult and irksome. It is so with the delightful art of music too. We all know about mathematics. The same is the case of this grand and noble science of the charkha. I call it grand because the more closely we study it the more we discover in it. And we need as much skill to attain proficiency in it as in any other major craft. I call this noble because it touches millions of people. I know of no other  science  save agriculture which has such universal applica-tion. Therefore I wish your devotion to this task is strengthened.
 I have understood your nature. You keep away from a thing so long as your head and heart do not accept it fully and this is quite right. Write to me about your experiences.

   LETTER TO IMPERIAL INDIAN CITIZENSHIP ASSOCIATION  
        DEAR 	FRIEND,  NANDI HILLS,  May 	31, 1927 
  	I wish your meeting every success. The Rt. Hon’ble Srinivasa 	Sastri embarks upon his arduous mission under the best of auspices. 	He takes with him the goodwill of all India, and both the Europeans 	and our countrymen in South Africa are looking forward  to  his 	advent. I know that if any man can possibly produce  harmony between 	the Europeans and the Indian settlers, it is certainly Sjt. 	Srinivasa Sastri. May God give him all the wisdom and all the 	strength he will need in South Africa.  Yours 	sincerely,  THE SECRETARY  THE 	IMPERIAL 	INDIAN 	CITIZENSHIP 	ASSOCIATION 	PETIT BUILDING  359, HORNBY 	ROAD 	BOMBAY  From 	a photostat: S.N. 12355      LETTER TO SATIS CHANDRA DAS GUPTA    NANDI HILLS,  May 	31, 1927  DEAR 	SATIS BABU,  	I have your letter. I have said my say. I understand your reasoning 	and value your determination. However, I send you the book on Food 	and Health. As a chemist you will understand it better than I 	can. Personally, I challenge many of the authors’ conclusions. But 	my challenge is based upon prejudice. I attack their data on 	insufficiency of evidence; but I have no data myself to support my 	challenge. I know the healthier condition of widows.  	So far as Nikhil is concerned, he need never go to Calcutta. If 	Hemaprabha Devi can be happy at the Ashram, she can live with Nikhil 	there and husband his strength. Or, she can stay in Patna, and she 	can be in Wardha also with quarters all to herself. 
 I must finish Madras and would really like to go through the other provinces also if I can do them gently and in a leisurely fashion leaving ample margin for rest and having no more than one meeting per day or even per two days. Not to do Madras, if I can at all manage it, would be criminal as there is already nearly three lakhs of rupees collected and locked up and people will not part with it unless I present myself to receive it. I can therefore combine rest and work. It becomes fairly cool in the Madras Presidency in the month of July. The whole of June will be spent in resting. The Mysore tour will be easy, because Mysore is on a higher level. It is a plateau of 3,000 feet above the sea level and the climate at this time of the year is exceptionally mild. Then there are other parts of the Madras Presidency too which are quite cool. And Karnatak is perfect after June. You need have therefore no worry whatsoever, and, of course, I shall be taking soundings as the tour progresses. What is more, the ever kind and the ever vigilant Nature will give warning betimes of any danger that may be lurking. And then, in spite of all the extraordinary precautions, she will one day send her messenger who like a thief in the night will steal in some day and unperceived by anybody administer the dose which will send me to long sleep.

      LETTER TO C. VIJAYARAGHAVACHARIAR    NANDI HILLS,  May 	31, 1927  DEAR 	FRIEND,  	I have your letter. Either Jamnalalji committed a blunder or the 	interviewer. There is absolutely no chance even if I become obdurate 	of my being able to resume my tour in the middle of June. Let alone 	the doctors, I have myself no such confidence. Nandi has done me 	good. But there is much leeway yet to be made up. I get easily tired 	and I cannot move about with ease. A month more is the very least I 
 shall require. What I feel is that I shall not be able to venture out much before the third week of July.
 Rajagopalachari is not just now here. He has gone to Bangalore to find and prepare quarters for me there as the weather here is now becoming too bracing for me. He is the jailor in charge and it is he who has to dispose of me finally, so far as this Presidency  is  concerned. But in so far as I have any control over my rnovements, I would certainly love to be your guest if Salem is on the list at all. And, if it is not on the list, you can easily have it on the list by collecting a fat purse for the dumb millions from among your  innumerable  friends in Salem.
 I never know that the European Association at Calcutta had passed such an original resolution as you have described.
 Yes, I do feel, without being able to assign any justification for the feeling, that behind all the seeming anarchy, order  is  being evolved and that we shall not for ever remain a damned country.

 DEAR FRIEND,
 I have your letter. At the present moment I can only ask you to read the reprint of the articles I wrote in Young India. The reprint is called Self-restraint v. Self-indulgence. It can be had at the Young India office, Ahmedabad. And if you propose to get the book and read it, you may correspond with me after you have read it and tell me whether you have found any help. Meanwhile I can only pray that God may give you the right guidance and strength of mind to do the right thing.

           DEAR 	FRIEND,    LETTER TO BASANTA KUMAR RAHA    NANDI HILLS,  May 	31, 1927 
  	I have your letter. As I do not know whether the English letter is 	written by you or for you, I shall have a translation of this letter 	enclosed with this.  	It is not because I do not want to comply with your proposal but 	because I have no fitness for becoming anybody’s guru, being 	myself in search of one. After all a person who sets out to become 	anybody’s guru, if he is a sincere man, must have confidence in 	himself. The relation of a teacher and disciple is not a mechanical 	one but it is organic. The only suggestion, therefore, that I can 	make to you is that if you cannot be satisfied with personal effort 	and struggle, you can have the guru of your imagination; but then it 	won’t be my conscious self; for I should be utterly incapable of 	giving you unerring guid- ance which a true guru is supposed to give 	and you may draw what 
 comfort it is possible for you to do from the imaginary picture. I am sorry that I can give you no other or further comfort. The best thing one can do however is to kneel down to God above and ask Him to give the required guidance. He is the only source of light and of peace.

I understand your difficulties and your 	struggles as I have always done and have therefore sympathized with 	you even whilst I have been powerless to give you any help or 	guidance. Personally, as I have implied in my letter to the 	President, I have not much faith in patched-up compromises brought 	about by mutual fear. And then, the contracts made by us, polished 	patriots, have no effect upon the masses, who either act under the 	impulse of the moment or under the guidance of mischief-makers. We, 	the so-called representatives of the people, build airy houses of 	our own imagination. But I suppose the imaginary is real to the one 	who sees it as such, and what is real is imaginary to him. A shadow 	is the real dog 
 to the one who only sees his own self through the clear water and bleeds himself to death by straining every nerve in barking at his own shadow.
 When you are sufficiently sick of the business and tired, do come and pass a few days with me. I descend from this hill in the course of the week and shall be in Bangalore at least for one month.

 476. LETTER TO TULSI MAHER
 [End of May 1927]libtech_607_footnote
 
CHI. TUSI MAHER,
 I have your letter. I am sorry to read of your illness. You need not have been over-enthusiastic. All that we do must be done with a detached mind. And nothing done in this way will be beyond our capacity and therefore affect our health. You should spare no pains so long as you are not attached to results. To exert oneself beyond that is to ruin one’s health and undo the work done. That was the cause of my breakdown. I did not observe even a nominal limit to my capacity during and after my tour of Maharashtra. Now I am  paying  the penalty ten times over. Had I added even of a quarter of the last two months (spent in rest] to the Maharashtra tour, the programme would have been completed smoothly and possibly I would have been spared this illness. For me the shore is in sight but you have just set out on your voyage. Taking a lesson from my case you should calm down and do quietly whatever you can. Milk and ghee may  be  taken without any qualms if considered necessary for recouping your strength. Haven’t I said that a friend who gives up milk and ghee is himself responsible for the risk incurred and that if he cannot sustain his body with this abstinence he must forthwith return to the milk and ghee diet.

 I  expect to  have another letter from you before you reply  to

I now understand that the pamphlet was seen by one of my companions; but, as it was seen a long time after its receipt by him and as I was in the midst of my work which hardly left me time to see any pamphlet, he did not bring it to my notice. I am sorry that it remained without acknowledgement. I have now sent for it. I have leisure enough during my convalescence to look at your pamphlet; and if I trace it, I shall certainly read it and let you have my views upon it.
 I am sorry that you had to remain in suspense for such a long time with reference to the two matters about which you had a right to expect from me at least an acknowledgement and it is contrary to my habit to leave such things unacknowledged.
    H. HARCOURT, 	ESQ. 	119, GIPSY HILL 	LONDON 	S.E. 19  From 	a photostat: S.N. 12494    479. LETTER TO J. P. BHANSALI  Yours sincerely,                  June 	1, 1927 
  	How can I put obstacles in your way or in the way of anyone else 	who, prompted by a religious motive, undertakes a religious effort. 	But I wish to place a suggestion before you. Fasting concerns the 	body. Hence, though it has an important place in one’s spiritual 	develop-ment, relatively it is a small thing. It is a means and 	serves a useful purpose only when the mind is behind it. I know that 	your mind cannot but be behind your fast, otherwise you could not 	have fasted for so many days. Nevertheless please think more deeply 	over the matter and reconsider it. Do you fast for some sort of 	self-puri- fication? Do you weigh afterwards the benefits of your 	fasts? Or are you indifferent towards them? If you are, how do you 	justify your fasts as spontaneous acts? The desire for fruit is 	implicit in describing a fast as meant for self-purification. This 	is not an unworthy desire; it is a worthy one. In interpreting what 	is meant by the desire for fruit, one must use discrimination. One’s 	duty is to be a mumukshu. A mumukshu is one who aspires after moksha. The true meaning of    
 renunciation of the desire for fruit is that one who renounces it knows that the fruit does follow. He does not mind if he himself does not enjoy that fruit. Absence of the desire for fruit makes a man courageous and helps to maintain the purity of the means.
 But I have written more than I should. My aim was merely to caution you. That was my duty. But do as your inner voice tells you.

  480. LETTER TO G. D. BIRLA      NANDI 	DURG, 
   BHAI 	GHANSHYAMDASJI,  Jyaishtha 	Shukla 2 [June 	1, 1927]libtech_611_footnote 
  	Your letter to hand. While I am dictating this letter Mahadev 	reminds me that you had sent word through Jamnalalji that I should 	write to you in English. But I propose to write nothing that needs 	be conveyed to anyone. I am, therefore, having this letter written  	in  Hindi.  	I have the letter you wrote from the steamer. I have already written 	two letters to your Geneva address. They must have reached you. I am 	steadily improving. I write regularly to pujya Malaviyaji. No 	sooner had I written to him this week than a lengthy telegram 	arrived from him, telling me that his health was now better but 	weakness persisted. He is at present in Bombay. It won’t be right 	to say I do not take care of my health. I do take all the 	precautions that I think are necessary to preserve my health. Pujya 	Malaviyaji does not do it as I have complained on many occasions 	and he took no rest even after solemnly promising to do so. He has 	great faith in the treatment of vaidyas and believes that he 	keeps and can keep well by taking their pills and powders. And so 	strong is his self-confidence that in spite of his weakness and ill 	health he is determined to live at least up to seventy-five. May God 	carry him through his resolve. Who can try to persuade him? I have 	written to him in a lighter vein but with as much severity as can be 	combined with courtesy. The truth is that man’s wisdom is 	determined by his past karma. In such matters there is very little 	scope for human effort. It is our duty to try and we    
 ought to do it but there comes in the life of every man a time when all effort appears futile and luckily God gives us no fore-knowledge of the end so as to avoid the frustration. Why then worry over the inevitable? The affairs of the nation depend neither upon Malaviyaji nor upon Lalajilibtech_612_footnotenor upon me. All are but instruments; moreover I think a good man’s efforts bear fruit only after his death. It is not correct as Shakespeare says, “the evil that men do lives after them, the good is oft interred with their bones”. Evil does not endure. Rama is still in our midst and we cherish his memory. Ravana and his wickedness are no more. Not even the wicked utter his name. Who knows what Rama was in his own age? The poet certainly says that in his own lifetime even Rama did not escape recriminations. But now all his imperfections have, with his body, turned to ashes and we worship him as an incarnation of God. And the Kingdom of Rama is much wider now than it ever was while he lived in the body. When I write this I don’t mean to philosophize or persuade you to suppress your feelings. But I emphasize that we should never grieve over the death of one whom we regard as a saint. And we must have the firm belief that a saint’s deeds begin to work or, say, truly bear fruit only after his death. The achievements which were regarded as great in his own time are only infinitesimal compared to the influence they will have in times to come. Yet it is certainly our duty to emulate to the best of our ability the good deeds of those whom we regard as saints of our age.
 Regarding your health I would suggest if you have no faith in allopathy, and you need not have it, that you should visit the institutions of Louis Kuhne and Just when you go to Germany. Their treatment with open air and water has benefited hundreds of people. Contact the Vegetarian Society both at London and  Manchester. There are always some nice, serious-minded people to be found there who will be courteous and considerate. Of course, you will come across some faddists and fanatics too. You said milk was not available on the steamer. Next time you should carry Horlick’s Malted Milk. It is pure milk-powder. The chemists say that this dehydrated powder contains all that milk does. You can try it.
 Yours,
 MOHANDAS

 This is a simple example of how to see action in non-action. With a spinning-wheel or the Gita or the Ramayana in one’s hand one can never say that one has no work to do. Till we are so content in our minds that we feel thus, we are bound to be restless for one reason or another. You ought to get over such restlessness; I have always expected that of you.

 482. LETTER TO MANILAL NATHUBHAI DOSHI
 [After Jane 1, 1927]libtech_614_footnotelibtech_615_footnoteI got your letter. Brahmacharya is to be observed in three ways— in mind, in speech and in body. As long as the mind feels the
slightest   evil  desire,   there   is   always  a   danger   of   the   desire for
 indulgence being aroused. The evil desires of the mind are not controlled in a moment; their control, being the aim of man’s highest effort, takes ages to attain. It is logical to believe that a person who conquers the evil desires in him in this life has succeeded in doing so by reason of the efforts in many lives rather than merely through his efforts in this life. If in our conscious moments the body is about to violate brahmacharya, it is our duty at that time to commit suicide and destroy the body. Hence one cannot be too vigilant towards one’s body; anyone who cannot be so vigilant has yet to learn the first lesson of brahmacharya. Brahmacharya in speech is practically included in bodily brahmacharya, for, though it is the mind that inspires speech, in itself speech is a bodily function. There remains the mind. As one acquires greater control over the mind, one finds it easy to keep the body under control without having to struggle to do so, but until the mind is completely subjugated, there is a chance of involuntary emission. We should not be frightened at such emission. It is the mind we should fear. Involuntary emission is Nature’s warning
 
 to us that the mind has not been subjugated. We see that even lustful men remain complacent because they do not have involuntary emissions. They feel pleased with themselves because of their freedom from such emissions. But, truly speaking, their being self-satisfied in this manner is their fall. In America they employ means which prevent involuntary emissions while the mind remains filled with lustful thoughts. But to regard such a man as a brahmachari amounts to murdering the language. Hence, though safeguarding of the vital fluid is the external form of brahmacharya, one cannot definitely say that its preservation is necessarily a manifestation of brahmacharya. Nevertheless, there is no doubt that it is an essential aspect of complete brahmacharya. My point in writing this is that, if there is involuntary emission despite our continuous and sincere struggling to avoid it, despite our vigilance and after we have neglected to adopt no measure which can possibly help us to avoid it, we need not get frightened or lose heart and feel that we have committed a great sin; rather we should look upon it as kind Nature’s warning and look deeper into ourselves. We should find out where evil desires are lurking in the mind and strive harder still to banish them. The effort is its own reward. If we have been cheating ourselves and mentally indulging our secret desires, we should make sure that we run away from those activities or associations which cause our downfall or make us weak. It should not matter if, in doing so, one ruins one’s business or loses one’s wealth and passes for a fool among the people.
 It is necessary to be almost completely free from sensuous desires in order to be blessed by the vision of God; the desires that still remain will be destroyed only by that vision. There is no sure means which can help us to have this vision. No one else can bring us to it. Truly speaking, the Shastras and those learned in them can only recount their experiences, and, if we lack faith, their experience may awaken faith in us; but no one else can make the necessary effort on our behalf. I can, therefore, tell you only this: do not give up your struggle for a single moment. To get a vision of God is the highest aim of human effort. Add up, therefore, all the struggles that human beings are ready to undertake to get certain things in this world and add up all those efforts; it is necessary, in order to get a vision of God, to make an effort a myriad times more difficult than the sum of all those struggles of human beings in this world. If one does not gain that vision, even after such an effort, one will be free to raise ques- tions; there will be some justification for lack of faith then. But, till
 
 then, we must not give up our faith and our struggle.
 The example of Mansukhlal which you have cited is inappro- priate. He possessed much knowledge of the Shastras,  and  he struggled [for self-control] but he had not become free from desire, neither did he make such a claim. Hence the fact that he felt a desire for a thing like a water-melon during his last hours is not enough reason to fill us with despair or to justify our disparaging him. We should not deceive ourselves and believe, living in these evil times and in this world full of difficulties, that we can easily become free from desires, nor should we entertain such expectations even of a person whom we believe to be good lest we get a shock or doubt his goodness when we have a contrary experience of him. We should remember that the soul’s power is unlimited. He whose desires have totally perished is practically fit to be God. Let us not believe that good men with whom we come in contact have gained such fitness and  thereby reduce God’s measuring rod to the littleness of our finger.
 If we see any person standing even on the first notch on that yardstick, we should feel happy and hope that, if one person can become fit enough to stand on the first notch, all of us can, if we but try, acquire the strength to stand on the second notch, and strive on in that hope.

 483. HOW TO PROTECT THE COW
 I gladly publish these noteslibtech_616_footnotefrom Sjt. C. V. Vaidya. Those, who believe in the methods advocated in these columns for cow-protection, will be glad to find, that a scholar of Sjt. C. V. Vaidya’s repute is in substantial agreement with those methods. The distinction that the learned writer draws between pinjrapole and goshala need not cause any anxiety or difficulty. My own opinion is, that either may be also the other, so long as separate accounts are kept and separate methods of feeding and housing the disabled and the working animals are adopted. Legislation and the State aid advocated by Sjt. Vaidya need not at present distract our attention. For there is immense scope for private effort, building public opinion in favour of the proposed
 
 methods and showing their workability in practice. We are so far behind, indeed, that we have not even enough trained workers to conduct dairies and tanneries along the lines suggested by Sjt. Vaidya. There are at least 1,500 pinjrapoles and goshalas according to the figures in my possession, which can, without much further donation, but by efficient management, test the usefulness of the methods. Their adoption will simply revolutionize the management of these institutions and put life into these, today for the most part, lifeless bodies. These pinjrapoles and goshalas, as they are at present being conducted, are more a salve to our conscience than a protection to the cow. The learned writer’s categorical statement, that during the Vedic and the Brahmana period cow-slaughter was countenanced and beef was eaten, will be hotly contested by Pandit Satavalekar, who has been a close student of Vedic lore for the past 35 years, and by Acharya Ramadeva who claims to be a historian and to have critically studied the ancient history of Bharatavarsha. But with the historical portion practical men and women will not concern themselves. They will perhaps be content like me to hope that our ancestors in the Vedic times knew better than to seek to gain merit by sacrificing innocent animals or to satisfy their palate by eating beef.

 484. CHOICE BEFORE US
 A correspondent sends me a cutting from the Press giving most gruesome facts about the growing infantile crimes and illicit gratifica- tion among girls in the New World.
 A boy of four years is reported to have shot his mother, because she forbade him to play with matches. When the police confronted him, he was in no way taken aback. He threatened “to shoot them too”, and when questioned by the Coroner, he grew so impatient with him that he picked up a knife from among the exhibits lying in front of him and rushed to strike him. It is said, that hardly a day passes in America without some crime being committed by a boy or a girl, and in most American colleges there are said to be suicide clubs or crime societies, and the more horrible part of the account shows that many girls, even of exclusive colleges, have become so lawless as to run away in pursuit of illicit adventures.
It is difficult, in an age in which newspapers, in order to provide
 
 sensational food for their readers, invent stories when they have no facts to weave narratives from, to believe without reservation reports such as I have condensed. But whilst one may make ample allowance for exaggeration, there is no doubt that infantile crime and lawlessness among boys and girls are sufficiently extensive in the New World to make us beware of a civilization which must be held responsible for these crimes and lawlessness. That life in the West goes on—and it may be said progressively after a fashion—in spite of these infantile crimes, may be granted. And it may also be granted that the wise people of the West are not only not unaware of the evil, but that they are manfully struggling to overtake it. Nevertheless we have to decide whether we shall indiscriminately copy this civilization. We may well pause in the face of the awful revelations that come to us from the West from time to time, and ask ourselves, whether after all it is not better to hold by our own civilization and seek, in the light of the comparative knowledge that is available to us, to reform it  by removing its known excrescences. For, there is no doubt, that if the West has its terrific problem arising out of its own civilization, we have no less grave problems of our own to deal with.
 It is perhaps unnecessary, if not useless, in this connection to weigh the merits of the two civilizations. It is likely that the West has evolved a civilization suited to its climate and surroundings, and similarly, we have a civilization suited to our conditions, and both are good in their own respective spheres. This may be safely said that the crimes and the lawlessness described by me are almost impossible with us, and I hold that this is due to our pacific training  and  the  restraining influence in the midst of which we are brought up. Cowardliness which often springs from pacific training, and obsequiousness which comes from the restraint that is handed down from generation to generation, have somehow to be avoided, if the ancient civilization is not to perish before the mad modern rush. The distinguishing characteristic of modern civilization is an indefinite multiplicity of human wants. The characteristic of ancient civilization is an imperative restriction upon and a strict regulating of those wants. The modern or Western insatiableness arises really from want of a living faith in a future state and therefore also in  Divinity.  The restraint of ancient or Eastern civilization arises from a belief, often in spite of ourselves, in a future state and the existence of a Divine Power. The record condensed above is a warning if we will take it, against a blind imitation of the West, which one sees so often in the
 city life of India and especially among the educated classes. Some of the immediate and brilliant results of modern inventions are too maddening to resist. But I have no manner of doubt that the victory of man lies in that resistance. We are in danger of bartering away the permanent good for a momentary pleasure.

 485. THE WHEEL OF LIFE AND THE VEDAS
 Pandit Satavalekar of Aundh wrote in 1922 a booklet in Hindi called	i.e., Charkha in the Vedas, and favoured me with a copy whilst I was resting in the Yeravda jail. I glanced then through its pages and with interest, but asked myself what good would it be to us in this age of so-called advancement to know that the charkha was to be found in the Vedas. Everybody knows that our remote ancestors spun and wove in their cottages even as they did so many other things. But we no longer do them. So I said to myself. The booklet, I hastily concluded, was not of much practical value and I laid it aside. On the sick-bed I have again an opportunity of turning, so far as my strength permits, to quiet studies. Another book of Pandit  Satavalekar  (of which more hereafter) has attracted me to his writings, and he has now favoured me with another copy of the booklet in question. I observe that it has undergone a second edition. I have read it this time more carefully, and I find that the mantras cited by the author from the Vedas demonstrate not merely the fact that our ancestors in those times were spinning and weaving, but they present, perhaps, a, for us, novel way of looking at the wheel. Here is what may be called the key mantra for spinners and weavers from Rig-Veda (X. 53-6) quoted by the author:
I give a free rendering as follows:
 Having spun the thread and given it a shining colour, weave it without knots, and so guard the pathways which the enlightened have chalked out, and thinking well, lead posterity unto the divine light, or (according to the author’s rendering) bring forth divine progeny. This truly is the work of poets.
 If the translation is at all correct—and the author has not merely given his own rendering but has reproduced Griffith’s translation also
 VOL. 38 : 2 JANUARY, 1927 - 3 JUNE, 1927	485
 
 in his booklet—the mantra proves not merely the existence of spinning and weaving in the Vedic times, but that it was the calling of the noblest men and women as well of the humblest. It was one of the pathways which wisdom hath prepared and to guard which was the work of poets. Little did I know, when I humbly presented  the  charkha to our Poetlibtech_617_footnoteas a sacrificial rite, that I had behind me the authority of what is understood to be the oldest Veda. I commend the mantra to all those who are engaged in reviving this ancient and  sacred industry and art. Let them thoughtfully recite  this  mantra whilst doing their sacrificial spinning. Let them treasure it in their hearts and keep their faith unshaken even in the face of disap- pointments and reverses in their forward march.
 I cannot resist quoting another beautiful mantra from the booklet:
 This is again from the Rig-Veda (X. 130-1). It means:
 Hundred and one artists are working at the sacrifice which through the myriad threads overspreads the earth. Here are the elderly guardians. They watch the processes saying,“Weave on here, do this right there.”
 Thus we see that spinning and weaving was regarded as a sacrifice even in those ancient days and commanded the protecting care of the elders. The author shows abundant evidence that both spinning and weaving were done by men as well as women. In fact the industry was as universal as farming. He shows too that the sartorial art was well advanced in those times. There were different dresses pres- cribed for different occasions as also for different states. If the farmer had his langotilibtech_618_footnote, royalty had its robe. There is mention of colours, fringes and gold borders. The author has also shown that some of the most beautiful metaphors have been taken from the language of spinners and weavers.
 I must resist the temptation to quote more extracts from this thoughtfully written booklet. There is a mantra which proves that the
 
 486	THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
 
 soldiers of those days were not above doing these processes; that the bridegroom’s garment was always made by the bride as is still the custom in Assam.
 There is one thing, however, the author leaves to other research scholars in the Vedic lore to discover. So far as he has been able to study the Vedas, he has not found a single equivalent for cotton as he has for wool and silk. He is, therefore, unable to say whether in those days our ancestors had only woollen and silken garments or whether they had already discovered the cotton fibres.

 486. 	LETTER TO HELENE HAUSSDING      NANDI 	HILLS, 
  June 	2, 1927  	I have your sweet little note. But it is disturbing to think that 	you are not yet well. If your recovery is dependent upon mine, well 	then you must already have recovered, because you had two letters 	from me telling you that I was on the road to recovery. I hope you 	got those two letters. But though I am on the road to recovery, I 	have to take care of myself and take plenty of rest. I, therefore, 	do most of my correspondence lying down and through  dictation. 	Hence this typewritten letter.  	You know my theory of the disease, don’t you? I regard it as a 	result of some conscious or unconscious sin as I call or breaches of 	Nature’s laws. When you lose mental equanimity, be it ever so 	little, it sets up terrible agitations in the body, and these latter 	produce visible effects upon it. I know that I am not free from 	these affections or perturbations as I would call them and I had the 	collapse. I do not flatter myself with such unctuous pleas as 	overwork, terrific strain, etc., in order to drown my conscience. On 	the contrary, I know that overwork and terrific strain are just as 	apprehensible, even though they may be in a good cause, as a 	drinking-bout or visiting cinemas. The results of both are the same. 	And, if I have attained equanimity, I should unerringly know when to 	work, when not to work and should be able to have the same control 	over the mind as I should have over the body. But I confess I have 	not. The mind continuously gives me [the] slip and outruns me. What 	wonder then that I am still convalescing? But all this confession is 	merely a preface to tell you 
 that you must not hug your disease to yourself and from your philosophic height blame the doctor, the weather, the food and everything and everybody else but yourself. Let us call a spade a spade.

            DEAR 	FRIEND,   LETTER TO M. M. GIDWANI       NANDI HILLS,  June 	2, 1927 
  	It was good of you to have sent your article for Young India 	entitled “The Present Situation”. But I am afraid that it 	will not be of much use for the readers of Young India. That 	it will lead popular education is an admitted fact. But the only 	question is how to do it and who shall do it. And Young India is 	published either to suggest new lines of thought or to show 	practical methods of working out plans and policies already 	accepted. I return your article lest you may want it. 
    PROF. 	M. M. GIDWANI, 	M. A. EDITOR,  	“SINDHUDESH” 	KARACHI  From 	a microfilm: S.N. 14142     LETTER TO GOSIBEHN   Yours sincerely,                    NANDI HILLS,  June 	2, 1927 
  	I am glad I have at least succeeded in drawing you. I have ward to 	your letter especially after Perin had prepared me for It. I am glad 	also of the confession. But a good confession results in a change of 	ways. But I see you have not yet become a Gujarati scholar, nor 	evidently did those excellent copy-books sent by grandfather produce 	any impression upon you. But here I cannot judge. If I did, it would 
 be like pot calling the kettle black. In spite of schoolmasters having put copy-books before me, I write a hand much worse than yours.
 I thought that Nargis had sent A.E.’s book The Interpreters. It came before your letter. I think that very book was sent to me through Jaijee when I was in Yeravda. But alas! I was discharged before I could read the book through. There is not much danger of a sudden discharge now. I shall therefore read it and tell you what I think of it.
 We remove to Bangalore on Sunday. You must all come there. There is going to be a Khadi Exhibition in July. I am writting to Mithubehn about it, and if you could come for that exhibition, you could all become stall holders and take the  Bangalore  public  by storm.
I am gaining strength slowly.
    SHRIMATI 	GOSIBEHN 	OMRA 	HALL, 	PANCHGANI From 	a photostat: S.N. 14143  Yours, 
   
           CHI. 	MIRA,   LETTER TO MIRABEHN       NANDI HILLS,  June 	3, 1927 
  	I have your letter. It fills me with both sorrow and joy; sorrow 	because for the time being at any rate that Ashram has fallen in my 	estimation, and joy because you are so gentle and yet so brave. You 	become a shield both for yourself and Gangu. That you committed the 	initial mistake of accepting the invitation to witness the bhang 	preparation dwindles into insignificance in the face of  your 	subsequent firmness combined with gentleness. Your acceptance of the 	invitation was as good or as bad as acceptance of an invitation to 	watch the manufacture of brandy in a brewery. But that acceptance 	itself was due to your great anxiety to please Maharajji and not out 	of any unpardonable or improper curiosity. On reading your letter, 	my first thought was to wire to you for you, Valunjker and Gangu to 	leave the Ashram at once. I then said to myself that that would be 	wrong especially when you had proved your presence of mind and 	bravery in the face of a wretched situation. I therefore decided to 	write to you and give you my reflections and then let you act as you 	thought proper in the circumstances. 
 I regard the scene you have described as highly improper, even immoral, on the part of those who sought to tempt you and almost force the vile stuff down your throat and poor Gangu’s, and then as you turned your backs upon them, to sprinkle the dirty water was more like a scene in a tavern than in a brahmacharya Ashram, where service of God and man is supposed to be the goal and where brahmacharya is strictly enjoined. Your fast was good for your purification. It has washed you clean of the initial mistake, and if they will take it, it is a gentle warning to the managers of the Ashram. It seems to me, however, that you should follow up the action by having a firm conversation with the Rao Saheb and other inmates, and, if you wish it, with the Maharajji himself. Whereas in a previous letterlibtech_619_footnoteI told you that it was no business of yours to rid the Ashram of the bhang habit, now in view of the developments described by you, it becomes your duty either to end the bhang or to end your presence there. I regard it to be next to impossible, both for men and women, to remain without sensual agitations whilst they are under the influence of bhang even though they may be able to exercise outward bodily control, though from my own experience of it, it seems to me that when I was under the influence of bhang any man or woman could have played fast or loose with me. And now that your eyes have been opened, it would be improper to lend any countenance to that Ashram unless they are sincerely ready to reform their ways. You may not co-operate with the Ashram even to gain a kingdom or even if it was the only place where you could finish your Hindi course. You may tell them that you are not there to impose your views, but as a friend you were bound to draw their attention to the evil which had forced itself upon your attention, and that unless the evil was eradicated—and that too not for your sake but out of conviction—you could not remain there to receive personal courtesies and personal favours in the shape of Hindi teaching. If therefore they could not see eye to eye with you about the evil of bhang, you would still be friends with them but you couldn’t possibly remain in the Ashram, nor Valunjker and Gangu who are also under the same discipline as you. You may read this letter to whomsoever you like. Discuss first with Valunjker—for, he is a wise man—the propriety of the step I have suggested, see what he has to say, see also what Gangu has to say. She is like a  simple glorious child. But wisdom often comes out of the mouths of babes
 
 and her intuition may be better than our reasoned judgement. And then if you feel like referring to me, do so by all means. If you wish to consult Jamnalalji, you may write to him also. I am sending him your letter and a copy of this so that you don’t have to say much to him. Do nothing in a hurry, nothing in a huff, certainly nothing in anger; but take whatever step you wish after humble prayer and with the greatest deliberation.
 I am perfectly at ease having dictated this letter. Such experiences, when they come to us unsought, are precious trials that God sends to those who would listen to the “still small voice” within. If I have read more into your letter than you meant and have been guilty of any injustice to the people at the Ashram, you will not

          DEAR 	FRIEND,   LETTER TO K. VYASA RAO       NANDI HILLS,  June 	3, 1927 
  	I have carefully gone through your pamphlet Foundations of 	Swaraj, as also your manifesto. About the manifesto, I 	cannot say anything because I do not know the facts. About the 	pamphlet, I am sorry to say it was a deep disappointment to me. You 	have  lost  yourself in the exuberance of your own language. You 	have not taken the trouble of studying a movement, not by any means 	insignificant so far at least as its extent is concerned, and have 	set  about demolishing a picture of your own imagination. You have 	not cared to understand the implications of soul-power or the 	implications of the spinning-wheel. The other chapters betray a most 	superficial study of questions handled by you. I understood from you 	that you had 25 years’ experience of public service at your back. 	It is a matter of deep sorrow to me that so many years of study 	should have brought forth such little fruit. Please do not be 	flattered by the testimonials that you have received about your 	other book from distinguished newspapers. I know nothing about the 	other book. But if it is based upon the same 
 preparation that is betrayed by the pamphlet you left with me, it could not be up to much. A good command over a language is often a hindrance rather than a help when that facility for expression is not backed by deep thinking and industrious research.

  	What a wonderful and poetic love letter you have sent me! I would 	wonder if my letter to Father crossed yours or whether this letter 	of yours is prompted by the reminder sent in my letter to Father. 	Not only must I not write much myself, but I must not even dictate 	for any length of time. I don’t want therefore to chat with you 	long. But let me hasten to tell you that if you can be happy and 	comfortable in the Ashram, I would love to have you in spite of your 	not doing any work with your hands. Spinning by the hand is after 	all a test, an emblem, an earnest of what is within, and I know that 	you have all that substance within you. What does it matter that 	through no present fault of your own, you are simply physically 	incapable of spinning. The work done by the spirit within is 	infinitely precious,  more  precious than the formal spinning done 	by many without the heart in it. Come therefore when you like to the 	Ashram as your very home and I shall certainly take all that your 	voice can give me. But I should prize your presence even if you had 	not that rich melodious voice. What I prize is your goodness, which 	can act without speaking. It is like the fragrance of a sweet 	flower. It does not need any movement and yet the fragrance is all 	pervading and unmistakable, and  it  survives for a while even after 	the flower is withdrawn. How much longer must the fragrance of 	goodness last even after the body is 
 withdrawn? But be absolutely sure that you will like the Ashram and that your body can sustain the Ashram life.
 Do you write to Mira? If not, do please now. Her address is Bhagavadbhakti Ashram, Rampura, Rewari (Dt. Gurgaon).
With love to all.

  	Whilst there remains any uncertainty about the legality of the 	resolution about Jamnalalji being officiating Chairman of the 	Council, the process I suggest in my capacity as President is that 	anything that is required to be done should first receive the 	approval of Jamnalalji as if he was legally the officiating Chairman 	and then his decision should be submitted to me for formal and final 	approval. That will save me from my having to critically examine the 	merits of each matter.  	With reference to the ten thousand rupees supplied to the 	Maharashtra Agency in anticipation of sanction, I entirely approve. 	And so do I approve the proposal to pay the Karnatak Agency the 	collections already made by me at Nipani, Belgaum and elsewhere.  	I think it is quite the proper thing to hold a meeting of the 	Council in Bangalore at the time of the forthcoming Exhibition or 	earlier, whichever date may suit you, Jamnalalji and others.  	I descend to Bangalore on Sunday. I understand that there is very 	ample accommodation in the State House placed at my disposal.  Yours 	faithfully,  From 	a microfilm: S.N. 19778 
 
 
 
 
 
 DEAR DOCTOR,
  LETTER TO DR. M. S. KELKAR 
 
 
 NANDI HILLS,
 June 3, 1927
  	Your letters are always interesting and instructive. Do I gather 	that you would prefer my giving up wheat-meal or oatmeal, salt, soda 	and vegetables altogether and confine myself to milk, water and 	fruit? Am I right in thinking that you consider raw milk better than 	boiled milk?  	Yes, I well remember your talk about sterile eggs and their culture. 	I shall enquire here myself; but if you have any literature on the 	subject, I would like to study it. Without further consideration I 	am prepared to say that I would put sterile eggs, as you have 	described them to be, under the same category as milk. I am 	therefore open to receive further instruction about them and their 	culture.  	You must some day try to convince me about the value of astrology; 	for, I do not deny the possibility of its being a true science. But 	I do not regard the investigation and use of every science as 	beneficial to mankind.

  Brahmacharya, etc., can be practised only by an inner urge 	and by cultivating spiritual energy. This energy again can only be  	cultivated by constant application. There are two means of such 	application. One, discriminating and meditative study of good books, 	and two, efforts to practise the noble principles one has learnt. 	Learning without practice goes waste and serves only to turn one’s 	head. Whatever therefore one has learnt one should immediately 	reduce to action. Therefore, a woman wanting to practise brahma- 	charya should take to non-violence, truth, 	non-possession, etc. She should thus zealously guard herself against 	the slightest untruth,  against violence in thought, word or deed 	and should strive to give up all possessions. The scriptures tell us 	that courage and contentment are also to be cultivated. Courage 	should mean both inward and outward courage and it should be 	practised as soon as its implications are 
 clearly understood. So is the case with contentment. We should not be upset if someone abuses us, maligns us or calls us fools. This is a sign of contentment. We should remain contented even if we do not get food when hungry or we do not get clothes when we shiver. And as long as we do not practise what we have learnt we should not take a new lesson. We must apply ourselves to a greater understanding of what we have learnt, and think of nothing else. This also is a part of the dharma of brahmacharya because the latter is the high watermark of discipline.

  LETTER TO S. D. SATAVALEKAR 
 June 3, 1927
 I have almost finished reading the current issue of Vaidika Dharma. I wish to make some comments about the article on brahmacharya in the issue. You have interpreted brahmacharya only as preservation of the vital fluid and mentioned manly pursuits like hunting and so on in that context. Visiting foreign lands  and founding colonies have also been mentioned. In my humble view this involves unsound logic. The first fallacy consists of narrow definition. The brahmacharya which you have explained by first quoting a mantra from the Atharva-Veda, viz., the gods overcame death by the strength of brahmacharya, and by practising it man also  can  overcome death, cannot be restricted to mere preservation of the vital fluid. The other is the fallacy of too wide definition. Brahmacharya need not be associated with acts of valour, etc. We see this in the world today. If the mere preservation of semen is the object  of brahmacharya, it can be attained, as I have said in one of my letters, in a few minutes by a surgical operation. This operation does not make a man impotent; but allows him to indulge in sexual pleasures without losing his vital fluid. Such a man does not lose by way of manly adventures either. I am sure, however, that you will not call this brahmacharya.
 The brahmacharya which you seek is attainable only by the subjugation of sexual and other desires. The preservation of the vital fluid, although important, is only a bye-product. Its  direct  and primary objective is nothing less than communion with the Brahman. This is the only desirable and legitimate adventure on the path of
 brahmacharya. Why should a man take to the uphill task  of conquering desires for the sake of brahmacharya, when manly adventures like vanquishing the enemy or undertaking foreign expeditions can be achieved by thousands of people  without practising brahmacharya? And nobody does it, as I can vouchsafe from my fairly wide experience. Where can we find braver warriors than the German and the English soldiers? They are  regularly  provided with prostitutes. Hundreds, if not thousands, of innocent girls are sacrificed to the sexual hunger of these soldiers. No one despises these brave Kshatriyas who defend the country; on the other hand, educated and civilized men and women dote on these soldiers. I am not employing epithets like Kshatriyas, etc., on my own or to explain my meaning. In my view they are no warriors at all. I do not consider them defenders of the country. Dharma declines when we sing praises of these men. But under modern civilization there is nothing but  praise for these people.
 Now let us come to the Indian scene. Pathans, Sikhs and  Gorkhas are the three acknowledged martial races. There is a similar provision of prostitutes for them as in the case of the German and other soldiers. They have an honoured place, you know,  in  the Empire. If you look at the ancient lores, adultery has been tolerated in the case of Kshatriyas. I write all this because I wish that the people should derive full benefit from your profound studies of the Vedas and other ancient scriptures. This will be possible by putting the scriptures in the crucible of modern conditions, by objective observation and intense churning. I can write a lot on this subject, but this should do to indicate to you the burden of my theme. Another reason for my brevity is that I have little energy. I have great respect for your learning and truthfulness, which has impelled me r`to write so much.

 APPENDIX I
 EXTRACTS FROM SHAPURJI SAKLATVALA’S OPEN LETTER
 
DEAR COMRADE GANDHI,
 We are both erratic enough to permit each other to be rude in order to freely express oneself correctly instead of getting lost in artificiality of phraseology....
 During my conversation with you at certain periods you did not seem to take a definite attitude with regard to the value of organization of labour and peasants. You emphatically argued that the charkha movement was making organization. I emphatically deny it. For centuries together, millions of men and women in India
 have been boiling rice, utilizing similar quantities of rice and water and conducting cooking operations.... All these operations surely have not produced  any organization and the work of spinning can never do so any more than the work of cooking....
 Before 1900, leaders who . . . worked to build up hopes of salvation	were
 popular leaders as Gladstone was to the British, Bismarck to the Germans, or Parnell to the Irish or Dadabhai or Pherozeshah and Surendranath to the Indians. By the year 1900 the masses of men got tired and sick and their hearts began to burn with fire. The change came on very rapidly and universally and only such individuals as expressed the burning fire of the heart and the revolt of the suffering human beings were taken as leaders. The first task of these was to express boldly and fearlessly the unexpressed voice of the people. The second task of these leaders was       to make it
 absolutely impossible for the old order to continue to function. The third task was to reconstruct and arduously and slowly to build up a new life. Ireland produced a De Valera. He did No. I and 2 and his people are now bravely carrying on his task No. 3. Russia has produced Lenin. He did No. 1 and 2 and though his life was short, he led his people on the right path regarding No. 3. Turkey produced Kemal. He did No. I and 2 and is fortunate enough to be kicking and vigorous to carry on his task No. 3. China produced Sun-Yat-Sen. He completed No. I and 2 and after his death his well-organized and well-disciplined followers are carrying on task No. 3. In Italy, though in contrary direction, Mussolini plays the same individual part, India at that moment announced to the world her leader to be Gandhi. You performed No. 1 but you abandoned task No.  2 and so task No. 3 is out of the question and we are so overwhelmed with the disastrous defect at the second stage of your struggle that our lot today is harder than before. . . .
 You have created an influence over our countrymen in the lowest strata of society wider and deeper than anybody else. However, what is your real object? If your purpose is to give your share in the national and political work, your approach to the people should be on terms of absolute equality and your task must be to inspire
 confidence into them. From this point of view you must stop allowing people to address you as a Mahatma.
 Then there is one thing that I witnessed at Yeotmeal which has hurt me greatly and I had some slight evidence of it before. Your work regarding the removal of untouchability is grand in its aspiration and is not bad in its success as it is generally carried on. However I strongly object to your permitting my countrymen and countrywomen to touch your feet and put their fingers to their eyes. Such touchability appears to be more damnable than untouchability. You are ruining the mentality and the psychology of these villagers for another generation or two. You are preparing the country not for mass civil disobedience but for servile obedience and for a belief that there are superior persons on earth and Mahatmas in this life at a time when in this country the white man’s prestige is already a dangerous obstacle in our way. Politically this career of yours is ruinous and from a humanitarian point of view its degenerating influence appears to me to be a moral plague....
 What I want of you is that you be a good old Gandhi, put an ordinary pair of khaddar trousers and coat and come out and work with us in the ordinary way. Come and organize with us (as you alone by yourself have failed) our workers, our peasants and our youths, not with a metaphysical sentimentality but with a set purpose a clear-cut and well-defined object and by methods such as by experiment are making success for all human beings.
 Therefore before I go, I should like you to get up one morning as from a dream and to say “Yes” and many of us can soon be put together in a good team and set about putting an end to so many deplorable conditions of life in India about which none of  us has any doubt.
 I remain,
 Yours fraternally,

 It is decided that, except the appeal for 2_ lakhs for the Gurukul Kangri which had already been issued by the Punjab Arya Pratinidhi Sabha, only one appeal should be issued on behalf of the Hindu community as a whole for Rs. 10 lakhs, 5 1akhs of which should be kept as a permanent endowment and 5 lakhs should be used immediately as follows: 1_ lakhs for the uplift of the depressed classes (achhutoddhar); 1 _ for carrying on the work of shuddhi and 1 _ for promoting Hindu sangathan. The Trustees shall select such agencies of the Hindu Mahasabha, Sanatan Dharma Sabha and the Arya Samaj, including the Bharatiya Shuddhi Sabha and the Dalitoddhar Sabha of Delhi to carry out the objects of the Trust as they may consider fit from time to time, subject to such general conditions for the submission and audit
 of accounts as they may lay down; but the work of sangathan shall be carried out through the Hindu Mahasabha alone. The interest of the five lakhs of the permanent fund will also be spent on the three objects named above in the proportion stated. It has also been decided that at least half the total amount raised in a province shall be spent within that province, and this applies to the interest of the permanent endowment fund also.
 It has been also resolved that steps be taken to acquire the house in which Swami Shraddhanandji was murdered with the object of converting it into Swami Shraddhanand Memorial Bhavan.
 Every donor is free to earmark his donation for any of the purposes named above. The donations will be strictly used for that purpose or purposes only for which a donor has given it.
 All donations should be remitted to the Manager, The Punjab National Bank Ltd., Delhi, to be credited to the Shraddhanand Memorial Fund. When remitting money, remitters are requested to send to the Bank a complete statement of the names and addresses of donors, and the amounts subscribed by each donor and also his instructions, if any. They are also requested to send a copy of such statements to the Secretary, Shraddhanand Memorial Fund, Delhi.
 To ensure that all subscriptions are duly credited to the Fund, a formal receipt for the amount subscribed will be sent to the donors by the Secretary, Shraddhanand Memorial Fund. If such a receipt is not received by a donor within fifteen days of payment, it is requested that the donor should inform the Secretary of the fact.
 We owe it to the memory of the revered Swamiji that the sum of ten lakhs for which the appeal has been issued by the Hindu Mahasabha, should be fully subscribed at the latest by the 30th of April next,
 We are of opinion that all efforts should be concentrated on raising the All-India Memorial and that all movements for local or sectional memorials should be deferred until the All-India Memorial Fund is fully subscribed.libtech_620_footnote
 The division of the Fund into three parts enables everyone to make his own
 choice and contribute freely to the object he may have most at heart. It is to be hoped that the subscribers will bear in mind the date before which the memorial committee expects to finish the collections.

 APPENDIX IV
 WHOM KHADI STANDS FOR
 
 ‘THE  MAN  WITH THE HOE’
 Bowed by the weight of centuries he leans Upon his hoe and gazes on the ground, The emptiness of ages in his face,
 And on his back the burden of the world. Who made him dead to rapture and despair,
 A thing that grieves not and that never hopes, Staid and stunned, a brother to the Ox?
 Who loosened and let down this brutal jaw?  Whose was the hand that slanted back his brow, Whose breath blew out the light within his brain?
 *	*	*
 Oh, masters, lords and rulers in all lands, Is this the handiwork you give to God,
 This monstrous thing distorted and soul-quenched? How will you ever straighten up this shape,
Touch it again with immortality,
 Give it the upward looking and the light: Rebuild in it the music and the dream?
    Young 	India, 31-3-1927     APPENDIX 	V  	—Edward 	Markham 
  FROM THE 	PREFACE TO “BAPU’S LETTERS TO MIRA”  In 	order that 	the reader may 	have a clearer 	background, I will 	explain briefly 	the outline 	of events 	in my life 	which led me 	to Bapu. Having been 	brought up in an 	English country home, I 	was familiar with rural life, 	besides which 	 there  was, inherent in me from the beginning, a profound love of Nature. At the age of 15, I first 
 heard the music of Beethoven. Forthwith my spirit within was awakened to a living sense of the Divine Power, and prayer to God became a reality. Through Beethoven’s music I was led to Romain Rolland, and through Romain Rolland to Bapu. These were not just easy stages. On the contrary, turmoil, darkness, hope, despair—all had to be passed through before the pure Light of Truth broke in upon my troubled soul and led me to my destination.
 All along a power was impelling me. I did not understand it for a long while, but, by the time I came to know of Romain Rolland, this force was becoming apparent to me, and from the time of our first meetings  at  Villeneuve,  an extraordinary sense of mellow happiness possessed me. I felt something was coming.  I had not the slightest idea what. I only knew that all would be well. Even when Romain Rolland talked to me about Bapu, and said a little book he had written about him was in the Press, I did not realize more than that I must read the book. Then the day came when the book was published. I went to the publisher’s shop in the Latin Quarter of Paris, where I was then staying. The whole shop window was full of a little book with an orange coloured cover on which was printed in  black  ‘Mahatma Gandhi’. I bought a copy, took my lodging and began to read. I could not put it down.   I read and read, and as I read the dawn in my heart glowed brighter and brighter, and by the time I had finished, the Sun of Truth was pouring his rays into my soul. From that moment I knew that my life was dedicated to Bapu. That for which I had been waiting had come, and it was this.
 I straightaway went to London and booked a passage to India at the P. & O. office. I also sought out and devoured all the literature I could; writings of Bapu, writings of Tagore, English and French translations of the Bhagavad Gita; and even the Upanishads and Vedas I peeped into. But very soon I began to realize that I was a fool to think that I could rush to Bapu like this. I was wholly unfit spiritually and physically, and I must first put myself through a severe training. I accordingly went back to the P. & O. office and changed my reserved berth for one a year later.
 I now set about things in a thorough and systematic way. First I studied the rules and regulations of the Sabarmati Ashram in every detail. Then I began changing my diet item by item, until I reached pure vegetarian food. I started sitting  cross-legged on the floor. Ten minutes at a stretch was all I could do in the beginning, but with steady practice I became perfectly at ease. I commenced lessons in Urdu and of course learnt carding, spinning and weaving. This had to be in wool, but gave me good practice. At the same time study of the literature continued. In the midst of this training news came in the papers that Bapu had gone on a 21 days’ fast for Hindu-Muslim unity. As the days went by, the papers began saying that Bapu would probably not survive. I prayed to God in anguish. The days dragged on. But I never slackened in my training because, even if Bapu were to pass away in his physical form, I knew I must go to India to serve his cause. It seemed an eternity, but at last the  21 days were over and the news came that the fast had been safely broken.
 Up to now I had not written a word to Bapu. But on the successful completion of the fast, my heart was so full of thankful joy that I just had to write.
