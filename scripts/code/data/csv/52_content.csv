  	I got your letter. Write to Hanuman Singh’s relations and tell 	them that his death has both grieved me and made me happy. His body 	had wasted away and it is good that it has perished. The soul which 	dwelt in that body is immortal. Since I knew him personally, I was 	bound to feel grieved at his passing away, but such grief ought to 	be suppressed. I, therefore, felt the pain only for a moment. Let 	the relations, too, feel in the same way. Translate this into Hindi 	and send it to them along with a copy of the Gujarati. Who is the 	Shankarrao who was bitten by a snake? How is he now? How did he come 	to be bitten by a snake? Did it get under his foot in the river or 	did it bite him unprovoked?

  	Did you in any way benefit from your stay in the hospital? Or, are 	things just as they were? Don’t let your constipation remain. If 	you come over here as soon as you get this letter, we will banish 	your constipation altogether. I 	have written to Bhai Mohanlal about your article.  	It seems that the Foreword did not reach you after all. Here is 	another :  	“These eleven points have been explained so clearly that everybody 	may understand them. If every reader, having understood these 	points, immediately starts acting upon as many of them as he finds 	practicable, how very near would swaraj be?  MOHANDAS 	GANDHI”  	Though I send you this Foreword, I wonder whether the eleven points 	have not become twenty now. Why won’t you write about all of them? 	But in this matter you know better.

  	I have your letter  of  the  22nd;  but  the  earlier  one  has  not 	 yet reached me. I fail to see why you are reluctant to write to the 	Doctor. Why should you feel any hesitation in explaining the facts 	as they are? I see nothing odd in your wish to ask Lallubhai to 	accom- pany you when you take Ratilal to Thana. He must be a strange 	man  who,  though  he   has enough money, refuses to spend it at 	such  a time. For whose sake should he hoard and save? I did get the 	tele- gram about Anna, and I replied to say that he would not be 	able to go. It is possible, however, that he want on his own. 
 How is the State being ruled? What happened to that petition in regard to drinking?"

      LETTER TO R. M. MAXWELL     
 
 
BARDOLI,
     DEAR 	MR. MAXWELL,  May 	29, 1931 
  	I thank you for your several letters which I hope to deal with as 	fast as time permits me. But I must make time to reply to your 	latest, i.e., of the 25th instant and the previous one, i.e., of the 	24th instant.  	I do not know what there can be in the prabhat pheris to 	object to. Though they took from during the Civil Disobedience 	campaign they were in themselves quite innocent. I do not know how 	far they dis-turb the peace of citizens. During my recent travels, I 	found them more or less in vogue in the other cities too. I can 	understand prohibition of inflammatory songs. But I do not know that 	the Government will be right in interfering with this innocent and 	beautiful institution which reminds citizens of their duty towards 	their Creator in early morning.  	With reference to the Seva Dals the practices they go through are 	not new. They have for years been going through them without any 	interference. If there is anything specific that is objected to, I 	would like it to be specified. I am unable without further 	information to endorse the suggestion that ‘these camps do not 	wholly reflect the spirit of the Settlement and that they are 	calculated in some degree to delay the restoration of normal 	conditions and feelings’.  	As to the other letter, i.e., about liquor sales it comes upon me 	with painful surprise.  	If whilst liquor picketing is recognized as legitimate, the 	Government counteract it through several practices even considered 	illegal, and contend that such practices are not in contravention of 	the Settlement, I venture to suggest that nothing that the 	Government may do or may not do need be deemed to be in 	contravention of it.  	But your letter tells me that the present practice of sale out of 	ordinary hours and outside ordinary places of sale is perfectly 	legal. This I must confess is a revelation for which I was wholly 	unprepared. It means that the Collectors are guided by no legal 	restrictions or regulations that the public need know. Indeed if 	such is the condition of liquor law or rather if the sale of liquor 	is governed by no law save the will of Collectors, the sooner the 	public is informed of the fact the 
 better for it. And it will be a serious matter for the Congress Working Committee to consider.
 His Excellency will permit me to say that he is  evidently  unaware of the fact that picketing in Ahmedabad has been accepted by the previous District Officer and the Superintendent of Police as the most peaceful and inoffensive. His Excellency is also evidently unaware of the fact that the picketing was started by the Labour Union in the interest of labour long before the Civil Disobedience campaign was inaugurated. It has been admired by strangers from the West who have visited Ahmedabad.
 His Excellency will pardon me for saying that the opening of the last paragraph of your letter betrays amazing ignorance of the working of picketing in Ahmedabad. I state here for his inform-  ation that the Labour Union including the drinkers are thankful for this watch and it is the Union that has borne the expenses. It was surely His Excellency’s duty to be sure of his facts on which undeserved reflections upon the conduct of an honourable body of men and women are based.
 The suggestion contained in the last sentence that such picketing cannot be peaceful implies a reflection on Lord Irwin who negotiated the Settlement which reflection I am sure His Excellency could never have intended.
 In conclusion I repeat my humble opinion that if the practice of liquor sales now going on in Ahmedabad continues, the continuation will be in breach of the spirit if not the letter of the Settlement.
 I  am, Yours sincerely,
  K. GANDHI

Unless you still think there is any use negotiating please follow up the suggestion made by you in your letter to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel about legal procedure. If there is no  cause  of action and if there is to be no further negotiation, let us forget the matter at least for the time being.

  	I now send herewith a note on allegations against Patel Jehangir of 	Varad. If an impartial open inquiry  is  held,  full  evidence  will 	 be led before the tribunal in support of  all the allegations.  	There is no objection on the part of the people to the inquiry being 	entirely open.  	Moreover, according to my information, Patel Jehangir  holds  a 	liquor license which, in my opinion, should be an effective bar 	against the holding of a Patelship. As the allegations made against 	this Patel are serious and as complaints about his high-handed 	treatment of the villagers continue to come in I request  an  early 	public investigation or an early removal from the  office  he  	holds.  I must add that the question of undesirability is raised 	without prejudice to the general question, namely, that the 	temporary appointments, no matter of what duration, are, in my 	opinion, only temporary in terms of the Settlement and in no sense 	permanent, 
 especially when it is known that these appointments are for so many years or until further orders.

  	I have learnt about the Dhrollibtech_254_footnoteincident.  My own view is that you should now forget 	all about the demand for the national flag. If you like, two or 	three of you may come to see me. It seems to me that many things are 	being done in haste. On your side, the right course at present is to 	apply yourselves exclusively to the boycott of foreign cloth through 	propagation of khadi, and to the campaign against drinking.

As for the boys and girls living in the Ashram who have joined the 	Vidyapith, I have already communicated my views to Kaka. Briefly, 	they are as follows : Though there is not much to justify the view 	that the students who had joined the movement should not return to 	the Ashram I would not oppose it either. The question is, what can 	they do if they cannot work elsewhere? Ordinarily, the Vidyapith 	would be the only choice. But we got alarmed when others,  too, 	began to give up manual work and go away. It may also  have happened 	that, under the pretext of excercising self-control and not 	returning to the Ashram, the students satisfied their desire for 	joining the Vidyapith. But we cannot hold back a flood. So I let the 	students  do what they liked. There is a long history behind all 	this. It is difficult to say how far the students’ action is 	inspired by their desire to join the Vidyapith and how far by a 	clear sense of duty. Ask me if    
 you fail to follow anything in this. Show this leter to those who had doubts in the matter.
 Write to me from time to time and inform me how Rambhau is faring.
 I have followed what you say about Chi. Gajanan. There is no harm in letting him satisfy his love of painting. It is very good indeed that, at the same time, he also does spinning, etc.
 I was eager to revise the draft of Mananvishi while I was in jail. But I was released before I could do so, and found myself again in the thick of affairs. Now print the thing off as it is. I have already given you one “meditaion’ to be added.

      THE  LAW  OF 					 SWADESHIlibtech_258_footnote     
 Swadeshi is the law of laws enjoined by the present age. Spiri- tual laws, like Nature’s laws need no enacting; they are selfacting. But through ignorance or other causes man often neglects or disobeys them. It is then vows are needed to steady one’s course.  A man who  is by temperament a vegetarian needs no vow to strengthen his vegetarianism. For, the sight of animal food, instead of tempting him would only excite his disgust. The law of swadeshi is ingained in the basic nature of man but it has today sunk into oblivion. Hence the necessity for the vow of swadeshi. In its ultimate and spiritual sence swadeshi stands for the final emancipation of the human soul from its
 
 earthly bondage. For, this earthly tabernacle is not its natural or permanent abode, it is a hindrance in its onward journey, it stands in the way of its realizing its oneness with other lives. A votary of swadeshi therefore, in his striving to identify himself with the entire creation seeks to be emancipated from the bondage of the physical body.
 If this interpretation of swadeshi be correct then if follows that its votary will as a first duty dedicate himself to the service of his immediate neighbours. This involves exclusion or even sacrifice of the interests of the rest but the exclusion or the sacrifice would be apparent only. Pure service of one’s neighbours can never, from its very nature result in disservice to those who are remotely situated, rather the contrary. ‘As with the individual so with the universe’ is  an unfailing principle which we would do well to lay to heart. On the other hand a man who allows himself to be lured by ‘the distant scene’ and runs to the ends of the earth for service, is not only foiled in his ambition but fails in his duty towards his neighbours also. Take  a concrete instance. In the particular place where I live I have certain persons as my neighbours, some relations and dependents. Naturally, they all feel, as they have a right to, that they have a claim on me and look to me for help and support. Suppose now I leave them all at once and set out to serve people in a distant place. My decision would throw my little world of neighbours and dependents out of gear while my gratuitous knight-errantry would more likely than not disturb the atmosphere in the new place.Thus a culpable neglect of my immediate neighbours and an unintended disservice to the people whom I wish to serve would be the first fruits of my violation of the principles of swadeshi.
 It is not difficult to multiply such instances. That is why the Gita says: “It is better to die performing one’s duty or swadharma, but para-dharma, or another’s duty, is fraught with danger.”libtech_259_footnoteInter- preted in terms of one’s physical environment this gives us the law of swadeshi. What the Gita says with regard to swadharma equally applies to swadeshi also, for swadeshi is swadharma applied to one’s immediate environment.
 It is only when the doctrine of swadeshi is wrongly understood that mischief results, e.g., it would be a travesty of the doctrine of swadeshi, it to coddle my family I set about grabbing money by all
 
 
 means fair or foul. The law of swadeshi requires me no more than to discharge my legitimate obligations towards my family by just means, and the attempt to do so will reveal to me the Universal Code of Conduct. The practice of swadeshi can never do harm to anyone and  if it does it is not swadharma but egotism that moves me.
 There may come occasions when a votary of swadeshi may be called upon to sacrifice his family at the altar of universal service. Such an act of willing immolation will then constitute the highest service rendered to the family. “Whosoever wants to save his life will lose it, and whosoever loses his life for the Lord’s sake will find it,” holds good for the family group no less than the individual. Take another instance . Supposing there is an outbreak of the plague in my village and in trying to serve the victims of the epidemic I, my wife and children and all the rest of my family are wiped out of existence, then in inducing those dearest and nearest to join me I will not have acted as the destroyer of my family but on the contrary as its truest friend. In swadeshi there is no room for selfishness, or if there is selfishness in it, it is of the highest type which is not different from the highest altruism. Swadeshi in its purest form is the acme of universal service.
 It was by following this line of argument that I hit upon khadi as a necessary and the most important corollary of the principle of swadeshi in its application to society.‘What is the kind of service,’ I asked myself, ‘that the teeming millions of India most need at the present time, that can be easily understood and appreciated by all, that is easy to perform and will at the same time enable the crores of our semi-starved countrymen to live, and the reply came that it is the universalization of khadi or the spinning wheel alone that can fulfil these conditions.
 Let no one suppose that the practice of swadeshi through khadi would harm the foreign mill-owners. A thief who is weaned from his vice or is made to return the property that he has stolen is not harmed thereby, on the contrary he is the gainer consciously in the one case, un-consciously in the other. Similarly if all the opium addicts or the drunkards in the world were to shake themselves free from their vice, the canteen keepers or the opium vendors who would be deprived of their customers could not be said to be losers. They would be the gainers in the truest sense of the word. The elimination of the ‘wages of sin’ is never a loss either to the individual concerned or to society;
 it is pure gain.
 It is the greatest delusion to suppose that the duty of swadeshi begins and ends with merely spinning so much yarn anyhow and wearing khadi made from it. Khadi is the first indispensable step towards the discharge of swadeshi dharma twoards society. One often meets men who wear khadi but in all other things indulge their taste for foreign manufactures with a vengeance. Such men cannot be said  to be practising swadeshi. They are simply following the fashion. A votary of swadeshi will carefully study his environment and try to help his neighbours wherever possible by giving preference to local manufactures even if they are of an inferior grade or dearer in price than things manufactured else-where. He will try to remedy their defects but will not give them up because of their defects and take to foreign manufactures.
 But even swadeshi like any other good thing can be ridden to death if it is made a fetish. That is a danger that must be guarded against. To reject foreign manufactures merely because they are foreign and to go on wasting notional time and money to promote manufactures in one’s country for which it is not suited wuld be criminal folly and a negation of the swadeshi spirit. A true votary of swadeshi will never harbour ill-will towards  the  oreigner, he  will not  be moved by antagonism towards anybody on earth. Swadeshism is not a cult of hatred. It is a doctrine of selfless service that has its roots in the purest ahimsa, i.e., love.

      LIMITS TO FREEDOM     
 Some Digambarlibtech_260_footnotelibtech_261_footnoteJains have asked the Sardar how, in the face of the Congress resolution passed at Karachi regarding  fundamental rights and duties, assuring religious freedom under swaraj, anyone can object to Digambar Jain sadhus roaming about naked in accordance with their religion. The Sardar had replied that religious freedom could not imply that an act which appeared indecent to many or hurts their feelings was permissible. And he had said it was his opinion that despite being sadhus, if they went about naked, it was bound to hurt people’s feelings.
 I feel that the Sardar could have possibly given no other reply.  I myself believe that the ideal state for all human beings is nakedness.
 
 
 But an ideal human being would always be innocent and free of passions or desires. Without such innocence, anyone roaming about naked would be regarded as a sinful man.
 There is no reason to conclude that because Digambar sadhus are known as sadhus they would necessarily be free of all passions. Even if they are so, it is their dharma to keep within the bounds of social decency. A few Jains may understand the state of these sadhus. But society by and large will fail to comprehend it and its feelings will be hurt. These naked sadhus have no need to visit cities. It they have, they should observe the minimum bounds of decency prescribed for citizens. Instead of doing that if they insist upon entering cities in a naked state, or if the  shravakaslibtech_262_footnotelibtech_263_footnoteinsist upon this, in  my  opinion  it would be regarded as  adharmalibtech_264_footnotelibtech_265_footnote.   I  myself  am  fond  of  the  state  of nakedness. If I were living in a lonely forest I would remain in that state, but in this world full of passions, there is little likelihood of this becoming the commonly accepted practice. For the preservation of morality even great men of every persuasion have to cover their pri- vate parts; it is their dharma to do so. Freedom, both individual and religious, has always had and will always have many limits. Religion does not hanker after rights, it hungers for restraints and restrictions. Anyone who knows religion and practises it does not think in terms of his rights. Nudity cannot be one’s duty. It is one’s duty to abandon all possessions. That is a dharma of the mind. If anyone puts any burden on me, that is not possession. But is becomes so if I start enjoying that burden. The sadhu who bears the burden of the loin- cloth for the preservation of the social order does not violate the principle of non-possession but rather exercises selfcontrol.The sadhu who insists upon going about naked without worrying about the feelings of society is self-willed. The following dictum of the Gita is pertinent in this context: “For me there is naught to do in the three worlds, yet I am ever in action. If I were not to perform my task, these worlds would be ruined; I should be the cause of chaos and of the end of all mankind.”libtech_266_footnotelibtech_267_footnoteSadhus should not do anything which would harm the people. Let society never encourage them to do so.

      NOTES     
 DISTINGUISHING SWADESHI FROM FOREIGN GOODS
 The   following   questionlibtech_268_footnotelibtech_269_footnotehas   been   received   regarding   this subject:
 No royal road has been found for distinguishing foreign from swadeshi cloth. A picketer should acquaint himself well with this distinction. And hence the general advice is that no one should purchase from uncertified shops. These certificates are of two kinds: Those issued by the All-India Spinners’ Association in  regard  to khadi and those issued by the Swadeshi Sabha in respect of cloth manufactured by Indian textile mills. I do not know if this second type of certificate has yet been issued. But khadi exclusively is the simpler way out. Where falsehood has become almost universal, the sentiment for khadi alone will stand the people in good  stead.  Untruth has entered even the domain of khadi, or, in other words, deceit is being practised with regard to it also; yet there is minimum room for deceit in it. Moreover, those who spin at home have nothing to fear.
 Then the question will arise as to what a picketing sevikalibtech_270_footnotelibtech_271_footnoteshould do. If she shares my faith in khadi, she would regard picketing as a means for carrying on propaganda for khadi and, while turning the customers away from shops selling foreign cloth, she would direct them towards those selling khadi. If the latter do not take this course, she will remain patient and have faith that there is no other way to boycott foreign cloth. And even if there is one, it is futile; moreover,  it is also well worth remembering that there is no special merit in boycotting foreign cloth. Such boycott is both useful and necessary for khadi propaganda. The woman picket who realizes this basic truth will not be insulted—because she will not feel insulted—or perplexed. She has somehow to carry on khadi propaganda for the sake of the poor. Other activities involve fear, insult, dishonesty and result in no benefit to the poor.
 BUYER’S  OBSTINACYlibtech_272_footnote
The answer to this question should be regarded as having been
 
 included in the above. If the customer is obstinate, we should be a hundredfold so. The customer’s obstinacy has no ground, ours has a strong one. “The khadi that he wants” cannot mean that he should get khadi as soft as satin made in Paris at the  very  same  price.  Anyone who wears khadi has no other alternative but to wear khadi whether coarse of fine. We should remember that we cannot satisfy all people. It is not our job to satisfy everyone; rather, everybody should suit himself to the needs of the poor, that is, be satisfied. Khadi alone  is the refuge of the affcted. We should be patient even with those who disregard it.
 SUCH PICKETS ARE TOO FEWlibtech_273_footnote
 If the number of women pickets is five and there are  five hundred shops, let them deal with only five shops or even with only one. Propaganda for khadi is a matter of dharma and not policy. Hence regardless of whether there is only one picket or many, that dharma must be performed. It will be good even if only one shopkeeper relents. It is not as if in this matter an  individual shopkeeper did not have to act till all shopkeepers acted and gave up selling foreign cloth. Even if only one gives up, the  five  women should continue picketing, thinking that the work has progressed to that extent. Seeing them picketing, other women will come forward. If their picketing produces an effect on one merchant, there is a likelihood of its having an effect on the others also. If this does not hap-pen, the merchant who relented will have no cause for regret. If trading in foreign cloth is a sin, although others may continue to be sinful he who has realized that this practice is sinful will give it up. It has always been thus. If I had waited for everyone, propaganda for khadi could never have been done. A Herculean task calls for Herculean courage.
 “It is because of his courage that Columbus discovered a new world,” says a poet. But Columbus’s courage was exhibited for his own pleasure. It was not intended to serve anyone. Underlying it was his desire to discover a new world and to amass the wealth to be found in it. In order to do so, he navigated the seas; then how much more courage shold we show in order to cloth the crores of naked people of
 
 India? The sevika who shares Columbus’s faith and has his patience will continue her work even if she is alone. Day by day she will gain new strength and new faith, and will think of new ways of doing her work or, the “Kindly Light” will point out new paths to her. Meanwhile, she would sing:
“One step enough for me.”
 POOR MANlibtech_274_footnote
 This question implies disparagement of khadi or one may say it implies ignorance of the importance of khadi. Has it been raised because it is supposed that producing khadi is an easy job or one for which only a few persons are needed? Khadi work is a great science which has so far been imperfectly studied. Let  as  many  people, young and old, as may wish, take up this work; there cannot be too many of them. How many men will be required in order to meet the needs of seven hundred thousand villages? Khadi work is so vast that even if a hundred thousand men give eight hours a day to it, some work will still remain undone. In this very issue, there is a brief account of the production and sale of khadi in Gujarat alone. A glance at this should give everyone an idea of how many men are required for khadi work.
 But I am aware that there is another question behind the above questio, viz, khadi work is all very well, but if a man finds it uninteresting, what should  he  do?  Such  men  should  remove  the filth  in  villages;  they  should  insted  of  making   speeches  for  that purpose, take up a broom and clean up roads and latrines, stop garbage heaps from forming and spread rules of sanitation among the people. Although the women will do picketing, they will need much help in doing so; that help should be given by men; if the men are competent enough, they should sit under trees in villages and without any books run schools for children as also start night schools for adults. For anyone who is bent on serving, the field is limitless. And everyone should realize that, when the time for launching the struggle comes again, the strength for it will be generated only through such activities.
 Even the violent soldiers of the world have acted in this manner and continue to do so. It is only the mercenary soldier who, when not engaged in fighting, becomes a drain because he eats bread which he has not rightfully earned. He is therefore a nuisance as he is busy seeking pleasures and is a burden to the earth. We have seen from history that Garibaldi and his soldiers tilled the land when they were not fighting. The Boers were farmers by profession and when the time for fighting came, right from General Botha down to the poorest Boer, they gave up their plough shares and showed such courage on the battlefield that it astonished the world—this I have seen with my own eyes. If soldiers who believe in violence preserve  their  fighting strength by doing such constructive work, I cannot understand why the non-violent soldiers of India in this age should find it difficult to do constructive work. Every reader should remember that a great deal of penance and constructive work lay behind the enthusiasm which was generated last year.
 IF POISON IS MIXED WITH MILK?libtech_275_footnote
 Just as milk in which even a drop of poison has fallen is fit to be shunned, so, in my opinion, should we have nothing to do with a shop selling foreign cloth along with Indian cloth. Just as a person who drinks pure milk at a brewer’s shop will be regarded as a drunkard, so too a customer who buys swadeshi cloth at a shop selling foreign cloth will be misunderstood. Is there any dearth of shops dealing only in swadeshi cloth? Even if there are only a few such shops and those are not in our neighbourhood, we should go to these wherever they are located. For those who are picketing, the way is straightforward: they should warn people who approach shops selling foreign cloth and turn them away, if possible. I have recently  received  even  this question whether swadeshi goods can be bought at a liquor shop if they are being sold there. I didn’t hesitate to reply immediately that the answer was in the negative.

 I have not answered your telegram because I did not know how to. Now that I have got your letter I am able to answer your ques- tions.
  Since 	picketing is to be 	peaceful free of 	all coercion, 	there  is 	no question 	of insistence on 	sealing up 	 the  present 	stock.  But 	if a 	cloth merchant declines 	to sign 	your pledge it 	is open 	to you 	to picket 	his shop even though 	it may 	contain swadeshi cloth.

 MY DEAR FRIEND,
 You are fishing for a compliment  but  I  am  not  going  to give it to  you   if  only  because  it  would  be  a  repetition  of  what I have told you before. But you are quite  right  in thinking  that I do not read newspapers. Even the local ones I  read  for  a  few minutes and that too grudgingly. Leading articles, as a rule, escape me. You did well therefore in sending me the  Leader cutting. Aninoffensive paragraph in Navajivan by Mahadev Desai has been made much of. I can only give you my assurance that I am not going lightly to declare war. I know what it would mean to Lord Irwin. The relations between us so developed during the negotiations that the very consideration that a declaration of war would hurt Irwin to the quick would alone make me wait a thousand times before embarking on any such step. But I can tell you in confidence that many occasions have arisen when,  if I was so minded,libtech_277_footnotelibtech_278_footnoteI might have broken up negotiaions with local authorities. But I have exercised and am still exercising immense patience. In any case I am not going to take any step without giving an ample opportunity to the Viceroy to review the situation and taking the public into confidence. It goes without saying that I would do nothing without first getting the  sanction of the Working Committee.
 So far for the peace or war part of your fears. The communal question is a horse of another colour. My position was made clear to Lord Irwin times without number and I made it clearer still at the farewell interview in Bombay. He greatly sympathized with my posi- tion. As you know, the Congress demand is far above what the Round Table Conference has higherto discussed. If we do not reach a communal settlement, I could not make the demand with any confi- dence in myself. But my non-participation in the Conference need not mean war. Failure to arrive at a settlement cannot be debited to the British Government though the question at all arises because of the present system of administraion. But I need not carry the matter any further.  In this matter too I am feeling my way and if I at all can,  I would certainly attend the Conference. I have come to no irrevo- cable decision. If the way at all opens up before me I will go to
 
 
 London  without   the  slightest  hesitation.	Do pleases write to me whenever you feel inclined.

  	I got your letter. “A non-Antyaja Hindu” does not mean a 	Bhangi, it means a Hindu who is not an antyaja.  The man I  	have  in view is a Brahmin brought up in Gujarat. As the Ashram does 	not recognize distinctions of caste and community and as it is 	necessary to abolish the class of Antyajas from Hindu 	society,  I  realty think that it would be good if Lakshmi could be 	married to a non-Antyaja. I a certainly very glad to know 	that Laksmi is not eager to get married just now. I hope I told you 	bout a house near Amreli.  Blessings 	from  BAPU "

  Interviewed 	by the Associated Press regarding the statement recently made by Sir 	Chimanlal Setalvad in connection with Mahatma Gandhi’s attitude 	towards the Round Table Conference, Mahatma Gandhi said : You 	embarrass me by asking question on anything that Sir  	Chimanlal Setalvad says about me. His age and his greatness entitle 	him to make statements on insufficient data and yet absolve him from 	criticism from one like myself.    
 Moreover, whilst I am carrying on delicate negotiations, I may not be over-communicative, but I can make a general statement that I am not conscious of having done anything to endanger the Settlement or in contravention of it.
 Though under given circumstances, I am anxious and willing to attend the Round Table Conference, there is nothing in the Settlement, so far as I can read it, to make it compulsory for the Congress to take part in the Round Table Conference, but that discussion is purely academic, for the question of non-attendance has not arisen at all.
 Asked if it was true that his attitude was undergoing constant change, Mahatma Gandhi said :
I am not aware of having done such a thing.
 Replying to a question whether he would take part in the Round Table Conference, he said:
 If I succeed in attending the Round Table Conference, I should put forth the Congress demands with all zeal and power I may have and fully participate in the proceeding and not be a mere spectator at the Round Table Conference.
 Questioned whether there was an impasse in Bardoli, Mahatma Gandhi said :
 I have had a happy interview with the Collector along with Mr. Vallabhbhai Patel and I am hoping that everything would be fixed up satisfactorily.
 Replying to a further question if there was any breach of the Truce terms in Bardoli or Borsad, he stated:
I would prefer not to answer that question, because negotiations
 are still going on for the settlement of outstanding questions both in Bardoli and Borsad.

      LETTER TO C. F. ANDREWS     
 AS  AT SABARMATI,
 June  2, 1931
 MY DEAR CHARLIE,
 I have your two precious letters. I see you are in a hury to have me in England through the air mail if I would fly. But I can hardly hop. I see no light before me as yet. My desire is certainly to go there but the inner voice says ‘no’ and the external atmosphere confirms the guidence of the inner voice. As you know, the Congress demands are strung in a high pitch. They could not be otherwise. If  we cannot set our house in order here so far even as the communal question is concerned I could not speak in London as with one voice. It therefore does seem to me that if the communal trouble is not finished and a workable formula is not arrived at by agreement I should not have the requisite self-confidence to deliver the Congress message. That is so far as the Round Table Conference is concerned. But of course if the British Minister require my presence in order to discuss the Congress position and understand it and if they would want me to do a little lobbying also I could come whenever required. But then there is the Delhi Settlement. I am bound to see, as far as is possible for a single human being, that there is no breakdown. The Bombay Government has given me cause enough to re-declare hostilities but if you knew everything you would yourself be amazed at my patience.  In every little thing it is like drawing a live tooth.  But I must not weary you with these troubles of mine. I am taking them cheerfully and breaking down opposition. Thank God, I do receive help from the Central Government. I believe Mr. Emerson knows me and he will play the game. But local governments may produce situations which neither he nor I can control. I can tell you that so far as the Congress is concerned, Congressmen are implementing the Settlement in a manner not even expected by me. Of course there is overzeal now and again in picketing but it is immediately brought
 
 under control.  You can give this assurance to all who may need it that I am anxious to attend the Conference and try my utmost to secure lasting peace and an honourable settlement of the constitutional question by negotiation. It is only external circumstances  which  really detain me. But in any case for reasons unconnected with my hesitation the Round Table Conference and its Committees stand postponed. There need be therefore no hurry just now over my coming unless of course I am required there independently of the Conference. I have now told you all that you should know.
 I am just now in Bardoli fixing up things. Gurudev seems to be ailing.
Love.

         LETTER TO SATIS CHANDRA DAS GUPTA       AS 	 AT SABARMATI,  June 	 2, 1931  DEAR 	SATIS BABU,  	I have your letter. Subhasbabu was here and he had  a formidable 	list of countercharges. I have now telegraphed to both ask- ing them 	to submit to arbitration by mutual consent, and if they will appoint 	some local men as arbitrators and abide by their decision, this 	unseemly squabble might end. In any case I am going to try whatever 	is possible on the 9th.  	You are having success with the Gita and the Autobiography. 	I did not expect you would have any sale for these books.  	I am glad you have gained in weight but you have to gain much more. 	And I am certain that you should not stint yourself about food that 	your system may require. It is quite enough that you deny your- self 	flesh and fish. You ought to take milk and curds liberally and take 	such fresh fruit as is easily available. I have written similarly to 	Hemprabha also. She is wrong in denying herself food that her body 	requires because Nikhillibtech_285_footnoteis no more.   I feel more and more that this kind of 	self-denial not only carries no merit but is a violation of nature’s 	laws. Denial of food has merit when it is undertaken for control of 	the palate or as a medical necessity.    
 Kishorelal Mashruwala raises a doubt as to the authenticity of the spinner’s letter of 1828 whose translation you sent me the other day and which I published in Young India.libtech_286_footnoteHe thinks that the langu- age is much too modern, as also the conception. If I understood your letter rightly, you had mentioned that the copy of the newspaper in which the letter appears is in your possession.

  	I thank you for your letter. Whilst I have a very vivid recollec- 	tion of your personal serviceslibtech_288_footnotelibtech_289_footnoteto 	me I have long ceased even to think of rewarding such services 	materially. I have rendered myself practi- cally incapable of 	rendering such services. The only service therefore I have for years 	rendered for them has been heartfelt thanks, and heartfelt thanks of 	a poor man like me take the shape of blessings. I must confess that 	I have been the recipient of personal kindnesses      
 from many quarters. Just imagine what would be my state and the state of rich men whom I only know in public life if I were to ask them for donations for the enterprise of my benefactors. You will therefore please excuse me for my inability to respond to your desire.

 June  2, 1931
 DEAR SIR COWASJI,
 I thank you for your prompt acknowledgement of my letterlibtech_290_footnoteand the trouble you are still taking with reference to the land in Sardar Garda’s possesion. It seems to me that he is legally bound to transfer the property having written the letter concluding the bargin. I have written to him to that effectlibtech_291_footnotein reply to his letter. I have been making
 further enquiries and I am able to give you my assurance that there is nothing in the charges made by him.  On the contrary he is becoming  a terror to the people. Youngsters under 12 years of age were arrested for having helped themselves to mangoes from his land. You do not know the taluqa. Mango trees are not protected and urchins all over the land help themselves often to mangoes during the mango season and nobody worries about them. I am not sure that the urchins whom he had arrested had touched his mangoes. But even if they had, they would be under nobody’s control. And yet he would press incidents like this into service to make up his indictment although these inci- dents have nothing to do with alleged harassment.
 I shall await your letter regading Miss V. Contractor’s com- plaint.
 Yours sincerely,

 I had the letter you both wrote on board the ship. I also got news of your having reached there. I will now expect your regular letter by the next mail. Ba is with me at Bardoli. She was with me at Simla too. Nothing is certain as yet about my going to England. The solution of the Hindu-Muslim problem seems to be far away yet.
 As for the rest, everything is all right. I have no time to write more.
 Sita—I have forgotten her other name—must have now put on weight again.  The climate there is such that one simply cannot fall ill.  I should be equally happy if Sushila too puts on weight.

  LETTER TO CHHAGANLAL JOSHI 
 June 2, 1931
 CHI. CHHAGANLAL,
 Surendra’s letter seems to have confused you. He has mixed up several issues, with the result that you could not understand my real meaning. The idea that Surendra should return to the Ashram is independent of other considerations, and these are the reasons for my view:
 It did not seem necessary to me to keep him at Karadi.  It 	is not proper 	for us, 	who have taken the 	vow of aparigraha, to 	make a 	special effort to 	find out 	another place 	and stay there.  In 	the present 	circumstances, it would 	not at 	all be 	wrong if 	persons like him 	return to 	the Ashram.  Sardar 	would certainly prefer that Surendra and 	other work 	ers like 	him who cannot 	easily adjust themselves 	to circumstances should 	stay in the Ashram. 
 The following is the substance of the other po9ints discussed along with these :
  Those 	Ashram workers who were 	slack in observing 	the Ashram 	rules of discipline 	and who were unwilling 	to return 	to the 	Ashram on 	the pretext 	that they should 	work outside 	should return to it.  It 	was the duty of 	those Ashram, 	workers  who  were required 	outside the Ashram 	and who could 	observe the Ashram 	rules to 	stay outside it 	and do 	the required work.  It 	was preferable 	to have 	only one public 	worker in every 	village.  When 	there are 	more workers 	than one 	in a 	village, it 	is likely 	that they will not have 	enough work to do and 	that even small 	differences of 	opinion which 	may arise among them will confuse 	the minds 	of the residents.  It 	is probable that 	Darbari left 	the place 	because he felt, 	when he 	saw three 	or four 	Ashram workers there, 	that he 	no longer enjoyed the 	position which he did.  One 	should run 	away from a 	place where the 	necessity of 	one’s services is 	not self-evident. Before 	accepting anybody’s version 	of what 	I may have 	said, you should 	ask me.

 I 	have your letter. You must have received my last letter.  	To reduce food or to abstain from it because a son or a dear one has 	died is ignorance. I see no merit in it.Dharma and true shraddha 	consist in increasing work of service in the name of the 	departed one, recognizing the unity of all souls, and in realizing 	the transitoriness of the body. We should reduce food or give up 	some item of food only for the purpose of controlling the palate or 	removing a physical disorder. The loss of a dear one should have no 	connection with the giving up of food. So wake up; forget Nikhil’s 	death and try to 
 improve your body for the cause of service. You need to take milk, curds and fruit. Tell me if you have any financial difficulty.

 DEAR MR. EMERSON,
 
 There is still the fire-arms question to be decided. I do not know whether you obtained legal advice in the matter. Whatever the legal advice, I am quite certain of the conversation about this very matter at the time I suggested the expression “illegal possession”. If you will look up the original draft, you will perhaps recall the conver- sation because the original draft excluded fire-arms.
 May I remind you about Mathura and Ludhiana incidents.
These are both matters deserving close scrutiny.

          DEAR 	FRIEND,    LETTER TO MRS. C. A. HATE    AS 	 AT SABARMATI,  June 	3, 1931 
  	Whatever energy I possess is due to regular habits and such 	self-restraint as I am capable of exercising. It is quite true that 	friends around me too notice my peace of mind. It is an object of 	envy. It comes from absolute faith in God and His goodness. That 	faith ena- bles me humbly to do the task allotted to me without 	being anxious for the result.  	I believe that indigestion is one thing which everybody can control 	and remove. Before I can advise you on your food, it is really 	necessary for me to know much more about you than you have told me 	in your letter. I should like to know what you feel when you say you 	are suffering from indigestion. Are your bowels acting regularly? 	How long have you suffered from indigestion? What food are you 	taking now and in what quantity and how many times? What exercises 	are you taking? How do you pass your days?  Yours 	sincerely,  MRS. 	C. A.

       DEAR 	FRIEND,  AS 	 AT SABARMATI,  June 	3, 1931 
  	I thank you for your letter of the 30th April last. I thought that 	the proposition that the Indian is a mere clerklibtech_305_footnotein the administration of the country was not 	seriously disputed by anybody. Wish that you could read the minds 	even of the Indian members of the I.C.S. I know from personal 	experience of them that the vast majority of them do not feel 	anything more than mere clerks, somewhat glorified if you like. But 	when I wrote the passage I had not the few of these highly-paid 	Indians in mind but I had the army of actual clerks who, no matter 	what their ability may be, can never rise beyond the status of 	clerks.  	When I said that the Indian at best was a commission agent I again 	thought that I was stating what was literally the truth. Take the 	largest item of foreign trade. Is not the Indian merely the agent of 	his foreign principals? If he makes five rupees for himself, he 	makes Rs. 95 for his principal. So long as the conditions of trade 	remain what they are it cannot be otherwise. If India remains 	principally a country exporting raw produce and importing 	manufactured articles, Indian merchants must be largely commission 	agents whether of England,    
 Japan, America or any other foreign country.
 How shall I prove to you the daily humiliating experience of the Indian who, no matter how wealthy he is, gets no facility whereas his English rival gets many things done for the asking. Take the case of the British navigation companies, the concessions enjoyed by Euro- peans all over India whether in mining, banking or other commercial pursuits too numerous to mention.
 When I say that the English trade is founded upon the ruin of Indian trade, I have simply written what historians have stated. If it was merely enterprise and grit that had brought about the state of things I should not grumble. But I would like you to study the rise of the East India Co. from the records of the India Office collected, be it said to their honour, by English historians.
 In writing of the levelling process I certainly had not in mind the Soviet rule of Bolshevism. It is perhaps somewhat shameful that I have to confess to you that I do not yet know exactly what Bolshevism is for the simple reason that I have not had time to study the inner working of the Russian revolution. The levelling process to me simply means that the system of favouritism on which, as I believe, English commerce has been built should cease and for that purpose a double process has to begin. Favouritism should go and young Indian enterprises should receive State help and patronage.
 I know that I must not expect to convert you by argument. What I would like Englishmen in India to do is to see them [selves] as the average Indian sees them and ask themselves why it is that the vast majority of Indians feel as I often write in the pages of Young India. Can it be that what some English economists have written and what most Indian economists, historians and administrators have written is all untrue? The case that I have presented is based upon their testi- mony and supported by personal experience.
 Lastly, however much I may differ from your views, let me assure you that I appreciate your persistence in trying to convince me of my error.  And if you will not give up the attempt I dare say that if  I am not converted it is possible that in the process of friendly interchange of communications you might be able to see theother side of the shield.

 I 	have your letter.  	I certainly think that it is everyone’s duty and especially an 	educationist’s to speak the truth at all cost.  	Discussion of politics in colleges should carry no stigma.  	It was impossible to cover in the Delhi Agreement cases  in  Indian 	States.  	I can understand the distinction between those who resigned on their 	own free will and those who were dismissed. A dismissal may take 	place on valid grounds apart from civil disobedience.  	I should be astonished if it was true, that because you were 	dismissed from Kashmir State service for the reasons you state, 	other educational institutions will not take you up.

 MY DEAR KRISHNADAS,
 Your firm hand in your letter of 25th May showed the rapid recovery you have made. I hope that there has been much more progress since then. You must not stir out till you are strong and are able to take fairly long walks without being fatigued. Whilst you are at it, it is much better not only to regain your original strength but to build up practically a new body. And all this should be possible after the terrible crisis which had reduced you to a shadow.
 Subhasbabu travelled with me from Mathura and we were together as far as Baroda. We had long chats. He came again to Bar- doli. I have advised him to submit the Bengal disputes to local arbitra- tion.
I go to Bombay on the 9th returning here on the 12th.

   CASTE AND COMMUNAL QUESTION  
A student who sends his name writes:libtech_309_footnote
 It is not quite correct to say that Hindus and Mussalmans do not greet one another on their respective sacred days. But one would certainly like much more frequent and extensive interchange of such greetings.
 As for caste I have frequently said that I do not believe in caste in the modern sense. It is an excrescence and a handicap on progress. Nor do I believe in enequalities between human beings. We are all absolutely equal. But equality is of souls and not bodies.  Hence it is a mental state. We need to think of and to assert equality because we see great inequalities in the physical world. We have to realize equlity in the midst of this apparent external inequality. Assumption of superiority by any person over any other is a sin against God and man. Thus caste, in so far as it c onnotes distinctions  in  status, in  an evil.
 I do however believe in varna which is based on hereditary occupations. Varnas are four to mark four universal occupations, — imparting knowledge, defending the defenceless, carrying on agri- culture and commerce and performing service through  physical labour. These occupations are common to all mankind, but Hinduism, having recognized them as the law of our being, has made use of it in regulating social relations and conduct. Gravitation affects us all whether one knows its existence or not. But scientists who knew the law have made it yield results that have startled the world. Even so has Hinduism startled the world by its discovery and application of the law of varna.When Hindus were seized with inertia, abuse of varna resulted in innumerable castes with unnecessary and harmful restrictions as to intermarriage and interdining. The law of varna has nothing to do with these restrictions. People of different varnas may intermarry and interdine.These restrictions may be necessary in the interest of chastity and hygiene. But a Brahmin who marries a Sudra girl or vice versa commits no offence against the law of varna.
 Marriage outside one’s religion stands on a different footing. Even here, so long as each is free to observe his or her religion, I can see no moral objection to such unions. But I do not believe that these unions can bring peace. They may follow peace. I can see nothing
 
 but disaster following any attempt to advocate Hindu-Muslim unions so long as the relations between the two remain strained. That such unions may be happy in exceptional circumstances can be no reason for their general advocacy. Interdining between Hindus and Mussl- mans does take place even now on a large scale. But that again has not resulted in promoting peace. It is my settled conviction that intermarriage and interdining have no bearing on communal unity. The causes of discord are economic and political, and it is these that have to be removed. There is intermarriage and interdining in Europe, but the Europeans have fought amongst themselves as we Hindus and Mussalmans have never fought in all history. Our masses have stood aside.
 The untouchables are a class apart—a standing reproach to Hindu-ism. The castes are a handicap, they are no sin. Untouchability is a sin, a grievous crime, and will eat up Hinduism, if the latter does not kill the snake in time. Untouchables’ should no longer be the outcastes of Hin-duism. They should be regarded as honoured members of Hindu society, and should belong to the varna for which their occupation fits them.
 According to my definition of varna there is no varna in operation at present in Hinduism. The so-called Brahmins have ceased to impart knowledge. They take to various other occupations. This is more or less true of theother varnas. In reality, being under foreign domination we are all slaves, and hence less than Sudras—untouch- ables of the West.
 The correspondent being a vegetarian finds it difficult to reconcile himself to dining with meat-eating Mussalmans. But he should re-member that there are many more meat-eating Hindus than Mussalmans. A vegetarian may with impunity dine with meat-eaters, Hindu and others, so long as he has eatable food cleanly prepared and placed before him. He will always have fruit and milk whereever he goes.

   NOTES  
 SAVE ME FROM MY ADMIRERS
A correspondent writes from far off Cape Comorin:libtech_310_footnote
 . . . In the car festivals here the Image is placed in the car and taken in procession. One set of people want that your photo should be placed side by side with the Image and taken in procession. Another set of riper men say that you would not like to be treated as God . . .
Another from Mathura sends me a horrible portrait representing
 me as lying stretched on the coil of the thousand-mouthed serpent with the roll of non-co-operation in one hand and the spinning-wheel suspended on the other arm. My poor wife is massaging my legs. The other celebrities have also been pressed into service. I must not violate the reader’s feelings by describing the other features. Suffice  it to say that the picture is a caricature of the Vaishnavite legend representing Vishnu resting on the coil of Sheshanag.The correspo- ndent who sends the picture asks me to plead with the publishers for its withdrawal. He rightly adds that though they may not publicly express their resentment, the picture must hurt the  feelings  of  orthodox Vaishnavas. I whole-heartedly endorse the sentiments  of both these correspondents. The motive in each case may be quite good.But this excessive heroworship borders on questionable idolatry, and is calculated to wound susceptibilities of the orthodox people without there being any excuse for giving such  offence.  Such excesses will defeat the purpose of the blind worshippers. If they have any regard for my feelings, let the organizers of the car festival who would put my portrait in the car and the publishers of the offending picture desist from their activity. There are many other healthy ways of giving expression to and promoting patriotic sentiment.
 REPATRIATES FROM SOUTH AFRICA
 Pandit Benarsidas Chaturvedi and Swami Bhavani Dayal  Sannyasi have prepared a well-reasoned report of an independent enquiry they held into the condition of emigrants repatriated to India under the assisted emigration scheme from South Africa. This report and the Swami’s telegram dated 16th ultimo, asking me to comment on it, telling me, “Condition worst, many starving, women half naked, children begging”, have lain with me ever since. I am sorry that I have not been able to deal with the report earlier. The telegram from
 
 which I have quoted is an epitome of the report. The condition of our people, who find themselves strangers in their own land, is a disgrace alike to us and to the Government, but more to us than to the Government. No Government in the world can cope fully with such cases. Governments can only support to a limited extent voluntary public effort in such cases. It is really up to the merchant princes and other employers of labour in Calcutta to take a real interest in the welfare of such people, and find suitable employment for them.
 But the condition of these people is a small consideration, compared with the cause that has reduced those repatriates to the condition in which theyfind themselves. There should have been no agreed repatriation at all, and if there was to be any, there should have been ample provision previously made to ensure proper occupation for them, and in any case there should never have been any consent to the repatriation of colonial-born Indians, of whom there are fully thirty-three per cent in the Calcutta depot. But it is no use crying over spilt milk. The labours of the framers of the report will not have been in vain if at the time of the revision of the Cape Agreement, the rights of the poor labouring Indian population are not bartered away for doubtful concessions to the other Indian settlers. The position taken up by the latter is unassailable, and should depend on its own merits. The settlers themselves should therefore refuse to be party to any bargain, which would compromise the rights of their less favourably situated brethren. South Africa can easily absorb and accommodate the existing Indian population.
 GANDHI ASHRAM, MEERUT
 This Ashram, a creation of  Acharya  Kripalani,  has  issued  a neat little pamphlet describing its activities. From a tiny thing which it was when it began life at Benares in 1920, it has now  grown into a big thing with branches and its  own  premises  in  Meerut, the headquarters. It is now a registered charitable associa- tion. Its chief activity is production and distribution of khadi, but it runs free dispensaries and night schools wherever it is possible. Its production of khadi in 1921 was Rs. 48 and sale Rs. 3,100. The production in 1930 was Rs. 4,21,490 and sales Rs. 5,32,361. The price of its khadi 45"" in width was Re. 1 per yard in 1921, and Rs. 0- 5-6 per yard in 1930. It has departments of washing, calendering, and dyeing besides the cotton processes up to weaving. It  takes  and teaches apprentices in these departments, and finds work for the poor women of Meerut by giving them knitting, bordering of bedsheets,
 etc. Who can say that khadi has no future, or that it is not the help of the poorest in the land?
 Young India, 4-6-1931
 
   IS IT AN ECONOMIC NECESSITY?  
 A contribution in the Times of India (26-5-’31) has the following:
 Mahtma Gandhi, in his latest pronouncementlibtech_311_footnoteconcerning the purpose and procedure of picketig, has reiterated his belief that the exclusion of foreign cloth is an ‘economic necessity to India’. Perhaps he will explain, in the next issue of Young India, in what sense he uses that  term.  The  information required can be supplied by answering certain questions prompted by the piecegoods situation as it is now developing.
  To 	what extent 	has the decline 	of 1,000 	million yeards in 	the imports of 	cotton piecegoods 	in 1930-31 	been balanced 	by the 	increased production of 	indigenous cloth based 	upon the processes 	of hand-spinning 	and weaving?  To 	what extent has 	it been balanced by increase in  mill 	 production?  Will 	the boycott be 	persisted in, 	regardless of 	the extent 	to which 	imported goods are displaced by hand-made and mill-made goods respectively?  If 	so, to 	what extent 	is the 	boycott in 	the interests 	of Bombay 	as distinct 	from other provinces? 
 Clearly, if the endeavour to revive the village industry has definitely failed, as appears to be the case, however reluctant Mahatma Gandhi may be to acknowledge defeat in a campaign so close to his heart, then the time has arrived, in the interests of public honesty, to transfer the formal control of the boycott campaign to the Cotton Millowners’ Associations, acting as principals, instead of continuing the camouflage of control by Congress, acting as agents.
The answers to the specific questions are:
  It 	is impossible to 	answer the 	question in 	terms of 	yards because 	khadi is 	not all commercially 	produced. Home 	manufacture of 	khadi for 	use by manufacturers 	themselves is proceeding 	on an 	ever increasing 	scale, which it 	is impossible for 	the poor 	All-India Spinners’ 	Association to measure. 
 
 
  The 	indigenous mills 	are undoubtedly playing 	 an important 	part in 	making good 	the deficit. It 	will be, subject to what follows.  The 	interest of 	Bombay is 	the interest 	of India. 	The writer 	perhaps includes 	Ahmedabad in Bombay, 	and evidently 	ignores the 	other important mills 	scattered all over India. 
 I have answered the specific questionsfor the satisfaction of the writer of the article than of myself or the public. The public should know that I should lose all interest in boycott of foreign cloth, if I really discovered that khadi was a failure, as the writer is sure it has proved to be already. I do not know the source of his assurance. But  as the party chiefly concerned in khadi production and propaganda, I make bold to say that it is not only not a failure but is making sure though slow headway all over India. I therefore do reiterate the claim that boycott is an econo-mic necessity for the masses. It may sound strange, but it is true that it is not in the same sense and to the same extent an economic necessity for the mills as for khadi. Mills have undoubtedly flourished beyond their expectations by reason of the boycott, but they could have, as they were doing, eked out an  existence without the boycott. They could always share with Britain and Japan the exploitation of starving millions by dumping their manufactures among the ignorant, famishing millions, who, forgetting that by using their leisure hours they could manufacture their own cloth, would buy the flimsy mill calico and thus doubly injure them- selves. Boycott cannot therefore be wholly transferred to the mills even if they wanted it. And If they undertook it, it would fail. The fact cannot be concealed tht the mills are interested in the boycott chiefly for their agents’ and their share-holders’ profits. The Con- gress is concerned with the boycott wholly in the interest of the  masses.
 The writer and,  for  that  matter,  many  others  do  not  know that the khadi method is a new method in economics as non-violence is a new method in politics. The khadi method is bound to  con-  found the orthodox economic theories, as non-violence has al- most  already  confounded  the  orthodox  political   methods.  The new method lends itself ot the orthodox  statistical  demonstration only to a certain extent. It is the khadi spirit that is responsible for the phenomenal success of the boycott. Boycott itself is no new cry.  It is as old as, if not older than, the Bengal partition period. But he hope
 of success was born with the rebirth of khadi in 1919, and the hope was partly realized last year when khadi spirit was at its highest. The real manifestation of the khadi spirit has still to come. And when it does, as it is bound to come, and that too sooner than most people expect, there will be neither picketing nor statistical demonstration required.
 The Times of India writer suggests tat the boycott is designed  or calculated merely to benefit the mills to the injury of the masses. The suggestion would have foundation if there was no khadi behind the boycott. Let the writer and critics like him remember that the Congress formula in so many words is ‘Boycott through Khadi’. The India mills come in to supplement khadi. But the boycott would stand in spite of the Indian mills if they opposed khadi. Many did oppose it  at one time. Their indiference to khadi was still more marked.  But be  it said to their credit that they have somewhat recognized the time spirit, and even though yet half-heartedly in the majority of cases, they have made terms with khadi. Some have become thorough converts to it, and will not even mind losing, if they must, for its sake. The Indian mills are therefore in no sense of the term principals in the boycott campaign. they benefit no doubt, and they will, at least for the time being, increasingly benefit, but the ratio of increse will be in direct proportion to the correctness of their  conduct  in  their dealings with khadi.
 The writer, as well as the reader, will now understand why India, that is to say, the masses must benefit in the long run even by the recent legislative protection given to the mills. The prices of mill cloth must of course go up. It is for the Congress to carry on ceaseless propaganda, so as to keep the mills from the profiteering temptation, and to teach the masses that their economic welfare lies in the manufacture of khadi in their own cottages through hand-spinning. When once foreign cloth is out of the way, indigenous mills will radily suit their prices and production to khadi, or will themselves face a boycott even like foreign mills.

   R. T. C. AND CONGRESS  
 Had it not been for the necessity of observing reticence for the sake of the lasting peace, which it is the common object of all parties to reach, I should have long ago taken the public into confidence about my proposed visit to London to take part in the R. T. C. I am now in a position to say the following:
 I have made no secret of my opnion, not new but held and expressed even while negotiations were going on in Delhi,  that  I should feel most reluctant to go to London to take part in the Conference, if we failed to solve the communal problem among ourselves. I have seen nothing as yet to make me alter the view.
 There is another obstacle in the way of my leaving India, whilst delicate situations continue to arise regarding the Delhi Pact. I should sacrifice life itself to prevent a breakdown. And I flatter myself with the belief that my presence is necessary to prevent it.
 Let us however hope that both the difficulties will be over by the time it becomes necessary to leave India for the September meeting.
 I can but give my assurance that having entered upon the Settlement, I am eager for the sake of the good name of the Gongess to proceed to London and deliver its message to the R. T. C. and the British statesmen, not excluding even Mr. Churchill. I know that he and his party do not realize that the Congress is no enemy of Great Britain. The Congress merely wants for India what he  and  his ancestors have fought to secure for Great Britain. I therefore need no persuasion to take me to London. I have even said to friends that if the communal tangle was not undone, and I was therefore unable to take part in the R. T. C. but the working of the Settlement left me free,   I should, if so required, proceed to London for the sake of presenting the Congress position to the responsible statesmen.  My  supreme  desire is to attain lasting peace, if it can be had with honour and without inviting the nation to engage in another fight involving untold suffering.

   PRABHATPHERIS  
 It was in the Yeravda prison that I read of the inauguration of prabhatpherislibtech_312_footnotelibtech_313_footnote. I thought that whoever originated the idea deserved thanks for it. I felt that apart from their propaganda value, they were spiritually beautiful. They summoned the sleeping to the call of duty. They reminded them that it was time to rise to the call of duty. They reminded them that it was time to rise from their beds and give thanks to God the first thing in the morning.For I had read that the memmers of the prabhatpheris sang songs of worship as also of topical public events. If wisely guided, this institutution can become a great means of purification as also political education of the right type. But I hear that songs generating bad passion are also some times sung. I should be sorry if my information proved true. I would strongly advise the organizers of these parties to restrict their choice of songs not only during this time of peace but for all time to those of worship and those dealing purely with constructive activities such as khadi, liquor prohibition, communal unity, untouchability and other social reform. The parties must be trained to sing well and in tune and should keep to one hour throughout India. I remember the parties in Bombay not always keeping the same time and in Allahabad keeping a different time from Bombay. The institution has sprung up anyhow, but it will be well now for the prime movers, if there are any, to evolve a proper plan and publish a selection of songs which all, no matter belonging to what faith or party, can sing. This should be a non-party national institution. If parties spring up anyhow and begin singing anyhow and any time, they would disturb the people by their jargon. But good singing in the morning will be appreciated.

   		‘AN HONEST DOUBT’ (?)  
 The now famous Gandhi-Irwin truce terms received an almost  un- animous approbation, though not from the entire section of Congressmen in India, at least from a majority of them. The people and the Press, both in this country as well as on the continent of Europe, expressed their sincere appre- ciation of the succes of the peace negotiations, and there was a consensus of opinion expressed, that honesty of purpose and sincerity in action on both
 
 sides lent sufficient weight to the success of the negotiations. In spite of this, there was and is still a very strong minority comprising especially the  younger generation, which is totally against the truce terms, and emphatically declines to put its seal of approval upon them. They are of the opinion, and we think not without sufficient justification, that the flag of complete independence as the immediate goal of India, hoisted at the Lahore Congress, has been lowered by the truce terms, thereby committing the Congress and its followers to a less severe and entirely different programme of a activities.
 No one for a moment seems to doubt the sincerity of purpose with which Gandhiji, as the one voice on behalf of the Congress, and Lord Irwin, as the spokesman of the British Government, carried out the peace negotiations to such a successful conclusion. The left-wingers, under the leadership of Sjt. Subhas Chandra Bose, had almost planned to oppose the Resolution at Karachi Congress ratifying the Delhi Pact, but better counsels prevailed with them, and we are thankful to them for having averted a very serious defection in the Congress, at a time like the present, when complete unanimity and co- operation mean much. With great reluctance they let Gandhiji have his own way and try once more his faith in the British Government.
 Let us for one moment examine how far the terms of the truce have been observed since the Settlement. Government on their part have released the Civil Disobedience prisoners, withdrawn the various ordinances, and declared the Congress organization a lawful body. The Congress on their part have called off Civil Disobedience, aggressive picketing, boycott of British goods, etc., and have also acceded to the cancellation of the enquiry into police excesses. So much the better for all. But what passes our comprehension is whether or not the Government have strictly adhered to the princeples uderlying the terms. Reports of non-release of prisoners in various parts of the country, promulgation of Section 144 on political meetings, arrests and convictions for political reasons, and various other happenings, which are considered a total violation of the Agreement, are pouring into our ears morning. On the other hand, we are told that the local Governments contend that the people have not always observed the terms of the truce. Whether or not both parties are justified in their charges it is not for us to say.
 In the light of the above, we honestly doubt if Gandhiji, behalf of the Congress, was sufficiently justified in having lowered the flag of independence hoisted at Lahore by agreeing to the truce.  We honestly doubt
 again if he fully satisfied that there was a real change of heart on the part of the
 British Government, so as to commit the Congress to a truce of this sort. We honestly doubt thirdly, if Gandhiji really thought that the British Government
 would take up seriously the question of Indian independence at the next Round Table Conference, even if the Congress under his leadership participated. Fourthly, we entertain an honest doubt if Gandhji thought for one moment that the British Government would totally abdicate in favour of the Congress after 150 years of continued exploitation of a land which is almost their entire subsistence and mainstay. Fifthly, we doubt whether he believed that they would surrender “the brightest jewel in the Crown of the British Empire” to those from whom no exploitation is possible in future, and thus pave the way for their own decline. And last but one, we honestly doubt whether Gandhiji remembered how he has been betrayed on more than one occasion in the past in his trust in the Government, and considered whether Young India would allow him to practise his political jugglery on the toiling millions once more and for ever.
 Last but not the least is the honest doubt we entertain whether there is any ray of hope of success through Congress participation in the coming Conference. Who knows that once Gandhiji with his team has left India for London they will be allowed to return to the scene of their activities, in case the London conversations break down? Who can guarantee to the Indian delegation a hospitable reception in London during its stay there?
 We honestly wonder whether it is not high time for us to present a united front, and if necessary, to wade through a pool of blood, of course pursing the creed of non-violence, to attain our one goal and that for now and for ever.
 The foregoing has been sent me by “The Youth of India” with a duly signed covering letter. I have removed certain unnecessary passages and made some alterations without changing the substance of the charge. There is truth in the statement that there are charges and countercharges about breach of the Settlement by the parties concerned. But I am able to assure the public that so far the diffi- culties have been removed. The Central Government is anxious to implement the Settlement as I know the Congess is. And so long as that condition persists, there is no danger of a breakdown. Beyond this the public will not expect me to go, whilst the very delicate instrument is being worked and kept in tune.
 As to the Settlement  itself,  I  have  no  doubt  whatsoever  that the Congress would have put itself  in  the  wrong  if  it  had  not entered upon it. And it was certainly patriotic on the part of Sjt. Subhas Chandra Bose and the young men who were behind
 him to have withdrawn their opposition and given their support to the Settlement   Resolution at  Karachi.	The  Karachi  Congress  did   not
 lower the independence flag. The Congress mandate is clear on the point.
 Whether the Congress will be able to make good its position at the Round Table Conference I do not know. But I do know that it would be wrong for the Congress to avoid the Conference for fear of rejection of its demands. The Conference is one way of showing the absolute justice of the national demand. It would have been foolish for the Congrss to refuse participation when it was open to it to press its full demand without reservation.The Congress would have betrayed lack of courge if it had declined to avail itself of the opportunity, when it came, of presenting its case at the Round Table Conference.
 Therefore I should not hesitate to go to London and attend the Congerence if I found that I could safely go. My difficulty is funda- mental and well known. I should not have the self-confidence to present the Congress case, if we could not set our own house in order by attaining a solution of the communal problem. But I am waiting, watching and praying. As soon as the way is open, I should not hesitate to go wherever wanted. The other difficulty is less serious, but none the less important. As the principal party on behalf of the Congress to the Pact, I should feel most uneasy leaving India, when serious questions arising out of the Settlement demand attention. I have pledged my honour to Lord Irwin that I shall leave no stone unturned to see that the Settlement does not break down. As I have already hinted, I am having some difficulty with local Governments, but I am hoping that with patience all will be well. In any case I believe in all humility that my presence in India is necessary to avoid a crisis.
 As for the other doubts of the wrter or writers of the letter, I can only repeat what I have said so often. I will not lose hope till I know that nothing is to be gained from negotiation.Since I believe in human nature, in spite of previous disappointments, I must trust. I regard it as practical wisdom. I rely for success upon the inherent justice of the national cause and the equally just means adopted for its vindication.  I do not believe that the Congress delegation will be insulted  in London. And if it is, the Congress will not lose its prestige. The loss will accrue to those who will insult. I therefore ask the youthful writers of the letter not to lose hope, but work with all their might to make the Settlement a success, and by working the constructive programme enhance the power of the Congress to vindicate the national position.
 For the measure of success at the Conference, if the Congress is represented thereat, will be in strict proportion to the measure of the power of the Congress.

   MISSIONARY METHODS  IN  INDIA  
 Gandhiji has given great umbrage to missionaries by his declaration against the prevailing methods of evangelization, and by challenging the claim to superiority put forward by them on behalf of Christianity. They strongly resent his assertion that their modus operandi   is  open to suspicion
 . . . . It was stated in the Indian Census Report for 1911 that the aboriginal tribes accept Christianity, “in the hope of obtaining assistance from the missionaries in their difficulties and protection the coercion of landlords.”  .  .
 .   In 1821,   Raja Rammohan Roy urged in the Brahmanical   Magazine   that the
 superiority of Christianity should not be advocated “by means of abuse and insult or by affording the hope of worldly gain.”
 . . . Mrs. Charles Howard, Secretary, Society for the Education of the Women of India, Chicago, in a letter to Sr. Virchand R. Gandhi of Bombay, wrote in 1896: “But I am more concerned for poor India. Why should Christianity, which is a failure here, be thrust upon India?”libtech_314_footnote
 This comes from a retired Deputy Collector. The collection of quotations from named sources should, instead of offending missio- naries, cause an inward search. I have several other similar articles, some from Christian Indians. The writers will excuse mefor with holding them. The controversy ought not to be prolonged. The incautious zeal of reporters, who trusted too much to memory, led to a discussionlibtech_315_footnote, which I would fain have avoided.

 CHI. VASUMATI,
 I got your letter. I have carefully read Nanalal’s letter. If you are required to stay at Visnagar in connection with that work, my advice is against it. The work is full of difficulties. If Nanalal wishes  to speak to me, he is welcome. In this matter I wil trust Krishnadas’s judgment. Before coming to a decision, you should also know the views of Budhabhai, Mathuradas and Narandas.  If  you  have  to choose a place outside the Ashram for work, you should choose either Nadiad or Bochasan. I am inclined in favour of Bochasan, since the work there has been put on a firm foundation. However, if you are under a moral obligation to work for that school at Nadiad,  you should certainly do your duty. If you have held out any hope, you ought to fulfil it.

  	It is quite all right that you wrote a long letter. You will surely 	have benefited from your month-long stay at Simla. You will have 	walked a lot. The suggestion that a boycott committee be formed 	seems a good one. I am hoping to get something done at the meeting. 	Most of our difficulties are due to the fact that we want to achieve 	the boycott through khadi. The mills do have a place in the boycott 	campaign. That place is secondary to khadi and is automatically 	assured through our carrying on khadi work. Giving a special place 	to the mills will make the mills lose, khadi lose and the boycott 	will fail. Have you understood this key to boycott? If you have not 	understood,  I wish you would ask me again and again and understand. 	Read carefully the article about boycott in the current issue of 	Young India.libtech_319_footnote You 	should never hesitate to write to me whenever you want to.

           DEAR 	FRIEND,    LETTER TO EMMA HARKER    AS 	  AT  SABARMATI,  June 	5, 1931 
  	I have your letter. How can I remove the ban on foreign cloth and 	why? And what is the meaning of the ban? It is merely a method  of 	persuasion. If people want to wear foreign cloth, there is nothing 	to prevent them from doing so. But if there was national government, 	the entry of foreign cloth would be surely prohibited as it was in 	the time of Elizabeth in England. It is true that the Lancashire 	workmen may have to suffer during the transition stage. But can it 	be any reason for India’s cottage industry. If in trying to undo 	the wrong, Indians cease to use foreign cloth which it is their duty 	to do Lancashire has to turn to a less injurious industry. Where is 	the harm and where is the wrong? I would like you to work out this 	problem in its details and you will find that ban on foreign cloth 	is a necessary condition of the life of the millions of villagers of 	India.  	You have evidently not studied the prohibition question in America. 	I talked to both who are for prohibition and against prohi- bition. 	Whilst it is true that prohibition has given rise to fashionable 	crime it has saved tens of thousands of the labouring population of 
 America, who, having the temptation put away from them, are now bringing up sober families. But the conditions in India are infinitely superior to those in America. In America drink was the fashion and yet its great men rose against it. We are too near the time to measure the greatness of America in having undertaken prohibition. In India drink is considered to be a vice and is confined to only a particular class of people. Prohibition will be therefore an unmixed good in this land.

  	I got your letter. You did right in having paid a visit to Rajkot.  	If you go on pleading with the elders through letters, they will 	probably listen to your advice regarding khadi.  	Some days ago, I had a letter from Mukundrai, which I am sending on 	to you. It will help you to a better understanding of the facts 	about Mahalakshmi. I did not know that she was related to 	Gaurishankar. I should be happy if you can take her  into the 	Ashram. Chhaganlal is also one of her relatives.  	If the other lady is what she seems to you, you can admit her. You 	should try to know her husband. If she had such intense aversion 	against worldly happiness, why did she marry? How old is she? What 	has been her education? To which community does she belong? What are 	her husband and father-in-law? What is her father? In principle, we 	should admit such women.  	If Ratubhai has gone to Bombay, we shall meet. I had indeed 	realized, when I went to Rangoon, that the Doctor was unhappy about 	Lilavati. But I will have a talk with Ratubhai when he meets me in 	Bombay.  	The suggestion that Madanmohan should stay with Jamnalalji seems all 	right to me. Haribhau was here and I had a talk with him too. If he 	stays with Jamnalalji, there will be no need to pay him anything.  	We should let Amtulbehn stay in the Ashram if she is ready to live 	in it till the end of her life. She may be permitted to receive 	money from outside. If no one sends her any money, we should bear 	the expenditure on her account. I think she will recover if she does 	very little physical work. You must have got the bill of exchange in 	Ba’s name which was received here.  	If an inmate of the Ashram lives elsewhere, his expenses should be 	borne by the people there. If, however, Chhaganlal desires another 	arrangement in regard to any person, do as he suggests. I have 	written to Chhaganlal also to this effect.  	I have advised Dwarkanath that he should live outside Gujarat till 	my suspicion against him regarding arms is removed. He will 
 leave in a few days. We have get to decide what to do about his bill. Chhaganlal thinks that he is innocent. I have written to him and told him that, if he feels inclined to pay the bill, he may do  so.  If, therefore, he writes to you requesting you to pay the bill, please do.
 I shall leave this place on Monday and return on the 12th, leaving Bombay on the 11th.

      LETTER TO R. M. MAXWELL    AS 	  AT  SABARMATI,  June 	6, 1931  DEAR 	MR. MAXWELL,  	Reverting to your letter of the 13th May,libtech_326_footnotelibtech_327_footnoteat 	 practically  the same time that I received your letter in Simla I 	received the news that Syt. Rajawade was discharged although the 	letter under reply left me no such hope. I was thankful to receive 	the telegraphic news which was conveyed to me by Mr. Emerson. I have 	now received the papers about Syt. H. D. Rajah and on a persual of 	the papers I can find no incitement to violence. The speeches 	themselves are not before me because I am told that they are not to 	be found in the record of the case, but the evidence of the Crown 	witnesses and the  Judge’s summing up bring out the most relevant 	parts of the speeches, which though highly discourteous and equally 	seditious, contain no incitement to violence. On the contrary, the 	judge himself refers to the profession of non-violence by the 	accused but dismisses it as lip    
 service. In the absence of any direct incitement to violence I cannot see how it is possible for a judge to infer mere lip service when there is   a direct assertion of non-violence. But I have not relied upon my own opinion. I put the thing before three legal friends, one of whom has kindly reduced his opinion to writing, copy of which I enclose herewith. In the circumstances I request His Excellency to reconsider his decision and beg to point out that under Cl. 13 of the Settlement there is no option but to discharge the civil disobedience prisoners who might not be guilty of offences involving violence other than technical violence or incitement to such violence. I venture to suggest that where there is no incitement on the fact of the evidence it is not open to the Government to deduce such incitement.
 Then there is the case of Ratanji Dayaram of Bardoli Taluka. I have now studied the judgment and evidence in this case. There is certainly no violence as contemplated in Cl. 13 of the Settlement. It is also moreover incorrect to say that the accused burnt his tenant’s crop. The accused burnt his own crop which he owned jointly with the complainant Devalia Jagla. If the complainant suffered any  damage it was open to him, as it is even now, to bring a civil suit against the accused. But where, on the evidence itself and the finding of the judge admitted by the Government, the crop was burnt in order to prevent the Government officials from collecting revenue from selling the crop, there was no question of intending to damage the partner. And may I point out the inconsistency of the Government in releasing the co-accused, Ranchhod, who had no ownership in the crop and keeping Ratanji Dayaram who was admittedly joint owner of the crop. I must, therefore, for the same reason as in the case of Syt.
 H. D. Rajah, ask for Ratanji Dayaram’s discharge in terms of the Settlement.
 With reference to your second letter of 30th May last, I can only say that the position taken up by His Excellency causes  me  deep pain. The reasoning given for  refusing  to  return  the  press seems to me to be extraordinary. It is giving back  and  not  taking back. Cl. 16 throws the burden on the Government  of  returning and not on the party dispossessed of going to take back. The reason- ing  given    in    the    third  paragraph  of   your letter  causes still
 greater pain. I was unprepared for the interpretation that is sought to be put upon the Ordinance. I cannot question the inter-pretation but I
 do question the propriety of putting an irritating interpretation in connection with a document of peace. What the Government seek to do is to justify wanton destruction of property by Government officials. But in order to bring within the smallest compass possible points of dispute between the Government and myself as representing the Congress, I have advised the owners of the motor-car and bicycle to remove them, if they chose to do so. So far as the  press  is  concerned I am sorry to say that I must ask for due fulfilment of the terms of the Settlement. If the Government seriously question my interpretation I am quite willing to submit the question for decision to the Chief Justice of the High Court of Bombay or any other impartial authority.
 Yours sincerely,
Encl. 1

 DEAR SATIS BABU,
 I have your letter and cutting from the Amrita Bazar Patrika. What can be done beyond suggesting arbitration in the place of the cumbersome procedure that will have to be adopted by the Working Committee if the matter has to be decided by it. Subhasbabu was here and gave Sardar Vallabhbhai a long list of complaints against Sen Gupta. Vallabhbhai could do nothing but said that when the matter came formally before the Working Committee, he will deal with the complaint. But when he and I began to receive wires from Bengal, I suggested local arbitration. Is there any other way besides such arbitration or decision by the Working Committee when the matter formally comes before it?
 If you are well enough, you should come to Bombay  and discuss the position at the All-India Spinners’ Association Comittee meeting. I cannot advise Dr. Roy to come to Ahmedabad especially when several mill-owners are outside Ahmedabad.
 If you have not seen the file of the Samachar of 1828 I think you ought to see it and verify the spinner’s letterlibtech_329_footnoteyourself.

Her stomach should be very 	lightly massaged with oil every day. Mothers in these parts 	vigorously exercise their children. If Nimu or you do not know it, 	you should learn it. It is very useful. Laying the child flat on the 	back, raise and bend the legs so that the toes touch the forehead. 	The knees should not bend. Do you understand what I mean? The baby 	should be held tightly by the feet upside down for a minute or a 	half. The exercise should be given while putting the child to sleep 	or in the morning, on an empty stomach.

   406. 	WORKER-VILLAGE RATIO  	How many workers would be needed to cover seven lakh villages? This 	question requires serious consideration. The British flag flies in 	each and every village, that is to say, all of them use the 	Government’s currency, and pay revenue in that currency. But the 	Congress has not been able to cover all the villages. Even its name 	has not reached every village, let alone its message. The Congress 	can reach every village through khadi, but we do not have enough 	interest in khadi for that purpose.  	The reader will be surprised to know that, though the Govern- ment’s 	authority is recognized in every village, every one of them does not 	have a Patel, a talati or a constable. All that it has been 	able  to do is to put a few villages under each talati and 	Patel. A talati should be an educated person, for he is 	supposed to keep accounts. He has, therefore, more villages under 	him than a Patel. If the Government does not have a talati and 	a Patel for every village, how can the Congress have a worker for 	every one of them. I know that the ratio of workers and villages 	should be exactly the opposite of that 
 of talatis and Patels and villages. The Congress should have the capacity which the Government does not possess. But we must admit with shame that it is not so. The Government cannot afford to spend enough money to keep a talati and a Patel in each village. The Congress does not need to spend money. It can get volunteers but its name has not reached every corner so that it can have a volunteer in each village.
 In these circumstances, it would be extravagance on the part of the Congress to have more than one worker per village. We should group the villages into blocks, each with a radius of ten miles. As our resources and the number of volunteers increase, we can increase the number of blocks but at present one volunteer should be able to cover ten miles from a central point. So the diameter of his working area would be twenty miles. But the volunteer will never have to walk twenty miles at a time. There is no rule that he must always sleep in the central village. Not only may he spend a night in any village within the limit of ten miles, but it would be actually his duty to spend a night in each of  them by turn.  There would be at least ten villages  in such a block with a radius of ten miles. So, according to me, there would be one worker for every ten villages. Hence we require seventy thousand men and women volunteers to cover all the villages in the country. I said women volunteers. But really speaking we  should  count their numbers on a different basis. If, in early stages, two of them stay together then we would require more than seventy thousand volunteers, or the volunteers would have to be posted in different manner according to the number of women volunteers included in the total. It should be obvious that to post more than one worker per village would be a crime.
Let us now think each worker can do. He can easily :
  collect 	children and teach 	them how 	to spin 	on the 	takli, 	card cotton, make 	taklis, 	and also teach 	them the three 	R’s; for this he 	can draw 	up a modest 	scheme and plan 	a curriculum;  look 	after the cleanlines 	of the 	villages and 	himself work to 	keep them clean; give 	medicine to sick persons;  if 	there are quarrels 	among different 	groups and parties 	in a 	village, bring them together;  relieve 	the hardships 	of the 	untouchables, provide 	facilities for drinking water for them if they do not have any; try 	to make the 	village self-reliant in 	regard to khadi;  prepare 	a census 	of each 	village in 	his block, 	count the 	number of 	cattle in each 	under the 	heads of cows, 	she-buffaloes, bullocks, 	he-buffaloes and male 	and female calves, 	calculate average yield 	of buffalo’s milk 	and cow’s 	milk, prepare a 	census of the 	Antyajas and 	write a 	general description of 	their conditions, 	find out 	the area of 	each village, 	its crops, 	the amount 	of land 	revenue paid 	by it, 	its crafts and 	industries, the 	number of 	wells in 	it and note whether 	any fruits 	and babul 	trees grow in the 	villages or 	in the fields within its 	limits. Though I 	have mentioned this 	activity last, the volunteers should 	take it up first. 	This work does not 	require much time. But 	the volunteer 	who has gathered 	all this 	informationn would 	find his work 	much easier. He should 	record all this 	information in 	a small 	exercise book. 
 No volunteer should say that he cannot  do  all  this  work unaided in ten villages. Just as a school works only for a few hours daily, similarly we should not mind if it works only for one day in the week. It will not matter if the school in each village works on every tenth day. I have stated a extreme possibility. I actual practice, a newly-posted volunteer will immediately collect the statistics about the villages in his block and then train men and women volunteers in every village and assign them work according to their capacity. In this way he will become a supervisor-worker. On the days on which he is not present in a particular village, the local volunteers will carry on the work.
 One quality is essential in such a worker and that is purity of character. If he is a slave of his eleven senses he will be able to do no work. These eleven senses are the five of perception, the five of action and the mind. If the mind is pure, then the ten senses automtically remain pure. If the mind is impure, then everything else will be impure. The senses of action are the arms, the legs, the mouth, and two private organs. The senses of knowledge are the skin, the sense of touch, the palate, the ear for hearing, the nose for smelling and the eyes for sight. Anyone who cannot control these should humbly refuse to become a volunteer. If he has become one and then later on finds that he is unable to control his senses, he should humbly resign. This is the right way if we want work to be done.
 Some might say that this programme cannot be completed in a hundred years and we want swaraj just now. This objection has no force. We shall not have an abundance of workers when we get swaraj. Those who are workers now will run the country under swaraj. It is
 
 true that those who run the administration at present will be there when its control is handed over to the people. If, however, the  Congress does not have the type of volunteers that I have suggested, then we shall lose control of the administration or it will become corrupt and there will be anarchy in the country. There is no reason to suppose that those who are hated now will become  godlike overnight as soon as the control of the administration changes hands. Hence, as we sow now, so shall we reap. If we get sincere workers, the programme that I have chalked out can begin today. “Let us first have seventy thousand volunteers and map out the country into blocks of ten miles each and then we shall see what work to take up.” This is not the right way to start work. If we approach the task thus, we shall succeed in doing nothing.
 The right method is this : Gujarat should start immediately. If work cannot be started in the whole of Gujarat, it should be started in one or two districts, or even talukas, and if even that is not possible, then the few workers in the different parts in Gujarat should begin as I have suggested and leave whatever is not essential or cannot be done well. They should start whatever they can do. If there are more workers than one at one place, they should disperse themselves. If they decide to stay together where they are, they should do so after considering whether that is necessary. They should not deceive themselves or the people through mental or physical lethargy.

 407. NOTES
 HINDUS’ SHAME
 In Dakor on 22nd May, 1931, there was a meeting of Bhangis of which Thakkar Bapa has sent me a report. I  give  below  its substance :
 About 1,500 Bhangis from 150 villages had gathered. They had crected a  mandaplibtech_330_footnoteof canvas with the  ground  also covered with canvas in which they could hold their meetings and sleep at night. The meetings were held in this mandap during the day and at night they slept in it. But no one would give them utensils for cooking and they could not get drinking water. The water of the Gomati pond is so dirty that there are municipal signboards at numerous spots warning people not to use it for drinking. But Bhangis can drink it! How could they drink such dirty water at a gathering like this? One Muslim gentleman took pity on them. He gave them utensils, helped them in cooking and gave them water too.
 No Hindu of Dakor, which is a centre of pilgrimage, felt ashamed at this or took pity on the Bangis. The guests had come from distant places, but could get no water, no utensils and no food though there was an abundance of everything in the town. the women volunteers of Dakor could have cooked for them.  It was the duty of the Mahajanlibtech_331_footnotein Dakor to supply water to these people. They failed in this duty and dimmed the lestre of Hinduism.
 “But this sort of thing  happens  everywhere  and  no  one  cares for Bhangis. Was it the  duty  of  Hindus  of  Dakor  spe- cially on this occasion to do all that?” Yes, it was. The fact that one’s for efathers have been committing a particular sin  gives one no right to go on committing it. As the days pass, the  awake-  ning among the Antyajas increases, this e vil in Hinduism is being recognized and more and more caste Hindus feel ashamed of the practice. The person who drafted the report is a Hindu and the person who sent it is also a Hindu. All of us want to implement the resolution on rights passed by the Congress. Whatever may have
 
 happened before now, even caste Hindus will not tolerate now the kind of inustice that was shown in Dakor. There will be no distinction between Antyajas and others under swaraj. Let us, therefore, wake up.
 THINK CAREFULLY OVER THIS
 There is a village named Bharthari in Thasara taluka. There a person named Dhanjibhai, an Antyaja, is trying hard to reform other Antyajas. From the report that I have received about his work I see that he silently bears the hardship which he has to suffer because of his activities. One of the reform which he is trying to persuade the Antyajas to adopt is to give up eating carrion and to this end to give up the work of disposal of dead cattle. To persuade them to stop eating carrion is of course good, but to persuade them to give up the occupation of disposing of dead cattle seems to me a very harmful move. I think myself the occupation is sacred, and certainly most useful. It is sacred because it helps in preserving sanitation. If dead animals were left unattended, the air whould be  polluted,diseases  would spread and the country’s wealth would be wasted. Cattle serve the people after they die as much a they do while alive. We use their skin, bones, flesh and guts for many purposes. If we use living cattle properly and use the hide, etc., of dead cattle scientifically, their value would increase so much that it would not be profitable to slaughter them.
 I would, therefore, suggest to reformers that they should not persuade Bhangis and Chamars to leave their occupation but they should, on the contrary, give them proper knowledge  about  their  work. This requires training. It is only in our country that this occupation is considered low. In the West we find even millionaires engaged in it. If instead of becoming clerks, after graduation, young men learn the Chamar’s work, learn how to skin dead cattle and how to make use of the other parts, then the present drain of crores of rupees to foreign countries because of our ignorance in this matter would stop and Chamars would no longer look upon their occupation as low. We shall be able to eradicate untouchability not when the Chamars give up their work but only when the Hindus realize their sin and when the Antyajas rid themselves of some evils which have entered their lives.

 408. POOR MAN’S HUNDI
 Vithaldashbai complains from his sick-bed that khadi stocks are accumulating. The workers of Gujarat write to inform me that because of this they are forced to give less work to spinners. This complaint regarding khadi is a matter of shame for us. Those who wear khadi know that by doing so they help women who are among the poorest in the country. If all of us understand this fact, the demand for khadi will never go down. As we always get the cash value of a currency note printed on, it, so we should always be able to get money for khadi at the price fixed by us. Khadi is a sort of hundi drawn by the poor. There should be men and women in cities who whould always accept such hundis. And so long as this hundi is available, no one should touch any other hundi.
 If I can have my way and if people co-operate, khadi will always be sold at a fixed price. The price of cotton may vary, but if the women who spin and the weavers are paid at uniform rates in their respective provinces and the rates of payment for the other proceses are also uniform, there should be no difficulty in having a fixed price for every variety of khadi. Since we do not possess the requisite honesty, efficiency of organization and sympathy for the poor, the prices of khadi hav been changing. However, anyone who takes the slightest interest in khadi knows that in every province the prices have declained from what they were ten years ago. I have already pointed out  in  these  columnslibtech_332_footnotelibtech_333_footnotethat,  of  the  khadi  produced  in  the  Meerut Ashram, where it is manufactured in large quantities, those varieties which previously cost one rupee now generally cost less than  six annas. This does not mean that the women spinners are paid less. It only means that the workers have acquired greater skill in all the processes of khadi manufacture.The quality of spinning has improved and, in consequence, the weavers’ work has become easier. This has made it possible to reduce the rate of pay-ment to weavers without reducing their total earnings. It has been possi-ble to bring about this happy result of reduction in prices because a philanthropic body is organizing khadi work. Thanks to this fact, the quality of khadi has progressively improved and the prices have come down.There is
 
 considerable scope for still further improvement in quality and reduction in prices and this will happen as more and more people patronize khadi. It is evident that, as the demand for khadi increases,  a larger number of people and more skilled people will take interest in it and the quality will improve and the prices decrease. The shareholders in the poor man’s company are not limited to a small number, but are the thirty crores in the country. Then why should there be any difficulty in selling khadi? But the difficulty is a fact and it is, therefore, fruitless to ask that question. It would be wiser to dicover ways of selling it. The following means suggest themselves :
  To 	go round hawking 	khadi. At 	all places 	women should do 	this only on 	fixed days, so 	that they will not 	have to 	go round every 	day. It 	would be 	enough if 	they give some hours 	on some 	days in 	the week. As 	in the West the wives of 	millionaires visit 	hospitals, etc., on 	certain days 	in the 	week, so 	the women 	here should 	go round 	hawking khadi.  Leaflets 	giving a list 	of the varities 	of khadi 	and their 	prices should be 	distributed to 	every household.  Talks 	about khadi should be 	arranged in 	all residential streets. 
 I have only given a few suggesions for guidance. But those who love khadi and have resourceful brains will be able to think out many other ways of selling the accumulated stocks of khadi.

   USE  ANOTHER  NAME  
 An Antyaja friend writes :libtech_334_footnote
 Such a feeling is natural in this age of awakening. A person does not like the name which is applied to him in contempt, though its origin may have been quite innocent. Formerly the name Antyaja was not felt as expressing contempt. The names Dhed and Bhangi were disliked. I think the term ‘Dalit’ was first used by the late Swami Shraddhanand. Now it seems that name also is not liked. This real explanation is that as long as the poison of untouchability exists in our society, any name that may be given will probably come to be disliked after some time. Hence the right thing to do is to get rid of that poison and for this we need the co-operation of the Antyajas men and women. It is of course the duty of the Hindus to get rid of this poison unconditionally. Atonement for one’s sin need not depend on any condition being fulfilled. But however sincere the efforts of Hindus to atone for their sin, the evils which have crept into the lives of the untouchables because of the sin of Hindus can be eradicated only by their own efforts. They will require the help of caste Hindus in their efforts. They are getting it slowly and its tempo is likely to increase. But even after taking all this into account, ultimately the Antyajas will have to rely on their own efforts. Though it is thus necessary to attack the root cause, if a better word than Antyaja or Dalit occurs to anyone he may send it to me.

   A SUPERSTITION  
 I give below the substance of what one cultured and very pious mother writes : “After my son’s death I  have left off milk and ghee.  I live on rice, dal, roti, and buttermilk. I have lost interest in life but I pass my time by devoting myself to service in one way or another. I read Ramayana and other books, but deep inside the memory of my dear son continues to pain me.”
 
 This mother’s health was already weak and now it has become weaker. It is not certain even whether she will survive or not. As I have summarized the mother’s letter, I also give the substance of my reply to her.libtech_335_footnote
 To mourn the death of either son or husband is meaningless and shows our ignorance. This should not be dismissed as merely wise talk; it is a truth to be pondered over till it sinks into our heart and to be acted upon. Since death is certain for all, the only question is whether it comes today or tomorrow. Why, then, should we grieve over anyone’s death? It is only the body which dies. That is its nature and therefore there is no cause for wonder when it dies. It is certain that the soul which dwells in the body never  dies,  it  is immortal. When we know this as certain truth, why should we grieve over death?
 Even if we assume that we are bound to be pained by death, is fasting or restriction of food  a  remedy  for  our  grief? Whom  does it help? The one who is dead? And if so, does it help the body which has perished, or the immortal soul? The body that used to eat is now ashes or is being eaten up by worms. The soul neither eats nor drinks. Why then should the mother or the wife restrict her food?
 In other words, the mother or wife restricting her food has no effect on the body or the soul of the dead person. If we desire the welfare of the departed soul or wish to keep his memory alive for ever, we shall not be able to fulfil our wish by fasting but shall fulfil both aims by retaining his virtues in ourselves. We can also contribute to perpetuating his memory by making donations to worthy causes.
 Does fasting or control over food then serve no purpose? In this case at any rate they serve none. They can be undertaken within certain limits, either for the purpose of self-purification or for curing a disease. We shall not discuss the second possibility. Control of the palate, then, aims at self-purification. Restriction of food or fasting, therefore, has this limit. Fasting is not the right way of atoning for a lie. The right way of doing so is to take a vow always to speak the truth in future, to renounce whatever serves as a temptation to us to tell a lie. If, however, a person cannot control his palate, the remedy is fasting or restriction of diet. Anyone who has overcome all cravings of the palate eats only for keeping his body alive. His diet is restricted to a few items and the quantity also is measured. Such men and
 
 women take food as medicine. If they practise further self-denial, they commit a sin because, if they do not eat, their bodies would become weak. The body is an instrument of service. Anyone who weakens that instrument is a thief. Such persons number hardly a few among crores. I have used this illustration only to  explain my meaning.
 We ordinary human beings daily indulge our palate. It is, therefore, necessary that we should occasionally fast and restrict our diet. But this should be done only to kill the cravings of the palate. To do it because of someone’s death or for some similar reason is a form of self-deception and may even be sinful.

   A LETTER  
 BARDOLI,
 June 7, 1931
 Sardar Garda met me at Swaraj Ashram, Bardoli, on April 25th in the company of Sir Cowasji Jehangir, Syt. K. F. Nariman, Sjt. Vimadalal, Rao Bahadur Bhim Bhai and another Parsi friend. He was brought by Sir Cowasji Jehagir and other friends in connection with the forfeited land belonging to Bardoli peasants which he had purchased during the Civil Disobedience Movement. He complained about the treatment he had received at the hands of the people. I told him that whatever complaints he might make I would undertake to invetigate and give him satisfaction. All the friends persuaded him to return the said land. He insisted not only on the price he had paid for the land being returned to him, namely, Rs. 6000 in addition which he said he had spent on the land. Sir Cowasji assured him that sum also would be forthcoming. He then said that he would most probably decide to restore the land for the purchase price plus the said sum of Rs. 6000, but that he would have to consult his people and the give a final reply which he would do inside of two days. In the course of the conversation Sardar Garda said that the land he had bought was fully worth four lakhs of rupees and that he would not have bought it but for the pressure that was brought to bear upon him on the part of the authorities. This, of course, he said in confidence. I asked him then whether I could announce to the people that most probably he would
 agree to restore the land, and he said “certainly”. Two days after, Sardar Vallabhbhai received a letter from Rao Bahadur Bhim Bhai saying that Sardar Garda had passed a note to him to the effect that he had decided to restore the land for the above sum. The enclosed is a copy of the letter passed by Sardar Garda to Rao Bahadur Bhim Bhai. The letter was also published in the papers and the agreement was duly announced to the people concerned. On May 7th I received a letter from Sardar Garda as per copy to which I sent a reply hereto attached. I also attach the further correspondence  since  passed between Sardar Garda and myself.

   LETTER TO K. B. BHADRAPUR  
 AS   AT  SABARMATI,
 June 7, 1931
 DEAR MR. BHADRAPUR,
 I write this letter in connection with the present Mukhilibtech_336_footnotelibtech_337_footnoteof Ras.  I discussed the question of his removal and the appointment of the old Mukhi with Mr. Perry more than once and I had hoped that by this time at least the Ras Mukhi would have been removed. The this time at least the Ras Mukhi would been removed. The matter is now becoming urgent as a deputation on behalf of the non-Dharala inhabitants of Ras waited on me yesterday and complained that life was becoming unbearable for them there. I enclose herewith particu- lars of destruction that is alleged to have gone on in Ras during the past fortnights. They mentioned also that personal assaults were added to the injury to property. It is not suggested that the Mukhi himself has personally done these things but it is suggested that they have been done with his connivance, if not instigation. It will be readily admitted that if the statements made in the memorandum hereto attached are at all true, it won’t be possible for the non-Dharala population to proceed with the cultivation of their fields as soon as rains commence. Suggestion has already been made that the Mukhiship should be divided into three parts, each part being held by a different person. I need hardly say this will not do. Either  the present Mukhi is an undesirable person or he is not. If he is an
 
 undesirable person, in accordance with the terms of the Settlement and the admission made by the Commissioner, undesirable Mukhis should be removed. And in view of the fact that there is a conviction for theft against the present Mukhi of Ras, his removal is surely overdue.  This  I ask irrespective of and without prejudice to my contention that appointments of Mukhis for definite terms are not permanent according to the meaning of the Settlement. I shall therefore  be  obliged if you will kindly let me know as early as possible whether it is the intention of the Government to remove this Mukhi and protect the life and property of the inhabitants of Ras.
 Yours sincerely,

  	I thank you for your letter. As a matter of fact I have got ample 	Christian Science literature with me. You will not mind my saying 	that somehow or other the message of Christian Science does not 	appeal to me. I met so many Christian scientists in South Africa. 	Their conversations also failed to convince me. And why do you say 	that the discovery that there is really no life or sensation in the 	body is the most important discovery of any kind that has ever been 	made? As a matter of fact the statement is not a complete 	proposition. By the body is evidently meant body without life is 	without sensation and every Hindu child is taught that from 	childhood. But I must not enter into a discussion. I felt that your 	long letter was entitled to a reasoned reply from me.

   LETTER TO ESTHER MENON  
 AS   AT  SABARMATI,
 June 7, 1931
 After having kept me waiting for many long months you have at last written to me. What a bad things that Menon has not yet got his diploma. I had a letter from a mutual friend saying that you were disheartened over this failure. This is unworthy of you as I have known you. No failure, no adversity should dishearten you who have  a living faith in God and his goodness. We do not know that every failure is a matter for sorrow nor do we know that every adversity is an infliction. Do we not often find that prosperity and success mean the undoing of people whereas failure and adversity chasten them?
 I do not know that I am going to London. If I do, I will of course love to go to Denmark and if I went there I should not like to miss you. But it is no speculating on a highly problematical thing.
I do hear from Maria, now and again.
 After dictating this I came upon another letter which mentionns you more intimately. This letter is from Dr. Henning Dalsgaard. In that letter he says you are cheerful but he asks me concrete proposition. Have you any such in view? If you have, thing, you know also you can rely upon my doing it.

   LETTER TO KANTI PAREKH  
 Silence Day, June 8, 1931
 
CHI. KANTI,
 
 Here is the reply to your letter. The word ‘love’ has two meanings : one, ignorant attachment, and, two, non-violence. Love between man and woman mostly takes the form of  ignorant attachment and, therefore, it is undesirable. It cannot become all- embracing love. If a man marries many woman or a woman many men, the world would be destroyed. Only that love which takes the form of non-violence can become all-embracing, and anybody who wishes to cultivate such love must renounce the other love, born of ignorant attachment, which a man and a woman feel for each other. The wheel of worldly life is kept moving, and will be kept moving, by a love which is a mixture of the two kinds. It helps human beings to satisfy their own needs and also to serve the race. What I have written pertains to love in its purest form. If we are clear in our minds about the ideal, it will be possible on its basis to formulate proper norms for practical life. If we base the ideal on the prevailing practice, we would lower both the ideal and the practice. If you do not follow anything  in this, ask me again. I am returning your letter herewith.
 Blessings from
 BAPU

   NOTES  
 WHO CAN BE CONGRESS OFFICE HOLDER?
A Sindhi correspondent asks :
  Whether 	a man dealing in 	foreign cigarettes and 	tobacco can 	 be  a president of 	the Congress Committee?  Whether 	persons dealing in 	foreign cloth 	can be vice-president 	and treasurer 	of the Congress Committee?  Whether 	a person 	connected with foreign-cloth dealers can 	be secretary of 	the Congress Committee? 
 These are bad questions. If the correspondent had said whether such and such a person should be, I could have given my opinion for what it might be worth. But when he asks whether a particular type of person can be officer it betrays ignorance of the democratic character of the constitution of the Congress. Even a drunkard and a rake can become president of Congress Committee or a secretary if his constituents elect him to that office. But one may assume that so long as the constituents are sober and pure, they will not elect a drunkard or a rake. Similarly if they are believers in out-and-out swadeshi only, they will not elect anyone who deals in foreign cloth or such foreign goods as are now manufactured in India. And so far as  things injurious to the nation are concerned, as for instance intoxicating drinks and drugs, Congressmen will make no distinction between foreign and swadeshi goods. All injurious things must be regarded as taboo whether they are foreign or home-made.
 COARSE MILL CLOTH AS KHADI
 Complaints are being received from several quarters, Madras, Bengal and Bombay Presidencies and elsewhere that coarse mill-cloth is being sold as khadi and that though since the understanding with the Congress, khadi labels are not used by mill-owners,  in  their invoices and otherwise, coarse cloth is shown as khadi. If the information is correct, it is clearly a breach of the agreement with the Congress. Mills ought to be satisfied with the profits they are making by reason of the Congress campaign, but if they will greedily and unlawfully appropriate the name ‘khadi’ somehow or other and at some stage or other for their wares, they will be following the example of the miser who, in the attempt to get a cocoanut free of charge, lost his life.

 433. MY FAITH
 A Bangali correspondent who gives his name and address even for publication if necessary has written a long letter which I condense as follows :
 Much has been said about Bhagat Singh and his comrades, yet even now I find great difficulty in appreciating the wisdom of passing the resolution at the Karachi Congress.
 I am afraid it will not be possible for me to explain to you properly the different peculiar and surreptitious ways in which your remarks about Bhagat Singh and the Karachi Resolution extolling him are being exploited here by some interested politicians to serve their own purpose and under-mine your influence.
  They 	accuse you 	for the niggardly way 	in which 	the resolution 	had been 	worded by you. 	These people are trying 	to impress 	upon the minds 	of the 	 young  men 	 that  you  really  had 	no sincere 	sympathy for those 	unfortunate men 	and that you 	gave your support 	to the 	resolution and 	expressed your 	admiration for 	Bhagat Singh 	and his comrades 	only being prevailed upon 	by the 	Navajuvanwallas, whose 	strong agitation you 	could not 	resist, and 	you wanted to 	placate Pandit 	Jawah- arlal.  They 	question your 	integrity and 	sincerity and 	try to belittle 	you (and 	your cause) by 	surreptitiously 	propagating an idea 	in Bengal 	that while 	you gave your active 	support to the 	resolution about Bhagat 	Singh at Karachi 	you severely 	criticized the 	late Deshbandhu 	Das for his 	responsibility in 	carrying out 	an exactly similar resolution at Faridpur Conference praising 
 
 Gopinath Sahalibtech_348_footnotelibtech_349_footnotewho lost his life on the gallows under exactly similar circumstances; and in this they say you are not immune from provincial bias. They are taking every opportunity to undermine your influence in Bengal by appealing to the sentiment of local patriotism. They say that many Bengal youths sacrificed their lives even within this very year for the same cause for which Bhagat Singh and his comrades died. Among those who thus died in Bengal there were Benoy Bose and his comrade, there were the Chittagong raiders—the twenty-one  lads, who died fighting bravely against the British troops on the Jalallabad Hills whose deeds were much more courageous and romantic than you would imagine, but how strange—you did not find romance there : not a word of sympathy passed from your lips! The insidious appeal made to their sentiment of local patriotism easily estranges them from you and your path of non-violence.
 I have already expressed my doubts as to the propriety of my having drafted and sponsored the Bhagat Singh  resolution  not because it was wrong in principle but for the misinterpretation it has lent itself to. But the reader must know that it was neither the fear of the Navajuvans nor my love for Pandit Jawaharlal that prompted me to initiate the resolution. Not that I should be ashamed of yielding to Navajuvans or placating Jawaharlal. I should be foolish if I did not yield to Navajuvans, if yielding advanced the interest of the country and involved no sacrifice of principle. And I should go a very long way to please Jawaharlal and retain his affection which I have the privilege of posses-sing in abundance. But there was no prompting required in this case. I had interested myself in the movement for the commutation of the death sentence on Bhagat Singh and his comra- des. I had put my whole being into the task. I had therefore to study the life of the principal actor in the tragedy. I had to come in contact with his devoted father and those who were attached to Bhagat Singh not for his deed but for his character. I was thus drawn to the resolution in the natural course. I am too sensitive not to be moved by circumstances demanding sympathy.
 Therefore had I found myself impelled to interest myself in any of the Bengali youths and had fancied myself in possession of
 
 influence which I could exercise in their behalf, I should have with equal zest plunged myself into their case. I regard myself as incapable of having any provincial bias. Bengal is as dear to me as the Punjab. And I owe a special debt to Bengal for the inspiration it gave me in my youth. It is true that Deshbandhu and I  differed  as  to  the emphasis in the matter of Gopinath Saha resolution.
 I do not know that my resolutionlibtech_350_footnoteon Gopinath Saha differed in substance from the Karachi Resolution. But the reader should know that whatever our differences, Deshbandhu and I always remained friends. Indeed towards the end of his all too short life, we came much nearer each other even in our ideals and methods of working towards them.
 I should therefore be sorry to discover that there was any secret propaganda against me in Bengal. I have many precious co-workers in Bengal. I want the number to grow. I know the value of the co- operation of the youth of Bengal. I need it for their sakes, for the sake of the country they love so well, but sometimes, alas, blindly. They must not by their unwarranted prejudice deny themselves the service of a true friend. If I have any influence over the youth of the country, it is a treasure I want to use for gaining the freedom of the motherland. I am therefore glad that my correspondent has given me the opportunity of stating my position. But whether I retain my hold on the youth of Bengal or any other province or I do not, I must proclaim my creed from the house-top. Freedom of India’s starving millions is attainable only through Truth and Ahimsa.

   A CORRECTION  
 My attention has been drawn to an unfortunate error that crept into my advice to the kisans of U.P.libtech_351_footnotelibtech_352_footnotein Young India 28th May last, p. 127, line 53. The line reads “as a general rule less than 8 annas or 4 annas as the case may be”. It should read “12 annas” instead of “4 annas”. I am sorry for the slip. I hope however no one was misled  by the slip. The preceding lines left no room for dubt.

   VIRUS OF UNTOUCHABILITY  
 All lovers of Hinduism will read the following with painful interest :libtech_353_footnote
 Sjt. Subanagounder deserves warm congratulations for his bravery and pertinacity. The only advice I can give him is that he should take all risks in protecting the untouchables of his village and yet bear no ill-will to the villagers. He will find in the end that the villagers will cease to worry him. They will at first mistake  his goodness for weakness and then perceive the strength lying behind his goodness. For they will soon find their mistake when they see that whilst he is gentle and forbearing towards them he is firm like a rock in his action in protecting the untouchables. As time passes, the villagers will forfeit all sympathy and Sjt. Subanagounder will gain the active sympathy and help of the public. The only condition is that he must be prepared to sacrifice everything, suffer even his fields to lie fallow if the sinful boycott by the villagers succeeds in scaring labour away from him. It is some consolation that he has four friends who stand by him. But he should be prepared to carry out his resolution, even if he loses these friends. For I am sure that he will lose only to gain. God loses these friends. For I am sure that he will lose only to gain. God sometimes does try to the uttermost those whom He wishes to bless.

   MEANING OF GRINDING POVERTY  
 The Deshseva Mandal of Sind has published a little pamphlet on the economic condition of the Bhils of Sind. It consists of two articles written by Sjt. Jairamdas Doulatram after a careful study on the spot of the condition of the Bhils living in Tharparker district of Sind. The tract is a desert. “The profession of agriculture in the desert“, writes Sjt. Jairamdas,“is nothing but a stupenduous struggle against nature.” “The average net yield of cultivation in that tract is not more than Rs. 5 per acre. It is not every year that he (the cultivator) cultivates the whole area.” “With a sandy soil, low rainfall, locust pest, and cheaply priced crops, the khatedarlibtech_354_footnotelibtech_355_footnotecan rarely keep his head above water.” “I have come across all types of Bhils, those, very few ones, who are for the time being out of debt, those who are in permanent debt and live a semi-starved life and lastly those who are living  in  hopeless  pauperism. I cannot do better than give to the reader a few hard facts about specific villages.”libtech_356_footnote
 These men should for years have revenue-free land. It is for people such as these that I pleaded for free salt and I know that at the end of our discussions, it became a matter of pleasure for Lord Irwin to make the concession regarding salt. And I hope that the workers throughout the land will bring the message of free salt to the semi- starved villagers and discover all the salt areas which though not good enough for mass production are good enough for village use. It is to these people that the charkha brings hope and happiness. Village economics is different from industrial economics. Human economics is not the same as that of exploitation of mere dead matter.

   AGRARIAN SITUATION IN ASSAM  
 Assam is in the grip of dire economic distress. From everywhere, from North Lakhimpur and Sibsagar, from  Darrang  and  Nowgong,  from  Goal-  para and Kamrup, come the tales of misery and woe of the ryots for this scarcity. Hundreds of people, generally immigrants from Mymensingh,
 . . . have been flocking to the towns of Goalpara and Dhubri for begging, with nothing to cover their loins excepting half-tattered pieces. . . .
 In Goalpara and Sibsagar, Nowgong and North Lakhimpur there has been repeated failure of crops owing to the annual visitation of floods for some years past. An earthquake also came in as another visitation in July last. . . .
 Affected by this economic depression, from everywhere comes the cry for remission of land revenue. . . .
 It seems that the Government has not yet been able to shake off the Civil Disobedience complex from their minds. They have taken their
 inability to pay land revenue to mean their unwillingness to do it and are seeking to test it till the last day of kist by all sorts of indirect pressure. . . .
 The   foregoing   reportlibtech_357_footnotehas   been   received   from   the   Assam Provincial Congress Committee. If the report is accurate, and there is no reason to doubt its accuracy, it is a clear case for remission.

   UNDER SWARAJ  
A Brahmin correspondent from Madras writeslibtech_358_footnotelibtech_359_footnote:
 During his tour Sjt. Sen Gupta said that Swaraj Government would pass legislation to crush Brahmins and also referred to resolutions of the Karachi Congress. On account of that the Brahmin minority has begun to be highly restless and it has also created a sense of fear in the inds of the orthodox Hindus. Therefore please let me know what exactly you and the Congress mean by
 The 	words of 	the resolution dealing 	with untouchability.  What 	exactly you 	and the Congress mean 	by saying 	therein that under 	the Swaraj Government the Government will observe religious neutra-lity. . . . 
I  do  not believe Sjt. Sen Gupta said that  Swaraj  Government
would “crush the Brahmins”.  The congress resolution is clear.  The
 
 correspondent is unnecessarily nervous about the future which lies as much in his hands as in Sjt. Sen Gupta’s or mine. Let it also be remembered that the Congress resolution is not yet a part of the constitution. When it is, its interpretation will not rest with me or any single individual. It will rest with the courts duly established by law.
 But I gladly give my opinion as to what is likely to be the interpretation of the Congress resolution on religious neutrality and untouchability. It is bound to be a part of any future constitution as there is no difference of opinion on it. Indeed, even the correspo- ndent seems to concede as much as the Congress wants. Religious neutrality means that the State will have no State religion nor a system of favouritism. There will be no untouchability. The ‘untouchables’ will have the same rights as any other. But a Brahmin will not be made to touch anybody. He will be free to make himself untouchable and have his own well, his own temple, his own school and whatever else he can afford, so long as he uses these things without being a nuisance to his neighbours. But he will not be able, as some do now, to punish untouchables for daring to walk on public streets or using wells. There will be under swaraj no such scandal as that of the use of public temples being denied to untouchables when it is allowed to all other Hindus. The authority of the Vedas and the other Shastras will not be denied but their interpretation will not rest with individuals but will depend upon the courts of law in so far as these religious books will be used to regulate public conduct. Conscientious scruples will be respected, but not at the expense of public morals or the rights of others. Those who will have extraordinary scruples will have themselves to suffer inconvenience and pay for the luxury. The law will not tolerate any arrogation of superiority by any person or class whether in the name of custom or religion. But all this is my dream.  I am not the Congress. Those who would have the Congress to do otherwise had better make haste to join it and make others of their opinion join it. The Congress represents, or it has a constitution wide enough to represent popular will.

   SPEECH AT DESHA SEVIKAS’ MEETING,BOMBAY  
 June 11, 1931
 Gandhiji, early this morning, addressed the Desh Sevikas for a few minutes, asking them to   carry   on  picketing  peacefully.		Only habitual wearers of   khaddar  should   have   the   privilege of  picketing.	If the audience had any stock of foreign cloth, they must consign them to the flames. If they had mill- cloth, they must give them to  the  poor and   the  needy.	The object  of  khaddar was to  help the starving peasants and workers who would  obtain  the  full  bene- fit of their labour if khadi was encouraged, while in the case of mill-cloth, they would receive only anna in the rupee. To help the humanitarian cause, they must wear khaddar.

   SPEECH  AT  BOMBAYlibtech_360_footnote  
 June 11, 1931
 I must first apologize to you for having called you at this early time. The Hindustani Seva Dal stands for the service of India. Till now whenever I heard the term ‘Servant of India’ it used to rouse great fear in my heart, because the rulers of India style themselves as ‘Servants of India’. These so-called‘Servants of India’ can never in reality be what they call themselves.They are the servants of the British Empire and it is an impossibility to serve the British Empire and at the same time serve India. I can assure you, you can do no service to India if you try to follow the workings of these so-called ‘Servants of India’. You have to develop a desire for real service which these people totally lack. If on acquiring power you begin to  cruelly enforce your authority on the people how is it possible to serve the people?
 It is because we lack this feeling of real service that a great deal of rivalry and dissatisfaction has spread among ourselves. It  has pained me very much to hear that out of a desire to attain high positions in the various Congress bodies people have been spending money, thus creating an atmosphere of unhealthy competition. The real worker is he who carries on the work with a steady mind in spite of his being in the furthermost rank. The perfection of real service does not solely depend on the magnitude of the task done but rests a
 
 great deal on the humble spirit in which it is undertaken.Those misguided people to whom I have referred desire by force, it seems, to serve their country. But it assuredly shows a most undesirable state of mind. One can never prosper or be capable of doing any good to anybody if one adopts questionable means to attain that end.
 It is decidedly wrong on my part to think that I shall be able  to serve India better if I become King of India. This was exactly the state of affairs at one time in the political life of France and people used to employ the most cruel and drastic means to  remove their opponents from the political field. But the workers of the Hindustani Seva Dal should work with Peace and Truth as their foundation.
 They must also cultivate to the greatest extent  a  sense  of humility nor must they ever relax their efforts or let the quality of the work be in the least affected by feeling that there is not proper appreciation. They should deal with their fellow beings in a spirit of fair tolerance and maintain a respectful reverence for their mothers and sisters. I know this perfect combination of humility—Truth, Love and Peace—is very rare in this world, but you must all strive to attain to it. Remember there will be no soldiers left to fight if everybody becomes a commander to give orders. I sincerely hope that you will try and live up to this ideal that I have portrayed for you at this most precious time of the day and I can confidently say that  if  you sincerely make an effort and keep the memory of this morning always in your mind you will be doing the best service both to yourself and to your motherland.

   LETTER TO JAMNADAS GANDHI  
 
 
BORSAD,
      CHI. 	JAMNADAS,  June 	12, 1931 
  	You are a strange man. After having spent days with me here, you go 	back and write from there a letter about an important matter. It 	raises several questions. Should I answer them by post, or call you 	back here? When I wanted to know why you thought of coming as far as 	Bombay, you could give no answer and hurriedly went back, and now 	you write to me a letter from there asking for Rs. 5,000. This is 	now my advice to you. Write to Kakasaheb and convince him about the 	propriety of your request. If you do this, my task will be easier. 	Have Manu and Babi reached there?  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	a copy of the Gujarati : C.W. 9324. Courtesy : Jamnadas Gandhi      INTERVIEW TO EUROPEAN DEPUTATION    June 	12, 1931  Gandhiji 	received a deputation 	of young 	Europeans, about 30 in 	number including four 	ladies. Gandhiji, at the 	request of 	the deputation, explained 	the attitude  of the 	Congress towards 	Englishmen and other 	Europeans in India.  Gandhiji 	said that the Congress 	attitude was not one of 	hostility to 	them, but 	of active 	friendship. He 	recalled to 	them how 	the Congress was 	started by an Englishman, 	Mr. Hume, 	and was presided 	over by 	even members 	of Parliament. 	He wanted 	them to study 	the object 	and history 	of the 	Congress, which never 	meant any harm to 	any community 	or interests. 	If they 	sympathized with 	the Congress it 	was their 	duty to join 	it. In 	India it 	was but natural 	that Indians should have full rights to 	rule as 	Englishmen had 	in their own 	country. It 	was not reasonable for 	Englishmen to 	ask for safeguards 	and trading 	rights of a 	special character 	on which they were 	insisting. Perpetuation 	of these 	privileges, which they 	had carved in 	their 150 	years of 	rule in 	India, would amount to 	friendship on 	unequal terms. The 	Congress was 	not merely 	not hostile 	to Englishmen, 	but welcome 	their association, assistance and 	co- operation and 	their organizing 	capacity. Co-operation of 	such a 	kind did not mean 	co-operation on unequal 	terms. The 	deputation waited 	on Gandhiji for about 15 minutes.  The 	Hindu, 12-6-1931 
   SPEECH  AT  MAROLIlibtech_361_footnote  
 June 12, 1931
 Mahatma Gandhi laid the foundation of the building of a Weaving School, started by Miss Mithubehn Petit. Addressing a big public meeting, he said that if he had been told ten years ago that Miss Mithubehn Petit, who belonged to a celebrated Parsi family of Bombay, would roam day and night in the villages barefooted and dressed in coarse khaddar, regardless of the heat and cold, to work among the poor people and teach their children spinning, weaving and other industries, he (Mr. Gandhi) would not have believed it. Althought he had appreciated the work of Parsis, even when the campaign of prohibition was launched, he had  thought  that  prohibition alone would not succeed without propagation of khaddar. The closing of liquor shops was not the principal thing. If drunkards did not give up the habit of drink, they would prepare illicit liquor and there would be illicit sale of liquor as at present. Drunkards would not give up drink till they were taught some industry. Workers working in big factories required something to be relieved of the fatigue. The speaker, who had never tasted liquor, had affectionately given liquor to the exhausted in South Africa. The Kolis, who were with him, demanded liquor, and the speaker brought liquor from a canteen-keeper and gave it to them. Men who were made to work like beasts would require liquor, but those working in a peaceful atmosphere in their homes could easily give up drink.
 If rural industries like spinning, weaving, dairying, shoe-making, etc., were revived, rural areas would become richer. They did not want to be rich like the millionaires of the Bombay Stock Exchange but they should get rid of their debts.
 There would be a few silver coins in their cash boxes. Instead of borrowing money from  sowcars,  they should deposit their savings with  sowcars.  They would  have
 then houses of their own, and the number of their cattle would increase. Such a process was going on in the area, and it should go on in the seven lakhs of villages in India. This was the work of swaraj. Last year, they had done the work of cleansing the field. Now they had to do the work of sowing. That was constructive work. The sowing work was of greater importance and had to be done for a longer time.

    DEAR 	MR. EMERSON,  	You must have seen from the papers that Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan has 	been with me for some time. During the few moments that I could 	spare for him from day to day, I carried on my conversations with 	him and he has left on me the impression that he is a truthful and 	out and out believer in non-violence. He has no connection with the 	Amanullah movement. His work is solely concentrated upon the Khudai 	Khidmatgar movement. This movement consists in enlisting men for 	service. The following pledge is administered to them: “I shall be 	truthful, I shall be chaste, I shall be non-violent and not quarrel 	with my neighbours. I shall not covet my neighbours’ pro- perty. I 	shall be prepared to suffer even unto death for the freedom of the 	country.” Those who take the pledge and enlist themselves as 	Khudai Khidmatgars are expected to attend a weekly roll call in 	their respective villages. He is most emphatic in his declar-ation 	that there has been on the part of himself and his followers no 	breach of the Settlement and he says that he has everywhere preached 	to the people the necessity for carrying out its terms in so far as 	they are applicable 
 to the people. But he says there are several breaches of the Settlement on the part of the officials and he relates the following :
    Many 			civil disobedience 			prisoners are not yet 			discharged in 			the Frontier 			Province including the 			Agency areas.  He 			says that the people 			are being 			molested on the 			slightest pretext. 			The soldiers 			as they 			pass the villagers’ 			houses cry 			“Islam Murdabad”, 			“Gandhi Murdabad”, “Ghaffar Khan 			Murdabad”, and 			he adds 			that he has 			prohibited among 			his followers 			all objectionable 			cries.   
 Khan Saheb admits that  he  did not visit  the  Commissioner and he says he refrained because he saw no change in the attitude of local officials and if he went, he was afraid of his being mis- represented. He is quite prepared to see you or His Excellency the Viceroy provided I accompany  him. I  do  feel  that  you  should make his acquaintance, and if you  think  it  worth  while  I  shall  gladly visit Simla solely  for  the  purpose  of introducing  him  to  you. I think that the Settlement presumes mutual trust and it will therefore perhaps be wise on the part of the Government to know Khan Saheb personally and then test his assurances. Pending reply to this letter I have detained Khan Saheb. As he has been long enough with me and as I do not want to detain him longer than is absolutely necessary, I would ask you please to send me a telegraphic reply. I should add that Khan Saheb is most insistent on my visiting  the Frontier Province and seeing things for myself, making the acquaintance of the numerous Khudai Khidmatgars and studying his activity.

           DEAR 	MR. DAVID,    LETTER TO M. I. DAVID    AS 	 AT SABARMATI,  June 	14, 1931 
 I 	have now thought out a formula and here it is :  	To provide a common platform for those  Europeans  and Indians who 	stand for the speedy creation of a system of Government which will 	enable India to take her rightful place among the free nations of 	the world.  	The phrase “among the free nations of the world” takes the place 	of “as a fellow member of the British Commonwealth of free 	nations” in the original. You will see that this formula does not 	exclude British connection in the shape of equal partnership at 	will. Nor does it necessarily include it. I do not say much of the 	other two formulae.

DEAR MR. DAVID,
 
 I dictated a letter last night. Mahadev had handed me another letter from you of 11th instant in which you ask me whether I approve of the suggestion contained in the letter in connection with the proposed non-official conciliation committee to be formed under the auspices of the Mayor of Bombay. I would like to make one suggestion. It would be bet-ter not to have a rigid rule fixing a proportion between the numbers of Indians and Europeans.libtech_372_footnotelibtech_373_footnoteIt would be better to adopt the natural method. It may be you will have more earnest Europeans than Indians to work on the Committee. In that event I should not hesitate to take more and vice versa.

  	I have your letter enclosing some Children’s League cards and 	medals. I am not in touch with the Salvation Army nor do I know 	anything of the Army’s work amongst children. My work lies in a 	wholly different direction. You were therefore evidently misinformed 	if you thought that I was working in connection with the Salvation 	Army.

  	I have your letter. Some time when I am in Bombay you should try to 	see me. It is difficult to advise you in the matter of food just 	now. It is necessary to see you and cross-question you. Will you not 	see some naturopath in Bombay? Mr. Khambhatta of Hornby Road knows 	one and he has benefited by his treatment. His full address is 	Bairam Khambhatta, 275 Hornby Road, Fort Bombay.  	It is difficult to say how many hours’ sleep a particular 	individual requires, but I can safely say for you that you should 	take as much sleep as you comfortably can. And you should take daily 	walks in the morning and in the evening. Once only is not enough. If 	you have the strength, you should take really three or four hours’ 	walk. You may divide it, if you like, in two or three periods.  	You ask me what should be one’s ideal in life. All the sages in 	the world have said—self-realization.  	The rumour about the burning of my foot was quite wrong. It would 	have been more correct if the report had said I had very narrowlylibtech_375_footnotelibtech_376_footnoteescaped 	burning my foot.

   LETTER TO H. W. EMERSON  
 BORSAD,
 June 14, 1931
 
 DEAR MR. EMERSON,
 Your letter enclosing an unsigned opinion of the Legislative Department on the meaning of the word “return” in the Settlement came upon me as a bomb shell.libtech_377_footnoteI was wholly unprepared for such an opinion. I had flattered myself with the belief that my knowledge of law had not become absolutely rusty. But the opinion of your legal department shook what little confidence I had yet in my legal knowledge. I therefore hastened to refer the matter to the best counsel available in Bombay at the present moment. I am sending you a copy of their opinion.libtech_378_footnotelibtech_379_footnoteThe first two signatories are ex-Advocates-General of Bombay and they are both today, as is also the third, distinguished practising lawyers. For the moment therefore my confidence is restored, but that can be of no avail to you. I can quite understand your not accepting the opinion of Bombay lawyers however eminent they may be, in the teeth of opinion from your legal department however contrary to common sense. I, therefore, suggest what I have suggested of the Government of Bombay. As the matter involved is one of principle for the Management of the Navajivan Press, I would repeat the suggestion I have made to the Government of Bombay that the Chief Justice of Bombay should be appointed sole arbitrator in the matter. The Managing Board is naturally anxious to end this controversy and also to avoid a continuing loss that the deprivation of the press causes to them. I hope therefore that the matter will be finished one way or the other without delay.
 This  impasse  brings  to  me  a  matter  of general   importance. I am having, as I imagine, more trouble than I have told you from the Bombay Government in connection with the matters arising out of the Settlement. And there is trouble growing in the Madras Presidency over liquor picketing. Here is an extract from Syt. Rajagopalachari whose instructions on this very point you had seen and which you so admired that you asked me to congratulate him :
 I had hitherto refrained from worrying you. The Government here are beginning to feel that peaceful picketing is not so harmless as they had imagined. They have discovered that it does stop drinking most effectively and as a result the revenue is threatened. They may hold renters to their contracts this year, but what about the next auction? They see that without any physical obstruction or coercion of any kind, picketing does keep people away from the shops.
 The renters too espected that like last year the congress activities would soon be interfered with by the police and so they did not themselves do anything at first to interfere with the volunteers. But now they realize that the Truce has put an end to the old order to things. They are consequently in a fright. They have begun to make strong representations to Government demanding either police interference or writing off of dues. Both Government officials and renters are thus opening their eyes to the reality of the moral power of picketing and the implications of the Truce. Both Government officials and renters have, therefore, it seems, resolved on new tactics. There  is almost by concerted action a number of cases cropping up everywhere of rowdyism to intimidate volunteers. Besides rowdyism, which might be expected, the renters whether instigated or encouraged by officials or not, I cannot yet say, are bringing up false charges through private complaints in order to get fines and imprisonments imposed on the  workers  and sympathizers and worry and tire out the Congress organizations. And magistrates, too, imagine that they should support the liquor-shop men. Further, even where they know the cases are false, they dare not expose themselves to the suspicion that they favour the Congress and do not support the revenue.
 Local police authorities have begun to harass and interfere with the picketing. Finding that there is no sort of coercion or disturbance of the peace, and that they cannot legitimately object to the picketing, they are trying other ways. They are making demonstrations of police force, pushing the volunteers away to impossible distances from the shops and from each other and demanding the observance of conditions that reduce picketing to an ineffectual farce. Local police authorities are permitted to terrorize town and village folk and proclaim that any assistance or harbouring of Congress volunteers would amount to abetment of offenders. In fact, the  1930 atmosphere is being sought to be brought about.
 I have conscientiously tried to put the best construction on all that Government officials are doing. But I am afraid I must confess failure. If you have time, please go through the enclosures.
 You might be unable to interfere with the working or not working of the Settlement by local governments. Or your interfer- ence may not go far enough according to my view of the Settlement. Time has therefore perhaps arrived for the appointment of a perm- anent Board of Arbitration to decide question of interpretation of the Settlement and as to the full carrying out of the terms by the one party or the other. I would therefore like you to consider this suggestion.
 Yours sincerely,
Encl. 1

   INTERVIEW TO THE PRESS  
 BORSAD,
 June 14, 1931
 Interviewed by a representative of the Associated Press, Mahatma Gandhi said he aarrived at Borsad principally to console the people of Ras who were perturbed over the continuous destruction of their hedges and stray assaults committed by Dharalas. They suspected that Dharalas had been emboldened by the continuance as the village headman of a Dharala who is an exconvict. Gandhiji had already asked for the cancellation of his appointment on two grounds in terms of the Delhi Settlement : one was that he was undesirable and the other was that his appointment was not permanent in the terms of the Delhi Settlement. He had also asked for protection of the non-Dharala population of Ras village. Both matters were engaging the attention of the Collector of Kaira District. There were other matters, too, which required his personal attention. He thought he need not go into these matters at present. Asked how long he would stay at Borsad, Gandhiji said as soon as he had finished his work he had instructions from Sardar Vallabhbhai to go to Bardoli which he would do.
 In reply to a question whether it was true, as stated by his son Mr. Devdas at last night’s public meeting, that he intended shortly to visit the Frontier Province, Gandhiji said it was perfectly true that Abdul Ghaffar Khan was pressing him to visit that province. He was equally anxious to go there and see for himself how far the spirit of non-violence had prevailed among tribes inhabiting that province, but whilst the Truce lasted he did not want to do anything, as far as possible, that might embarrass Government. He was therefore in correspondence with Government on the matter. Asked how long Abdul Ghaffar Khan would stay with him, Gandhiji said he would stay pending the results of the correspondence between him and Government.

In 	spite of what the D.C. says, I hold that my messagelibtech_381_footnotelibtech_382_footnoteto 	 the kisans 	is no breach of the Settlement.  	It was never the intention that each kisan’s money should 	be separately deposited. If such was the suggestion, I have 	forgotten all about it.

    INTERVIEW TO ASSOCIATED PRESS      BORSAD, 
  June 	15, 1931  Interviewed 	by a representative of 	the Associated Press regarding the 	controversy in respect of his services in the Boer War, Mahatma Gandhi said :  	The Indian Ambulance Corps numbering over 1,100 reached Chieveley 	camp near Colenso after dusk just after the battle in which 	Lieutenant Roberts was killed. I received orders from Col. Gallwey 	that the deceased Lieutenant’s body had to be immediately removed. 	We had then hardly pitched the tents.  	I sent seven men, not “coolies”, but educated men, who returned 	late at night and I received special thanks from Col. Gallwey for 	the prompt attention and was next day invited through Dr. Booth to 	meet him in his tent.  	It is quite true that on this occasion there was no question of 	firing line, hostilities having been suspended for the collection of 	the wounded. It is also true that despite our desire to work under 	fire, we were told that we would not be allowed to do so but after 	the reversea at Spion Kop, the situation became grave.    
 General Buller came to my tent and said we would enter the firing zone in order to remove nearly 60 wounded from the foot of Spion Kop. My companions and I were delighted to have this privi- lege and led by Major Bapty, we crossed the pontoon, entered firing zone and removed the wounded including General Woodgate, Major Scott Moncrief and other officers and carried them on stretchers 25 miles.
 We were again within the firing zone at Vaal Kantz soon after Kop. For these and general services I was mentioned in General Buller’s dispatch and with over 20 leaders was recipient of a War Medal.

There may be some 	modification as to the board, but the principle, I think,  they  	will  accept. Do you suggest anything more to be done in this 	direction? Till the final answer is received, you should not embark 	upon any heroic measure. But I agree with you that if we do not get 	anything whatsoever, we have a perfect right to take such measures 	as we like including local and specific civil disobedience in so far 	as it may be necessary to resist lawlessness on the part of 	unscrupulous officials.  	I want you  to study carefully the articlelibtech_388_footnoteI have written for the forthcoming issue of Young 	India on the Working Committee resolution. I do not like it.

 article and tell me what you think of my alternative, because that alternative has to be enforced in the event of failure of our demand at the Conference.
 Why do you not see the Governor yourself and at any rate discuss the liquor picketing?

    LETTER TO ANAND T. HINGORANI      BORSAD, 
     MY 	DEAR ANAND,  June 	17, 1931 
  	I hear all about you regularly through  Mirabehn and occasionally 	through Jairamdas. I know that you are refraining from writing to me 	purely out of pity for me.  	I should not consider father’s letter disappointing. I think that 	he took up the correct position. But Jairamdas tells me that later 	he modified his view. I think that it is a sound rule for people who 	are well-to-do not to go to their friends living in public 	institutions except when they are ready to make a grant to those 	institutions at least equal to what their visit to such institutions 	might have cost them. It need not be done offensively and can be 	done gracefully. If father had simply come or sent your mother or 	your sister and asked them quietly to slip into your pocket a 	hundred-rupee note, it would have been still more correct. You 	must not be or feel feeble either in body or in mind.  	Nothing has to be done beyond your resolute to feel weak. There was 	no foot-burn to the healed. The whole thing was a creation of the 	reporters’ imagination.  	It is good for Vidyalibtech_391_footnotelibtech_392_footnoteto continue the diet of milk and fruit and even fruit 	alone if milk disagrees, till she has a real hunger and  appetite 	for other food. But if she can go to Bombay for treatment under a 	nature-cure expert, it would, of course, be better.    
 You must not consider yourself ill-starred. Think of the many millions who have not the opportunities that God has provided for you. It is the height of ingratitude to the Maker for anyone to consider himself ill-starred. You must shake yourself free of this pessimism that overtakes you so often.

With reference to the National Flag Film I would like you to go into 	the regulations governing the censorship of films and enter first 	into correspondence with the Board of Censors and find their reason.

   SUBSTANCE NOT SHADOW  
 The public are entitled to know why after having made repeated declarations to the contrary the Working Committee had passed the resolutionlibtech_394_footnoterequiring me (other conditions being favourable) to attend the Round Table Conference, if thereto required, for the presentation of the Congress position.
 Ordinarily a member of the Working Committee could not tell the public of discussions behind its resolutions, their defeated amend- ments or counter resolutions. But in the present case the Working Committee has made an exception and authorized me to take the public into confidence in order that I might clear my position and also explain that of the Working Committee.
 It was my essentially democratic nature which, in spite of my very strong objection, impelled me to submit to the resolution. One may not make a principle of every objection and, if not carried, block the way by threatening to retire from an institution or by refusing submission to the opinion of the majority. I therefore fought the Working Committee, reminded it of my repeated public and private declarations and moved informally a resolution myself which I  thought was far more consistent and desirable in the national interest. But I could not carry with me the majority who thought that not to attend the Conference by reason of the failure of a communal settlement would be to play into the hands of the enemy and expose the Committee to unnecessary misrepresentation.
 Though  there is  much  to   be   said   for   the   majority   view, I regard mine to be safer and more truly in consonance with the Lahore resolution on the communal question.libtech_395_footnotelibtech_396_footnoteThere was, in my opinion,  sound  reasoning  behind  my declaration  that   I   should not attend the Round Table Conference if there was no agreed settlement of the communal question. Absence of it would mean
 
 absence of unity and absence of unity would deprive the national demand of the strength required to secure its acceptance.
 My proposition therefore before the Working Committee was that agreed settlement failing, the Congress should give up the hope of winning a swaraj constitution by the way of the present Round Table Conference and should wait till all the communities were satisfied to adopt a purely national solution. The Congress could meanwhile further consolidate its position and work with greater concentration for the masses including all the communities and thus make the toilers of all the other communities regard the Congress as theirs as the Hindus do.
This does not mean giving up the struggle for freedom.
 It all depends upon what we mean by and want through purna swaraj. If we mean an awakening among the masses, a knowledge among them of their true interest and ability to serve that interest against the whole world and if through purna swaraj we want harmony, freedom from aggression from within or without and a progressive improvement in the economic condition of the masses, we can gain our end without political power and by directly acting upon the powers that be. One form of direct action is adult suffrage. The second and more potent form is satyagraha. It can easily be shown that whatever is needful and can be gained by political power can perhaps be more quickly and more certainly gained by satyagraha. If such is the case and if, in spite of all, [the] attempt to secure an honourable settlement of the communal question fails it is obvious that we should give up the attempt to secure a swaraj constitution at the present moment. It is better and quicker to wait till the Congress has become equally popular with the other communities than to attempt to force swaraj through highly artificial surroundings. If the Congress means what it says, it cannot be long gaining the adherence of all the other communities. Meanwhile the Congress must fulfil its mission of representing the starving millions by fighting for their relief, if it cannot do so by gaining power then by gaining that relief through the government existing at the moment. Whilst discussing this probability with English friends, I was reminded that this position was hardly fair, not to take the power to make the reforms and to force the hands of those who cannot carry on the administration if they grant the reforms, in their opinion only so called. I pointed out the fallacy underlying the rebuke. The Congress is ever ready to take the power
 
 if it is given to it but the Congress is too weak to seize power from unwilling hands in the artificial surroundings of the Round Table Conference and that in the absence of real unity between the chief actors, the communities.
 The Congress wants the substance not the shadow. It can there- fore wait for the shadow of power, it cannot wait for the substance of freedom which the dumb millions so badly need and can understand.
 I have placed before the public the main part of the argument I placed before the Working Committee. It failed to convince its majority. It may fail therefore to convince too the majority of the public. Nevertheless my position will probably be the same as now if and when the Conference fails to meet the Congress position.
 But having accepted the resolution of the Working Com-mittee, I shall faithfully carry it out and work at the Conference with all possible zeal, if I am destined to attend it. I should not reject real power if it is real. I should put my whole soul into working for it. But  I have wisdom and patience enough to wait for it if necessary and know that such waiting may be a process of hastening.

   NATIONAL UNIVERSITIES  
The head master of Tilak Vidyalaya thus rebukes me:libtech_397_footnote
 I gladly publish the letter if only to advertise the very good work of the national school of Nagpur. As for the Tilak University, I am not sure that I omitted to mention it on the occasion referred to. My speech was not previously prepared. It had to be delivered extempore. Whatever names I took were merely illustrative and not exhaustive. I can certainly recall many national institutions which rendered great service during the struggle. My object was to show the very marked contrast between the Government institutions and the national ones and to show that every anna spent in the latter was an anna spent for swaraj. I showed too that in the nature of things it
 
 could not be otherwise. However badly managed the Congress may be, it is still that and that alone which can usher in swaraj and not a Government department. It is once more a question of swadeshi v. videshilibtech_398_footnote.   The   English   paraphrase   is:  ‘a   good   Government   is  no substitute for self-Government’.

   COLOUR BAR IN EDINBURGH  
The Honorary Secretary, Edinburgh Indian Association, writes:
 It will be recalled that in 1927 all the cafes, restaurants and dance halls, imposed the colour ban, but after representations being made to various authorities a compromise was reached and soon after the ban was raised, again this year two cafes in Edinburgh have renewed the colour ban. These two cafes (Strand Cafe and Cafeteria) refuse to admit coloured students as a whole without any reasons. Edinburgh Indian Association approached the Lord Provost of Edinburgh and the Students’ Representative Council of Edinburgh University, but so far no action has been taken by them and the colour ban still continues.
 The Hon. Secretary does not say why the two Cafes have  restored the ban or why it was originally introduced. Denial of the use of refreshment rooms in the West is an inconvenience of which we in India can have no adequate conception. Intense public agitation is the only way to deal with this prejudice. The Edinburgh Indian Associa- tion will do well to supply the public with full facts.

   HINDI IN THE SOUTH  
 It was a good sign that at the same time as the Tamil Nadu Conference a Hindi Prachar Conference too was held. The people of the Southern Presidency are under promise to send for the next year Congress delegates who would speak and understand Hindi. If we were not living in artificial conditions, the people living in the South will not consider the learning of Hindi as a strain on them, much less a superfluity. It is surely more necessary for them to learn Hindi than for the Hindi-speaking population to learn the Southern languages. There are two speaking and understanding Hindi against one speaking the Southern languages in all India. There must be for all India a common language of inter-provincial contact in addition to, not in the place of, the provincial language or languages. It can only be Hindi-Hindustani. Some who altogether dismiss the masses from their minds would regard English not merely as an alternative but the only possible medium. This proposition would be unthinkable but for the hypnotic influence of foreign domination. For the  masses  of the South who must take an ever-growing part in national affairs, what can be easier—learning Hindi which has many words in common with their languages and which at once gives them access practically to the whole of the North or learn English a wholly foreign tongue spoken only by a select few? The choice really depends upon one’s concep- tion of swaraj. If it is to be of and for only the English-knowing Indians, English is undoubtedly the common medium. If it is to be for and of the starving millions, of the illiterate millions, of the illiterate women, of the suppressed untouchables, Hindi is the only possible common language. Those who think like me will therefore welcome the report of the great progress made by Hindi during the past twelve years of the existence of organized propaganda. Here is the record of work during the period:
 Number of those who have taken to the study of Hindi	4,00,000
 
           ,,   ,,    ,,   acquired 					a working knowledge                     of 					it   2,50,000     ,,   ,,    ,,   appeared 					for our examinations   11,000     ,,   ,,    ,,   passed 					the examinations   10,000     
 ,,	readers published by the Sabha in its own press	3,00,000
 .,	,,	sold	2,50,000
 Varieties of books published	35
 (All of them have gone through numerous edi- tions, one through 12.)
 Number of centres at which Hindi has been taught so far	400
 ,,	,,	working now (total	150
 ,,	,,	,,	under direct control	25
 ,,	,,	where examinations were held in Feb. ‘31	113
 ,,	teachers trained so far	250
 Total funds raised and spent so far	Rs.	2,50,000
 
            ,,   ,,    ,,   from 					North India   Rs.   1,55,000     ,,   ,,    ,,   from 					South India   Rs.   95,000     
 Let us hope that during this year  of  grace  the  progress  will be still more rapid and that the finance will be found wholly by the South. It will be a test of the desire of the South to learn the national language and to make India one indivisible whole.

   NOTES  
 SWARAJ FOR CEYLON
A Ceylon correspondent asks the following strange questionslibtech_399_footnotelibtech_400_footnote:
 I do not know that Ceylon is a bankrupt island or that it is necessarily bankrupt because it does not manufacture all its own cloth or grow all the grains it eats. But assuming that Ceylon is as the correspondent describes, it haslibtech_401_footnoteall the greater reason for being free. Possibly Ceylon’s economic condition is bad, if it is bad, because of its dependence. I cannot conceive of a single occasion when slavery or dependence can be preferable to swaraj or freedom.
 So far as India’s help is concerned, when India is free, whether she will or no, her freedom will automatically spur Ceylon to
 
 deliverance, if it does not actually bring it. India’s freedom must  mean more freedom to her neighbours and even other countries in the East as her slavery or dependence means a hindrance to their growth. Disease among neighbours can never be an advantage. And a diseased continent like India must be a perpetual menace to her neighbours. Dependence is perhaps the greatest disease. Mere physical illness is any day preferable to the illness of the soul. The latter brings in its train all kinds of physical afflictions and worse.

   JAPANESE OR BRITISH?  
 That from the economic standpoint (and that is the only standpoint important for the millions) boycott of Japanese cloth is much the most important is clear from the following letterlibtech_402_footnotefrom Sjt.
H. P. Modi, President, Bombay Mill-owners’ Association.
 If therefore there is any laxity on the part of boycott workers, they will remember that emphasis on boycott of British cloth would be of no avail whatsoever from the economic viewpoint. Incidentally one can see how British cloth has been hit by Japanese cloth.

You say, “I know that 	you are too pure for sex-consciousness yourself.” I wish this was 	a true certificate. I am sorry to have to disillusion you. I am 	trying to lose that consciousness. But I have not lost it. Loss of 	that

ANDREWS    Private	AS AT  SABARMATI, 
    MY 	DEAR CHARLIE,  June 	19, 1931 
  	I have your two letters, both of them quite like you. Here is my 	answer to the moral questions you have placed. It is perfectly true 	that I would have prohibition of foreign cloth by one blow if I 	could manage it and would not feel that there was the slightest 	trace of violence in it. At this conclusion I arrived in 1889 and 	‘90 when I was studying in London and keenly following the 	controversy between    
 total prohibitionists and temperance reformers. The former were led by Sir Wilfred Lawson who contended that all public houses could be closed without any compensation being paid to the keepers. The temperance party which was really the party financed by the public- house keepers put up a strong and successful fight for compensation and graduation. If a man is making a living out of wrongdoing he gains no prescriptive right and therefore is entitled to no compen- sation or consideration when his business is stopped whether by the ‘State or by his customers refusing to deal with him. It is irrelevant to consider what would happen to the many labourers who might be engaged unconsciously in helping the wrongdoer. The assumption at the back of this argument is that wrong must be righted at any cost and that the harm that may temporarily seem to result to  the  wrongdoer and his dependents is only apparent and that in the end he and they are all the better for it. If such was not the case, many a reform would become impossible. Of course it is open to you to say that you will not put foreign-cloth trade on a level with liquor or opium trade. But this is a matter of opinion.
 If I was bolstering up the Bombay mills in any shape or form it would undoubtedly be violence. But my conscience is quite clear on that point. I am not only not bolstering up the Indian mills but I am fighting them in many matters. My intervention has resulted in steady improvement of the conditions of labour. If these mills interfered with khaddar I should desire their boycott just as strongly as  that  of foreign mills.
 The remedy for unemployment in England is not thoughtless generosity of India but a complete realization by England of the awfulness of exploitation of people, violently brought under subjec- tion by her, and consequent radical changes in her conception of the standard of life and a return to simplicity. Has generosity, in respect of a man more fortunate than himself, any meaning for the man who is living in a state of chronic starvation?
 The South African analogy you have quoted is improper. What you regard as generous action was really necessary action in terms of non-violence. In order to show that my fight was not intended to embarrass the Government or to seize power I was bound in pursuance of non-violence to suspend the strugglelibtech_412_footnotein order to show
 
 that I had no sympathy with the Europeans who were bent on embarrassing the Government to the point of making it so powerless as to enable them to seize the reins themselves. Occasions here for what you would call generosity occurred at the time of the Delhi Settlementlibtech_413_footnotelibtech_414_footnoteand are occurring whilst the Settlement is being worked and it would delight your heart if you knew how every such occasion has been fully availed of. And even with reference to the present unemployment in England, many a generous gesture is possible but none is possible if it means continuance of injury to India or fresh injury. If England ceased to think imperially, if India came to her own and instead of being a dependency of England became a real partner or ally, England could get preferential treatment in  hundreds  of things, which an awakened India on her road to prosperity would require from the West. If therefore Lancashire cannot keep all its labour going through spinning and weaving mills working for other markets, it should find out some other use for it. Lastly, remember that even if there was no boycott of foreign cloth and  open competition Japan would outdistance Lancashire as it is already doing.
 I have your cable. Of course if I came to London my movement will be in your hands and I would gladly go to Lancashire as early as you would want me to.
 I quite agree with you that your name should remain in the background as much as possible.

    LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI        BORSAD, 
    CHI. 	NARANDAS,  June 	19, 1931 
 I 	got your letters. I understand what you say about Dwarkanath. I 	am in correspondence with him.  	We should not pay the premiums on Sorabji’s policy. I see little 	possibility of our getting back the original sum. I can think of no 	remedy against this.  	Has Jamna completely recovered now? Was it that she took too large a 	dose of the medicine through mistake, or was it the fault of the 	vaid?  	Panditji wanted to talk to me about the students. He believes that 	the arrangement by which Premabehn teaches Gujarati is not right. It 	is not sufficient either. He, therefore, requested that Shivabhai 	should be employed. You acceded to the request but put him in the 	office. He had also much to say against Premabehn’s temper. The 	reading-room remains closed while she is in it, so much so that it 	is not opened even for Maganbhai. After hearing all this, I merely 	said that, if I inter-vened in the Ashram affairs just now, it would 	amount to my living in it, but that, when necessary, I might give 	some guidance. I, therefore, advised him to discuss the whole matter 	with you and solve the problem. I think you should have a frank talk 	with him. He is a straight forward man. If he has not talked to you 	about all this, you should use this letter and discuss the matter 	with him and reassure him. You may consult me if necessary.  	Champa must have arrived there today. I have advised her to stay in 	the Ashram. If she does not do that, let her stay in the red 	bungalow or anywhere else. Some special arrangement will have to be 	made about Shashi’s education. It would be best if you could 	secure the services of a good lady teacher. Consult Kakasaheb. 	Savitabehn, too, may be able to guide you. Balvant, Champa’s 	brother, wants to be permitted to live in the Ashram. I have told 	him that he may do so if he agrees to obey the rules. He is also 	eager to stay with Krishnan Nair. I have written to him.  Blessings 	from  BAPU

  	I had your letter. Take Indu under your loving care. That boy is 	pining away without his mother. The thing is that you should, like a 	mother, keep a watchful eye on all boys and girls. To any woman who 	wishes to serve as a mother, they are her children. Many women may 	act as mothers to the same children. If, therefore, any other woman 	feels such love in her heart, we should be happy about it. It is but 	right that she should feel such love. At any rate you should try to 	awaken it in other women.  	Whenever you feel upset and worried, let me know. Never lose heart. 	Try and get to know personally the men and women who have recently 	joined. Remember that you are also a member of the Managing 	Committee.  	You have taken a rather difficult vow in regard to your food. Since 	you take milk, no harm will follow.

  	I have your letter of 16th June enclosing extract from  an  account 	received from the Madras Government regarding picketing. It does 	make bad reading if the report is true. But what I am receiving 	almost daily from Madras from workers who are thoroughly reliable 	eye-witnesses makes me distrust the reports that you are receiving. 	But I know that this takes us no further. So far as the Congress  is 	 concerned I want it to implement the Settlement to the fullest 	extent. I therefore make an offer. Will you advise local governments 	to appoint a Board of Enquiry consisting of a nominee on their 	behalf and a nominee on behalf of the Congress to conduct a summary 	enquiry into the allegations on either side, and wherever it is 	found that the rule of peaceful picketing has been at all violated 	picketing would be entirely suspended, the Government undertaking on 	its part to stop prosecutions wherever it is found that they have 	been undertaken in spite of peaceful picketing. And if my suggestion 	does not commend itself to you, you will perhaps suggest something 	better and more acceptable. Meanwhile I am enquiring into the 	specific charge mentioned in your letter.libtech_420_footnote  Yours sincerely,  M. K. GANDHI  From 	a photostat: C.W. 9369.

What do you mean by the latter phrase? It 	will be fine if the Bose and Sen Gupta affair is settled.

   MY NOTES  
 NUDITY AND  SOCIETY
 An article on this subject has appeared in Jain Mitra. Its author, Jain-Nyaya Tirtha Paramesthidas, has asked me to reply to the article;  I wished to express my view in this issue, but in spite of best effort I could not find the necessary time. I hope to reply to it at the earliest opportunity.libtech_426_footnotelibtech_427_footnotelibtech_428_footnoteAs the problem is not of immediate importance, I have had naturally to give priority to other more urgent matters.
 STUDENTSlibtech_429_footnote
A student writes:libtech_430_footnote
 I hear that such undertakings are demanded in other provinces also. I will not discuss here the question whether this involves a violation of the Settlement but this raises another question which requires discussion. Why should parents give such an undertaking; and if they do, what would be its value? It is likely that the authorities will act wrongly in many things which lie outside the terms of the Settlement. When that happens, one’s duty lies not in acquiescing in such action or co-operating with the authorities but in not co-opera- ting with them. No one should interpret the Agreement to mean that the people should now give up resistance to authority and sit back with folded hands. An agreement may clarify certain things, but may not clarify some others. The people should certainly not sacrifice their self-respect in matters not so clarified. Hence I would certainly advise parents or students not to give such undertakings if they are demanded from them and if for that reason the latter cannot attend Government schools, they should stay away from them. All persons thus concerned should remember that the present uncertain state will not last long. Before the beginning of the next year at the latest, we shall have known whether the Congress demand is going to be accepted. There is no need to say what should be done in case it is rejected.
 
 FREEDOM ABOUT SALT
 Can we carry salt from a village where it may be manufactured and sell it in surrounding villages where it cannot be?
If the villages are so near that one can reach them on foot one
can certainly sell there the salt manufactured by oneself.
 Does the Simla Notification make any difference to the law hitherto in force that, within 10 miles of the coastline, no one could stock more than one Bengal maund of salt?
There can be no such law though I had heard of a notification
 to that effect having been issued. The latest notification issued should be understood to cancel all previous notifications that may be inconsistent with it. The correct position is this: According to the Agreement one may stock the salt needed for one’s consumption or manufactured by oneself within the limits of one’s village and intended for sale in places which one can reach on foot.
 Can one stock salt for sale? Fishermen need more salt in the month of Bhadrapad. Can one stock enough salt for them and sell it to them at that time?
The answer to this is included in the reply above.
 Can we make in Government land the pits and beds for manufacturing salt? Or should we make them in our own?
Such pits can be made wherever salt can be manufactured. As
 for private land the owner’s permission would be required, and hence the Agreement implies that pits may be made in Government land or one’s own.
 IRRELIGION IN THE NAME OF RELIGION
 There is a village, named Raghvanaj in Matar Taluka. It is well known that under Thakkar Bapa’s supervision, wells for Antyajas are being dug at many places in Gujarat, and one such well is being dug at Raghvanaj. The person supervising the work there had sent to Thakkar Bapa a report, the following extract from which deserves to be pondered over by all Hindus.libtech_431_footnote
 This is the height of tyranny. I do not blame the Dharalas much for the incident. The blame lies with the so-called highcaste Hindus. The Dharalas are merely acting under the influence of the atmosphere which the former have created. In wielding this whip of my pen, I
 
 have little hope of waking up the Dharala men and women, but I do certainly hope to be able to wake up Congress workers and the readers of Navajivan. In such a situation, the Congress workers who come to know of it should themselves take up the spade and start working, explain the meaning of dharma to Dharalas and others who may be oppressing the Antyajas and teach the latter to shed fear and to be self-reliant. All this can be easily done as soon as we get ready to work with our own hands. But we would do so only if we feel revolted by such oppression.
 MILLIONS SMOKED AWAY
A correspondent from Calcutta writes as follows:libtech_432_footnote
 It is not very likely that my writing on the subject would end the present waste of millions on smoking. But, apropos of this letter, I may remark here on a phenomenon which I have been observing. We seem to have become indifferent in keeping up the reforms which had spontaneously spread during the satyagraha movement. The inference to be drawn from this is alarming. If we behave well only while we are fighting and lapse into slackness as soon as the intoxication of battle is over, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to preserve swaraj after it is won. In that case, would it not be desirable that the struggle be prolonged? Perhaps such a conclusion is not altogether justified, but I certainly fear that it may be in the interest of the country that the struggle should continue sufficiently long so that the people may acquire the capacity to preserve swaraj. The fight ended before we had acquired strength enough to assimilate the reforms brought about while it was going on. May I hope that readers who have become indifferent in this matter will draw the appropriate lesson from this, shake off their indifference and wake up others as well? To those who realize that the satyagraha fight is a fight for self-purification, every day is a day of battle or, if you like, of peace, for the effort for self-purification should not be relaxed even for a moment.

   WHEAT OR CHAFFlibtech_433_footnote  
 Everyone must have read the resolution of the Congress Working Committee. It says in substance that if other conditions are favourable and if I am invited, I should attend the Round Table Conference to put before it the Congress demand even if the  communal question remains unsolved. I did not like the resolution. I opposed it. I even placed before the Committee for discussion a draft resolution along the lines I desired. But I was defeated and the resolution to the above effect was passed by a majority.
 Though I am often described as an autocrat, I consider myself a man who accepts the supremacy of the people’s voice; it is in my nature to give in to a panch. Panch means the voice of the people. I, therefore, accepted the resolution passed by the majority. There is an exception to this rule. We cannot give in to anyone on a question of principle. But there are not many principles in life. one who at every step refuses, in the name of principle, to listen to others is autocratic and selfish. Questions of principle arise only rarely. Here there was no such question, and so I gave in. I had often declared my determina- tion not to attend the Round Table Conference if the Hindu-Muslim, i.e., the communal question was not solved. But I could not convince the Working Committee of the correctness of my position. Ordinarily it would not be proper for me to put before the public my argument. No member has a right to publish anything that is discussed in the Working Committee. But in this case, the Committee has given me permission to do so. The Committee felt that in order to enable me to explain my position as also its own policy it was necessary to give me such permission.
 The reasoning behind my reluctance to go to the Round Table Conference without solving the communal question was as follows: Even if the question was solved, the acceptance of the  Congress demand in England was unlikely, but if it was not solved the sanction behind the demands would be lost. ‘You cannot put your own house in order and cannot unite yourselves, and still you ask for indepen- dence!’ Even if the members do not say this openly out of politeness, they would think thus and we would read their thought in their eyes. And they would, on the whole, be justified in taunting us thus.
 
 
 It would be better to accept our weakness rather than invite ridi- cule by going in such a pitiable condition. A satyagrahi never hides his weakness. According to the law of satyagraha, from the admission of weakness new strength is born. The first step in conquering weakness is its admission.
 No one should conclude from my argument that the Working Committee’s resolution is an attempt to hide our weakness. It reflects the consequence of weakness and hence amounts to unconscious hiding of it. The logical consequence of the admission of the weak- ness would be not to go to the Round Table Conference. That alone would be true admission of the weakness. One who does not have the strength to walk and admits that in words but actually tries to walk, has not truly admitted his weakness and by walking weakens himself all the more. He may even faint and collapse.
 Now if we admit our incapacity to solve the problem and do not send a representative of the Congress to the Round Table Conference, what should we do instead? That would not mean that we give up our fight for purna swaraj. The Round Table Conference is only one means of securing it. We may have to let go that means. Everyone will understand this much at once. But we should even give up the desire and the hope to secure purna swaraj through the Round Table Conference. We have then to swallow one bitter dose, and that is that whatever fight we start will not be for purna swaraj in name, though the result would be the same.
 If the communal question cannot be solved satisfactorily now, then it means that the methods which we have tried so far to solve it were wrong or inadequate. The attempts so far made aimed at brin- ging about understanding among the Hindu and Muslim politicians. They were of the nature of a fight for power among them. From such fighting no unity can come, none has come at least. If, therefore, the Congress desires unity of the heart, it should get out of that field and try to gain power over the hearts of Muslims and the other commu- nities as it has gained over those of the Hindus. Such an attempt is bound to result in a unity of hearts. There is no scope for failure in it. The power of the Congress has its source in service of the people. If the Congress programme is so organized that the Muslims and the others continue to get equal benefit, then they also will come to know the Congress.
 It is not that today nothing is done for their service. Nevertheless we must acknowledge the fact that Muslims, Sikhs and others do not respond to the Congress as much as the Hindus do. Instead of finding fault with these communities for this state of affairs, it would be better and more graceful for the Congress to admit its deficiency.
 When the Congress will be overflowing with Indians other than Hindus, then there will be no difference between a communal solution and a national solution, the Muslims or other communities will not be afraid, because they are fewer in number, of the far more numerous Hindus, and the Hindus, physically weaker though in a majority, will not be afraid of the physically stronger Mussalmans or Sikhs. Each community’s strength will benefit the other communities. Unless such conditions are created, paper swaraj will fly off with a puff like the sheet of paper on which it is written.
 What is paper swaraj, and what is the other swaraj? Let us see. The swaraj got through the Round Table Conference means the swaraj constitution accepted by us and passed by British Parliament into law. This is the swaraj on the statute book, i.e., paper swaraj. Behind it, there would not be the signatures of the millions; in fact the millions would not be trusting one another. If Hindus and Muslims in Kanpur and Kashi are fighting one another, then such swaraj would be no better than chaff.
 True swaraj is that which will have signatures of the millions behind it, whose cool shelter the millions would enjoy, and in which the incidents at Kanpur and Kashi would be past history to us and we would laugh heartily at our past follies. Whether or not such swaraj has become statutory, it would be true swaraj and would be like wheat, for it would be nourishing.
 I am of the view that if we cannot solve the communal question satisfactorily and if we decide to fight for the swaraj of my concep- tion, then our boycott of the Round Table Conference will be a sign of our strength and will uphold our self-respect.
 This is the fight of my conception. Even if the communal question is not solved and the representative of the Congress does not attend the Round Table Conference, something is bound to be done. Let the communal-minded Hindus and Muslims and others share a little power with the British under that Constitution and think that they are participating in ruling the country. The Congress instead of asking for power from that Government will demand the things for which
 
 they want power and, if they are refused, it will fight through satya- graha. We do not want political power for its own sake, we want it for a certain end. That end is service of the millions. If we cannot get today the reins of power in our hands to improve their economic, moral and social conditions, we need not on that account stop that work.
 By giving such a turn to the fight for swaraj, we can bypass the communal tangle and invite all the people to join the fight. Nobody will be able to keep out of it. Those who refuse to join will lose their face. All those who have the spirit of self-sacrifice and courage cannot but join in the demand for what is necessary for the uplift of the millions.
 For example, a fight for revision of the land revenue laws to make them more equitable and to reduce the burden of land revenue would be for the benefit of all communities and in time everybody would join it. Such a fight would result either in the desired reforms being effected or in those holding power handing over the power to the rebellious people. Either result would mean the same to us. As a result of such a fight communal discords would disappear and the people would know who their servants were and who their masters. The people’s strength would increase day by day, they would get true political education and know where their interests lay. This, according to me, would be true swaraj. If we adopt such a course in time we would find purna swaraj in our lap.
 But I could not convince the Working Committee of the sound- ness of this scheme. The majority of the members felt that as the Settlement had been signed, if other circumstances were favourable I must attend the Round Table Conference despite the absence of a solution of the communal question. I will go out of respect for the collective decision of the Committee. And if I go, I will use all my ability to present the Congress demand and to get it accepted. But if the communal question is not solved, I believe it highly improbable that our demand will be accepted, and if it is not accepted and if it is decided to resume the fight, I would try to give the fight the turn I have explained above.

He who curbs the organs of action but allows the mind to dwell on 	sense-objects,—such a one, wholly deluded, is called a hypocrite.libtech_436_footnote  	Here we should understand vimudhatma to mean merely that the 	person lacks true knowledge and that, therefore, his outward 	self-control is of no value. The man who lets his mind dwell on 	lustful thoughts cannot be regarded a brahmachari simply 	because  he refrains from physical gratification. In other words, 	one must banish from one’s mind all evil thoughts which may arise 	in it. Anyone who wants to succeed in this effort would take the 	necessary steps, which you never did. Now you should recognize the 	lack of self-control in you both, live humbly as an ordinary married 	couple and practise only such self-control outwardly as you can do 	mentally as well. Think over the meaning of the bhajan: “Unless 	the mind is free from desire, renunciation cannot endure.” Do not 	feel that  I  am  reproaching you. Rest assured that I have only 	tried to open your eyes to the truth so that you may wake up. I 	am enclosing a notelibtech_437_footnotelibtech_438_footnotesaying that the sums which you owe to  Navajivan 	and the Ashram should 	be written off. You may use it. I think that this was a      
 mistake on your part. You should not have incurred debts in that way. Instead of borrowing money and then seeking exemption from repaying the loan, at the very time of drawing the money you should have asked for so much more by way of honorarium. We ought not to value in terms of money the work done for a public cause. I write this for the sake of purity in our dealings. Only if we maintain the highest standards of purity in our practical affairs can we come out of our abject condition of mind. He who never feels inwardly poor is richer than even the richest millionaire.
 I am going to Bombay from here on Wednesday. Both of you may come before that if you wish to. You may, however, save your time and money, if you can be satisfied with my blessings conveyed to you through a letter from here. We haven’t yet learnt the lesson of simplicity. This charge applies to nearly everyone. The fault lies with the circumstances. I have always had plenty of money at my disposal, so that I have not succeeded in exercising strict control in its use. I have therefore often wished how good it would be if people stopped giving us money and we did not even know how we would get our next meal. Read again my articlelibtech_439_footnotein Navajivan on this subject.

  	I read your humorous but painful letter, containing the account of 	all that happened in Kashmir in connection with the flag. The sketch 	is very interesting and reveals the deplorable conditions in the 	Indian States. It was your insistence on a written order that saved 	you. It is evident an ordinary man, had he carried the flag, would 	have been arrested. Let us see what this Round Table Conference 	accomplishes. Yes, 	Kotak is doing good work in Kashmir.  	Door to door propaganda is required for the boycott of foreign 	cloth. That is more effective than picketing and the result is more 	or less permanent.  	Should not Dr. Ansari do something about the  quarrels  in Delhi? 	You may suggest this to him.  Yours  MOHANDAS  From 	a photostat of the Hindi: G.N. 5622

  	I have your letter. It was Panditji who told me about Maganbhai.  I 	certainly thought that there must have been some misunderstanding on 	his part over other matters as there was over this. But Panditji 	speaks out what he has in mind and then thinks no more about it. 	That is a great virtue in him. Mahadev 	told me that Manju was perfectly all right now.  	The Punjabi vaid seems to charge rather high fee. If, however, his 	medicines are effective, why should we not let ourselves be treated     
 by him and pay him his fees? Do not allopathic doctors sometimes charge Rs. 1,000 for a day? Some of them give free service to us. This vaid thought that, if he could charge others, he could certainly charge us too. If he is an honest vaid, we should not mind his fee. He does not charge for a visit separately, but charges for visits and medicines together. Allopathic doctors charge for them separately.
 Shivabhai had a talk with me about his wife. Even if he cannot come, I see that we have no choice but to admit his wife. If she becomes too much of a problem, inform Shivabhai. It would be better if she stays with Gangabehn or with some other woman of equal standing.

   LETTER TO PRABHAVATI  
 BORSAD,
 June 22, 1931
 
 CHI. PRABHAVATI,
 
 I got your letter. You are doing right in giving your address in every letter. You should not feel worried but do your duty in the given circumstances. If you can come away early, you can stay with me for many days. Nothing is yet certain about my going to England, but, even if I go, I shall not be able to take you with me, however much I may wish to do so. The work which I have to do there will not permit me to do that. Moreover, the expense of taking you with me will be far too much. That would not become people like us who are trying to live simple lives. If, however, you come away from there to stay with me, why need you return? While I am away, you will live in the Ashram. You are bound to keep good health there. All that is necessary is that you should come away soon.
 For some time, Rajendrababu will stay hereabouts. Afterwards, he will certainly return to Patna. But that will be after some time yet.
The Committee will meet on July 7.
 I am in Borsad, but you should write to me to the  Bardoli address.

  	I have your letter. You have given enough details. I think it would 	have been good if you had come and seen me. I could follow Kisan’slibtech_444_footnoteletter. Write to her and tell her that I liked it.  	Gangabehn’s eagerness to teach the girls all she can is quite sin- 	cere and is also admirable.

Panditji has much to complain against  you.libtech_445_footnotelibtech_446_footnoteGo 	 to  him  and listen to all that he has to say, and reply to his 	complaints courteously. It will be difficult to find an inmate of 	the Ashram as sincere as Panditji. Win him over. Why should he have 	reason to  complain against you ? You are by nature harsh, curt, 	reserved. This much is true. I don’t think that these are serious 	defects, but they are bound to create difficulties. You should, 	therefore, try to overcome them. Straighten out matters with 	Panditji immediately.

    LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI       BORSAD, 
    CHI. 	NARANDAS,  June 	22, 1931 
  	This letter will be brought to you by one Mahadev Mailar and his 	wife, Sidhudevi. Mahadev was an inmate of the Ashram. He was married 	at an early age. He observes complete brahmacharya and tells 	me that his wife, too, understands the importance of the vow. 	Mahadev works in an Ashram which is being run in a place called 	Hosari. He and his wife will ultimately settle in that Ashram. Just 	now, they wish to learn Hindi. They will learn other things, too, 	but  they are especially eager to master Hindi. See what 	arrangements you  can make for them. Personally, I think you can 	enlist the services of that crazy fellow Parasram. Though crazy, he 	has clung to us. I don’t feel like shifting him from Kanpur, but 	we may do that if necessary. It is certainly desirable that the 	Ashram should have perfect arrangements for teaching Hindi. 
     [PS.]  Blessings 	from  BAPU   I have 	told Mahadev that, if his wife is found to be of no use to 
  	the Ashram, she will have to leave. We shall have to bear the 	expenditure on them. They, on their part, are of course willing to 	work so that the Ashram is not out of pocket on their account.  From 	a microfilm of the Gujarati: M.M.U./I      LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI    [June 22, 1931]libtech_447_footnote  CHI. 	NARANDAS,  	There is only one point in your letter which calls for a reply. In 	what context did I tell Soman that he might take his meals 	separately from others? I don’t remember having told him this, but 	I will carry out whatever he remembers that I told him. The general 	rule is what you    
 state it to be. Janakibai is a pious woman. We should keep her in the Ashram as long as she feels happy in it. If you think it proper, show this to Bhai Soman. What does he do these days?
Mahavir’s fever must have left him.
 Mirabehn and Gaur Gopaldas intend to go to the Ashram. Mirabehn now realizes that her place is in the Ashram or wherever there is some work to do. She is convinced of this and wishes to live accordingly. That is why she is going there. Assign her any work you think proper. Make whatever arrangements you do on the understanding that, if I have to go to England, she will accompany me. If I have to go, it will be in the middle of August.
 I am intentionally sending Gaur Gopal there. He is a youth of a very straightforward nature. You must have come to know that he belongs to a zamindar family. Make him as comfortable as you can and assign to him any work you think proper. See that he acquires proficiency in Hindi and learns to card and spin well. I should like him to complete the whole course in weaving. Arrange his work in such a way that he gets some time for reading.
     [PS.]  Blessings 	from  BAPU   Mirabehn 	will leave by the Kathiawar Mail tomorrow. It arrives 
  	there at 7.30 or 8 a.m. She will hire a tonga from the station to 	take her to the Ashram. If Ranchhodbhai or somebody else agrees to 	go to the station and take her in a car to the Ashram, that will 	save her time. Get Mirabehn’s room vacated for her. Balvant and 	Gaur Gopal will probably be travelling with her. [From 	Gujarati]  Bapuna 	Patro-9: Shri Narandas Gandhine, 	Pt. I, pp. 263-4; also C.W. 8176.  Courtesy: 	Narandas Gandhi

  	I expect much from you at this time. If you wish to cultivate 	oneness with all the women and see that the girls make great 	progress, you should, instead of undertaking too many tasks, be 	content with a few and give more time to general supervision. If you 	try to do every small thing yourself, you will not be able to 	exercise general super- vision. You should also give up thinking 	about new plans of work and the ambition to jump high. At present 	you have quite a large number of grown-up women and girls under your 	charge. If this field of the Ashram activities is perfectly 	organized, the Ashram will overflow with women and girls. Think that 	your family is of unlimited size.

    ADVICE TO FARMERS, BORSAD       BORSAD, 
  June 	22, 1931  Answering 	various questions put to 	him, Mahatma 	Gandhi said that everyone 	who could 	afford should pay all 	dues, including past dues 	and taqavi. 	By affording, 	he meant ability to 	pay without 	borrowing and without 	selling their belongings. He 	had, from 	the moment 	he entered 	Borsad, made it clear 	to the 	authorities and 	in his personal 	conversation with the 	Collector, that 	it was 	on that 	basis that he proposed 	to work 	and offer 	help and 	it was 	on that 	basis that 	the lists 	were prepared 	and payments made.  He 	was happy to see that all but Rs. 2,000 to Rs. 3,000 had been paid 	and he had been given an assurance that this sum also would be paid 	up in two or three days. There was now, therefore, no question of 	further calls upon them during the present year. He had, however, 	written to the Collector, asking him to furnish the names of 
 those whom he might suspect of having withheld their correct position from him. He would be severely disappointed if he had been misled by any of the landholders.
 He warned them and told them that if there were any whom they knew, they should bring their names to his notice and induce them to  pay  land  revenue. Regarding village officers who were still awaiting reinstatement, he said that he was in correspondence with the authorities and hoped to have a satisfactory decision about them.
 Concluding, Mahatma Gandhi exhorted Patidarslibtech_448_footnote, who had taken prominent part in the struggle, to get rid of untouchability and treat other backward commu- nities, such as Dharalas and Barias, as themselves.
 Asked what they should do regarding their confiscated lands sold to third parties, Mahatma Gandhi said that he hoped still to secure all such lands, but if the so-called purchasers came to take possession no opposition should be offered them. If they were still in possession, they could till the land but they should realize that they ran the risk of having to lose labour and seed if they were called upon to give up possession, which they would have to do. Whilst no one should work on such land on behalf of purchasers, no molestation should be offered against those who wished to work.

MANILAL AND SUSHILA,  	I got your joint letter (only three lines from Sushila). Corruption 	you will find everywhere. The reformer and public worker should do 	what he can to remove it, himself remain untouched by it, and cease 	worrying. However, personally I do believe that persons like you 	would get better support in India and so be able to do some work. 	But now that you have gone back there, you should stay on for some 	time and, if you wish to wind up the work, do so properly before you 	come away. It would certainly be good if Indian Opinion 	continues. But rather than that it should pass into the hands of 	persons who may not run it well, it had better stop. Everything that 	exists is bound to perish sooner or later. Let Indian Opinion, 	then, meet its end at your hands. Meet Kallenbach, Omar Sheth and 	others, and do what you think proper after discussing the matter 	with them.  	You should plan to return here when the struggle is resumed. It 	seems certain that it will be resumed next year, though I will make 	every effort to see that it does not become necessary. Don’t 	decide anything in haste or excitement.  	It is a painful thing that Sorabji should refuse to pay even the 	policy premiums. The Ashram cannot pay them. Do not mind if the 
 premiums already paid are lost. Now that Jalbhai also is there, see if you can persuade the two brothers and make them pay the premiums. Is any surrender value of the policy payable, or nothing at all? What is Sorabji’s financial condition?
 Nothing is yet certain about my going to England. Ramdas and Nimu have gone to Almora to enjoy the climate for a few days.

  	If  influential  workers  in  Limbasilibtech_450_footnotelibtech_451_footnotetake 	  the   lead   and   permit Antyajas, opposition from the few 	would subside of itself. But they must be real workers, and not 	merely workers in name. Why not call the people of the village 	together and tell them that you would disband the Ashram? If the 	people don’t let you, there is no need to hurry; if they agree, 	then too there is no hurry. But it would be good if they say yes. 	Our work would get publicity.    
 My statement that looking for another place of work would mean parigraha was intended to apply to all. Are not all Ashram residents under the vow of aparigraha? I mentioned only the ideal. If  a person who is disinclined for some reason to return to the Ashram finds himself without work at a given place, he may certainly look for it elsewhere.
 I read your letter to Mahadev about the headman. What can we do in the case? It should be proved that he cannot pay. I cannot do that from here and so a letter from here can have no effect. If you write to me from there, giving evidence regarding his condition, or if I get such a letter from somebody else, I may possibly be able to do something in the matter.

   this. Your 	personal letter will be destroyed as soon as I have finished   I believe in the 	English saying, “Take care of your pennies and 
  	the pounds will take care of themselves”. If we act on the square 	over the comparatively little settlementlibtech_461_footnote, the big issue in London will take care of itself. I 	do therefore want (p. 69) you please to straighten out things on 	your side. There is a tendency in the Provinces to crush the 	Congress and the Congress spirit. It is like distrusting or 	belittling one’s partner.  	On my side, I do not want you to spare me. Your indictments I shall 	appreciate. I do not want to hide or overlook a single breach on our 	part. I want us to make (p. 70) full reparation for every wrong act 	we may do. For I desire with all my heart a permanent settlement, an 	honourable partnership. This is impossible if we conceal our 	weaknesses or condone breaches on the part of workers. If you only 	saw the letters I daily write, the discussions I daily hold on  the 	necessity of a faithful (p. 71) performance of what you have called 	gentlemen’s agreement.  	Khansaheb’s speeches have not all been correctly reported. I wish 	it had been possible for you to have met him.  	I shall write to you about Pandit Jawaharlal later. You must not get 	ill.  	The newspaper (72) cutting with your comment came as a tonic 	relieving the depression of exhausting correspondence dealing with 	all kinds of complaints. Hope 	you are feeling better.

    LETTER TO R. M. MAXWELL        DEAR 	MR. MAXWELL,      BORSAD,  June 	24, 1931 
  	May I remind you about several letters regarding the Settlement to 	which answers are long overdue? They cover important matters and I 	would be grateful if you could let me have early replies. Meanwhile  	I have to draw your attention to the fact that with reference to the 	restoration  of  forfeited  watanslibtech_462_footnotelibtech_463_footnote,  undertakings   are   required   before restoration. 	I send you a copy in connection with one such watan. The 	other parties are: Messrs 	Hanamant Ramchandra Deshpande of Bilgi, G. 	C. Joshi of Guledgud, Hanumantrao 	Desai of Andamurnal, Taluk Bagalkot.  	These undertakings in my opinion are in breach of the Settlement and 	they should be waived as they were in Gujarat in connection with 	Mukhislibtech_464_footnote.  	Whilst I am dictating this letter, I have a letter from Barsi town 	from Mr. D. V. Sulakhe. His is a case of confiscation pure and 	simple. He has sent a petition to His Excellency, but he has not 	been given any reply. The petition of which I have a copy sent to me 	bears date 16th March.  Yours 	sincerely, Encl. 	1  R. M.

    LETTER TO K. B. BHADRAPUR        DEAR 	MR. BHADRAPUR,      BORSAD,  June 	24, 1931 
  	In your letter the other day you said that the non-Dharala 	population of Ras was fully entitled to protection at the hands of 	the Government and that you were enquiring into the complaints made 	by me to you. You will agree with me that no assurance on paper can 	possibly bring relief to those who are actually being injured. The 	only relief they can see and feel is when the injury ceases. 	Unfortunately the same injury that I complained of seems to be 	continuing. This time in order to verify so far as it was possible 	the complaints made by the residents of Ras I sent Syt. Mahadev 	Desai to make a local investigation. The enclosed is his report. You 	will see therefrom that the hedges of the poor cultivators are still 	being destroyed. Valuable babul trees are being cut down and wood 	taken away. I understand from Mr. Perry that, for fear lest the 	Dharalas might be molested by the Patidars, additional police still 	continued to be posted. I wonder if the police is able to afford any 	protection to the Patidars and others. But whether the function of 	this additional police is or is not to protect the non-Dharala 	population of Ras, will you please let me know whether the 	Government intend to protect the Patidars of Ras from continuous 	molestation or whether they are to look after themselves in the best 	manner they can. I shall be away from Borsad for two days, possibly 	three. May I ask for immediate attention to the complaints and may I 	know when I may expect reply to my letter about the Mukhi?

            MY 	DEAR CHARLIE,    LETTER TO C. F. ANDREWS    AS 	AT SABARMATI,  June 	24, 1931 
  	I have your letter. I shall look forward to Mrs. Polak’s booklibtech_465_footnote. I know it will revive old and pleasant memories and 	it will tell me of things I have perhaps altogether forgotten.  	It is a good thing that your two bookslibtech_466_footnoteare reaching the proper people.  	As is your wont you are distressed over what your eyes see and ears 	hear. This time it is the terrible unemployment in Lancashire and 	what you see and hear acts as an effective barrier against 	perceiving the truth. I have seen from extensive experience the 	truth of a legal maxim which says: “Hard cases make bad law.” 	Many legal maxims are also sound moral maxims as this one is. I can 	say with perfect detachment although I am immersed in the Indian 	turmoil that the way you suggest is not the way to help Lancashire. 	If it was wrong any time for Lancashire to impose its cloth upon 	India by hook or by crook it is wrong also today and more so because 	India has become conscious of the wrong. And if India now refuses to 	be party to the wrong, surely she won’t be adding wrong to wrong 	but she would be assisting the process of undoing the wrong done by 	Lancashire. That the labourers were not conscious of the wrong that 	was being done is no justification for the wrong itself being 	sustained by the party wronged, that is, India or anybody else. The 	proper course is to show the labourers how they have been 	unconsciously assisting the wrong done by Lancashire to India and 	therefore how necessary it is to retrace the step. The first thing 	to do therefore is, if Lancashire cloth cannot be sold outside 	India, to find some other employment. What that can be it is 	difficult for me to say. I do not know how England itself is 	clothed. Why should not the same machinery be used for preparing the 	clothing of the kind required by England or better still, why should 	not the machinery be scrapped and the unemployed take     
 to handicrafts? I know these are vague ideas without any basis for them but I have given them to show which way my mind is working.
 Let me help you by putting before you another fact. Foreign cloth boycott has created a kind of atmosphere. Its effect upon Lancashire is nothing so serious as it is made out. In the first place do you know that before the boycott became a live thing Lancashire sent to India only 12% of her output of piecegoods? Have you studied the illuminating  figureslibtech_467_footnotelibtech_468_footnotepublished  in  a   recent   issue   of   Young   India showing conclusively that Lancashire had to fear not so much Indian boycott as the ever-growing Japanese competition? My heart goes out to the unemployed. It goes out to you in your terrific moral struggle. But I cannot be helpful in the way you suggest. Of that I am quite clear. That there is a way out I have no doubt and probably if I came to London, after a study of the situation on the spot I should be able to suggest some practical solution. And if I came at all I would certainly do as you want me to, first of all proceed to Lancashire and see the unemployed face to face.
 But I am not at all sure that I shall be able to go. As yet of course there is no invitation. The Settlement is causing me much anxiety. The local governments are not playing the game. Lathi charges too are now and then resorted to. Jawaharlal sends me bitter complaints from Allahabad. But I shall see what is possible when the time for sailing comes. Jawaharlal cannot accompany me unless he forms part of the deputation. 1 do not think it would be advisable though of course if he was in London his presence would relieve me of a great deal of responsibility. Malaviyaji and Ansari are a certainty. They are most likely to be invited apart from the Working Committee and so is Mrs. Naidu. I note you will house me with Muriel.
Love.

    DEAR 	PRINCIPAL SHIRRAS,  June 	24, 1931 
  	Some students from your college have come to me for advice regarding 	your refusal to admit to the college certain students who had taken 	part in the civil disobedience movement. Without entering into a 	discussion of the Delhi Settlement, may I suggest that at the 	present moment it would be hardly proper to refuse admission to the 	students who took part in the movement? Is it not a fact that the 	whole of the student world was stirred to the very depths by the 	national awakening, and whether they took any direct part in the 	movement or not there is no doubt that they were all filled with the 	spirit of the     
 time. For the sake of peace therefore I would urge you to withdraw your orders and admit all the students without imposing any condi- tions. I have given my opinionlibtech_471_footnoteto the students which I have published in Navajivan that any undertaking given by the students as to non- participation in any future struggle or regret about participa-tion in the past would be wholly inconsistent with self-respect. I would also go further and say, what I have not said in my opinion referred to above, that it would also be inconsistent with the students’ inmost belief. I hope you would not consider this letter a presumption.
 Yours sincerely,

  	I have your letter. Your explanation does not absolve you from 	blame. My point is that it is wrong to criticize one State in the 	territory of another. Such criticism involves violence. You should 	think over all that I have said to you from the point of view of 	non-violence. If you think that the principle of non-violence itself 	is an error, my argument loses all force.

   SLAVE COMMUNITIES  
 We have the untouchables, the shame and curse of the Hindu society. But we have also other communities whom we—the so-called higher classes—treat almost as slaves and keep in quarters designed for our cattle. Representatives of one such community have addressed a letter which I condense as follows:libtech_474_footnote
 We are representatives of the Rajwar community living in the districts of Gaya, Patna, Monghyr and Palamau, in the Province of Bihar and Orissa. . . .
 On refusal to give begarlibtech_475_footnotethe zamindar forthwith begins a suit for arrears of rent, gets decree, puts the  jotlibtech_476_footnoteto auction and evicts the tenant from the land in his possession.
 A Rajwar child, no sooner he reaches his 6th or 7th year, becomes almost the property of his parents’ landlord; he is  made to tend the landlord’s cattle and do all sorts of odd jobs. .
 . . In fact he leads the life of a slave, a mere chattel of the landlord.
 For working from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. Rajwars are paid at the rate of 3 seers of unhusked rice per diem and no wages in cash are ever paid to them. . . .
 The Rajwar children are not allowed to be sent to the primary schools and the teachers too are not allowed to teach the boys by the landlord.
 Whenever there is any theft or larceny or dacoity or any crime whatever in the locality where this community is living, the first suspicion and the first brunt of the police enquiry must be borne by it, although there may not be the slightest evidence for the same. . . .
 We have already submitted these memorials to the District Magistrates of Gaya and Patna, and to the Chief Secretary, Bihar and Orissa Government but we have not as yet learnt what steps the respective authorities have taken. We hope that you will do something to ameliorate our condition.
The letter is written for the representatives and probably
 
 also prompted by some unknown reformer among them. It is signed by about twenty-five representatives. What however matters is not who wrote it but the statements made therein, if they are true.
 They are highly likely to be true in the main. For such treatment is not an isolated phenomenon of Bihar. Almost all the provinces have these backward, suppressed, slave communities. They are no heritage from the British. We have had them for ages and all the greater shame on us for that.
 We may plead a thousand excuses for their existence in the days gone by. But in these days of enlightenment, awakening and insis- tence on swaraj, we have no excuse for tolerating the atrocity. Con- gress workers have to take up the cause of these communities wher- ever they are found. They should try to enlist the sympathy and co- operation of those who ‘own’ these men and women. Swaraj is the sum total of all the activities that go to build up a free and vigorous nation concious of the strength that comes from right doing. The existence of slave communities is aterrible wrong and must therefore be a hindrance in our march towards the goal.

   A GENTLE REBUKE  
 C. Rajagopalachari’s eagle eye sees everything that appears in print about the drink evil. He saw a report of my very innocent speech at the village of Marolilibtech_477_footnotewhere the other day I laid the foundation of a weaving institute. I had there attempted to show the connection that exists between factory labour and drink and said how mithubehn Petit had, whilst doing prohibition work, discovered that if the people who ceased to visit the liquor shops she picketed were to be permanently weaned from drink, they should have some ambition provided in life, some work found for them during their idle hours. I then showed how she found such occupation in hand-spinning and weaving. I further went on to show that if people had to do excessive labour, they would want some stimulant and illustrated it by an experience from my own life when during the Boer War I had to issue from the commissariat rations of rum for those bearers who were used to drink and who pleaded with me for rum which, they said, would enable them to bear the fatigue and resume next day’s march. Of course, this was a
 
 
 superstition. But superstitions die hard.
 Rajagopalachari feared that the report that he had read would be distorted to yield all kinds of meanings favourable to the opponents of prohibition. His fear has been justified. I have received embarr- assing congratulations on my conversion to sanity. They embarrass me because I am not conscious of the conversion imputed to me. I feel like a man who falsely reported to have died reads his obituary notices and blushes to have the virtues he never knew  he  had possessed.
Let me therefore re-declare my faith in undiluted prohibition
 before I land myself in deeper water. If I was appointed dictator for one hour for all India, the first thing I would do would be to close without compensation all the liquor shops, destroy all the toddy palms such as I know them in Gujarat, compel factory owners to produce humane conditions for their workmen and open refreshment and recreation rooms where these workmen would get innocent drinks and equally innocent amusements. I would close down the factories if the owners pleaded want of funds. Being a teetotaller, I would retain my sobriety in spite of the possession of one hour’s dictatorship and therefore arrange for the examination of my European friends and diseased persons who may be in medical need of brandy and the like at State expense by medical experts and where necessary they would receive certificate which would entitle them to obtain the prescribed quantity of the fiery waters from certified chemists. The rule will apply mutatis mutandis to intoxicating drugs.
 For the loss of revenue from drinks, I would straightway cut down the military expenditure and expect the Commander-in-Chief to accommodate himself to the new condition in the best way he can. The workmen left idle by the closing of factories, I would remove to model farms to be immediately opened as far as possible in the neighbourhood of the factories unless I was advised during that brief hour that the State could profitably run the factories under  the  required conditions and could therefore take over from the owners.
 Young India, 25-6-1931
  
   TERRIBLE IF TRUE  
I take the following from a complaint about picketing:
 In rural areas there is definite evidence that everything short of physical violence has been resorted to by volunteers. Would-be customers  are obstructed, abused and generally harassed, and toddy shop renters have been put to considerable loss and in some instances have been so discouraged that they have ceased to get trees marked for tapping and closed their shops rather than suffer further indignities. The Congress office in Tellichery issued summonses to the principal renters to appear before them and few had the courage to disobey. Those who appeared were summarily told to close their shops, and when they asked for compensation they were told that Congress would do nothing for them.
 If these complaints are true this picketing should be suspended immediately. Though as soon as I had this complaint  I  wrote  inquiring about the allegations, I thought it was better for the sake of workers in general to publish the complaint. It may be mentioned that somewhat similar complaints have been received regarding cloth- picketing too. I can but repeat the warninglibtech_478_footnotelibtech_479_footnoteI have issued in   these pages that it would be better for the Congress, better for the cause of prohibition, whether of intoxicating drinks and drugs or foreign cloth, that we ceased picketing altogether than that there was the slightest departure from the terms of the Delhi Settlement. If picketing cannot remain peaceful, it should be abandoned altogether.
 It is being discovered that the more effective method is to pay house-to-house visit and meet the drunkards, opium-eaters or foreign-cloth users in their own homes and explain to them the evil of the use of any of the three things. There may be also addresses at street corners and distribution of leaflets. Prabhat pherieslibtech_480_footnotetoo can do this propaganda through swadeshi and anti-drink and drug songs. Foreign-cloth boycott may also be assisted by door to door hawking of khadi, registering orders and organizing the weaving of self-spun yarn. Such levelling up [of] the atmosphere cannot but affect the use of drinks and drugs and foreign cloth.
 
 THE OTHER SIDE
 But how if these charges are in the main or wholly untrue. I know that in Gujarat there is a tendency growing up  to  molest  peaceful picketers and, what is more mischievious still, there is going on an unrestrained sale of liquor at odd hours and in odd places under cover of the law. Sjt. C. Rajagopalachari who is the General Secretary of the Temperance League in the place vacated by Mr. Anderson and who is a politician only because he is a social reformer is convinced that in the South a deliberate policy of repression of strictly peaceful picketing has been launched in the shape of faked prosecutions and physical interference. From Ludhiana, Ambala, Muttra and elsewhere come authentic reports of lathi charges and the like. I have deliberately refrained from publishing these statements of which the various organizations have furnished me with a full record. Besides this, there are complaints pouring in about other matters. I can only give the assurance to the public that not one of these has escaped my attention. But I cannot carry on a public propaganda at the same time that I am carrying on delicate negotiations with the Central Government from and through which I expect to gain relief in most of, if not all of these cases.
 Meanwhile I must ask all Congress workers to be patient. They must not allow themselves to be provoked into civil disobedience. It is never the first, it is always the last resort. We must exhaust all the intermediate processes before we can take up that last sovereign remedy. Whilst the Settlement lasts, we have the law-courts too, open to us. I know that at best they bring us poor comfort. But, such as they are, they may not be passed by, even as we may not pass by, the respective departments of the executive Government for  seeking relief. Happily nowadays we have all over India lawyers who give their services to the Congress organizations free of charge. Wherever therefore these facilities exist, Congress organizations should avail themselves of them and try to obtain such relief as is locally possible. They must not embark on civil disobedience without first obtaining the permission of the Working Committee. It is to meet very shortlylibtech_481_footnoteand I promise to place it in full possession of all the complaints and take directions from it. Our safety and honour  today demand a meticulous performance by us of all the conditions of the Settlement.
 
 But I would appeal to the provincial governments and the members of the Civil Service to come to the rescue. I must not conceal from them and the public the suspicion based on the evidences before me that they are in many cases hindering the working  of the Settlement where they are not wilfully breaking it. Let it not be proved what is being said of them that some of them want the Settlement to break to pieces. Let it not be said of them that they destroyed the edifice that Lord Irwin gave anxious days and anxious nights to build up. Let them realize that the Settlement is a solemn contract not between two individuals but between two organizations, hitherto fighting, now seeking to cooperate. They may not distrust  the Congress workers and treat them as if they were enemies even as the Congressmen may not, whilst the contract persists, distrust  every official act.

   A MARTYR  
 Whilst the Working Committee was deliberating in Bombay during the early part of the month, there was a public meeting in Dongri at which there was an uproar and at which a youth was fatally stabbed. The news of the death was brought to the Working Committee. It created a sensation but at the time it was thought that some unknown unidentifiable person had died. On returning to Bor- sad I had a letter from Sjt. Kishorelal Mashruwala who deploring the tragedy gave me some details about the deceased. I thereupon asked him to procure fuller details which I now have.
 Brave and good Pannalal was only 22 years old when he received the fatal stab on that fateful night from one of the excited Mussalman crowd. Accompanied by his father and younger brother, Pannalal had gone to the Dongri meeting specially to hear  Khan Saheb Abdul Ghaffar Khan who was among others advertised to speak at the meeting. After they had heard the Khan Saheb the father hailed a victoria and they got in. Being khaddar-clad they were taken for nationalist leaders. A howling crowd surrounded them. Stones were rained on them. All of them were hurt. Pannalal’s left eyebrow was bleeding. Nothing minding, in order to lighten his father’s sorrow, he made light of his wound. Suddenly there came into his left ribs a deep stab. Blood gushed from the wounded side. Out came the entrails.
 Pannalal bore it all bravely and asked to be taken to the hospital where he said his wound would be dressed and all would be well. Alas ! all was not well. In spite of all the attention given to him the brave young man died the next day.
 He was born of wealthy parents. His father Maganlal Zaveri is a flourishing jeweller, much trusted and respected for his honesty. His uncle is the Chief Judge of the Jodhpur High Court. The deceased leaves a young widow to whom he was married only eighteen months ago. The parents, having come under the influence of the national movement, simplified the life of the family and sent Pannalal to the national school. After having studied up to the sixth standard he left studies to help his father in business. But Pannalal never left national work. He was one of the party that raided the Wadala Salt Works and came in for lathi blows. He always joined the dangerous processions which were the feature of those days. Pannalal has lived by dying. My congratulations to the parents for having had such a worthy son. Let death and especially a death such as this leave no sting behind. The body has been reduced to ashes but out of the ashes will rise true unity among us. If we do not resent this death and would give many more lives if need be, I know that true unity will not be long in coming.
 As for the widow let me hope that their love for their son will prompt the parents to give her the education the girl widow may desire or be fitted for and that they will give her every encouragement to remarry when she grows to maturity. Let them, if they have drunk in the spirit of the age, shed the superstition that a widow is the property of the husband’s family to remain as their slave. A widow must have the same right as a widower and must be taught to know that she has the same free choice as men.
 And of the Mussalmans who approve of such murders ? Surely, the cause of Islam or the cause of peace which the word ‘Islam’ means, has not been advanced by the murder. It cannot be right to take innocent life; Pannalal had given no provocation. How I wish Pannalal’s murder would open the eyes of those whose heart approves such murders and who make them possible. Is it not possible  to  arrange a joint meeting on the very spot where the murder took place and to declare that whether we could evolve a common formulae regarding the political issue or not, such murders would be made impossible. Such a meeting is not impossible as, so far as I am aware,
 Pannalal’s people have forgiven the wrong and the Congress Com- mittee purposely avoided a public funeral in order that passion might not be in flamed. We ought to be able to hold public meetings anywhere and fearlessly express views even though they may be unpalatable in [a] particular neighbourhood.

   NOTES  
 SELF-RESPECT ABOVE ALL
 I have letterslibtech_483_footnotefrom several provinces saying that the education authorities are imposing conditions on the return of students who had left their schools or colleges during the struggle. A circular of which a copy has been sent by one of the correspondents requires parents to give guarantees that their children will not take part in politics. These correspondents ask me whether these conditions are consistent with the Settlement.
 Without entering into that question for the time being, I have no hesitation in saying that neither students nor parents if they have any self-respect left in them should accept such conditions. What will it profit the students or the parents if they have to lose their souls to gain the questionable advantage of a public education and a certificate? There are the national institutions open to the students. If they do not like these, they can study at home. It is a gross superstition to suppose that knowledge can be obtained only by going to schools and  colleges. The world produced brilliant students before schools and colleges came into being. There is nothing so ennobling or lasting as self-study. Schools and colleges make most of us mere receptacles for holding the superfluities of knowledge. Wheat is left out and mere husk is taken in. I do not wish to decry schools and colleges as such. They have their use. But we are making altogether too much of them. They are but one of the many means of gaining knowledge.
 OH, THOSE ADDRESSES
 Manibehn, Sardar Vallabhbhai’s daughter who does secretarial work, wardrobe keeping and nursing for her father and therefore always travels with him plaintively asks:
 Why do the people give Father so many addresses, when he wants money? You know better than I do that he has nowhere to lay his head on. He has no house or chests to keep the many addresses he receives. He has no safes in which he can keep costly caskets and gifts. For me it becomes positively a burden to take charge of these addresses and gifts. I would like people not to give addresses and gifts to any Congressmen. Their service must be its own
 
 reward. But in any case, will you not ask them to spare Father. Let them refrain from giving him the addresses he does not need, let them give him the money he needs for the very work they expect him to do and so much admire.
 I need add nothing to these sentiments beyond heartily endorsing them and commending them to those who would invite the Sardar to their places.
 DUTY OF DISCIPLINARIANS
An Akola correspondent asks:libtech_484_footnote
 If even elected officials in a Congress organization do not carry out the rule of khadi laid down in the constitution, what is one to do who believes in strict adherence to the rules?
 The question is more easily asked than answered. The decision would depend upon so many surrounding circumstances. Therefore it is possible only to give a general guidance which it may be necessary to depart from as new and varying circumstances arise.
 Assuming that the member believing in khaddar out and out finds that the majority do not observe the rule, that he has drawn their attention to the breach, that he has drawn the attention of the chief officials also and fails to find any satisfaction, he should by way of protest retire from the elected body to which he belongs. He will simply remain a four-anna member without exercising his right of voting. But outside the organization he will preach discipline without being bitter towards those who are lax in observing it. He will also do such Congress work as commends itself to him if he can do so without incurring the displeasure of the powers that be in the Congress organi- zation. A vast amount of constructive work can be done without one being a member.
 WHY DON’T THEY SPIN
A correspondent bitingly writes:
 When you address meetings you ask people to spin for the sake of your
 Daridranarayanalibtech_485_footnote. If anyone asks for your autograph, Bania-like, you impose the condition that he or she should spin! Then what prevents you from asking Congress members on so many committees to spin? Why do they not all spin by way of encouragement to others ? Or is spinning to be reserved for
 
 
 non-Congressmen or at best for four-anna members but not for the chosen ones of committees?
I apologize to the writer. Only let him remember that whereas I
 cannot always give spinning demonstrations before big audiences, I give actual demonstrations before members of committees. And is not an ounce of practice more than tons of preaching? But the writer is perhaps right in his sarcasm. There are hundreds of Congress committees if not thousands. I do not speak to all of them through my spinning. It would certainly be a good example and would add imperceptibly but materially to the wealth of the country if the thousands of members of these committees would spin regularly for at least half an hour. If these figures were tabulated and published from week to week, it will fill the atmosphere with the spirit of industry, sacrifice and khadi, the emblem of Daridranarayana. Boycott of foreign cloth through khadi will then be accomplished much earlier than the most sanguine among us dare expect. But will they? “They spin not, neither do they toil.”libtech_486_footnote

    LETTER TO K. B. BHADRAPUR        DEAR 	MR. BHADRAPUR,      AS 	AT BORSAD,  June 	25, 1931 
  	I have your astonishing letter of 23rd inst. I had written to you 	that the complainants had no evidence whereby they could fix the 	blame on the Dharalas. Nor had I asked for any prosecutions. What I 	had asked for was a preventive measure and if you tell me that where 	complainants cannot trace the guilty parties the Government will 	leave them to their fate I shall take the answer. But I was 	unprepared for the gratuitous statement that it is not beyond 	suspicion that the damages might have been selfinflicted to fasten 	the crime on the Dharalas. You will permit me to say that sentiments 	like this amount to putting a premium on crime. Does it not strike 	you as unthinkable that the Patidars should engage in 	self-destruction for the doubtful purpose of proving the Dharalas 	guilty? Nor am I able to see  what  earthly purpose they can serve 	by cutting all their hedges in order to fasten    
 any crime on the Dharalas. If you have at the back of your mind the Dharala Mukhi of Ras I must tell you that it was not the Patidars who made the suggestion that the presence of a Dharala Mukhi was probably responsible for the cutting of these hedges. In any case the case against the Dharala Mukhi stands on an independent footing. It is as I hold part of the Settlement whereas it would be open to you to say that the granting of protection to the Patidars is no part of the Settlement and I would not be able to challenge a position of that description.

   INTERVIEW TO THE PRESS  
 BOMBAY,
 June 25, 1931
 To a question put about his participation in the Federal Structure Committee [Gandhiji replied:]
If I attend the Round Table Conference, I shall possibly attend
the Federal Structure Committee also.
 Asked whether he had finally decided to go to the London Conference and when he was likely to start, Gandhiji said that the Working Committee would decide all those questions for him. His theory and views had been exploded and he would willingly obey whatever the Committee asked him to do.
 Asked whether the situation in Gujarat was satisfactory, after hesitating for a while, Gandhiji replied that the situation was not satisfactory. But he had been corresponding with the Government of India. Incidentally, he mentioned that he had been receiving reports from all over India forwarded by reliable trusted workers like Mr. C. Rajagopalachari, that a deliberate policy of repression of strictly peaceful picketing, in the shape of faked prosecutions, physical interference and lathi charges was hindering the working of the Settlement. None of these complaints had escaped his attention, and he could not publish them as he was carrying on delicate negotiations with the Central Government from and through which he expected to gain relief. He hoped that things would not assume serious proportions as to endanger the Truce. He had one word to say to Congressmen, that the safety and honour of the Congress demanded meticulous performance by the  Congressmen  of  all  the conditions of the Truce.
 Gandhiji proposed to place the Working Committee in full possession of all the complaints.
 
 Gandhiji profoundly regretted the failure of the efforts in Bhopal to effect a settlement between the two sections of the Muslim group. It was a very unfortunate incident. The Working Committee would discuss what next should be done in view of the failure.
 Gandhiji was confident that the Foreign-cloth Export Scheme would prove a success and the scheme did not amount to a breach of the Truce as alleged by certain interested parties.
 Is the contention made by a new political school of thought to the effect that the Congress, by accepting the Truce, accepted the principle of Federation as enunciated in the last R.T.C. true? If so where does the Congress resolution of Indepcndence passed at the Lahore Congress and reiterated at Karachi stand?
 A. This question need not be answered.

   DISCUSSION ON FOREIGN-CLOTH BOYCOTTlibtech_487_footnote  
 BOMBAY,
 June 25, 1931
 Mr. Gandhi said he was aware of the position, but it was an article of faith with him that the use of any foreign manufactured articles in the composition of cloth turned out by Indian mills was detrimental to the interests of the masses. He explained his view at some length and regretted his inability to deflect from the course [in spite] of any disadvantage, which might accrue to the industry, which he thought would only be of a temporary character.
 Gandhiji however realized very fully the menace of Japanese competition, and said he would leave no stone unturned to deal with it effectively. The Congress policy was certainly not intended to merely restrict imports from Lancashire, but all imports of foreign cloth, and he would direct particular attention to the growing menace from Japan. If and when a satisfactory settlement was reached, Japanese competition might be dealt with by means of a special tariff. The whole position was one which would have to be seriously considered in the nearest future.

   SPEECH AT WOMEN’S MEETING, BOMBAY  
 June 26, 1931
 Mahatma Gandhi first congratulated the women of India and particularly the women of Bombay for the great and heroic part they had taken in the last fight. They had shown unparalleled courage and their capacity to suffer and make supreme sacrifices in the cause of the country was fully tested. When Gandhiji started on his pilgrimage to Dandilibtech_488_footnotehe had entrusted to the women of India a twofold mission. Firstly the women of India must help the nation to exterminate all foreign cloth and secondly they must help to enforce total prohibition. Gandhiji entrusted this task to the women, having full faith that it would be carried out. What the women had achieved by selfless work and during such a short time was far beyond his most sanguine hopes.
 The women of India, proceeded Gandhiji, had enhanced the prestige of the whole nation. They were the cynosure of all eyes. The whole world looked up to them with admiration for their patriotism. But that was not enough. The praise that was showered on them by the world must encourage them to look forward to their future work with greater faith and zeal.
 They should with more vigour carry out the work entrusted to them during the fight. They should persuade dealers in foreign cloth as well as consumers to shun foreign cloth. They should beg of those who are addicted to drink to give up the vice and they should induce the dealers in liquor to stop the evil traffic. During the last fight men and women volunteered their services for this work but now this task had become more onerous and difficult. There was both laxity in work and lack of workers.
 The need for a regular and disciplined army of workers was therefore all the greater. They should not be disappointed by the results of their efforts. If they had complete faith in their mission and believed that they were going to succeed, it would not only be possible to exterminate foreign cloth from India but also root out the drink evil in a short time. But this kind of work required discipline and united efforts. He noticed among the audience a few women wearing the orange colour saris but a majority of them did not wear this emblem. This colour was symbolic of the dedication of their services in the cause of the country. It also indicated that they were members of the local organization of women which carried out the mission of boycott and prohibition.
 
 My appeal to you women, therefore, is to come out and adopt this symbol of the orange colour sari and join the band of those brave and selfless women whose services are pledged to the country.
 He then sounded a note of warning to such of the women who took to khaddar during the last struggle but were now tempted to go in for foreign fineries. It had been brought to his notice that a few Khojalibtech_489_footnotewomen who had taken part in the movement and had become converts to the gospel of khaddar were now showing an inclination to buy foreign cloth. This was not the case with Khoja women alone but Hindu women also. If they had the slightest regard and pity for the millions of their countrymen who were facing starvation and worse they should cease patronizing foreign cloth.
 They should prefer either khaddar or India-made cloth to the exclusion of all foreign cloth. But he would point out that Indian mill-cloth was meant for those to whom the message of the starving millions had not reached and for such persons who were not of Congress persuasion. But every Congressman and woman and everyone who believed in the Congress creed must adopt khaddar and khaddar alone even to the exclusion of mill-cloth.
 No doubt the use of mill-cloth would benefit a few lakhs of workers living in industrial towns, a few thousands of shareholders and a smaller number of agents and directors. But there were seven lakhs of villages in India and 30 crores of poverty-stricken peasants in them. Should one place the interest of 30 crores of peasants first or a few lakhs of industrial workers ? Their duty should be to relieve the poverty of the 30 crores of peasants by patronizing khaddar and khaddar alone.
 Mahatmaji thought that the best education for girls and women was not the kind of university education that they were getting in schools but that they should be taught thoroughly to master the art of spinning and carding. The message of the charkha must be popularized throughout the length and breadth of the country and women were best fitted for the propagation of this message. If every woman learnt to spin and cultivated the habit of wearing only selfmade khaddar clothes they would go a long way in winning their freedom. [Concluding, Gandhiji said:]
In khaddar alone lies your salvation and in your salvation lies
the salvation of your country.

   SPEECH TO ‘DEPRESSED’ CLASSES DEPUTATIONlibtech_490_footnote  
 BOMBAY,
 June 26, 1931
 Gandhiji said in reply to the address:
Don’t call me a Mahatma, but call me a Bhangi.
 He said that he appreciated the title “Pioneer of Scavengers”, once given to him by a European friend rather than the title “Mahatma”. He promised the deputationists that everything that he would urge at the Round Table Conference would be in the interest of their community and the country in general. He would not promise that the very same formula suggested by the deputation will be placed before the Conference but if a better one suggested itself to him he would give it preference. As regards providing educational facilities to the ‘depressed’ classes, Mahatmaji would like to do much more than was suggested to him.
 But Gandhiji was himself not sure whether the present Settlement with the Government was a temporary settlement or permanent one. If it was a permanent one and swaraj was achieved, then many of the problems concerning the ‘depressed’ classes could be at once tackled. Of this much he was sure, that owing to the great awakening of the people the stigma of untouchability would soon  disappear altogether from the country.
 Mahatmaji wanted to say how much the Congress had been doing for the uplift and general advancement of the ‘depressed’ classes. After the question of untouchability was taken up by the Congress, it had spent more than 20 lakhs of rupees for starting ashrams and schools for ‘depressed’ classes and untouchable classes where free education was imparted. There was a network of ashrams in Gujarat where ‘depressed’ class boys were taught free.

   LETTER TO H. T. SORLEY  
 BORSAD,

 DEAR SIR,
 
 I thank you for your exhaustive letter of 23rd inst. No. 43- 14/30libtech_497_footnote. It will be impossible for me to get hold of the purchaser of the muchwa and induce him to part with the thing he has got admittedly so cheap. The sale of the muchwa being after the Settlement, was clearly in breach of it and was due to the negligence of the official at Surat. The only proper course in my opinion is to pay the owner the market price of the muchwa, which, I understand, is Rs. 200. But I have no evidence in support of my statement beyond the one made by the owner. There should be no difficulty in ascertaining the market price. I hope that the course suggested by me would be adopted without delay. The poor owner naturally has to suffer loss whilst he remains without a muchwa.
 Yours sincerely,

  June 	28, 1931  MY 	DEAR JAWAHARLAL,    	I have your letter and your postcard. I am glad the notice under 	Sec. 144 in Rae Bareli has been withdrawn. It was undoubtedly due to    
 your clear letter to the Chief Secretary. By the  time  you  reach Bombay for the Working Committee, the Committee should be ready to give definite guidance.
 I am quite convinced that in order to complete our case it is necessary for you to ask the Governor to see you. In seeking the interview you will tell him that you want to leave no stone unturned to see that the clear position is placed before the highest authority in the province. You may bring nothing from the Governor but our position will surely be the stronger for your having made the attempt to see him and to secure fulfilment of the Settlement. We shall lose nothing by your offering to see him and seeing him if he accepts the offer.
 You might have seen in Young India what I wrote about the happenings  in  Unao  District.libtech_498_footnoteI  am  going   to   write  again   on   the material supplied by you and others.
 It was unfortunate that the Working Committee had to be postponed. Vallabhbhai was strongly against going to Allahabad in the present circumstances there. I think too that what with Cawnpore and the other excitement in U.P. it was better that Allahabad was avoided for the time being.

 “Never lose heart”libtech_499_footnotemeans that, if we get unhappy experiences in society or do not succeed immediately in our undertakings, we should not give way to despair but should remain cheerful and go on doing our work. This is what is meant by never losing heart.
 By saying you are a member of the Managing Committee, I tried to remind you of your responsibility and your powers You can say in the Committee what you wish to and persuade it to accept your proposal.
 What I expect from you is this. Even if others lose heart, you should not. Swallow all bitter draughts, go ahead and do the work expected of you. This is what I want from you. All my expectations of you concern strength of heart and not intellectual ability. The intellect has less value, the heart has more. And the heart is something which everyone has.
 “Do not try to jump too high”libtech_500_footnotemeans that, instead of planning big things, you should try to improve what we are already doing. If you are impatient to take up new things, the task on hand will suffer. In my thoughts, I am always there. But how can I come away? I must finish the task that has come to me unsought.

    LETTER TO H. W. EMERSON        DEAR 	MR. EMERSON,      BORSAD,  June 	30, 1931 
  	I have your lettcr of 23rd inst. setting forth objections raised 	against the recent resolution of the Working Committee on boycott of 	foreign cloth. I have re-read the resolution in the light of the 	objec- tions raised and I have come to the conclusion that the 	objections are based on an insufficient reading of the resolution 	and ignorance of the previous history of the Congress policy in the 	matter. Long before the civil disobedience campaign and ever since 	the Bengal Partition days, boycott of foreign cloth and especially 	British cloth and general British goods became the policy of the 	Congress. In 1920 boycott of British goods was dropped at my 	instance and replaced by boycott of foreign cloth on predominantly 	economic grounds and ever since it has so remained. Whilst I was in 	Yeravda jail between 1922 and ‘24 a resolution adopting boycott of 	British goods was passed at one of the sessions of the Congress and 	since then, boycott of foreign cloth and boycott of British goods 	have run on parallel lines. During the last struggle these assumed 	an aggressive political character and became practically merged. As 	a result of the Delhi Settlement, boycott of British goods was 	discontinued and the effect of discontinuance was so immediate that 	within a week of the Settlement orders for British 
 machinery and other goods were freely sent. Boycott of foreign cloth however remained not as a political weapon but as an economic necessity. Thus complete prohibition of the sale of foreign cloth as an economic necessity has been the settled Congress policy since 1920. It was torn from its original anti-British setting. A mere pursuit of this policy can in no sense be interpreted to mean interference with the liberty of action of the individual unless the policy was enforced through violent measures. But the history of the methods adopted by the Congress since the Settlement, I think, furnishes sufficient evi- dence to show that both the letter and the spirit of the Settlement have been adhered to in the vast majority of cases by Congress organi- zations and prompt measures have been taken wherever any departure from peaceful methods has been detected.
 Objection has been taken to the use of the word ‘permit’ in the resolution in question. Of course the word has reference only to those who put themselves under Congress discipline and so long as the Congress retains the influence it has over the people, the use of the word ‘permit’ is not only legitimate but necessary if the Congress resolutions are to convey the intention of the authors. So long as the Congress policy remains what it is, it is not open to Congress organi- zations to permit all those under their influence  importation  of  foreign cloth even if individuals desired it.
 As to disciplinary action the words of the resolution are surely quite clear. Disciplinary action contemplated is “against the Commit- tee or the individual as the case may be” and Committee or the indivi- dual means only a Congress Committee or its individual members. That all the obligation that is imposed by the Congress is purely moral and devoid of any violence is abundantly clear from the fact that breaches of pledges given to the Congress continue to be reported, the Congress remaining helpless. At the same time it is to be confessed that in a majority of cases the moral authority of the Congress is felt and accepted by the people.
 Lastly, I entirely endorse your remark that “it is most undesi- rable that there should be any ground for misunderstanding as to the attitude of the Congress in this matter.” And I assure you that mem- bers of the Working Committee are most anxious to avoid any mis- understanding, their desire being, for the good name of the Congress
 if for nothing else, to be meticulous in the performance of all the obligations undertaken on behalf of the Congress in the Delhi Settlement.

 DEAR MR. EMERSON,
 
 I thank you for your letter of 24th inst. intimating the withdra- wal of the salt concession in two areas of the salt range, namely, Nurpur Gorge and Kalabagh.libtech_503_footnotelibtech_504_footnoteI confess that I am taken aback by the news. I think the local officials could have warned the people and waited for the warning to take effect. The withdrawal seems to have been so abrupt and peremptory. I am however myself making enquir- ies in the matter and shall let you know the result. Of course I entirely agree with you that the use of any transport other than human is not to be countenanced.

   LETTER TO H. W. EMERSON  
 BORSAD,
 June 30, 1931
 
 DEAR MR. EMERSON,
 
 This letter is an appeal to you as a Punjabi. There is a prisoner who has served over 19 years’ imprisonment whose name is Pandit Jagat Ramlibtech_507_footnote. My youngest son who was arrested in Delhi as  a  civil resister and sentenced to two years’ imprisonment was in the Gujarat jail in common with several other civil resisters. He tells me that Pandit Jagat Ram is a most inoffensive man, has no anarchical tendencies. His father died on the 22nd inst. His mother and brother died before his father. There is only the widow left. Several representations, I hear, have been made to the Punjab Government. No one knows why Pandit Jagat Ram has not yet been discharged. This case has no connection with the Settlement. I simply bring it to your notice so as to make an appeal to your humanity and to ask you to use your good offices with your friends in the Punjab Government if you think that you could,
 
 without difficulty, use them. I am not worrying you with the details of the case which are well known to the Punjab Secretariat.libtech_508_footnote
 Yours sincerely,
 M. K. GANDHI

    LETTER TO G. FINDLAY SHIRRAS       BORSAD, 
    DEAR 	PRINCIPAL SHIRRAS,  June 	30, 1931 
  	I thank you for your letter of 25th instant, in reply to mine. I 	understand that you have admitted all students but seven. There is 	therefore, I presume, no question of want of accommodation. So far 	as the internal discipline is concerned I suppose that what you 	regard as indiscipline was more or less common to the majority of 	students. But what perhaps you have in mind is that the seven 	students were ring-leaders. I suggest that, if it was right to take 	the other students, it would be wrong to keep out the ring-leaders. 	The Delhi Settlement makes no such distinction between the leaders 	and the rank and file. I would urge you, therefore, to take the 	remaining students and avoid a possible crisis.

  	If I come there I shall tackle all the several matters which you 	mention about Lancashire mills compared to Bombay mills. I may deal 	with portions of your letter in Young India.  	The difficulty about my going to London is still there. To get 	anything done by the Government just now is like drawing a live 	tooth. But bit by bit difficulties are being removed. I believe that 	the Viceroy is sincerely anxious that I should go but I do not think 	he is able to give much relief. 
 Yes, the limit of five articles of food and the taking of meals before sundown applies to India alone. In London, therefore, if the system needs it, I shall be able to take more varied food. But so far as milk is concerned cow’s milk and buffalo’s milk are taboo, and naturally therefore products of these two milks.

 no response from the Bengalees either for khadi or for famine relief? There is something wrong about the method of work here. You should do this work through  Rashtrabanilibtech_518_footnotelibtech_519_footnote. The poison that you see about you will be neutralized only by the most correct conduct on our part. It needs utter selfeffacement. I wanted to talk about all these things to you when we met, but it was no good. Bombay is about the worst place for me to hope to have any quiet chat with anybody. There is an endless stream of visiting friends whom I must not repel. But if you are in any way dejected or despondent you must come to me without fixing the time-limit and hang on till we have, in leisurely fashion, thrashed out every conceivable problem that we could think of.
 It is good that the  Atma Kathalibtech_520_footnoteis in demand. Do you under- stand Gujarati so well as to be able to translate directly from it? If anyhody else asks for permission to translate the Atma Katha, I don’t need to refer him to you. I will flatly refuse permission. I have a vague recollection that Anil Babu of Shantiniketan did get from me the permission years ago.
 I am glad that your weight and strength are increasing. Remem- ber the verselibtech_521_footnoteabout fasting in the verses of the second chapter of the Gita that we sing every evening. Fasting is good enough up to a point. But if we are nervous about our perception of Truth and Ahimsa, the moment we begin to satisfy real hunger, we have reached the danger point, and our ascribing a bettcr perception of Truth and Ahimsa to fasting or semi-fasting may be pure hallucination. Hard work must be consistent with hard and clear thinking. Conversely, hard and clear thinking I hold to be impossible if a person has become physically a perfect wreck. A healthy mind in a healthy body is a correct maxim.

 MY DEAR JAWAHARLAL,
 
 I have your letter of 27th June, redirected from  Bardoli. Possibly you did not know that from Bombay I had come back to Borsad because it has been necessary for Vallabhbhai and me  to divide our work. Danger is being averted by constant presence and vigilance. But any day there might be a burst-up in Borsad. I have had difficult experiences of working settlements in South Africa and even getting the poor head brokenlibtech_522_footnotelibtech_523_footnotein rendering a cent per cent account from our side, and then had to get myself arrested in making the Government render a tolerably good account of themselves. But I thought that I had forgotten all about working settlements. Now, however, I am reviving old memories and many of the experiences are being repeated. My great satisfaction however is that whether war or settlement, the nation must go forward if we remain faithful servers.
 I like all your letters to the Chief Secretary. I do hope that the Governor will consent to see you.
 Here is a complaint against you. Please keep the typewritten sheet and return it to me if you write about it or bring it with you and you will tell me all about it when we meet.

SIMLA,
 April  30, 1931
  You 	will remember that, when I last saw you in Bombay, I promised to 	write to His Excellency Sir Malcolm Hailey with the object of 	arranging for you to have an interview with him. I wrote to him the 	next day and have just received a letter from him. He has been 	unable to reply before, because he has been busy in studying the 	revenue and rent position. He feels that is is no use discussing the 	matter with you until he is fully informed of the facts and is clear 	in his own mind what relief is necessary. In other words, he wants 	to be quite sure that any assurance he may give you will cover the 	case. At present, reports from all districts have not come in; but 	Sir Malcolm Hailey hopes to be fully acquainted with the situation 	within a week and in a position to discuss it. I will let you know 	when I hear further from him.  2. 	I am sorry to see in the papers that you have not been fit, and I 	hope the reports were not true, or, if they were true, that you are 	now alright again.  Yours sincerely,  H. W. EMERSON  M. K.

 APPENDIX II
 NOTE BY H. W. EMERSON ON INTERVIEW BETWEEN HIMSELF AND GANDHIJIlibtech_535_footnote
 Confidential
 I had prolonged discussions with Mr. Gandhi on the 13th, 14th, 15th and 16th of May on matters arising out of the Settlement, also incidentally on general questions.
  The 	first subject of 	importance discussed was 	the situation in 	Gujarat. Particular 	matters raised were the followings : 
  Mr. 	Gandhi said that in 	the Kaira 	District, and 	particularly in 	the Borsad Taluka, 	matters were on the whole 	proceeding very satisfactorily owing to 	the system of 	co-operation between 	himself and Mr. Perry, 	the Collector. 	He said 	that the people 	were paying land revenue as 	quickly as 	they could and 	that he 	was satisfying 	himself by 	personal enquiry into 	cases that 	they were paying as 	much as 	their circumstances 	would permit. He 	was worried about the 	question of 	unauthorized arrears. He 	said that 	it was common ground that those who could pay the current demand and 	arrears should pay; 	but there would be 	undoubtedly numerous 	cases in which 	revenue payers were able 	to pay 	the current ones, but 	would not 	be able 	to pay 	arrears; that what he 	would like 	was a 	declaration of 	announcement from 	the local 	Government of 	a general 	character that in 	such cases the 	arrears would be 	automatically suspended. 	He argued 	that when the 	arrears of 	those who 	had not joined the 	Civil Disobedience 	Movement had 	been suspended and so had become authorized arrears, there was a 	stronger reason for 	suspending the 	arrears of 	those who 	had suffered a 	great deal from the 	Civil Disobedience 	Movement and were, therefore, prima 	facie in a 	 worse  position 	to pay. I 	said that, 	so far 	as I 	understood the 	case, there had 	been no general 	suspension of the 	demand in 	cases of 	those who 	had not joined the 	Civil Disobedience 	Movement, but 	that in 	accordance with the 	ordinary system of 	land revenue 	administration certain 	arrears had been 	suspended where there was sufficient reason. It could not be assumed 	that because people had 	joined in 	the civil 	disobedience movement, 	they were, 	therefore, less 	able to pay 	than people who 	had not joined in 	it. Of 	those who 	had joined 	many had not suffered 	serious loss, a good 	number had suffered 	no loss 	at all, 	and in any case 	the test 	was not the losses 	they had suffered, 	but their 	present capacity to 	pay. I 	did not, therefore, see 	how a general order could 	be issued. 	He then 	said that many 	revenue-payers were 	paying money representing 	the current 	demand and, in 	some cases, also part of 	the arrears, on 	the understanding that 	this represented all that 	they could pay 	at present, and 	that the 	balance of 	the arrears would be 	suspended, that 	Government officers were taking these sums, knowing what the intentions of the 
 
 
 people were and that a very difficult situation would arise if later coercive processes were issued for the balance. I said that it would clearly not be possible  for  Government to accept the position that the tax-payers should determine what amount of Government dues should be paid. He admitted this as a general proposition, but said that where, as at present in Kaira, he himself and other Congress workers in pursuance of the Settlement were satisfying themselves that people were paying as much as they could pay, the position was different, and that they became more or less involved in the transaction. I suggested to him that all Congress workers in Gujarat were inspired by the same honesty of purpose as he himself, and that for this reason also the Collector had to satisfy himself that there was a case for suspension, that my information was that in some parts of Gujarat revenue payers were being encouraged not to pay unauthorized arrears, although many of them were able to do so. I assumed generally that neither the local Government nor the local officers desire to squeeze money out of persons who could not pay and that it really resolved itself into a question of good faith. If the Congress and the people genuinely played up and paid all they could pay, then I imagined nobody would wish to resort to  coercive  processes. If, on the other hand, they did not play up, I did not see how coercive processes would be avoided. At any rate it was not necessary to take this particular fence at the present time, and it would be sufficient to consider any difficulty, if and when it arises.
 My general impression about this part of the conversation was that Mr. Gandhi foresees trouble in regard to the collection of unauthorized arrears, and that while he is playing the game in Borsad, attempts are being made elsewhere to defer the payment of unauthorized arrears on a large scale under the cover of inability to pay. The nature of the difficulty that is likely to arise will depend on the extent to which this movement succeeds, but if complications are to be avoided, it will probably be necessary for the local officers not to press collection of unauthorized arrears in cases where there will be real difficulty in paying.
  We 	had a 	long talk about 	the reinstatement 	of village 	officials. Mr. 	Gandhi made the 	point that no 	new Patels 	had been 	appointed permanently in 	the sense 	that they had been 	appointed for life 	and that 	the appointments 	were for a 	term of 	years, e.g., 3, 	5, or 10 years, and 	that even these were 	subject to further 	notice. He contended 	that such appointments 	could not 	be treated 	as permanent 	and that 	they were 	not, therefore, completely protected under para 19 	of the Statement of 	the 5th of March. 	I told 	him that 	I understood 	that this particular 	system of 	appointment was 	usual and 	that it 	was not the practice in 	Gujarat even if 	normal times to 	appoint Patels 	permanently in 	the sense 	in which 	he used 	the word. The 	local Government take 	the view 	that “permanently” 	means substantively and 	that this was at least 	a reasonable 	interpretation. Personally I 	did not press this, 	because I 	knew that when this 	clause was under discussion in New Delhi, neither Lord Irwin nor Mr. Gandhi was aware of 
 the fact that the appointments made had been of this character, and the impression was that they were either of a permanent or purely temporary character. The actual wording of the clause did not, however, affect the broad principle which underlay this and similar provisions. That principle was that where third party rights had been created, the local Government were under an obligation to protect the rights and this principle obviously applied to appointments for a term of years. It might  be contended that when the third party rights so created had been satisfied, then effect should be given to the Settlement and return should be made to the status quo ante; instance at the end of an appointment of three years the claims of the original holder,  if in the meantime there was no cause of disqualification against him, might be given preferential treatment. This seemed to be a view of the case which the local Government might be inclined to take, but I could not commit them in any way. Mr. Gandhi was not very satisfied with this, but felt, I think, that he was not in a strong position.
 He then pursued another line, namely, that it was generally recognized that the new men who had been put in were unable to carry on the work, that in many cases they were criminals or of bad character, that in fact they were unable to collect the land revenue and it was the resigned Patel who had been doing this work; that there could be no peace in a village where a new Patel had been appointed until he was removed from it; and that in the interest of good administration a remedy should be found either by compensating the new Patels or by finding them jobs elsewhere. I said that, so far as I knew, the local officers were quite prepared to enquire into bonafide complaints against particular Patels, but they of course had to protect them against frivolous complaints; that the third  party right in such cases was the right to   a particular appointment; and that com- pensation would not be regarded by the Patels themselves as a satisfaction of those rights. Something might perhaps be done to ease what was admittedly a difficult problem by putting in Patels who had resigned in vacancies elsewhere as they occur; but I did not know whether this was, in fact, practicable. This question evidently is also causing him a good deal of concern.
  In 	regard to 	the repurchase of 	lands that had 	been sold, he 	appeared to 	be fairly 	happy. He was 	very critical of 	the difficulties 	experienced in 	ascertaining what 	lands had been sold and 	at what 	price; but 	he admitted 	that the present 	arrangement under 	which the entries 	relating to all 	such transactions have 	been or will 	shortly be 	entered up in the 	village registers, to 	which the public 	have access, 	would meet the 	requirements of the 	case. He 	said that he 	was having 	more success in 	getting back 	lands from Dharalas than 	he had anticipated, 	and in fact 	he was getting 	on better 	with them 	than with others in 	regard to 	whom he 	had not expected 	so much 	difficulty. I 	asked him 	why Garda had 	repudiated his 	transaction. He 	would not 	admit that Garda 	had any reasonable 	cause for complaint 	against the Congress 	for any deviation 	from their 	side of 	the bargain 	and said 	he was in correspondence 	with Sir Cowasjee 
 
 Jehangir.
 He said that in some cases in the Kaira District land had been forfeited for arrears of land revenue, had then been declared to be Government property and had been sold, that none of the sale price had been credited to the account of the defaulter, and that, in fact, the amount in regard to which the land had been forfeited was still being demanded. I expressed doubts about this, although I did understand that where land had been forfeited the whole of the sale price had been credited to Government, even although this exceeded the amount of the demand. I gathered that the Collector of Kaira had referred this question to the local Government and they will doubtless consider, if cases, such as stated by mr. Gandhi, have actually occurred, whether the collection of the demand in addition to forfeiture of the land is not unduly severe.
 On the whole Mr. Gandhi was more happy about Gujarat than he was when I last saw him, and the situation there has undoubtedly improved. He himself appears to have worked very hard to get things cleared up, but there appear to be several troublesome matters ahead and these may create difficulties, especially where Gandhi has not tried his hand and Vallabhbhai’s influence has been at work.
 I may observe that during the course of the discussion about Gujarat and also on one or two other occasions Mr. Gandhi dropped the claim, if he ever seriously entertained it, that Congress should be recognized as an intermediary between Government and the people, although he did claim, and not without reason, that where, as in the case of Kaira, the local officers are co-operating with himself and other workers, action should be avoided which will embarrass him and his helpers, unless it is clear that they are not playing the game. I tackled him about the statements attributed to him in the Press that he had advised revenue payers not to pay land revenue if they had to borrow to do so on interest. I told him that this was a principle that Govern- ment could not accept, that it was a well-known fact that revenue payers had often to borrow money in order to meet their revenue demands, and that if I had credit at the Bank, my creditors would not let me off, because I had no ready cash. He admitted that in ordinary circumstances his advice was not justifiable, but on the merits of this particular case he eliminated further argument by saying that in Kaira, where the advice was given, the Collector had accepted the principle as a working basis.
  We 	then had 	some discussion 	about salt, which was 	resumed later in 	connection with 	a reference 	from the 	Central Board 	of Revenue. 	The main 	points, which 	were raised, were the following : 
  Mr. 	Gandhi is anxious that 	Government should 	issue some communication 	amplifying the relevant 	clause of the 	Statement of 	March 5th, so 	that persons entitled to 	the concession 	will know more about 	its character. 	I showed 	him the lengthy and detailed circulars issued by the Central Board of Revenue for various 
 areas, and explained to him, what I understand to be the view of the Central Board of Revenue, namely, that while these were necessary for departmental guidance, they were too complicated to be of real assistance to the public, that in fact specific difficulties were still continually cropping up, that these were being dealt with ad hoc in a liberal and practical spirit, and that until the various points had been settled the publication of a detailed statement would in any case be premature. Moreover, anything in the nature of a lengthy statement would probably give rise to questions of hypothetical character, which it was better not to raise. Mr. Gandhi accepted all this and said that he had not intended anything in the nature of a long statement, but that he felt it very desirable that the main principles should be published. I suggested that he should try his hand on a draft and Government would then see whether it could  be accepted by them with such modifications as might be necessary. He promised to let me have one.
  He 	then got 	on to the question of 	the fish-curing industry. 	I told 	him that 	  I understood 	that this matter was 	already under 	consideration by the 	Central Board of 	Revenue, who 	had addressed the 	Madras Government. 	Briefly the points 	which he made 	were the followings :— 
  Fishermen 	along the East and West 	Coast already enjoy the 	concession of 	duty free salt.  On 	the West 	Coast, where fish curing is 	carried on 	by contractors in 	special yards, salt has 	to be purchased from 	Government. Mr. Gandhi 	agreed that this was 	quite right and 	that the 	salt concession should 	not be 	extended to 	the fish-curing 	industry when the curing is done on a big scale by contractors.  He 	said, however, that 	even on the 	West Coast there 	was a certain amount 	of curing 	done by 	fishermen in 	their own homes, 	that it 	was carried 	on as a 	domestic and 	not as a 	big scale 	industry, and 	that it was 	reasonable to 	allow the 	concession in 	such cases. 
 I declined to express any opinion in ignorance of the facts, but promised to let the C.B.R. know the gist of the Conversation.
  I 	then mentioned 	to him 	the case reported 	by the 	Collector of 	Salt Revenue, Bombay, in 	which it 	was said that Congress 	workers were making 	salt in 	works situated on 	privately owned land at 	Shiroda, that there was 	a fairly 	large force of 	labour employed, and 	that a 	stock of 	salt of 	500 to 	600 maunds 	was being collected. 	We were 	agreed that 	the salt concession did 	not anticipate that 	Congress would 	come in as an 	organization engaged in 	the manufacture of 	salt, and 	he admitted that an 	impossible situation 	would arise if local 	Congress organizations as 	such took 	up the 	manufacture of 	salt even for the purpose 	included in the 	Settlement. He 	also admitted 	that if salt 	is being 	manufactured at Shiroda 	by paid 	labour, then this is not 	covered by 	the Settlement, but 	he claimed that if 	the villagers entitled 	to the 
 concession had combined for the manufacture of salt and were making it themselves and not through paid labour, then the case was covered by the Settlement provided the relevant provisions of the Settlement were observed. He also claimed that the mere manufacture of a stock of 500 or 600 maunds did not necessarily constitute a breach, since it was natural that the people concerned should manufacture a sufficient quantity   of salt to see them over the close period. He claimed to be acquainted with the facts of the manufacture at Shiroda, and the C.B.R. may find it necessary to collect further information in regard to them before they can reach a decision. If it is decided that the facts do not preclude this system of manufacture, then a practical solution may be to limit the quantity of salt to be manufactured in accordance with an estimate of local requirements.
  Mr. 	Gandhi agreed that 	the practical test 	of removal 	on foot 	should not 	include the removal of manufactured salt by gangs of coolies. 
  Mr. 	Gandhi then mentioned 	the matter 	of releases 	of prisoners, 	about which 	we had 	a general 	and somewhat 	infructuous talk. He 	still seems to 	think that 	there are 	cases which come 	within the 	amnesty in 	which releases have 	not been granted, 	and he 	promised to 	let me 	have lists of 	these. I 	told him 	that we 	had sent 	the previous 	lists to local 	Governments, and the 	replies we 	had so 	far received 	definitely indicated that 	local Governments had 	very scrupulously 	honoured the Settlement 	in this respect. 	I mentioned 	the case 	of the 	Punjab list in 	which, for 	lack of 	accurate information, 	the local 	Government had been 	unable to identify 	a number 	of prisoners 	mentioned, and of the 75 	who had been identified 47 had been released before the list was 	sent. This 	went to show 	that the information 	supplied to 	Mr. Gandhi was inaccurate. 	I also 	reminded him that 	local Governments generally have interpreted the 	Settlement very 	liberally in 	cases of 	technical violence and 	that while they have 	been more strict in 	cases of 	incitement to 	violence, there are 	good reasons for 	this. I 	took the 	opportunity of 	reminding him 	that within the 	last three weeks there 	have been 	three incidents connected 	with the 	terrorist movement in 	the Punjab 	alone, namely, 	the Shalimar 	affair, the Sialkot 	incident and the very 	recent bomb explosion in 	the Jullundur District. 	He had not heard 	of the last 	and was shocked 	to hear 	that the two 	persons concerned were 	connected with 	the Congress. He 	agreed that local 	Governments were 	justified in taking 	a serious 	view of incitement 	to violence, 	and he 	did not attempt 	to raise 	the question 	of cases 	under section 124 A., 	I.P.C., and 	section 108, 	Criminal Procedure Code, 	which at one time 	threatened to be a matter of controversy. 	Two cases 	appeared to be worrying 	him. One was the case 	of an editorlibtech_536_footnote convicted in 	Sholapur, in 	regard to 	which he 	urges that there was 	neither violence nor 	incitement to violence, 	and the second 	case was one from 	the Surat 	District, where a youth had been convicted for arson. His crop had been attached, and he then set fire to 
 
 it. Mr. Gandhi then attempted to argue that violence within the terms  of  the  Settlement had reference only to violence to person and that, therefore, this particular incident was not violence. This of course could not be accepted. I understood that he was in correspondence in regard to both cases with the local Government.
 He wanted to know what was to happen if there were a deadlock between Congress and the local Government in regard to particular cases. I said that the intention was that the local Government should be the final authority, that so far no such case has arisen, and we might wait and see. The Government of India had in the case of several representations made to them requested local Governments to inform them of the facts, and since neither the Government of India nor any  local Government has any desire to evade the obligations of the Settlement, there is no reason to suppose that a solution will not be found if there is any particular case in which there has been a genuine mistake. I informed him that local Governments had attached very great importance to this part of the Settlement and that in some province the Governor had himself scrutinized all doubtful cases. I imagine that Mr. Gandhi is being given a good deal of trouble by provincial Congressmen in this matter.
  We 	then had 	a humorous 	discussion about bicycles 	and a motor-car 	which led up to the case 	of the Young India Press. 
 Under clause 16 of the Statement Government have agreed to return movable property, not being an illegal possession, which was seized during the civil disobedience movement and which at the time of the Settlement was still in the possession of Government. A motor-car was seized in the Kaira District and was quite properly used for official purposes. It is now, I gathered, in a somewhat dilapidated condition and is out of action at some distance from its original home. Mr. Gandhi claims that it should be returned at the place where it was seized. The local officers will not admit this, and I gather that they cannot, in any case, return it there, either by putting it into running condition or transporting it as scrap iron. This led us on to what was the real purport of the matter, namely, the Press of Young India. This was seized in Ahmedabad under the Press Ordinance and is of considerable value. Part of it   is still in Ahmedabad, while part of it was sent to Bombay for sale. Mr. Gandhi claims as a right that he is entitled to its delivery at Ahmedabad, and he has recently addressed the Bombay Government on the subject. He made it clear that he did not want the Bombay portion of the press returned to him at Ahmedabad as a matter of grace, if he was not entitled to this under the Settlement. I promised that we would look into the legal aspect of the case, and if necessary, address  the  local Government.libtech_537_footnoteHe on his part promised that if the decision is in his favour he will not use it for vexatious purposes, e.g., the return of a useless motor-car.
 
  Under 	the same 	clause of the 	Settlement he 	raised the 	question of 	the return 	of arms, 	the licences 	of which 	had been 	cancelled in connection 	with the Civil 	Disobedience Movement. He 	had mentioned 	this before 	at previous 	talks, but I 	had not 	appreciated the 	fact that the claim was under the clause, 	and had imagined 	that what 	he desired 	was a 	more liberal 	policy within the 	spirit of 	the Settlement 	in re- 	granting licences when 	previous ones had been 	cancelled. I told 	him that, 	so far as the 	clause was 	concerned it 	seemed to 	me that as 	soon as 	an arms’ licence was 	cancelled, the 	arm became an 	illegal possession and 	that, therefore, the 	case was 	not covered. In 	any case, 	even if the clause did 	technically apply, 	 local Governments  would 	obviously be 	unwilling to 	return arms 	where there was 	reason to 	suppose that 	these arms 	might be used 	for terrorist 	purposes, and this 	applied particularly to 	the Punjab 	and Bangal. 	Mr. Gandhi 	accepted this as 	reasonable and 	said that a way 	out of the 	difficulty might be 	found by 	formally returning the 	arms, cancelling the 	new licences and 	recovering them. 	I suggested 	that this would lead to 	a good 	deal of friction. 	I promised 	to have 	the legal 	aspect examined. 
 I explained that if the matter did not come within the scope of the Settlement, there were difficulties in addressing local Governments in regard to the re-grant of licences, that the Arms Rules gave wide discretionary powers to District Magistrates in regard to the grant and cancellation of licences, and that while it did not seem improvable that they would take a reasonable view in the case of licences cancelled during the civil disobedience movement when the licensees  were  responsible persons, they would be sticky before giving licences to persons about whom they were not satisfied.
  He 	then mentioned 	the case of 	restoration of 	pensions forfeited during 	the Civil 	Disobdience Movement. I 	said that this had not 	been discussed with 	local Governments; 	previous to the 	Settlement and 	that they and 	the Army Department in 	the case 	of military 	pensions would certainly take strong exception to 	the restoration 	of military and 	police pensions, 	and that, 	this being so, it 	would be 	difficult for 	them to 	discriminate in 	favour of 	other civil pensions. 	Local Governments 	would, however, 	doubtless consider in the 	ordinary course of 	business any 	applications made to them, 	but I 	did not see how the 	Government of 	India could make 	any general suggestion 	to them 	on this 	matter. Mr. 	Gandhi recognized the 	difficulty of 	restoring military and police pensions and did not press the matter.  Mr. 	Gandhi mentioned 	the case 	of boys 	and students 	who had been 	expelled from 	educational institutions 	on account of 	participation in 	the Civil Disobedience 	Movement. He said 	that in several 	provinces they were being 	allowed to 	return only 	on condition 	that they gave a 	declaration that 	they would take 	no part 	in politics. He 	seemed to 	think this 	was wrong. 	I explained 	to him 	that in 	some Government’s 	institutions in the 	Pubjab (and probably 	else-where) such declarations 	were taken from students on first entry—let alone from students who were allowed re- 
 admission after expulsion; that the latter were fortunate to be allowed to return and knowing the importance that local Government rightly attached to discipline in schools and colleges. I saw no point in raising this matter with them, even if the Government of India were prepared to take a more lenient view which I did not think they would.
  We 	next got 	on to the 	important question of 	the North-West 	Frontier Province. 	I had 	a preliminary 	talk with hin on 	one matter, 	giving him the main facts 	as known 	to us, and Mr. Howell 	later joined us and 	explained the 	peculiar difficulties of the 	Frontier situation. 	The points 	on which 	I laid 	emphasis in 	the preliminary 	discussion were : 
 Abdul 	Ghaffar’s activities and 	speeches since the amnesty.  His 	continued insistence on 	the Settlement 	being a truce 	and therefore 	a period 	of preparation.  The 	continuous recruitment of 	Red Shirts, 	their organization, 	drilling, etc. Abdul Ghaffar’s attempt to spread agitation across the border.  His 	deliberate and 	discourteous refusal to 	see the Chief 	Commissioner or local officials.  The 	encouragement he 	has given 	to the 	non-payment of 	land revenue and 	the consequent 	effects on the land 	revenue administration of 	the Peshawar District. The 	increase in crime that has occurred there. 
 I suggested to Mr. Gandhi that even in other provinces where we might tolerate and had, in fact, tolerated in the past the recruitment of Congress volunteers up to a certain point, we could not even in those provinces tolerate either the unlimited recruitment of volunteers or the establishment of bodies of trained volunteers. The fact that their immediate activities were comparatively harmless was not a decisive test. We had to look to the use to which they might be put, and if at any time we came to the conclusion that they constituted a serious menace to future peace, we might have to take action. At any rate, we obviously could not accept the argument that because we do not think it necessary at present to take action against Congress volunteers in a particular province, therefore our hands are tied either in regard to volunteers generally or in regard to volunteers in places where they do constitute a menace; nor, having regard to the peculiar conditions in the North-West Frontier Province the obvious danger of the Red Shirt Movement  being misunderstood in tribal territory and its possible effects in Afghanistan, could we regard its extension with equanimity. Mr. Gandhi appreciated these  peculiar difficulties, but was inclined to attach weight to Abdul Ghaffar’s own statement of the case, which appeared in the Press a few days ago and in which he naturally attempted
 to place the odium on the local administration.
 The further discussion of the matter is given in Mr. Howell’s note below :
 “By arrangement with Mr. Emerson I went yesterday afternoon to interview Mr. Gandhi. Before I arrived Mr. Emerson had already dissuaded Mr. Gandhi from his intention of visiting the North-West Frontier Province and had secured from him a promise to get into touch either personally or by letter with Abdul Ghaffar Khan and induce the latter at least to examine and reconsider his methods if not to abandon, at any rate temporarily, his campaign. There was therefore very little for me to do except to go over the ground again, and this I did with the special idea of impressing upon Mr. Gandhi the dangers of Abdul Ghaffar Khan’s programme in the Frontier Province. The gist of what Mr. Emerson and I said to him in the course of the interview was as follows :
 We had no intention of questioning Abdul Ghaffar Khan’s sincerity, but we did think the wisdom of his procedure open to question. Why for instance had he steadily refused to have an interview with the Chief Commissioner who had shown exemplary patience and had done his best to get into contact with him? If they were bound to fall out at a later stage, was that any reason for not walking together so far as their ways lay together? Again was it wise to stage an exciting drama in the presence of an exceedingly excitable audience, such as the frontier tribes, all of them well armed, and many of them only waiting for a favourable opportunity to go and loot the box office? If Mr. Gandhi thought this was prudent, let him listen to what Bhai Parmanand and other Frontier Hindus, who had reason to know what they were talking about, had recently been saying at Lahore. The basic fact of the situation was that, as these frontier Hindus realize, security for life and property on the Frontier, especially Hindu life and property, and the whole stability of society depended on the maintenance of respect for the existing Government. And if the Frontier tribes, who were never tired of proclaiming themselves to be as good as or better than anybody else, saw Abdul Ghaffar Khan here, or X there, or Y in another place successfully defying Government, they too might be tempted to take a hand in the same game. Hence the paramount importance of preventing the Red Shirts Movement from being spread across the border. Once there it could not fail to take on a militant form and, as last summer in Waziristan, might assume the appearance of a pro-Amanullah campaign which would cause anxiety to King Nadir.
 Throughout stress was laid not on the contention that tribal territory was beyond the scope of the Civil Disobedience Movement, since that is dead or at any rate dormant, or of the Irwin-Gandhi Pact, since that might give Mr. Gandhi a clue that in the event of a further struggle he would do well to make a point of extending activities into tribal territory, that being a weak spot on our side, but on the danger, especially the danger to Hindu life and property, to which opposition to Government
 in the Frontier region was likely to lead. He was asked whether in his opinion it was wise for anyone conducting a difficult and an unprecedented experiment, such as is now in progress throughout India, to begin by tampering with the breakwater which keeps the flood waters out. Mr. Gandhi seemed to grasp the point of this question.
 We also put Sir Steuart Pears’ remaining points to Mr. Gandhi, and asked him to consider whether there really could be any use for such a body of men as 13,000, the latest figure we had had—admittedly only an estimate— of the number of Red Shirts. Finally the revenue situation, with special reference to Peshawar District, was discussed at some length, and Mr. Gandhi was informed of the startling rise in the figures of crime. He wished to know how land and water rates compared in Peshawar with the adjoining districts in the Punjab and seemed surprised to learn that, while agricultural conditions in the irrigated area of the Peshawar District  generally compared favourably with anything in northern India, rates of land revenue and water rates were distinctly lower than in the adjoining districts of the Punjab. This Mr. Gandhi’s interlocutors thought might be taken as fair evidence of the constant Pathan tendency to have things both ways at which the Pathan is an adept and frequently successful. Mr. Gandhi took note of this and also of the fact that liberal remissions had been, were being and would be granted according to the necessities of the case. He seemed disposed to agree that whatever the land revenue policy of the future Government might be, it was perhaps bad tactics to interfere too much with revenue collection under the existing regime. On Mr. Gandhi’s side a promise was given that he would send for Abdul Ghaffar Khan as soon as possible, and in the meantime would both telegraph and write to him.”
  We 	had some talk about 	the boycott 	and the attitude 	of Lancashire. 	Mr. Gandhi 	was more sorrowful 	than resentful 	about the latter. He 	claimed that the 	Settlement had 	produced a 	great change in 	the position 	regarding the 	boycott of 	foreign cloth, 	that there 	had been a very large reduction in picketing, 	that discrimination 	against British cloth had 	ceased and 	that while there were 	still causes of 	complaint these should be 	regarded in 	the light 	of the 	situation as 	a whole and 	not advanced as 	though they 	represented the 	general position. He 	claimed (and 	I believe rightly) 	that he was 	doing his 	utmost to 	secure the 	strict observance of 	the Settlement 	and he asked that any breaches of it should be at once brought to his notice. 
 I admitted the truth of a great deal of what he said; but gave him a number of illustrations of the sort of thing that was going on, and in particular, dwelt on the prevalence of social pressure. I said that the general impression was that freedom of action of the individual has not been secured and that it was this belief that was responsible for reactions in Lancashire, which were of  first-class political importance in England. I emphasized the harm that was being done by every instance of violation of the Settlement that was communicated to the British Press and I dwelt
 
 at length on a particular case that had come to the notice of Government. This case is briefly as follows :
 “The British Goods Boycott Committee of Ahmedabad sent a letter, dated the 7th of April 1931, to the Cawnpore Chemical Works, Cawnpore, asking them various questions, among which were the following :
 Do you use any British materials in the process of manufacture?  Has 	any Englishman or 	foreigner any 	interest whatever, either 	direct or indirect, in your concern? If so, what is the extent of such interest? 
 Mr. Gavin Jones is very closely interested in this concern and sent the letter on to us. We had enquiries made about it and were informed that the active workers on the Committee were members of the Congress. After the Settlement the Committee changed its name, but apparently sent out notices on the note paper with the old heading and also included in their questions matters which directly offended against the Settlement.”
 I told Mr. Gandhi that in this particular case the attack was on the concern of an Englishman, who was a member of the Round Table Conference Delegation and who had strongly supported the Indian case in London. It would hardly be a matter of surprise if activities of this kind were to make Europpeans doubtful of their previous attitude and that if this particular instance were communicated to the British Press or raised in Parliament, it could not fail to have very unfortunate results. Mr. Gandhi admitted all this and expressed regret that the matter had not been brought to his notice even once. I said that we could not do this until we knew that Congress were concerned in it and we had just received this information. I promised to let him have a copy of the relevant correspondence, and he said he would have the matter put right at once and let me know the results in a letter which Government could, if they thought  it desirable, communicate to Mr. Gavin Jones.
 Mr. Gandhi is, I think, uneasy about the fulfilment of the boycott provi- sions of the Settlement, and while he is as keen as ever on the replacement of Indian for foreign cloth and is convinced that the movement has come to stay, he realizes that methods of coercion and pressure will not succeed in the long run and that any abuse of the Settlement has adverse effects in India and in England  out of proportion  to the benefit to the movement itself. He has, however, still to get his own  principles across to Congress organizations and workers as a whole and although he has done a good deal in this direction, there is still much more to do. It will help if local Government either directly tackle provincial Congress organizations in regard to violation of the Settlement in this respect or communicate at once specific instances to the Home Department to pass them on to Mr. Gandhi.
  During 	the course 	of our 	talk with Mr. Gandhi a 	number of general 	questions were 	incidentally discussed, and 	one sitting was 	almost entirely devoted 	to big issues. An attempt is made below to summarize the points which arose. 
 Mr. Gandhi appears to have little hope at present of an early communal settlement and realizes the bitterness of feeling. He expressed himself as reluctant to go to England unless a solution is reached, for he would then feel that he could not either with decency or consistency press for self-government when Indians them- selves were at sixes and sevens. He is also sensitive as to taunts being made in this respect. I took the following line with him :
  If 	there were 	no communal 	settlement in India, 	then the logical 	conclu- sion 	of Mr. Gandhi to this would be that unless and until there were a 	settlement, there could be no further advance in the constitutional 	field. Even if Mr. Gandhi himself felt this, 	it was 	not possible for 	Government to 	accept it. 	Government had 	often been 	accused of 	Machiavellian methods, 	and if 	it adopted the 	line taken by 	Mr. Gandhi 	himself, there would be 	an immediate outcry 	accompanied by political 	agitation on an 	intense scale. This must, 	therefore, be 	ruled out, and Government 	must assume 	constitutional advance, 	even if 	no agreed communal 	settlement were reached. 	Why should 	Mr. Gandhi 	take in 	this matter 	a more 	reactionary attitude than 	Government were 	prepared to take? 	Moreover, even if a 	settlement were not 	reached in 	India, this 	did not necessarily 	mean that one would 	not be 	reached in 	England. Conditions were 	in some respects 	more favourable there 	than here 	:  representations  of 	 various interests 	would be 	in constant touch 	with each other; atmosphere 	would be 	better; British 	leaders were prepared 	to give 	the greatest assistance 	possible and in 	fact an 	agreement had 	almost been 	reached in 	London on 	the last occasion. 	Moreover, Lord Irwin 	would be certainly 	ready to 	help. (Here at 	this point 	Mr. Gandhi 	made the 	suggestion that 	Lord Irwin might even act 	as an arbitrator—an 	admission entirely 	contrary to 	some of 	his previous 	declarations that 	Indians should 	settle among 	themselves.) A 	settlement in 	London was 	more likely to 	be secured if 	Congress were 	represented and 	Mr. Gandhi himself might 	be expected 	to play 	a considerable 	part in it. In 	any case, 	he would 	not help 	by staying 	in India 	and, so far 	as the 	communal question was concerned, his clear duty was to go to England. 
 I asked him what his friends thought about this matter, and I understood that while two or three Congressites doubted, the mjority considered that he ought to go. Mr. Gandhi did not commit himself to any clear decision as to whether he would go or not, but my own very definite impression is that the failure of a communal settlement will not in itself prevent his attendance.
  I 	asked him 	what he was 	going to 	do about Congress 	representatives at the 	Conference and 	suggested that even if 	he went as 	the sole 	representative it would 	be convenient 	to have 	available Congress 	representatives who could 	be appointed 	to Sub-Committees, 	since even a Mahatma 	could not be 	in three places at 	once. He 	was very 	vague about this part of 	the business and 	confessed that he 	had been so 	occupied in local affairs in Gujarat that he had not had time to give consideration to the Round 
 
 Table Conference arrangements. The impression he gave was that he was very reluctant to have anyone else as representing Congress in the picture and that he has an idea that he can carry on alone coming in with his views at the final stage. He obviously does not realize the amount of detailed discussion involved and the nature and extent of the difficulties. On the other hand, he has no objection to Congressmen being invited in their individual capacity to the Round Table Conference.  I specifically asked him this on a point raised by His Excellency when I last saw him. In fact, he says that Lord Irwin had accepted this position and accordingly had invited Malaviya, and he had indicated his intentions of also asking Mrs.Naidu and Dr. Ansari. There would thus be, from Mr. Gandhi’s point of view, no objection in inviting Congress Muslims as such, or indeed in inviting any Congress member in any capacity other than as representative of Congress. This may assist in removing difficulties which will almost certainly arise if Mr. Gandhi insists on being the sole representative of the Congress.
  Another 	constitutional matter that 	Congress are 	now taking up 	is as to whether— 
  they 	should serve on 	Sub-Committee formed 	previous to the Round 	Table Conference, and whether 	they should give evidence before such Committee. 
 I fancy this question was brought to a head by the resignation of AhmadShah from the North-West Frontier Provinces Subjects Committee. Mr. Gandhi knew nothing about his appointment or his resignation, and the latter was not, I think, given under the orders of the Congress. It was probably given under the orders of Abdul Ghaffar, and I gathered that Mr. Gandhi thought that Ahmad Shah should have referred both his acceptance of the appointment and his resignation to the Congress. He agreed that the case had not been in any way prejudged and that Ahmed Shah was wrong in making this the ground for his resignation, but he did not think that anything could now be done to put this right, although I gave him the opportunity of suggesting a successor. In these circumstances he agreed that the best thing was to leave the place vacant.
 On the general question the Working Committee are  to  hold  a  meeting shortly. I very strongly urged that the decision should be in favour of co-opera- tion both as regards accepting places and giving evidence, and I said on my own authority that I thought there would be no difficulty, if the principle were accepted, in asking Congress to nominate members to Committees where the principle of Congress representation was accepted by Government. Mr. Gandhi’s doubt seemed to be as to whether it was right to take part in Committees previous to the Round Table Conference when he had not made up his mind about attendance at the Conference himself. I pointed out that whatever might be his final decision in regard to London,
 one important and main object of the Settlement would be defeated if Congress did  not co-operate in constitutional matters, and that, even if for any reason the Settle- ment broke down, their present participation would not commit them. I am rather afraid that the Working Committee will come to a wrong decision in this matter.
  The 	question of 	land revenue cropped up 	in several connection, 	e.g., Gujarat, 	U.P. and North-West 	Frontier Province. Mr. 	Gandhi did 	not attempt to 	press the 	idea formerly favoured by him that 	Congress should 	act generally as 	an intermediary between 	Government and the 	revenue payer, but 	he still 	seems to think 	that it 	is possible for 	Congress to 	act as the friend of 	the landlord or 	tenant and 	advise him 	on revenue 	and rent matters 	without coming into 	conflict with 	Government or 	without causing serious 	embarrassment. He was 	impressed by 	the attitude 	I took 	on the 	matter. I 	told him that there 	was no 	Government in 	the world 	that would 	allow a political 	organization to 	come between them and the tax-payer, 	when their 	intervention took 	the form of advice 	to the 	latter as 	to what taxes they should 	pay; that 	if this 	was tried 	in Afghanistan, 	the agitator 	would be quickly 	put against 	the wall 	and blown 	from the 	cannon; that 	in the 	Indian States he 	would be deported or imprisoned; 	and that 	in the most 	advanced European countries the 	whole resources of 	the Government would be 	used against an organized movement of this kind carried out 	by a powerful 	political party. In India 	it was 	particularly necessary 	that agitation 	of this 	kind should be avoided 	and the more 	so in existing 	economic conditions and 	immediately after a 	direct campaign against rent and revenue. I made it quite clear that 	personally I 	regarded activities, such 	as those 	in the U.P. 	as a very 	grave breach of the 	whole spirit of the 	Settlement. I 	explained that local 	Governments were fully alive to 	the gravity 	of the 	economic situation and 	the necessity of 	being lenient in 	land revenue 	policy. Even so 	they had 	a very 	difficult task 	in deciding 	what the 	people could 	pay and could not 	pay, and this 	task could 	only be 	complicated by the 	interference of 	Congress, one 	result of 	which was 	to introduce the 	doubt as 	to whether a person 	was refusing 	to pay 	land revenue because he 	genuinely could 	not pay or 	because Congress advice 	had induced 	him to 	try and get off without 	payment. Mr. Gandhi was 	not able to accept 	the idea of 	Congress standing aside 	from helping 	persons in 	distress; but 	he did, 	I think, 	realize some of 	the difficulties 	in the 	way of intervention, 	and so 	far as 	he himself is 	concerned, he 	is worried less 	by the 	thought that inaction will remove the 	great opportunity of 	getting at 	the rural 	masses than by the 	failure to 	do something for 	the oppressed. We 	have here a 	definite potential 	source of 	trouble. On 	the other 	hand, he had 	no hesitation 	in condemning 	pressure being 	brought on landlords, 	direct appeals not to 	pay, creating false 	expectations on the 	Congress creed of 	a 50 per cent 	reduction in revenue 	and generally 	of any 	refusal to 	pay less 	than a person’s 	capacity to pay. 	The results 	of his 	forthcoming discussion 	with Sir Malcolm Hailey ought to clear up the position in this respect. I attempted to give Mr. Gandhi an appreciation of the present situation 
 in the various provinces and made special reference to the North-West Frontier Provinces, Punjab, United Provinces, Bihar and Orissa and Bengal. I emphasized the fact that some of the local Governments who had been satisfied with the early results of the Settlement were getting apprehensive because of Congress activities. I pointed out that difficulties were almost unprecedented—Constitutional, political, Commu- nal, financial, agrarian and terrorist—that we had a good chance of surmounting them  if everyone pulled together, but that otherwise the prospects were gloomy. I said it was the deliberate and definite policy of the Government of India to implement the Settlement and to make every effort within reason to prevent a break-down. There were no reactionary forces at work in this respect. At the same time, they had necessarily to exercise constant vigilance and they could not allow a situation of danger to develop either generally or locally, even if action meant the disappearance of the Settlement. In this respect the outstanding danger was the mentality of the Congress and the constant advocacy, on the contrary, of preparation for a further struggle. This mentality was inevitably having effects elsewhere. It was partly because of the reaction in England and unless we could check the reaction there, the atmosphere would become entirely unfavourable. In regard to constitutional discussion at the Conference, I suggested that his own position would be very unpleasant if, when he was in London, a state of affairs existed in India which irritated and even outraged public opinion in England. I gave him many instances from different provinces of Congress subversive action. Mr. Gandhi was, I think, generally impressed by the above factor. He had already realized the significance of the reaction in England and he did not, as I rather expected he might do, criticize the reactionary forces at work. Similarly he made no protest whatever against the line taken by His Excellency the Governor of the Punjab in his recent speech, and he seemed to accept the view I took that the speech was the natural consequence of hard facts for which Congress were largely responsible, but his only complaint was that I had suggested a widespread suspicion of the objects and activities of the Congress, that these in fact were good and that they did want a peaceful solution. He admitted that particular activities were bad and had his complete disapproval. He also appreciated the necessity of getting the situation on to a more peaceful plane, and he will, I hope, definitely use his influence to this end. I showed him a circular issued by the Provincial Congress Committee of Madras, a copy of which is attached to this note, and said that while there were one or two things in it which might be better expressed, Government would have little cause for complaint if Congress as a whole acted on the principles stated in it. I also told him that the line he had taken in his own speech at Simla would definitely help, and begged him to carry on in the same spirit and get his leaders to do likewise. I have personally no doubt that he will do his best.
 I may close this note (which is already of inordinate length) with some 
 personal impressions.
 Mr. Gandhi is, I think, more sincere than ever in his desire to see the Settlement through, and he will do his utmost in this respect. It is probably less likely to break down from the Congress side on a big issue than on some irritating and comparatively unimportant matter of detail. This danger would be lessened if Congress activities, especially in rural areas, were materially to moderate, for it might then be possible and even desirable for local Government to stretch a point here and there in response to Congress action. If and when this becomes feasible, the atmosphere will improve.
 Mr. Gandhi himself has definitely mellowed during the past few months. He has been up against concrete difficulties and has had to face constructive work. This has made him less confident in regard to preconceived ideas and more ready to see the other side of the case, although I have always found him very fair in this respect. Personal contact with various officers of Government has increased his desire to co- operate and while I realize only too well the difficulties and dangers in the way of closer co-operation with Congress leaders so long as Congress are out to increase their prestige and influence at the expense of Government and other parties, I feel that, where it is possible to avoid these difficulties and dangers, personal contact will definitely help to relieve the situation. This will be particularly the case if, as I hope, Mr. Gandhi tries with success to tone down the war mentality. If there is no response by Government, we shall get back into the same vicious circle.
 Mr. Gandhi himself is at present too involved in detail to give the attention he should be giving to big questions. He receives many complaints of failure on the part of Government to carry out their part of the agreement, and although the great majority of these are untrue, they doubts and suspicions. The sooner the matters immediately arising out of the Settlement are would up the better.
 Mr. Gandhi is under no illusion as to the consequences of the break-down of the Settlement. He realizes the renewal of the Civil Disobedience Movement will compel Government to hit hard and hit at once and I have made this perfectly clear to him on many occasions. He accepts this as quite fair and will, if necessary, face the consequences. But if it can be avoided, he does not want another fight and this fact and his sense of obligation to honour promises given to Lord Irwin are factors of very great importance in the situation.

 SIR MALCOLM HAILEY’S NOTE ON DISCUSSIONS WITH GANDHIJI1libtech_538_footnote
 May 20, 1931
 My discussion with Mr. Gandhi today turned mainly on the agrarian situation, but there were also some subsidiary points mentioned.
  As 	regards releases, he 	had little 	to say; 	he had 	not at all 	events come 	prepared with 	a list 	of cases 	in which 	there were any complaints 	that we 	had not 	observed the 	Agreement. I 	told him that if 	there were 	any cases which he 	wished to 	refer to us, I should be glad if he would send them to Chief Secretary; and he agreed.  He 	mentioned the 	cases of 	students who 	had been rusticated, 	etc., for 	taking part 	in Civil 	Disobedience. I 	have not 	the full facts, 	but the D.P.I. 	has informed 	me that 	before being re-admitted they were required to 	undertake that they 	were to observe 	the disciplinary 	rules of 	the institution. 	This does not seem to 	be a very 	onerous obligation, and 	failing any 	more definite 	complaint from Congress, 	I would 	let the matter rest there. 	Mr. Gandhi did not 	seem to  attach 	 any  great 	importance to 	it at the time.  He 	attached some importance 	to the 	question of 	arms for 	which licenses 	had been 	confiscated owing to 	their owners taking part 	in Civil 	Disobedience. There were 	I believe 	some such cases, though I 	do not now if 	we have anything about 	them at 	headquarters. He 	told me 	that the 	Commissioner in 	Gujarat had 	recognized that this 	fell within the 	terms of 	the Agreement, 	that Mr. Emerson 	had said he 	thought it 	did so, 	but that 	he would consult 	legal opinion before 	issuing anything 	to local 	Governments. Chief 	Secretary might 	ascertain any 	facts that he can 	on the 	subject, and 	at the 	same time write 	demi-officially to Mr. 	Emerson, asking if 	the Government 	of India 	think that arms licenses should be 	restored, where they have 	been confiscated strictly on the ground that owners have taken part in Civil Disobediences.  As 	I have 	said, the 	main point was 	the agrarian situation. 	We discussed 	this at 	great length, and 	I for my part avoided any 	point of 	principle, such as 	whethere the 	Congress was 	really entitled under 	the Agreement to be recognized as the 
 ,representative of  the people, etc., and too him at once to the facts of the situation  in the districts in which Congress had been most  active.  I  pointed out that however the situation had been arrived at, the danger was that tenants would now refuse to pay rents at all and resort to acts of violence if they were pressed by l andlords. I naturally quoted Chauri Chaura to him. He at once dis- claimed any idea of a no-
 
 rent campaign, and was somewhat aghast when I gave him a copy of the resolution of the Etawah Congress Committee which he said he would look into at once. He admitted that where compromises had been made by landlords with Congress, the latter had not been able to persuade tenants to pay up. He said it was no part of Congress plans to establish an organization of tahsils and thanas; they were quite opposed to the idea of actually starting a parallel government or anything of the kind. Having got thus far, I then again but to him the actual difficulty arising from the situation in these districts. He said that it could only be solved by enlisting the effective co-operation of Congress in persuading tenants to pay their rents. But he could not promise this, nor could he engage to use his own active efforts  of  persuasion direct to tenants unless Congress had something better to put forward than the mere announcement of remissions by Government. His workers had narrowly examined the conditions of numerous districts and were confident that tenants could not pay even the reduced rentals in present circumstances. He indeed suggested that the enquiry showed that rents were so high as practically to be unpayable even in ordinary years, though he admitted that this conclusion might need some modifying in the light of the fact that many of these rentals were old and spread over a long series of years. He suggested the adoption of one of the three following courses :
 First, (though he did not press this) he suggested that we might accept the figures arrived at by Congress workers, which he assured me were not a mere rough shot but the result of actual inquiries. I pointed out to him that it was quite impossible to assume that these general figures were equally correct for all classes of tenants and for all parts of the province.
 Secondly, he suggested that our officers might hold a kind of summary inquiry with selected Congressmen in each district or division with a view of getting better figures.
 Thirdly, if neither course was acceptable to Government, he asked that Government itself should hold a public inquiry at which Congressmen could give evidence as to the capacity of tenants to pay rentals. I pointed out to him that either  of the latter courses would mean delay with every prospect that no money would be available at all for payment of rentals. If tenants get over the payment of any rental at all this harvest, it is pretty certain that they would pay nothing for kharif. It was quite impossible to make summary inquiries in three or four days as he thought, and a general inquiry on the lines of that which he had in mind, namely, the Commission on Champaran in 1916 would take many months. Anything that we did now would not only very gravely affect the landlords, but also might have an abiding effect on our own finances for many years to come; it was not, therefore, reasonable to ask
 Government to adopt a summary p rocedure which might have such far-reaching effects. I told him that I would consider his proposals, but it seemed to me that the result of delaying collections would be so dangerous that it would be difficult to accept them. I pointed out that there were many districts in which our officers thought that collections might now proceed without great difficulty, and that in my opinion the best course was to set to work on collections wherever possible in the hope that if these proceeded smoothly it will have its effect on the attitude of the tenants generally. We left the matter at that, and it may be that it is not a very satisfactory conclusion, for I did not get his definite engagement to do nothing except to discountenance anything like a no-rent campaign or an attempt to set up Congress tribunals. As Mr. Emerson had warned me, Mr. Gandhi feels deeply that Congress cannot entirely retire from its position of championship of tenants and small landowners.
  We 	discussed the 	question of 	picketing though at 	no great length. I 	pointed out 	to him the danger that it 	was becoming communal 	owing to 	the unwillingness 	of volunteers 	to tackle 	Mohammedan shopkeepers, and 	I also 	pointed out that 	the snatching 	away of 	liquor or 	the infliction 	of fines 	is quite 	beyond the spirit 	of the 	Agreement. Here 	is agreed and said that 	he would do his 	best to 	discountenance it and had indeed already issued orders against the taking of fines.

 LETTER FROM SIR MALCOLM HAILEY TO H. W. EMERSONlibtech_539_footnote

 May 21, 1931
 MY DEAR EMERSON,
 Many thanks for your letter of the 16th May; I have found it very useful indeed in my discussion with Mr. Gandhi. I send you a note as to the results which, I fear, were not very conspicuous. But the discussion was very friendly throughout, and I was particularly struck with the fact that he did not seem to have come prepared to open up    a battery of objections against our method of dealing with releases, ect. As you will see, his general attitude on the object of the agrarian trouble was very much the same as that which he took with you.
 
     H. 	W. EMERSON, 	ESQ.,  SECY 	. TO 	THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA 	HOME DEPARTMENT  PS.  Yours 	sincerely,  M. HAILEY 
  I 	have sent a copy of my note to the Viceroy.  Home 	Department, Political, File No. 33/XI & K.Ws., 1931. Courtesy : 	National Archives of India  APPENDIX V (A)  LETTER FROM SIR 	MALCOLM HAILEYlibtech_540_footnote  May 	23, 1931   DEAR 	MR. GANDHI,  I 	have just received your letter of today, and as you ask for a very 	early, I have given it urgent but very anxious consideration and 	write at once to give you my views on the subject.  Thought 	I welcome much that is contained in your proposed manifesto, such as 	the advice to tenants to begin making payments at once, your 	condemnation of the use of violence by kisans, 	and your strongly expressed desire that they should not injure their 	own cause by undersirable action, yet I much regret that I could not 	associate myself in any way with the manifesto as a whole. It 	practically embodies a decision that it is necessary to make for a 	large number of districts in the province a rental remission for the 	whole year 1338 Fasli of eight annas in the rupee in the case   
 of statutory and non-occupancy tenants and four annas in the case of occupancy tenants. Though I admit that it is stated that in some cases a larger payment is possible, yet tenants generally could not understand it as anything but a direction to confine their payments to this level as a whole. I am myself far from convinced by anything that I have seen or heard that a reduction on this scale is required by the circumstances, and I am certainly clear that no one formula, whether it embraces reductions of this amount or otherwise, could with equity be applied to the very different conditions pevailing throughout the province.
 I am advised that collections of rentals are already proceeding in many of our districts on the basis of the reductions made by Government, and though it is not possible at the moment to say whether these collections can everywhere be made absolutely in full, yet to my mind the right policy is to allow collections to proceed on this basis and to watch the results carefully. I have in conversation with you pointed out the danger of doing anything which would encourage tenants to withhold rentals at this stage, for if collections are not made at once, there will be little chance of securing any payment at all at a subsequent stage. It is for this latter reason in particular that I have deprecated proposals for general inquiries into the present pitch of rentals throughout the province, for no summary inquiry of this nature can do justice to a very complicated and involved case, a decision on which will not only affect vitally the finances of Government, but will involve far-reaching effects on the relations of tenants and landlords.
 With best wishes,

 LETTER FROM SIR MALCOLM HAILEY TO H. W. EMERSONlibtech_541_footnote
 UNITED PROVINCES ,
 May 23, 1931
 MY DEAR EMERSON,
 I think that you ought to see at once the enclosed correspondence I have just had with Mr. Gandhi. I had to reply at somewhat short notice, as I did not wish to do anything that might delay him leaving us at 3 o’clock this afternoon! But it was clearly impossible for me to agree to anything that would look like a joint manifesto from myself and him, particularly as his draft could only have been understood by the majority of people to embody a decision that the remissions granted by us were altogether wrong and that something far more extensive was required. I do not know if  he will return to the charge or will want to come and see me again; but his lieutenant, Govind Vallabh Pant, was told on the telephone that I should be unlikely to vary the attitude I had taken up. After a good deal of consideration I think this is only one possible for me.
 
      PS.  Yours 	sincerely,  M. HAILEY   If 	Sir George Lambert is still in Simla would you kindly show this to 	him? 
  H. W. EMERSON, 	ESQ.  Home 	Department, Political, File No. 33/XI & K.Ws., 1931. Courtesy : 	National Archives of India    APPENDIX VII  LETTER FROM R. 	M. MAXWELL libtech_542_footnote  GOVERNMENT HOUSE,  MAHABALESHWAR,  May 	13, 1931   DEAR 	MR. GANDHI,  At 	your interview with His Excellency Sir Frederick Sykes on the 17th 	April His Excellency promised that certain cases which you 	mentiioned, pertaining to the Home Department, would be reconsidered 	by the Government. I am now to inform you of the results of that 	review.   
  I 	am to deal 	firstly with 	your suggestions for 	the release of 	certain prisoners. 
  You 	represented that 	the Sholapur Martial Law 	prisoners who 	had not been 	released should have 	been released according 	to the 	Settlement, and 	you were informed 	at the time that there were three such persons. 
 In the case of Mr. Rajwade you are right in your supposition, to which you have referred in your letter of the 1st instant to Mr. Collins, that no other writing was placed before the Court except the issue of the Karmayogi in question. Many of the allegations in that document were either false or so grossly exaggerated (or, when he referred to the incidents of the riots, minimized) as to be untrue to the facts. The chief consideration, however, is that their publication at that time and in the conditions then prevailing in Sholapur inevitably tended to inflame the population against the authorities and thus amounted to a direct and real incitement to further violence. Their actual effect was to make more difficult the restoration of peace, and it is impossible to doubt that this result was foreseen by Mr. Rajwade when he published the article. The Government, therefore, on reconsideration adhere to their view that this is not a case which can properly claim the benefit of the amnesty.
 The other two persons were convicted of tampering with justice by bribing witnesses in the case which arose from the murder of two policemen, and on reconsideration Government are unable to see that the Settlement can apply to a case of this description or that the persons concerned deserve any clemency.
  The 	Government have 	reconsidered the 	cases of persons 	convicted under 	Section 124-A of the 	I.P.C. You 	expressed the 	opinion that 	the writing of 	articles and the making  	of  speeches  were  not  contemplated  when i t  was  decided  that 	the Settlement should not 	apply to 	cases of 	violence and 	incitement to 	violence. The 	Government are 	unable to 	accept this 	view, for 	it is clear 	that such writings 	and speeches 	can, and 	often did, contain 	incitement to 	violence which 	is real 	and not 	technical, and 	that such incitement 	is often 	more dangerous and 	far-reaching than 	other forms of 	incitement to 	violence. The 	Government find 	that the cases 	of the 	individuals detained in 	jail satisfied 	this test, 	and they are therefore 	in no doubt 	that those 	persons were rightly excluded from the 	benefits of 	the amnesty. I 	am to add that Government 	are always 	ready to show 	leniency, as 	in many cases 	in the 	past, to 	any person 	convicted under Section 124-A of 	the I.P.C., 	who makes 	adequate apologies and 	gives an 	undertaking not 	to repeat 	the offence 	but this 	is a 	point unconnected 	with the Settlement, which makes no provision for conditional release.  You 	referred to 	the case 	of Ratanji 	Dayaram of Bardoli 	taluka, who you 	said was convicted of burning his own crop and should therefore have been released. 
 On examining his case Government find that he was convicted of deliberately burning his tenant’s crop in order that the revenue due to Government should not be
 paid on the land in question. He has not made any reparation to the sufferer which might have entitled his case to consideration on grounds of clemency as distinct from the terms of the Settlement, which, as I have pointed out, make no provision for conditional release. Apart from this circumstance, Government consider that violent mischief of this description does not come within the terms of the amnesty.
  His 	Excellency understood you 	to say 	that there were 	certain prisoners 	convicted of 	offences in 	connection with 	the salt campaign 	who had not 	been released. 	The Home Department are however unable to trace any such cases.  You 	stated that there were 	certain prosecutions 	which were still being 	carried on 	for offences 	which took place during 	the civil 	disobedience campaign 	contrary to 	the terms 	of the 	Settlement, and 	you referred in 	particular to 	a case 	in Belgaum. 
 It was pointed out to you at the time that the particular case to which you referred was a case of Nipani in that district. The facts of this case are that, following the conviction of two local leaders in April 1930, a mob collected with the intention of enforcing hartal, and after damaging public and private property and destroying the royal portraits in the school, came into conflict with the police whom they proceeded to stone, with the result that three policemen and some village servants were injured. There was thus real violence and Government feel that the decision to proceed with the case cannot be altered.
 The other prosecutions which were still pending at the time of your conversation with His Excellency were those of (a) Mahadev Kuverji and Hira Vallabh
 (b) Vishnu Sali, (c) Shiva Mattur,  all of S urat district, who were accused respectively  of setting fire to attached crops, severely assaulting a police constable, and setting fire to an attached crop after beating the village servant in charge. These are clear cases of violence which cannot be reviewed.
  As 	regards the 	orders of 	deportation passed under 	the Foreigners’ 	Act, the 	Government have already, 	on reconsideration, 	withdrawn these orders in 	all cases, six 	in number, 	and the persons 	who were in 	prison for 	failing to 	observe the 	orders have 	been released. In this 	connection you stated 	that there were 30 such 	cases in the 	Karnatak and 	you were informed that 	Government were not aware 	of them, 	on which 	you agreed 	to furnish 	particulars of them 	to the 	Secretary, Home 	Department. As you have not done so, His Excellency assumes that you were misinformed on the point.  You 	stated that 	certain movable and 	immovable property 	forfeited had not 	been returned. His 	Excellency finds that all 	the buildings seized 	under Ordinance IX 	have been restored. The 	delay in 	some cases was 	due to the time which 	necessarily elapsed in 	finding, and 	making the 	necessary arrangements 	with, the persons 	entitled and 	authorized to take delivery. 
 As regards the return of movable property, the position has been discussed in
 my separate letter of today, in reply to yours of the 7th May.
  As 	regards the Chirner case, which you represented should be withdrawn, 	you were 	informed at the 	time that as 	the persons 	concerned were accused of 	rioting, being 	armed with deadly weapons, dacoity, conspiracy to 	commit dacoity and 	causing grievous 	hurt to 	public servants in 	the performance 	of their 	duty, while six of them 	are directly charged with 	murder, the case was obviously one shich must be allowed to take 	its course. 
 Yours sincerely,

 APPENDIX VIII
 OPINIONlibtech_543_footnote
 June 13, 1931
  (1) 	The question which 	has arisen 	between the Government 	and the 	Navajivan Press is : 
 “What are the obligations of the Government as regards returning the press which was seized at Ahmedabad from the premises of the Navajivan Press?” The question depends primarily on the language of the Instrument which says “movable property . . . will be returned”. The meaning of the word “return” as given by Webster is “to bring, carry, put, or send back; to restore”. According to Murray’s Oxford Dictionary the word “return” has, among others, the following meaning :
 “to bring or convey to a place or person; to send bac again; to give or render back”. From this it is plain that where a party in possession (in this case the Government) has agreed to return a movable property, the obligation undertaken can only be said to have been performed when the party in possession brings or conveys back to the place from where the thing was taken and hands it over to the person from whom it was taken. We are, therefore, of opinion that the terms of the Agreement are not only not silent as to the place of delivery, but are clear as to the place of delivery, viz., the place from where it was taken or where it was seized.
  In 	an Indian Statute, the 	word “return” has 	also been used in 	the sense of 	taking a 	thing back 	to the 	place from 	which it 	was brought. 	Section 43 of the 	Indian Sale 	of Goods Act runs as follows : 
 “Unless otherwise agreed, where goods are delivered to the buyer and he refuses
 
 to accept them, having the right so to do, he is not to return them to the seller, but it  is sufficient if he intimates to the seller that he refuses to accept them”.
 It is obvious that the word “return” must mean taking bac to the place from which it was taken, and it is used in contradistinction to “offer to return” or “holding  it at the disposal of the party from whom it was taken”. The action of the Government in this case merely amounts to “offer to return” or to “hold it at the disposal of the previous owner”, but does not amount to the performance of the obligation to return. As is pointed out above, the obligation to return requires that the thing should be restored to the place and the person from which and from whom it was taken.
  We 	are of opinion that the 	section dealing with the 	subject of 	delivery of 	goods as 	between the 	seller and 	the buyer, has 	got nothing to 	do with the 	present question as no question of return arises in such a case.  While 	clearly disagreeing with 	the view that the agreement 	in question 	is silent 	as to the place 	of “return”, 	we are of opinion 	that even in that 	view, the place of performance 	of the 	obligation, in 	an agreement like 	the present, is 	the place 	from or at which 	the thing 	was taken 	or seized. 	The place 	in such a case has to be 	determined by 	a reference 	to the 	object of 	the agreement. 	It is clear 	that in 	this case, 	the object 	is to restore 	status quo ante.  Even 	on the 	assumption, which 	is denied, 	that the agreement 	in this 	present case 	is silent 	as to the 	place of 	“return”, by 	reason of 	the provisions 	of Section 	49 of the Indian Contract Act, if no place of performance was     	agreed upon,   the 	promisee has 	the right to 	appoint the 	place of 	performance and 	the promisor is 	bound to perform 	the promise 	(in this case, 	the promise 	to return 	the press) 	at such 	place, provided it 	is reasonable. In 	this case, 	the promisee 	is entitled 	to name 	a reasonable 	place for performance 	and the reasonable 	and proper 	place is prima 	facie the 	place from where it was 	taken or where 	it was 	seized; for 	it is conceivable 	that after 	the seizure, 	the thing 	may be removed, 	for a variety 	of reasons, 	to a distant 	place and 	it would be 	clearly reasonable for 	the promisee to 	claim that it 	should be 	returned to the place from where 	it was taken or where it was seized.  In 	every view 	of the 	matter, therefore, 	the position 	taken up by the 	Government in 	the matter 	of the 	Navajivan Press 	cannot be 	sustained. They 	can be said 	to have 	fulfilled the agreement 	only when they have taken it 	to Ahmedabad (from 	where it was seized) and offer to return it to the person from whom it was taken.

 APPENDIX IX
 LETTER FROM H. W. EMERSONlibtech_544_footnote
 
 
 
 
SIMLA,
 July 4, 1931
  In 	your letter 	of June 	14, you suggested that 	the time had perhaps 	arrived for the 	appointment of 	a permanent 	Board of 	Arbitration to 	decide questions 	of the 	interpretation of 	the Settlement 	and as 	to the full 	carrying out of 	the terms 	by the 	one party or 	the other. 	Again in 	your letter 	of June 	20, you made the farther 	suggestion that 	in regard 	to picketing, 	the Government 	of India 	should advise local Governments 	to appoint 	a Board 	of Inquiry, 	consisting of a nominee 	on their 	behalf and a 	nominee on behalf 	of the 	Congress, to 	conduct a 	summary inquiry into 	the allegations on 	either side and 	wherever it 	is found that the 	rule of 	peaceful picketing has 	been violated 	picketing should be 	entirely suspended, the 	Government undertaking on 	its part 	to stop 	prosecutions wherever it 	is found that they have 	been undertaken in spite 	of peaceful picketing.  I 	much appreciate 	your object 	of removing 	the possible 	causes of dispute 	arising out 	of the Settlement, but 	there are, I 	am afraid, serious 	difficulties in the way of accepting 	either proposal. To take 	the lesser 	one first. 	Its scope, 	as I understand 	it, is 	mainly limited to 	cases in 	which it 	is alleged that 	the methods of 	picketing have 	contravened the 	ordinary law 	and that the 	police have, therefore, 	prosecuted or propose 	to prosecute 	the picketer. 	One effect 	of your 	proposal would be 	that before 	bringing the law into 	operation there 	should be 	a summary 	inquiry carried out by 	a nominee 	of Government 	and a 	nominee of 	Congress and 	that further proceedings 	would depend on their decision.  In 	other words, the duty of maintaining the law in this particular 	respect would be transferred from the police, who have statutory 	duties, to a Board of Inquiry, the members of which might well 	arrive at different conclusions.  While 	the police, 	of course, 	must act only 	in accordance 	with the law, 	it is not 	practicable nor 	was it intended by 	the Settlement that their 	duty in this 	respect should in any way be abrogated.  In 	cases of 	this kind a 	practical test 	as to whether 	the law has or 	has not been 	contravened is 	the decision 	of the 	Court, which tries the 	case, and 	unless its 	decision  is 	reversed on 	appeal the 	finding of 	the Court 	that picketing has 	contravened the 	law and 	consequently the 	terms of the Settlement 	should prima 	facie be followed 	automatically by 	a suspension of 	picketing. The 	above illustrates one 	of the difficulties, that would also arise in the case of Standing Boards of Arbitration.    
 The obligations imposed on Congress by the Settlement relate largely to matters affecting Law and Order, the freedom of action of the individual and the carrying on of the administration, that is to say, any serious breach of it has important reactions on one or other of these matters. So far as individual breaches contravened the ordinary law, the position would be the same as for picketing. If general breaches of it raised questions of policy affecting Law and Order or the effective working of the administration, it would be clearly impossible  for Government to restrict their freedom of action by reference to a Board of Arbitration. This was not contemplated when the Settlement was made and in particular when the last clause of it was drafted. Nor would it be consonant with the discharge by Government of fundamental responsibilities.
 It seems to me that the working of the Settlement must depend primarily on the good faith of the parties to it. So far as Government are concerned they desire to adhere strictly to its terms and our information shows that the local Governments have been scrupulous in carrying out the obligations imposed on them. Doubtful cases are of course inevitable, but local Governments are prepared to give them most careful examination and the Government of India will continue to bring to the notice of local Governments any cases that are reported to them and if necessary satisfy themselves in regard to the facts.
