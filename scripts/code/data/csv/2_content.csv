1,,INTERVIEW TO “THE NATAL ADVERTISER”,"
       [s.s. Courland],  January [13,]libtech_1_footnotelibtech_2_footnote1897  [REPORTER:] 	How do you view the 	proceedings of the demonstration committeelibtech_3_footnote?  	[GANDHIJI:] I certainly 	think the demonstration is most ill- advised, especially proceeding 	from a number of Colonists who say they are loyal to the British 	Crown, and I should never have expected that the thing would go so 	far. They are showing a most decided spirit of disloyalty by their 	demonstration, and the effects of it will be felt not only 	throughout the Colony, but throughout the British Empire, more 	especially the Indian Empire.  In 	what way?  	Whatever affects the body of Indians who come over here will most 	decidedly affect the Indians in India.  You 	mean to say that it will prejudice the Indians against this country?  	Yes, and it will give the Indians a sort of feeling that will not be 	got rid of easily, besides creating a mutual feeling between sister 	Colonies against India. I don’t say that there is a great 	ill-feeling between Indians and the Colonists generally at the 	present moment. I certainly think that, from what the Colonists are 	doing here, people in India would infer that that would be the 	attitude of every other British Colony also and, so far as things 	have gone in that direction, they confirm that impression. So we 	find in South Africa, so far as we can read from the telegrams and 	the reports in the newspapers.  Of 	course, you firmly believe that Natal has no right to stop Indians 	coming  here?       
 I certainly think so.
 On what grounds?
 On the ground that they are British subjects and, also, because the Colony of Natal has been importing one class of Indians and does not want to have another class.libtech_4_footnote
 Yes.
 It is very inconsistent. It seems to be a sort of leonine partnership. They want to get all the advantages that can possibly be gained from the Indians, but do not want the Indians to have any advantage whatever.
 What attitude will the Indian Government take on this question?
 That I am unable to say. So far I don’t know what the feeling of the Indian Government is. The feeling cannot be apathetic towards the Indians. They are bound to sympathize, but what attitude they will take depends upon so many circumstances that it is very difficult to conjecture what it will be.
 Is it probable that, if free Indians are stopped, the Indian Government will stop the indentured Indians?
 I hope so;libtech_5_footnotebut whether the Indian Government will do that is a different thing.
 What I think most of is that the demonstrators have not taken any notice whatever of the Imperial aspect of the question. It is an admitted fact that the Indian Empire is the brightest jewel in the  British Crown. Most of the trade of the United Kingdom is carried on with the Indian Empire, and it furnishes some of the bravest soldiers to fight the wars of Great Britain in almost all parts of the world.
 “They have never been further than Egypt,” interpolated the interviewer, and Mr. Gandhi tacitly admitted the correction.
 The policy of the Imperial Government has throughout been a policy of conciliation — a policy of winning over the Indians by love and not by force. Every Britisher is agreed that the glory of the British Empire depends upon the retention of the Indian Empire and on the
 
 face of this, it looks very unpatriotic of the Colonists of Natal, whose prosperity depends not a little upon the introduction of the Indians, to so vigorously protest against the introduction of free Indians. The policy of exclusion is obsolete, and Colonists should admit Indians to the franchise and, at the same time, in points in which they are not fully civilized, Colonists should help them to become more civilized. That, I certainly think, should be the policy followed throughout the Colonies, if all the parts of the British Empire are to remain  in harmony.
 Are Indians admitted, at present, to all parts of the British Empire?
 Australia has now been endeavouring to exclude them, but the Government Bill has been thrown out by the Legislative Council, and, even if the policy were adopted in Australia, it remains to be seen whether it will be sanctioned by the Home Government. Even if the Australians were successful, I should say it would not be good for Natal to follow a bad example and one which was bound to be suicidal in the end.
 What was your main object in visiting India?
 My main object in returning was to see my family, my wife and children, from whom I have been separated, almost continually, for the last seven years. I told the Indians here that I should have to go to India for a short time. They thought I might be able to do something for the cause of the Indians in Natal and I thought so also. And here I may state, parenthetically, that we have not been fighting, really speaking, with regard to the position of the Indians in the Colony, but we have been simply fighting for the principle. The object of our agitation is not to swamp the Colony with Indians or to have the status of the Indian in the Colony of Natal defined, but to have the Imperial question decided once for all, namely: ‘What status will the Indians outside British India have?’ That was the principle we have been striving to determine. The Indian gentlemen interested in the cause in Durban discussed the question with me as to what my plan of action should be in India, and the plan of action was that I should simply get my travelling expenses in India paid by the Natal Congress. As soon as I arrived in India I published that pamphlet.libtech_6_footnote
 Where did you prepare the pamphlet?
 
 
 I did not prepare it in Natal. I prepared the whole of it while on the voyage home.
 How did you secure the information it contains?
 I was determined to make myself acquainted with all the facts about the Indians in South Africa, and with that object in view I had translations of the Transvaal laws supplied to me, and I asked friends in the Cape Colony and in other parts of South Africa to furnish me with any information they had on this question. So, I was fully acquainted with the facts before I decided to go to India. In the memorials which have been sent from the Indians of Natal to the Home Government, the Imperial view of the question has always been kept in the forefront.
 Were the memorials bearing on the franchise question?
 Not exclusively. They treated with the immigration and other laws the Colony has passed, as well as the Transvaal agitation.libtech_7_footnote
 What was your object in publishing the pamphlet?
 My object in publishing it was to place the entire facts regarding the position of the Indians in South Africa before the Indian public. The people here believe that India does not know exactly how many Indians were outside the country, and what their status was, and the object was to draw their attention to the subject, and it was with that view that the pamphlet was published.
 But had you not an ulterior object?
 The ulterior object was to have the status of the Indians decided to our satisfaction; that is to say, in terms with the Proclamation of 1858.
 Do you hope to be successful?
 I certainly hope that, with the help of the Indian public in India, we shall achieve the end very quickly.
 What means do you propose adopting?
 We desire them to go in for a constitutional agitation in India. At every meeting that has been held, resolutions have been passed authorizing the chairman to draw up memorials addressed to  the Indian Government and the Home Government, drawing their
 
 attention to the position of the Indians in South Africa.  These meetings have been held throughout the presidencies of Bombay, Madras and Calcutta.libtech_8_footnote
 Have you received any encouragement from the Indian Government on the subject?
No; I had to return before I received any reply.
 Mr. Gandhi continued:
 It has been said that I went to India to blacken the character of the Natal Colonists. This I must emphatically deny. It will be remembered that I addressed an ‘Open Letter’libtech_9_footnoteto the members of the Natal Parliament about two years ago, and there I gave my view of the treatment the Indians were receiving, and it was exactly that view that I placed before the Indian public.
 In fact, I copied an extract from that ‘Open Letter’, word for word, into my pamphlet.libtech_10_footnoteIt gave my view of the treatment the Indians were receiving before, and no exception was taken to that portion of the ‘Open Letter’ when it was published here. No one then said that I was blackening the character of the Colonists, but only when that statement was repeated in India. How that can amount to blackening the character of the Colonists I fail to understand. At the time of discussing the ‘Open Letter’, almost all the papers said unanimously that I was absolutely impartial, and not a single statement I made was contradicted. Under these circumstances, I thought I was perfectly justified in making the extract from the ‘Open Letter’. I am aware that Reuter cabled Home a summarylibtech_11_footnoteof the pamphlet that could not be borne out by the ‘Open Letter’, and as soon as you received the pamphlet, both the Durban papers said Reuter had exaggerated its statements.libtech_12_footnoteI can hardly be held responsible for Reuter’s statements and opinions, and I believe that the leaders of the demonstration party
 
 have not read the ‘Open Letter’ and the pamphlet; they have taken Reuter’s telegram as an accurate summary of the pamphlet, and are, therefore, proceeding on these lines. If this belief is well founded, then I say that the leaders are doing an injustice to the Colonists as well as the Indians. I will say I have not gone beyond what I did here, and my stating the case in India has not prejudiced it in any way.
 In your Indian campaign what attitude did you adopt towards the indentured Indian question?
 I have said most emphatically, in the pamphlets and elsewhere, that the treatment of the indentured Indians is no worse or better in Natal than they receive in other parts of the world. I have never endeavoured to show that the indentured Indians have been receiving cruel treatment. The question, generally speaking, is not a question of the ill-treatment of Indians, but of the legal disabilities that are placed on them. I have even said in the pamphlet that instances I have quoted show that the treatment that the Indians receive was owing to the prejudice against them, and what I have endeavoured to show is the connection between the prejudice and the laws passed by the Colony to restrict the freedom of the Indian.
 I have said that the Indians did not approach the Indian Government, the Indian public, or the Home Government, with the view to having any redress against the prejudices of these Colonists. I have said that Indians are the most hated beings in South Africa, and that they are being ill-treated; but, for all that we do not ask the Government for redress with regard to these things, but with regard to the legal disabilities that are placed upon the Indians. We protest against the legislation passed by prejudice, and redress has been asked for against them. This, then, is simply a question of toleration on the part of the Indian. The attitude taken up by the Colonists, especially by the demonstration committee, is an attitude of intolerance. It has been said in the papers that there is an organized attempt, under my leadership,  to  swamp  the  Colony  with  Indians.libtech_13_footnoteThis   statement   is absolutely false. I have as much to do with having induced these passengers to come here as I have with inducing passengers to come from Europe. No such attempt has ever been made.
 I should think your agitation in India would have rather the opposite effect?
Certainly. I tried to induce some gentlemen to come who, I
 
 thought, would be able to replace me, to work for the cause and I was absolutely unsuccessful.libtech_14_footnotelibtech_15_footnoteThey refused to come.
 The number of passengers on board the Courland and Naderi has been exaggerated. There are not 800 passengers on the two ships, so far as my information goes. In all there are about 600. Of these, only 200 are for Natal, the rest are for Delagoa Bay, Mauritius, Bourbon, and the Transvaal. Now, out of these 200, about 100 are newcomers and of these new comers about 40 are ladies, and so it is a question of admitting about 60 newcomers. These 60 newcomers consist of storekeepers’ assistants, traders on their own account, and hawkers. I have nothing whatever to do with bringing passengers to any of the other ports either. A statement has appeared to the effect that there is a printing plant, 50 blacksmiths, and 30 compositors on board—all absolutely false. Such a statement is calculated to inflame the passions of the European artisans and the working people in Durban, though it has no foundation in fact. The leader of the demonstration committee, and anybody in Natal, would be perfectly justified in getting up an agitation—a constitutional agitation, remember—if there was an organized attempt to swamp the Colony with Indians, and Indians of this stamp; but, as a matter of fact, there is not a single blacksmith or compositor on board.
 The statement has been made that I have been advising people on board to institute legal proceedings against the Government for unlawful detention.libtech_16_footnotelibtech_17_footnoteThat is another statement that has no foundation in fact. My object throughout is not to sow dissension between the two communities, but to assist at creating harmony between the two, without the Indians having to accept any degradation of their status as conferred upon them by the Proclamation of 1858, when it was stated that all subjects of Her Majesty in India would be treated on a footing of equality without distinction of race, colour, or creed; and I submit, I am justified in requesting every Colonist to tolerate the attitude, however much they have differed from it. Really speaking, there can be no objection to the Indian. The Colonial Patriotic Unionlibtech_18_footnotelibtech_19_footnotehave put
 
 forward statements that the artisan class are concerned. I say there is no competition between Europeans and Indians.
 It is true that few Indians do now and then come to Natal, but the number of those in the Colony is very greatly exaggerated, and certainly there are very few new comers. And how can there be any competition between a high-class European and an ordinary Indian artisan? I don’t mean to say that Indian artisans cannot compete successfully with the European artisans, but here, again, the Indian artisans of a high order, and of the right stamp, do not come here, and if they did come, they would not find much employment, just as if other professional men came here they would not find much to do.
 What is your object in coming back?
 I do not return here with the intention of making money, but of acting as a humble interpreter between the two communities. There is a great misunderstanding between the communities, and I shall endeavour to fulfil the office of interpreter so long as both the communities do not object to my presence.
 Had you the approval of the Indian Congresslibtech_20_footnoteto all the statements you made and the action you took in India?
I certainly think so. I spoke in the name of the people.
 Are there not some indentured Indians on board these boats?
 No. There are some who come under an ordinary contract to serve merchants here as shop assistants, but none indentured. An unauthorized agency for bringing Indians under contract to render domestic service is illegal, according to the Indian Immigration Law.
 Have the Indian Congress no intention of starting a newspaper in Natal?
 There was an intention, not by the Indian Congress, but by a body of workers who sympathize with the Congress, of starting a paper, but that idea has to be given up, simply because I could not see any way to devote my time to that and other work. I had instructions to bring material and Indian type, but as I found it would be  impossible for me to work it, I did not bring anything. Had I been able to persuade the gentlemen with whom I was negotiating to come over here, I might have brought the material, but as that fell through, I did not do so.
 What steps have the Indian Congress taken with regard to this Colonial
 
 agitation?
So far as I know, the Congress have taken no steps whatever.
 What is your plan of campaign?
 My plan of campaign now is, if I am allowed time, to show that there is no conflict of interest between the two countries; that the attitude taken up by the Colony at present is indefensible on every ground; and to justify what I have done in the eyes of the Colonists for the sake of the case in which I am interested. Of course, we should resist the passing of any laws to restrict the freedom of Indians entering the Colony. I would naturally expect to have the full support of the Indian Government on that. There is absolutely no danger of the Colony getting swamped. The Courland, on one of her voyages, took back as many as a hundred new arrivals, and I, therefore, submit that the leaders should make sure of their facts before they put a drastic policy before the Colony. The free Indian population really remains stationary. The law of supply and demand  regulates  the inflow and outflow of passengers.
 Mr. Gandhi requested the reporter to convey to the editor of the
Advertiser his best thanks for allowing him to ventilate his views.
 In taking leave of Mr. Gandhi, the reporter laid stress on the very strong feeling against him at present in Durban, and advised him, for his own sake, to be exceedingly careful in regard to disembarking, since he was determined to land.

4,"January 	29, 1897",LETTER TO SIR WILLIAM W. HUNTERlibtech_27_footnote,"
  
 
 DURBAN,
     SIR,  January 	29, 1897    	I  reached Natal on  the 18th December but could not land  in 
  	Durban before the 13th January. The circumstances under which this 	delay occurred are very painful. The Indian community yesterday sent 	a very long telegramlibtech_28_footnoteto 	you narrating the events of the past 30 days. I venture to give 	below the circumstances that culminated in a demonstration by about 	5,000 Durban men to oppose the landing of passengers on board two 	ships Courland and Naderi, the first named being owned 	by Messrs Dada Abdoolla and Co. of Durban and the second by the 	Persian Steam Navigation Co. (of Bombay).  	About the beginning of August last,libtech_29_footnotelibtech_30_footnotethe 	 Tongaat  Sugar  Co. applied to the Immigration Trust Board for 	eleven Indian artisans to be brought under indenture.libtech_31_footnotelibtech_32_footnoteThis 	gave rise to an organized agitation by the European artisans against 	the Indians generally. Well-attended meetings of European artisans 	were held in Durban and Maritzburg and other towns to protest 	against the introduction of Indian artisans by the Sugar Co. who, 	yielding to the voice of the artisans, withdrew their application. 	But the agitation continued. The leaders assumed certain facts and 	allowed the agitation to develop into one against the Indians 	wholesale almost without discrimination. Angry correspondence 	condemning the Indians, mostly under noms de plume, 	went on. While this was going on, statements appeared in the 	Press to the effect that the Indians had organized an attempt to 	flood the Colony with free Indians. About this time appeared also 	Reuter’s telegramlibtech_33_footnotelibtech_34_footnoteregarding my pamphlet which enraged the Colonists. The 	telegram said that I had stated that Indians were robbed, assaulted, 	etc.        
 When, however, the papers received copies of the pamphlet, they acknowledged that I had stated nothing that was not stated in Natal before and that was not acknowledged to be correct. But the general populace, who formed their opinion of the pamphlet from Reuter’s summary, continued to retain their bitter feelings. Then came the wires regarding the Bombay and Madras meetings. These, while not inaccurate, were read together with Reuter’s summary and made the feelings more bitter.
 In the mean while, steamers continued to bring a large number of Indians. The arrivals were prominently reported and exaggerated. The almost equal returns by the same steamers passed unnoticed. And the artisans were led to believe without any ground that these steamers brought mostly Indian artisans. This gave rise to the formation of anti-Indian associationslibtech_35_footnoteat whose meetings  resolutions  were  passed asking the Natal Government to stop the influx of free Indians, to prevent Indians from owning landed property, etc. These associations are not much countenanced by the commercial people but are composed chiefly of artisans and a few professional men.
 At the time this was going on, two ships Courland and Naderi, bound for Natal and containing Indian passengers, were reported to be on the water. I was a passenger on board the Courland. I was to have gone by one of the British Indian boats, but the telegram from Durban, asking me to return at once, necessitated my taking passage by the Courland. As soon as the news became public property, the papers and the Durban Town Council urged that Bombay should be declared an infected port. The steamers reached Natal on the 18th and were placed under quarantine for 23 days from the day of leaving Bombay. Proclamation declaring Bombay an infected port was dated the 18th December and published in a Gazette Extraordinary on the 19th, that is, one day after the steamers’ arrival. The medical officer, who imposed five day, quarantine, making 23 days from the time of departure of the steamers from Bombay, was dismissed and another appointed in his stead. He boarded the steamers after the expiry of the first quarantine and imposed 12 days’ quarantine from that day. The Government had appointed a Committee to report as to how the two ships were to be treated and the reports said that 12 days’ quarantine
 
 “Memorial to Secretary of State for the Colonies"", 15-3-1897.
 after fumigation, etc., would be necessary. The medical officer gave instructions with regard to fumigation and disinfection during the time. These were carried out. Six days after this, an officer was placed on each ship to watch fumigation, etc. And after that, the medical officer came again and imposed a quarantine of 12 days from that day. Thus, even if the Committee’s report were justified, 11 clear days were wasted before the 12 days’ quarantine began.
 While the ships were thus lying in the outer anchorage, a local butcher, Mr. Harry Sparks, Captain, Natal Mounted Rifles of the Volunteer Force, published a notice under  his  signature  calling “every man in Durban to attend a public meeting to be held on the 4th January for the purpose of arranging a demonstration to proceed to  the  Point,  and   protest   against   the   landing   of   Asiatics.”libtech_36_footnoteThis meeting was very largely attended and held in the Durban Town Hall. It was, however, a compliment that the more sober portion of the community held aloof from active participation in the movement. It is also worthy of notice that the associations before referred to did not take part in the movement. Dr. Mackenzie, one of the members of the Committee alluded to above, and Captain of the Naval Carbineers and Mr. J. S. Wylie, a local solicitor and Captain of the Durban Light Infantry, were the chief movers. Inflammatory speeches were made at the meeting. It was resolved that the Government should be called upon to return the passengers on the two ships to  India  at  the Colony’s expense and “that every man at this meeting agrees and binds himself, with a view to assisting the Government to carry out the foregoing resolution, to do all his country may require of him and with that view will, if necessary, attend at the Point at any time when required.” The meeting also suggested that the quarantine should be further extended and that a special session be called, if necessary, to extend it, thus, in my humble opinion, showing clearly that the previous quarantine was meant to vex the Indians into returning to India.
 The Government, in their telegraphic reply to the resolutions, said that they had no power “apart from such as may be conferred by the quarantine laws to prevent the landing in the Colony of any class of Her Majesty’s subjects” and deprecated action suggested by the second resolution quoted above. There-upon another meeting was
 
 held in the Town Hall. Mr. Wylie moved a resolution, which was carried, to the effect that a special session should be called to extend quarantine. The following are the significant passages of his speech:
 The Committee said if the Government did nothing, Durban would have to do it herself and go in force to the Point and see what could be done. They capped that by remarking “we presume that you, as representing the Government and good authority of this Colony, would have to bring force to oppose us.” Mr. Escombe, the Attorney-General and Minister of Defence, said, “We will do nothing of the sort. We are with you and we are going to do nothing of the sort to oppose you. But, if you put us in such a position, we may have to go to the Governor of the Colony and ask him to take over the reins of this Colony as we can no longer conduct the Government. You will have to find some other persons.
 The second resolution was that, “We proceed by demonstration to the Point on the arrival of the Indians but each man binds himself to conform to the orders of his leaders.” The speakers inflamed the hearers particularly against me. A document that was issued for signatures was thus headed: “List of names of members (trade or profession mentioned) who are willing to proceed to the Point and resist by force, if necessary, the landing of Asiatics and to obey any orders which may be given by the leaders.” The next stage in the movement was for the Demonstration Committee to send an ultimatum to the Captain of the Courland, saying that passengers should return to India at the Colony’s expense and that, if they did not do so, their landing would be resisted by thousands of Durban men. This was practically ignored.
 While the movement was thus progressing, the Agents communicated with the Government and asked for protection of passengers. No reply was vouchsafed until the day on which the ships were brought in, on the 13th instant. Not much remains to be added to the telegram, of which a copy is enclosed herewith. As to the assault on me, it was due to the misrepresentations that appeared about me in the papers. The assault itself was the work of irresponsible persons and by itself need not be noticed at all. Of course, I narrowly escaped being lynched. The papers agree in saying that I did nothing that another in my place would not have done. I may also state that, after the assault, I was treated kindly by the Government officials and afforded protection.
 The Government now intend to introduce, in March next, laws restricting the influx of the Indians. Town Councils have been asking
 the Government for widest powers to enable them to prevent Indians from taking out licences to trade, owning landed property, etc. What the outcome will be it is difficult to say. Our only hope lies in you and the gentlemen working in London in our behalf. In any case, it is time some declaration was made as to the policy of the Home Government with regard to the Indians going outside India. The continuation of assisted immigration to Natal under the circumstances seems to be a great anomaly. There is absolutely no danger of the  Asiatics swamping the Colony. There is no competition between Indian and European artisans. It may almost be said that for every Indian coming to Natal one returns to India. The whole of this matter will be fully dealt with in a memorial to Mr. Chamberlain that is in course of preparation. This letter has been sent in the mean while to furnish you with a brief summary of the past events. We are aware that your time is otherwise well occupied. But, however reluctant we may be to trouble you with our sorrows, we find no escape from the course if we are to get justice.
 Thanking you on behalf of the Indian community in Natal,
 I remain,
 Your obedient servant,

  	Many Indians, intending to proceed to the Transvaal via 	Charlestown find difficulty in crossing the border. Some days 	ago, the official on the border allowed Indians possessing £25 to 	proceed to their destination in the Transvaal. Now it is said the 	official on the border would not allow the Indians to cross the 	border under any circumstances, though some may have been able to do 	so.

         DURBAN, 
   THE 	EDITOR, 	The Natal Mercury  SIR,  February 	2, 1897 
  	I venture to offer a few remarks on the Indian famine, regarding 	which appeal for funds has been made to the British Colonies. It is 	not perhaps generally known that India is the poorest country in  	the world, in spite of the fabulous accounts of the riches of her 	Rajas and Maharajas. The highest Indian authorities state that “the 	remaining fifth (i.e., of the population of British India), or 	40,000,000,  go through life on insufficient food”. This is the 	normal condition of British India. Famines, as a rule, recur in 	India every four years. It must not be difficult to imagine what the 	condition of the people would be at such a time in that 	poverty-stricken country. Children are snatched from their mothers, 	wives from their husbands. Whole tracts are devastated, and this in 	spite of the precautions taken by a most benevolent Government. Of 	the famines of recent times, that of 1877- 78 was the most severe. 	The famine commissioners thus report as to the death-rate:  It 	has been estimated, and, in our opinion, on substantial grounds, 	that the mortality which occurred in the Provinces under British 	administration, during the period of famine and drought extending 	over the years 1877 and 1878, amounted, in a population of 	197,000,000 to 52,50,000 in excess of the deaths that would have 	occurred had the seasons been ordinarily healthy. The 	total expenditure during the crisis was over £11,000,000.  	The present famine bids fair to beat the record in point of 	severity. The distress has already become acute. The worst time has 	yet to come, when summer sets in. This is the first time, I believe, 	that the British Colonies have been appealed to from India, and it 	is to be    
 hoped the response will be generous. The Central Famine Committee at Calcutta must have exhausted all the resources before deciding to appeal to the Colonies. And it will be a great pity if the response is not adequate to the urgency of the appeal.
 It is true that the outlook is not particularly cheerful even in South Africa, but it will be admitted that there can be no comparison between the distress in India and that in South Africa. And even if there should be a call on the purse of the Natal magnates on behalf of the South African poor, I venture to trust that that would not deter them from dipping their hands deep into their purses on behalf of millions of their fellow-subjects in India, who are on the verge of starvation. Whether it be in the United Kingdom or in the Colonies, I am sure British philanthropy will assert itself, as it has on previous occasions, on behalf of suffering humanity, no matter where and how often.

7,"February 	3, 1897",APPEAL FOR FUNDSlibtech_38_footnote,"
         DEAR 	COUNTRYMEN,      [February 	3, 1897] 
  	While we are having our meals daily, hundreds of thousands are dying 	of hunger in India. The dark shadow of famine has caused a gloom 	over our dear country. The people of India have applied to all under 	the British flag to send help to the starving millions there. It is, 	perhaps, not known to all of us that, without famine, 40,000,000 in 	India do not know what it is to have their hunger satisfied from 	year’s end to year’s end. Imagine, then, what must be the 	condition of our brethren in India during these distressing times. 	Under such circumstances, it is the duty of every Indian, who is 	able to get sufficient to feed himself, to part with something for 	the sake of the dying. It will not do for us to say, ‘I gave 	something only yesterday    
 towards this fund or that.’ You would not say so if you saw a man dying at your door of hunger; you would give all you may have to satisfy the hunger of that dying man. In the present case, the only difference is that millions are dying of hunger far away from you in a place which is your Motherland, from which you derive your status whatever it may be, and with whose welfare yours is indissolubly bound up. It would not also do to say that what you may give will be of no use to the ocean of sufferers in India. This is a mistake. If all were to argue that way, there will be no help for them. It is the drops that make the ocean. It is, therefore, the duty of every one of us to give the utmost we can towards the Relief Fund.
 If you are not in affluent circumstances, it should be a duty to deny yourself something—some luxury, some jewellery, anything that is not absolutely necessary for you.
 The funds will be in the hands of a Committee. The names of all who give 10s. or more will be published in newspapers in India and everyone will get a receipt, signed by Mr. M. K. Gandhi for the Famine Relief Committee, countersigned by the person or persons receiving the contributions. The Committee consists of Messrs Dada Abdoolla and Co., Messrs Mahomed Cassim Camroodeen and Co., Messrs Azam Gulam Hussain and Co., Mr. Mohanlal Ray, Mr. Syed Mahomed, Rev. Simon Velaman, Mr. Adamji Miyakhan, Mr. Parsee Rustomji, Mr. Peermahomed Dawoodji, Mr. Moosa Hajee Cassim, Messrs Dawood Mahomed and Co., Mr. Dunn, Mr. Royappan, Mr Lawrence, Mr. Godfrey, Mr. Osman Ahmed, Mr. Joshua, Mr. Gabriel, Mr. Hajee Abdoola, Mr. Hasam Sumar, Mr. Peeran Mahomed, Mr. Mogararia, Mr. Gandhi and others.
It is expected that the Indians in the Colony will furnish at least
 £1,000 for the sufferers, though there is no reason why the funds should not amount to £2,000 and more. It will all depend upon your generosity and sympathy for your brethren in India.
 No money should be given without a receipt in English and Tamil, signed by Mr. M. K. Gandhi and countersigned by  the  receiver.

 J. B. ROBINSON, ESQ. JOHANNESBURG
 SIR,
 We, as representing the Indian community in Natal, beg respectfully to approach you, as a Leader of the British community in Johannesburg, on a matter which, we are confident, has your entire sympathy and support.
 The present famine in India beats all previous records, and the alarming condition to which people have been reduced by starvation and consequent evils is unparalleled in the annals of Indian famines. The acute suffering is so widespread the authorities as well as the public have called forth the utmost resources of Indian charity. Relief Fund Committees have been formed in all parts of India, but they are found to be entirely and absolutely inadequate to stem the rising tide of distress. The population is being rapidly decimated in spite of the efforts of those that are working heart and soul for the poor, suffering masses of humanity. The Government and the people of India cannot cope with the horrors of the calamity in an effective way, and no wonder the English public has stretched its ever-ready helping hand.
 The Press in England has taken up the matter in right earnest, and as you are aware, a Mansion Houselibtech_40_footnoteFund has been opened. It is stated that even foreign powers have promised help.
 Probably, this is the first time in the history of Indian famines that the Colonies have been asked to open relief funds, and we have no doubt every loyal British subject will gladly avail himself of the opportunity of offering what material assistance be can to lessen the horrible suffering of his tens of millions of starving fellow-subjects.
 Realizing his responsibility and recognizing his duty, our Mayor has already started a fund in response to Calcutta cablegram from the Chief Justice of Bengal on behalf of Central Committee there.libtech_41_footnoteIndians
 
 in all parts of the world have been moving actively in the matter, and in Durban alone, by yesterday, they subscribed about £700, two firms contributing over £100 each and one £75 and there are good grounds for the hope that the collection might amount to about £1,500.
 We have taken the liberty to approach you, Sir, because we are confident you will sympathize with our aims and objects;  we, therefore, venture to request you to start a relief fund. There is no doubt, with your immense influence and energy, you are in position to help materially the public of India in their endeavours to relieve the suffering millions from the terrible consequences of the prevailing famine, and we feel sure that Johannesburg, with its immense riches, can do much more in this direction than all other parts of South Africa put together.
 We may be permitted to state here that we have appealed to the Indians in different parts of South Africa to do all they can in this matter.
 Hoping that this will receive your immediate attention and with apologies for encroaching upon your precious time,
 We remain, Sir,
 Your obedient servants

 March 15, 1897
 THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN HER MAJESTY’S PRINCIPAL SECRETARY OF STATE
 FOR THE COLONIES LONDON
 THE MEMORIAL OF THE UNDERSIGNED INDIANS RESIDING IN THE COLONY OF NATAL
 HUMBLY SHEWETH:
 That your Memorialists, as representing the Indian community in Natal, hereby venture to approach you with reference to the Indian question in Natal, with special regard to the demonstration that took place in Durban on the 13th January, 1897, headed  by  Captain  Sparks, a commissioned officer, to protest against the landing of Asiatics on board the s.s. Courland and s.s. Naderi, two Indian-owned ships which arrived in Durban on the 18th day of December, 1896 with about 600 passengers, which culminated in an assault on one of them who was saved from being lynched by the tact of the Durban Borough Police.libtech_47_footnote
 The Indian community in Natal has been suffering from various legal disabilities for a very long time, some of which have been made the  subject  of  memorials  to  Her  Majesty’s  Government.libtech_48_footnotelibtech_49_footnoteIn  those memorials, it has been pointed out that the ultimate extinction of the Indian as a free man is the goal of the Colonists, and that every disability placed on the Indian becomes the forerunner of many more, and that his position is to be so reduced that he cannot exist in the Colony, except as (to quote the Attorney-General of Natal) “a hewer of wood and drawer of water”, till the end of his lifetime. On these and such grounds, it was urged that legislation restrictive of the freedom of the Indians in Natal should not be sanctioned by Her Majesty’s Government. While, whoever, Her Majesty’s Government sympathized with the object of the memorials, they were reluctant to
 
 refuse the Royal sanction to some of the Bills objected to in the memorials. The encouragement, obtained from the more or less successful issue of their first and test experiments to carry out the final object, has resulted in the formation by the Europeans, during the last seven months, of anti-Indian associations, and the question has assumed a very acute phase. Under the circumstances, your Memorialists, in the interests of the Indian community in Natal, feel it to be their duty to place a review of the last seven months’ anti-Indian agitation before Her Majesty’s Government.
 On the 7th April, 1896, the Tongaat Sugar Company applied to the Immigration Trust Board, indenting for the following Indian artisans—one each: brick-layer, plate-layer, plasterer, house-painter, carriage-builder, wheelwright, carpenter, blacksmith, fitter, turner, iron-moulder, and coppersmith. The Trust Board granted the application. As soon as this information was published in the newspapers, a storm of protest arose of the Colony.  Meetings  to protest against the action of the Trust Board were advertised for in the local papers, both in Pietermaritzburg and Durban. The first meeting was held in Durban, on the 11th day of August, and is reported to have been largely attended, where angry speeches were made. As a result of the agitation, the Tongaat Sugar Company withdrew their application in the following terms: “As our application for the above appears to have met with an opposition entirely unforeseen on our part, we have decided to withdraw it.” The agitation, however, did not die with the withdrawal. Meetings continued to be held and the speakers went beyond the scope thereof. Your memorialists humbly think that the protest against the application was perfectly justified, in so far as the introduction of skilled labour under State protection was contemplated; and that, had the agitation remained within proper bounds, the events that followed might not have taken place. Some of the speakers at those meetings laid stress on the fact that the Indians could not fairly be blamed in the matter, and that it was the Sugar Company that was entirely to blame. The tone, however, of most of the speeches was such as to easily inflame the passions  of the audience. The correspondence in the newspapers also was carried on much the same way. Facts were at a heavy discount; the whole Indian question was opened up; and Indians were condemned wholesale. The meetings, in your Memorialists’ humble opinion, amply justified the contention of the Indian community that the Indians are the most hated and misunderstood community in the Colony. They were called
 “black vermin”. A speaker at one of the Maritzburg meetings said: “A coolie could live on the smell of an oily rag.” One  of the  audience at that meeting said: “They breed like rabbits, those that are here”, and another added: “The worst of it is we can’t shoot them down.” At one of the Durban meetings, a voice from the audience said, with reference to the application: “If the Indian artisans come, we will go to the Point and stop them.” Another said at the same meeting: “A coolie is not a man.” Thus, it will be seen that the material for the events of January last was being prepared in August, 1896. Another feature of this agitation was that the working classes were induced to take an active interest in the matter.
 Hardly had the time for proper reflection over the action of the Trust Board come, when the following telegram appeared in the newspapers, on September 14th, 1896, through Reuter’s agency:
 A pamphlet published in India declares that the Indians in Natal are robbed and assaulted and treated like beasts, and are unable to obtain redress. The Times of India advocates an inquiry into these allegation.
 This telegram naturally roused the indignation of the Colony, and added fuel to the fire. The pamphlet referred to was a statement of the grievances of the British Indians in South Africa by Mr. M. K. Gandhi, who was appointed by the representatives of the Indian community in South Africa to “represent the grievances the Indians are labouring under in South Africa, before the authorities and public men and public bodies in India”.libtech_50_footnote
 It is necessary for your Memorialists to digress a little, and to clear up the position. Your Memorialists have no hesitation in saying that the contents of the telegram are not borne out by the pamphlet. This was admitted by all who read both. The Natal  Mercury,  on reading the pamphlet, changed the angry attitude it had taken up on seeing the telegram, in the following words:
 Mr. Gandhi, on his part and on behalf of his countrymen, has done nothing that he is not entitled to do, and from his point of view, the principle he is working for is an honourable and a legitimate one. He is within his rights, and so long as he acts honestly and in a straightforward manner, he cannot be blamed nor interfered with. So far as we know, he has always done so, and his latest pamphlet we cannot honestly say is an unfair statement of the case from his point of view. Reuter’s cable is a gross exaggeration of Mr.
 
 Gandhi’s statement. He enumerates only a number of grievances, but these by no means justify anyone in stating that his pamphlet declares that the Indians in Natal are robbed and assaulted and treated like beasts and are unable to obtain redress. (18th September, 1896)
 The Natal Advertiser of the same date says:
 A perusal of Mr. Gandhi’s pamphlet, recently published in Bombay, leads to the conclusion that the telegraphic description of its objects and contents was considerably exaggerated. True, Mr. Gandhi complains of a certain amount of ill-treatment of indentured Indians, but there is nothing to warrant the statement that he alleges that the Indians in Natal are robbed, assaulted and treated like beasts. His is rather the old, familiar grievance that the Indian is regarded and treated by Europeans as belonging to a separate class and race, and not one of themselves. From Mr. Gandhi’s point of view this is very deplorable and it is easy to sympathize with him and his compatriots.
 To return, although a select few could treat the above telegram at its proper value, the generality kept up their idea of the pamphlet in India derived from the telegram. Correspondence went on in the newspapers, inflaming the Europeans against the Indians. An association, called the European Protection Association, was formed in Maritzburg on the 18th day of September, 1896, at a meeting, according to reports, attended by about 30 persons. Although this meeting was the direct outcome of the action of the Trust Board above referred to, the programme of the Association is very comprehensive.
 The principal efforts of the Association, according to The Natal Witness of the 8th October, 1896, will be directed to  the  further reform of the laws regulating the introduction of Asiatics into the Colony, and special attention will be directed to (a) withdrawal of all State-aid, assistance or countenance from all bodies of persons connected with Indian or other Asiatic immigration; (b) press upon Parliament the necessity of enacting such rules and regulations as will really compel the Indian to leave the Colony at the expiration of his term of indenture; (c) take all steps that may be found advisable for limiting the number of Indians introduced into the Colony; and (d) to endeavour to have the Australian laws as to immigration made applicable to Natal.
 Following upon that was established an association in Durban on the 26th day of November, 1896, called the Colonial Patriotic Union. The object of the Union is stated to be “to prevent the further influx
 of free Asiatics into the country”. The following passages occur in the statement published by the Union:
 By preventing the further immigration of Asiatic  races  into  this Colony, the interests of Europeans, natives, and Asiatics now in the country will be protected. The Union will in no way interfere with the introduction of indentured labourers, provided such labourers, with their wives and children, if any, shall be returnable to India on completion of their indentures.
 The Union have been canvassing signatures to the following petition addressed to the Government:
 We the undersigned inhabitants of the Colony of Natal do hereby most respectfully petition the Government to adopt measures which would prevent the influx of Asiatic races into this Colony: ‘(1) The older and richer British Colonies of Australia and New Zealand have found that this class of immigrant is detrimental to the best interests of inhabitants, and have passed laws having as their object the total exclusion of Asiatics. (2) The disproportion between white and black races is already so great in this Colony that it appears highly injudicious to further increase this disproportion. (3) The continued introduction of Asiatic races is in the highest sense detrimental to the natives of this Colony from the fact that so long as the cheaper Asiatic supply is available so long will the civilization of the natives be retarded, their civilization depending upon their intercourse with the white races. (4) The low moral tone and insanitary habits of Asiatics are a constant source of danger to the progress and health of the European population.’
 The Government have declared themselves in entire sympathy with the Union programme. It will be seen that, as your Memorialists feared when the Immigration Law Amendment Bill was passed,libtech_51_footnotelibtech_52_footnotewhich has unfortunately received the sanction of the Home Government, it was simply a step towards further restriction. Whether the Government would bring in a Bill having for its object completion  of  the indentures in India is another matter. But, your Memorialists humbly submit, the fact remains that the yielding by Her Majesty’s  Government to the desire of the European Colonists to establish the principle of compulsory return of the indentured Indians after the completion of their contracts has encouraged them to ask for more. The Indian community is expected to join in a leonine partnership:
 
 the Indians are to give all but to receive nothing worth mentioning. Your Memorialists earnestly hope that, whatever be the ultimate outcome of the present position, Her Majesty’s Government will never countenance so obviously iniquitous an arrangement and stop further State-aided emigration from India to Natal.
 The petition of the Union discloses a sad want of knowledge and grave prejudice on the part of the promoters thereof. Your Memorialists need hardly say that the British Colonies alluded to have not yet been allowed to pass the class legislation of the  nature indicated therein. As The Natal Mercury, in a leading article on November 28, reminded the Union, “the fact of the matter is that the Acts in operation in those Colonies are almost solely directed against Chinese.” And, even if such Acts were to come into operation in future, there is hardly any analogy between this Colony  and  the others. Natal cannot do without the Indian labourers; it would shut the door against Indians above that level. This is hardly consistent. The Australian Colonies, on the other hand, would have this much in their favour that they would, if they could, exclude all Indians without distinction.
 The disproportion between white and black races is certainly very great; but, even if the Indians were to be classed amongst black races, they are not responsible for it, for it is caused owing to there being over 400,000 natives of South Africa, as against 50,000 Europeans. The Indians, who number about 51,000, cannot materially affect the proportion even if their number were to  increase  to  100,000. The petition states that the introduction “of Asiatic races is in the highest sense detrimental to the natives of  this  Colony,” because of the cheaper Asiatic supply. Now the natives can, if at all, only take the place of the indentured Indians; but the Union does not propose to do away with the indentured Indians. In fact, the highest authorities have stated it as their opinion that the natives cannot, and will not, do the work now being done by the indentured Indians; the very fact that, in spite of all this agitation, the demand for indentured Indians is greater than ever, as seen from the reports of the Immigration Department, proves this; and it is admitted that there is no competition whatever between the free Indians, who alone  the Union objects to, and the natives. As to the allegation about the low moral tone and insanitary habits of Indians, your Memorialists need hardly say anything: it simply shows to what extent prejudice has
 carried the promoters away. Your Memorialists would, however, crave leave to refer Her Majesty’s Government to Dr. Veale’s and other certificates of the same tenor, annexed to the petition with regard to the Transvaal Indian Arbitration, to the effect that class considered, the Indians live better and in better habitations than the Europeans.libtech_53_footnoteIf, however, the Indians do not attend to sanitation as well as the Europeans, the laws are there to see that they do not neglect the duty of observing the sanitary rules. Be that as it may, these meetings, the correspondence they gave rise to, and the statements made therein, without particular regard to accuracy, kept up and added to the excitement of the populace.
 On the 18th of December came the two ill-fated steamers the Courland and the Naderi, the first named being owned by a local Indian firm and the second named by the Persian Steam Navigation Company of Bombay, which was under the agency of the owners of the Courland. In dealing with the events after the arrival of the two ships, your Memorialists disclaim any intention to ventilate a personal grievance. The question, as affecting Messrs Dada Abdulla & Company personally as owners and agents of the ships, your Memorialists would endeavour to avoid, except when it is necessary to refer to it in the interests of the Indian community as a whole. The bills of health received by the steamers at Bombay, at the time of departure, stated that there was a mild form of bubonic plague raging in certain districts of Bombay; the steamers, therefore, entered the bay flying the quarantine flag, although there was an absolutely clean bill of health during the voyage. (App. A and B.) The s.s. Naderi left the Prince’s Dock, Bombay, on the 28th, and the s.s. Courland on the 30th of November, 1896. The steamers, on their arrival, were placed in quarantine by the Health Officer “until 23 days had elapsed since leaving Bombay”. By a proclamation which appeared in  a  Government Gazette Extraordinary, on the 19th December, 1896, Bombay was declared to be an infected port. On the same day, the owners and agents wrote to the Health Officer, on the strength of a newspaper report, asking the cause of the ships being put in quarantine. (App. C.) No reply was sent to that communication. On the 21st of the same month, a telegram was sent by the owners’ solicitors, Messrs Goodricke, Laughton and Cooke, to the Honourable the Colonial Secretary of Natal with reference to the matter, and
 
 asking if His Excellency the Governor would receive a deputation. (App. D.) Reply thereto was received from Maritzburg on the 22nd that there would be no need of a deputation, for reasons stated in Appendix E. But after their solicitors had despatched the telegram, they were informed that His Excellency was in Durban, whereupon they wrote a letter to the Honourable Harry Escombe to much the same effect (App. F), and a reply thereto was received, saying that, while the ministers would be referred to for advice in the matter, if it was so wished, a deputation would be received by His Excellency on the 23rd. (App. G.) On the 22nd the master of the Courland signalled as follows: “Our days have expired; are we out of quarantine? Please consult Quarantine Officer, report we all well. Thanks.” (App. A.) To this a reply was signalled to the effect that the length of quarantine was not decided till then. A similar signal was sent from the Naderi with a similar result. Your Memorialists may here parenthetically remark that the owners and agents were kept absolutely in the dark as to what was going on between the masters of the vessels and the officers on shore. On the 23rd, a reply to signals from the Naderi said: “Quarantine Officer has no instructions yet.” (App. B.) From the solicitors’ letter (App. P), it appears that since the Health Officer had ordered that the ships were to remain in quarantine until 23 days had elapsed after the day of their departure from Bombay, he was suspended or dismissed, and Dr. Birtwell put in his place. On the 24th, Dr. Birtwell and the Superintendent of Water Police boarded the vessels and examined passengers and crew, gave instructions as to disinfection, fumigation and burning of soiled clothing, all mats, baskets and useless articles in the donkey furnace, and imposed 11 and 12 days’ quarantine on the Courland and Naderi respectively. (App. A & B.) In accordance with the instructions, much of the old clothing, mats, etc., were burnt, and fumigation and disinfection carried on. On the 28th, a police officer boarded each vessel with instructions to superintend the use of disinfectants. The  following signal was hoisted on the 29th, from the Courland: “Disinfection and fumigation carried out to satisfaction of officer on board.” A similar signal was also sent from the Naderi on the same day. The Courland signalled again: “We are ready, waiting for the Quarantine Officer”, and Dr. Birtwell went, inspected the ships, and declared himself satisfied with the manner in which his orders had been carried out; but placed both the ships under quarantine for a further period of 12 days from that day. Thereupon, the master of the Courland gave the signal
 that:
 
 
 By order of the Government, all passengers’ bed clothes having been burnt, request Government renew same at once, as passengers’ lives are in danger without them. Want written instructions how long quarantine is to last, as verbal time changes with every visit of Quarantine Officer. No case of sickness occurring in the interval. Give notice to the Government our ship has been disinfected every day since leaving Bombay.
The following was signalled from the Naderi on the 30th:
 Ask Government to supply at once 250 blankets for passengers, instead of those destroyed by Government. Passengers are suffering greatly without them. Otherwise disembark them at once. Passengers suffering from cold and wet; fear sickness in consequence.
These signals were altogether disregarded by the Government.
  	Happily, the Indian residents in Durban started a Quarantine Relief 	Fund, whereby blankets were supplied to all the passengers on both 	the ships, and also foodstuffs to the poor passengers, free of 	charge, involving an expense of not less than £125.  	While this was going on board the ships, the owners and agents were 	busy protesting against the quarantine and the somewhat capricious, 	because uncertain, ways in which the same was being enforced. They 	forwarded a petition to His Excellency the Governor, praying that, 	for reasons stated therein, the Medical Officer of the Port “be 	directed to grant pratique to the said vessels”. (App. H.) 	Certificates from medical gentlemen were attached to it showing 	that, in their opinion, the quarantine then intended and afterwards 	imposed on the ships was unnecessary. (Ann.libtech_54_footnoteto App. H.) A telegram was sent by the owners’ 	solicitors, asking for a reply to the petition (App. I), but none 	came. On the 24th December, the owners’ solicitors wrote to the 	acting Health Officer, requesting him to grant pratique to 	the said vessels on the grounds stated therein. (App. J.) The 	officer in question the same day wrote in reply:  I 	am endeavouring to do my duty as Health Officer with due regard to 	all interests. I am willing to authorize the placing in quarantine 	on the      
 Blufflibtech_55_footnoteat the cost of the ships, all persons intended to be landed, and when this is arranged for, pratique may be given to the ships after my instructions have been carried out. (App. K.)
Your Memorialists respectfully draw your attention to the fact
 that the Medical Officer fails to state what his instructions are, even in that letter. On the 25th, the owners’ solicitors wrote to the Acting Health Officer pressing for a reply to their question contained in their letter of the 24th. (App. L.) The Health Officer replied the same day that he did not consider it safe to grant pratique to the vessels except on the conditions stated by him. (App. M.) The owners’ solicitors wrote the same day expressing surprise that it did not contain any answer to their question, and pressing for the same, also asking for the exact conditions under which he would grant pratique. (App. N.) On the 26th, the Health Officer replied in the following terms:
 If the passengers are not landed into quarantine quarters, 12 days must run after fumigation of ship and precautions as regards clothing, namely, by washing and disinfecting, and the burning of sundry old rags, mats, socks, etc., in accordance with instructions given by me to each Captain, before pratique can be given. If the owners agree to bear the expense of quarantine, then the landing must be preceded by fumigation and precautions as above, and after the landing is effected, the departure of the steamers will be facilitated; but there must be no contact with shore except under proper restrictions. If you want to get the steamers away, the simplest course will be to arrange for the owners to bear the expense of quarantining the passengers on the Bluff for twelve days after fumigation, etc., of the ship, or for any longer period, should such necessity arise. (App. O.)
 The owners’ solicitors wrote in reply the same day, drawing his attention to the certificates given by Drs. Prince and Harrison above referred to, and protesting against the conditions imposed by him. They also protested that, although upwards of eight days had elapsed since the arrival of the steamers, no steps had been taken to disinfect the vessels in the way he had proposed. They further said that their clients refused to be party to any proceedings with  reference  to placing the passengers in quarantine on shore, as  they  did  not consider his refusal to grant pratique to be a legal action. They,
 
 moreover, recorded the facts that his predecessor had “stated as his opinion that pratique could be granted without danger, and that if he were permitted he would do so, but he was thereupon suspended,” and “that Drs. MacKenzie and Dumat, having been privately interviewed by Mr. Escombe on the question, were, at his suggestion, called in by him to give their opinion as to the refusing of pratique.” (App,. P.)
 While the correspondence was thus going on between the Government and the owners’ solicitors with reference to the quarantine, and while the passengers on board the two vessels were being subjected to grave inconvenience and hardship, an agitation was being got up in Durban with a view to prevent the landing of the quarantined passengers. The following notice appeared in The Natal Advertiser, for the first time on the 30th December,  above  the signature of “Harry Sparks, chairman of preliminary meeting”, one of Her Majesty’s commissioned officers:
 Wanted every man in Durban to attend a meeting to be held in the large room at the Victoria Cafe, on Monday the 4th January at 8 o’clock for the purpose of arranging a demonstration to proceed to the Point and protest against the landing of Asiatics.
 This meeting was ultimately held in the town hall of Durban. Inflammatory speeches were made, and some commissioned officers, besides Captain Sparks, also took part in the animated proceedings. The meeting is said to have been attended by about 2,000 persons, mostly of the artisan class. The following resolutions were passed at the meeting:
 That this meeting is strongly of opinion that the time has come to prevent the landing of any more free Indians or Asiatics in this Colony, and now calls upon the Government to take steps to have returned to India, at the Colony’s expense, the Asiatics at present on board the Naderi and Courland, and to prevent any other free Indians or Asiatics being landed in Durban.
 Every man at this meeting agrees and binds himself, with a view to assisting the Government to carry out the foregoing resolution, to do all his country may require of him, and with that view, will, if necessary, attend at the Point any time when required.
 The following are extracts from the speech of Dr. MacKenzie, the mover of the second resolution, and one of those who, as stated above, were called by Mr. Escombe to determine the period of quarantine:
 Mr. Gandhi, (prolonged hissing and hooting) that gentleman came to Natal and settled in the borough of Durban. He was received here freely and openly; all the privileges and advantages which the Colony could afford him were at his disposal. No contracting or circumscribing influence was brought to play upon him any more than on the audience or himself (the speaker), and he had all the privileges of their hospitality. In return, Mr. Gandhi had accused the Colonists of Natal of having dealt unfairly with Indians, and of having abused and robbed and swindled them. (A voice, ‘You can’t swindle a coolie.’) He (the doctor) quite agreed with that. Mr. Gandhi had returned to India and dragged them in the gutters, and painted them as black and filthy as his own skin. (Applause.) And this was what they might call, in Indian parlance, an honourable and manly return for the privileges which Natal had allowed him . .
 . . It was the intention of these facile and delicate creatures to make themselves proprietors of the only thing that the ruler of this country had withheld from them—the franchise. It was their intention to put themselves in Parliament and legislate for the Europeans; to take over the household management, and put the Europeans in the kitchen          Their country had decided that they had
 enough Asiatics and Indians here, and they were going to treat them fairly and well, provided they behaved themselves; but, if they were going to associate themselves with such men as Gandhi, and abuse their hospitality, and act in the way he had done, they might expect the same kind of treatment that was to be meted out to him. (Applause.) However great a misfortune it might be for those people, he could not get over the distinction between black and white.
 — The Natal Advertiser, 5th January.
 Comment is superfluous. That Mr. Gandhi has done nothing to justify the remarks about him will have been seen from what has preceded. That the Indians want legislative powers and that they want to put the Europeans in the kitchen, are but the products of the gallant doctor’s fertile imagination. These and such utterances would not have been noticed here but for the hold they had on the popular mind. The Government wired the following reply to Capt. Sparks’ telegraphic communication giving the text of the above resolutions:
 In reply, I am to state that the Government has at present no power, apart from such as may be conferred by the Quarantine Laws, to prevent the landing in the Colony of any class of Her Majesty’s subjects. I am to state, however, that the closest attention has been, is being, and will be given to this question, the extreme importance of which the Government most completely recognizes. Government is in full sympathy with the consensus of
 public opinion in this Colony as regards the desirability of preventing the overrunning of the Colony by Asiatics. Government is carefully discussing and considering this question with a view to future legislation; but I am to point out that its action will be thwarted rather than helped by any action or demonstration of the character indicated in the second resolution.
 Thus it would appear that the quarantine was meant more to harass the passengers into returning to India than to  protect the Colony against the introduction of the bubonic plague. The chairman then telegraphed the Government as follows:
 I am instructed by the Committee to thank you for wire, and have now to ask Government to convey to the Asiatics on board the Naderi and Courland the strong popular feeling against their landing, and request them to return to India at the Colony’s expense.
 Another meeting, convened by Captain Sparks, was held on the 7th January, again in the Town Hall, when the following resolutions were passed:
 That this meeting requests the Government to call a special session of Parliament to take steps to temporarily stop the importation of free Indians, pending the passing of law giving Government these powers; (and) that we proceed by demonstration to the Point on the arrival of the Indians, but each man binds himself to conform to the orders of the leaders.
 The speeches at the meeting clearly show that the Government were in full sympathy with its objects, that they would not oppose the mutinous tendency of the meeting, that the imposition of quarantine was nothing but a means to prevent, if possible, the landing of the passengers, and that a special session was to be called in order to pass  a Bill indefinitely extending the quarantine. The following are the extracts from the speeches which would illustrate these remarks:
 If the Government could not possibly help them, then (a voice, “help ourselves”) they must help themselves. (Loud applause.)
Capt. Wylie, in the course of his speech, is reported to have said:
 Now, they must be pleased to know this, that the action that they (the meeting) had taken had been characterized by the members of the Government as having done more for this cause than anything that had yet been done within the Colony. (Applause.)
 Thus, perhaps inadvertently but surely inducing the promoters to further action.
 But at the same time they have to bear in mind in carrying this thing through they must not do anything rash to frustrate the end they had in view. They must be careful not to blindly jump over the wharf and leave it clear for the others to land. (Laughter.)
 Dr. MacKenzie said at the last meeting that:
 The Indian Ocean was the proper place for those Indians (Laughter), let them have it. They were not going to dispute their right to the water there. But they must be careful not to give them the right to dispute the land adjoining that ocean. Mr. Escombe treated the Committee at an interview that morning, extending for about two hours, in a fair and reasonable manner. He said the Government were with them, and wished to help them and expedite the matter in every possible way. He said, however, that they must be careful not to do anything that would hamper the Government’s hands. In their argument to
 him, they replied: ‘If you do nothing, we will have to act ourselves, and go in force to the Point to see what could be done.’ (Applause.) They further capped that with the remark that the Government of the Colony would have to bring a force to oppose them. Mr. Escombe replied that they would do nothing of the sort (Applause); that the Government were with them, but, he continued, if they put the Government in such a position that they might have to go to the Governor and ask him to take over the reins of the Government, they would have to find some other person, (Interruption.)
 (This statement, your  Memorialists may remark, remains uncontradicted to the present day, and it can easily be imagined what impetus such a statement would give to the movement.)
 Some gentleman said ‘extend the quarantine’, that was exactly what Parliament was going to do. (Applause, and cries of ‘sink the ship’.) He heard  a naval volunteer say last night that he would give a month’s pay for a shot at the ship; was every man present prepared to pay down a month’s pay to carry out the object of that meeting? (Applause, and cries of assent.) Then the Government would know what they had behind them. One of the objects of the meeting was to convey to the Government the wish that they wanted a special session of Parliament to extend the quarantine. (Applause.) They must bear in mind that hasty legislation seldom reached its end; but there might be such legislation that would give them time, and protect them while they were fighting for proper legislation. They suggested to Mr. Escombe, and it met with his approval, that as the quarantine laws did not give power to extend the quarantine for an unlimited period, they asked that Parliament be  called together for one, two, or three days if need be, to pass a law which would enable them to say Bombay was an infected district. We declare it to be such,
 and until that proclamation was taken off, no Indian could come from Bombay to this Colony.libtech_56_footnote(Loud applause.) He thought that the deputation were quite entitled to infer from the meeting they had with Mr. Escombe that morning, that if they went the right way to work, and did not do anything to hamper the Government, they would get that session of Parliament at the earliest possible date, and thereby prevent the landing of more coolies until they could get time to pass a law which would last for ever. (Applause.)
 Dr. MacKenzie:
 The men of Durban were unanimous on that point (early Parliament). He said “the men of Durban,” because there were a few old women knocking about the place. (Laughter and cheers.) They had only to take the tone of some of the leaders in the papers, and some of the cautious and sage advice they had been meting out to them to get the type of the man who sticks behind the quill—the sort of man who urged that sort of thing—was the man who presumed to say that the burgesses did not know what was right. All but one man on board
 these boats, lying outside, had no reason to suspect that they would not be agreeably received as emigrants to this Colony. One man might reasonably be supposed to have some suspicions upon that point. That gentleman (Gandhi) was on board one of the boats, and in what he now said, he did not refer to him. They had the right to shut the Port, and they intended to shut it. (Applause.) They would deal fairly by the people, and by the men on these boats, and to that extent, by that solitary individual. But he hoped there would be a marked difference between the character of the dealing. When they got to the Point they would put themselves under their leader, and do exactly what he told them,  if he told them to do anything. (Laughter.)
 A document headed as follows was circulated amongst the Durban employees by the Demonstration Committee:
 List of names of members, trade or profession mentioned,libtech_57_footnotewho are willing to proceed to the Point and resist, by force if necessary, the landing of Asiatics, and to obey any orders which may be given by the leaders.
 The following passage from Captain Sparks’ concluding speech, at the meeting of the 7th, gives an idea of the methods adopted by the committee to enlist men to join the Demonstration:
 
 They intended to call upon the merchants of the town to close their places of business to allow the men who wished to take part in the Demonstration to do so. (Applause.) Then they would be able to see who was on their side. Several merchants had already promised to do all they could; others they wanted to show in their true colours. (Cries of “boycott them”.)
 At this stage it would be worth while to see what was happening between the owners and the Government to secure the peaceable landing of the passengers. Your Memorialists may here remark that the town, during the first week in January, was in a perfect state of excitement. It was a time of terror and anxiety for the Indian residents, and collision between the two communities was to be feared at any moment. On the 8th January, 1897, the owners and agents of the ships sent a petition to the Government drawing their attention to the state of public feeling that existed in Durban against the landing of Indians, and asking for “the protection of the Government for passengers and property against the lawless acts of any persons whoever they may be,” and signifying their readiness “to co-operate with  the Government in taking all the necessary steps for the landing of passengers quietly and unknown to the public in order to render unnecessary any act on the part of the Government which might tend to intensify the excitement” which then existed. (App. Q.) A letter was sent on the 9th January, further drawing the attention of the Government to the circulation of the document hereinbefore referred to for the forcible resistance against the landing of the passengers, as also to the fact that the railwaymen, being employees of the Government, were to take part in the Demonstration, and praying for assurance of the Government that “Government servants will be prohibited from taking any part in the Demonstration”. (App. R.) On the 11th January, the Principal Under-Secretary thus wrote in reply:
 Your proposals for the landing of the passengers quietly and unknown to the public is impossible. The Government understand that you have requested the Port Captain not to bring the vessel inside without special instructions. This action on your part, and your letters now under reply, show that you are aware of the intense feeling throughout the Colony against the landing of the Indians, and they certainly should be informed of the existence and strength of that feeling. (App. S.)
Your   Memorialists   here	cannot	help	regretting	that	the
 Government should have made the concluding remarks in that letter. Instead of giving an assurance of protection when it is asked, the Government advise the owners, in so many words, to induce the passengers to return. This letter, more than anything else, in your Memorialists’ humble opinion, shows that the Government indirectly countenanced the agitation, and betrayed their weakness, where a strong expression of opinion might have stifled it and produced a healthy confidence in their just intentions in the minds of the Indian community, apart from their policy with regard to the unrestricted immigration of Her Majesty’s Indian subjects. On the 10th January, the Honourable Mr. Harry Escombe being in Durban, Mr. Laughton, of the firm of Messrs Goodricke, Laughton & Cooke, the owners’ solicitors, took the opportunity to interview him, and wrote a letter to the honourable gentleman, embodying  the substance of their conference. (App. T.) From that letter it would appear that Mr. Escombe repudiated the statement attributed to him by Mr. Wylie and referred to above. It would also appear that the following propositions were recognized by the Government:
 That upon the requirements of the quarantine being carried out, pratique must be granted to the steamers Courland and Naderi; that upon pratique being granted, the steamers were entitled to discharge their passengers and cargo at the wharf, either by the steamers being brought inside, or by means of tugs and lighters; that the Government is responsible for the protection of passengers and cargo from the violence of rioters.
 The reply to the letter dated the 11th January (App. U) said that the interview referred to therein was, it was understood, to be regarded as a private meeting, and did not accept as correct Mr. Laughton’s record of what was said by the Honourable Mr. Escombe and Mr. Laughton. On the 12th January, Messrs Goodricke, Laughton and Cooke wrote in reply, explaining how the interview came to be regarded as not private by Mr. Laughton, and in order to avoid misunderstanding, applied for the correction of the alleged inaccuracies committed by Mr. Laughton in recording the interview. (App. V.) So far as your Memorialists are aware, no reply  was  returned thereto. On the same day the owners wrote to Mr. Escombe in reply to the Principal Under-Secretary’s letter, dated 11th January. (App. S.) Their letter expressed surprise at there being no reference in that communication to the various points brought to the notice of the
 Government. It contained the following paragraph:
 The steamers have now been at the outer anchorage for 24 days, at a cost of £150 per diem to us; and this being so, we trust you will see the reasonableness of your giving us a full answer by noon tomorrow. And we think it right to inform you that failing a definite reply giving us an assurance that we shall be paid £150 per diem from Sunday last, and that you are taking steps to suppress the rioters so as to enable us to disembark the steamers, preparations will be at once commenced to steam into the harbour, relying on the protection which, we respectfully submit, Government is bound to give us. (App. W.)
 Mr. Escombe wrote as follows in reply, from the Point, at 10.45 a.m., on the 13th:
 The Port Captain has instructed that the steamers shall be ready to cross the bar inwards at 12 o’clock today. The Government needs no reminder of its responsibility for the maintenance of order. (App. X.)
 This was the first assurance that the owners received from the Government with regard to the safety of the passengers, and as will appear hereinafter, after all the resources, including threats of violence to induce the passengers to return to India, had been exhausted.
 To turn now to the steamers. On the 9th January, the following signal was put up from the Naderi: “ Quarantine finished. When shall  I obtain pratique; please reply,” and the Courland put up a similar signal on the 10th. But the pratique was not granted until after the noon of the 11th January, 1897. On the same day a letter was received by the master of the Courland, dated the 8th January, 1897, and signed “Harry Sparks, Chairman of Committee”, which reads:
 Neither you nor your passengers may be aware that the feeling in the Colony against the inflow of Asiatics has been running very high lately, and has culminated on the arrival of your ship and the Naderi. Following on that, public meetings have been held in Durban, at which the enclosed resolutions were carried with acclamation. So largely attended were these meetings that all desiring it could not get into the Town Hall. Almost every man in Durban has signed signifying his intention to prevent those on board your ship and the Naderi landing in the Colony, and we are most desirous there should, if possible, be avoided a conflict between the men of Durban and  your  passengers which will most assuredly happen if they attempt to land. As your passengers are ignorant of the state of feeling, and have come here in ignorance, and we have it from the Attorney-General that if your people are
 willing to return to India, the Colony will pay the expense. We shall, therefore, be glad to receive and answer from you before the ship comes alongside the wharf, whether the passengers elect to return to India at the Colony’s expense, or to endeavour to force a landing against the thousands of men who are ready and waiting to oppose their landing. (App. Aa.)
 The masters of both the vessels, on learning that there was an intense feeling against the landing of the passengers, that the Government were in sympathy with the agitation, and that they practically failed to assure protection to passengers, and that the Demonstration Committee practically represented the Government (as would appear from the Committee’s letter to the master of the Courland, from their unrestricted interference with the passengers on board the s.s. Greek, of the Union Steam Ship Company’s fleet, which arrived on 11th January from Delagoa Bay with some Indian passengers, from the acquiescence of the Port officials in their conduct, as also from the willingness of the Union Steam Ship Company’s management to “obey the orders” of the Committee, etc.), naturally became anxious about the safety of their charge and were induced to parley with the Committee. Consequently, they went ashore on the evening of 11th January, and held consultations with the Demonstration Committee, in the course of which a document was drawn up by the Committee for signature of the captains (App. Wa), which, however, they could not sign, and the negotiations thus fell through.
 It might be as well to examine the position of the committee at the time immediately preceding the Demonstration. One of the spokesmen of the Committee, Dr. Mackenzie, observed:
 “Their position was the same as at first, viz., that none of the Indians were to land” (Applause).
 Another member of the Committee, Captain Wylie, in the course of a speech, in response to “Where is Gandhi?”, said:
 “Where they hoped he would remain. ‘Had they’ (deputation sent by the Committee to the steamers) ‘seen him?’ No. The Captain of the Courland had treated Gandhi as he treated the other passengers. (Applause.) He knew their opinion regarding him. There was not much more he could tell them. ‘Have you the tar ready for him? Is he going back?’ It was their sincere hope that the Indians would be going back. If not, then the Committee would want the men of Durban.
 The Natal Advertiser (16th January) says “:
 
 When the signal was received that the Courland and Naderi were daring to come into Port, and the trumpeters galloped through the streets and borough shortly after 10 o’clock on Wednesday morning, the general impression was that the poor Indians were in for a rough time if they attempted to land, and that even if they remained on board, afraid to disembark, they would be deafened and scared into hysterics by the hooting, groaning, and the jeering  of the assembly. But the end was to be the same as originally intended—”no landing at any price”.
 Long before the owners were informed that the ships were to be brought in that day, the town knew it. The bugles to  rally  were sounded at 10.30 a.m., the shopkeepers put down their shutters, and people began to flock to the Point, The following is an account of the muster at the Point, taken from The Natal Advertiser:
 Shortly before 12 o’clock, the muster on Alexandra Square was completed, and as far as could be ascertained, the sections were as follows: Railwaymen, 900 To 1,000—Wylie, leader; assistants: G. Whelan, W. Coles, Grant, Erlsmont, Dick, Duke, Russell, Calder, Titheridge. Yacht Club, Point Club, and Rowing Club, 150—Mr. Dan Taylor, leader; assistants: Messrs Anderton, Goldsbury, Hutton, Harper, Murray Smith, Johnston, Wood, Peters, Anderson, Cross, Playfair, Seaward. Carpenters and Joiners, 450—Puntan, leader; assistants: H. W. Nichols, Jas. Hood, T. G. Harper. Printers, 80—Mr.
  D. 	Sykes, leader; 	assistants: W. P. 	Plowman, E. 	Edwards, J. 	Shackleton, E. 	Trolley, T. 	Armstrong. Shop 	Assistants, about. 	400—Mr. A. A. Gibson, 	J. McIntosh, 	leaders; assistants: Messrs H. 	Pearson, W. 	H. Kinsman, J. 	Pardy, Dawson, 	S. Adams, 	A. Mummery, 	J. Tyzack, 	Johns, J. Rapson, 	Banfield, Etheridge, 	Austin. Tailors and 	Saddler, 70—J. C. 	Armitage, leader; assistants: 
 H. Mulholland, G. Bull, R. Godfrey, E. Manderson, A. Rose, J. W. Dent, C. Dowse. Plasterers and Bricklayers, 200—Dr. MacKenzie, leader; assistants: Horner, Keal, Brown, Jenkinson. Point men, a small section—J. Dick, Leader; assistants: Gimber, Clackston, Poyson, Elliott, Parr. General public, about 1,000—T. Adams leader; P. F. Garbutt, Downard. Native section, 500—Mr. G. Spradbrow and Mr. R. C. Vincent organized the natives, and kept them in order on Alexandra Square, while the Demonstration was going on. They told the natives they had appointed a dwarf native as their leader. They were highly amused with this diminutive chap, who marched up and down in front of their ranks officering them, while they went through a number of exercises with their sticks, and danced and whooped. This proved an excellent diversion to
 keep the natives out of trouble. Later on, Supt. Alexander appeared on  horseback and moved them off the Square.
 Your Memorialists cannot do better than quote again from the same paper of 14th a description as to how the steamers were brought in, and what happened then:
 Great uncertainty was felt on board the vessels as to what form the Demonstration would assume. Capt. Milne, of the Courland, who exhibited the bolder attitude of the two, was allowed to have his vessel taken in first, although she lay further up the coast than the Naderi. He decided that some efforts should be made to protect his passengers, as he had received no assurance from Government that any steps had been taken to do so. He, therefore, had the Union Jack run up at the forecastle head, the red ensign was placed above the ship’s house flag at the main mast, and the red ensign was also exhibited at the stern. His instructions to his officers were to prevent any demonstrators from coming aboard, if possible, but that, if they did come aboard, to haul down the Union Jack and present it to the invaders, his idea being that no Englishman would seek to molest those on board after this surrender. Fortunately, as matters resulted, it was not necessary to have recourse to this action. As the Courland entered the bay, all eyes were on the look-out to see what form the demonstration was taking. A row of people, extending from the south end of the main wharf to some distance along the north pier, could be perceived, but they seemed to take matters very calmly. The Indians on board did not seem much scared, and Mr. Gandhi and a few others who were on deck, looked on with an unperturbed expression. The main body of the demonstrators, who had thronged the vessels at the main wharf, could not be seen from the incoming steamers. The surprise experienced by those on the embankment when they saw the Courland laid alongside the Bluff Channel moorings, was seen by their actions. They were seen to rush hither and thither, entirely at a loss how to proceed, and soon they all left to attend the meeting on Alexandra Square. This was the last that the vessels were to see of the much-talked-of Demonstration. Meanwhile, Mr. Escombe was pulled alongside the Courland in a rowing boat, which was also occupied by Captain Ballard, Port Captain, Mr. Reid, wharfmaster, and Mr. Simpkins, mooring master. The Attorney-General said: ‘Captain Milne, I want you to inform your passengers that they are as safe under the Natal Government laws as if they were in their own native villages.’ The captain asked if it was advisable for him to allow them to land. Mr. Escombe replied that he (the Captain) had better see him again first. Having made a similar communication to the Naderi, Mr. Escombe was pulled ashore to address the crowd. The Naderi and Courland
 were laid side by side near to the Bluff passenger jetty, the Courland being nearest to land.
After the above assurance was given by Mr. Escombe, he went to
 Alexandra Square, Point, where the muster had taken place, and addressed the men who had assembled there, promising an early session of Parliament to deal with the question and requesting them to disperse. Speeches were also made by some members of the Committee, and the crowd ultimately melted away. It might be useful to note here some of the exclamations from the audience at the time these speeches were being made, as also a few passages from the speeches themselves:
 “Send them back.” “Why don’t you bring Gandhi ashore?” “Get the tar and feathers ready.” “Send these Indians back.” “The hold of the British on South Africa would not be maintained by slumming them with the miserable refuge of the social gutters of India.” (Applause.) —Dr. MacKenzie. “He was just as game as anybody to take a coolie by the neck and throw him overboard. (Applause.)... Now about that man Gandhi. (Applause.) They might shout about him. He was a particular friend of his, they might depend upon it. (Laughter). Gandhi was on board one of the boats and the greatest service they could do him would be to do him an injury. He believed Gandhi was very anxious to become a hero and a martyr to his cause. The greatest punishment which could be inflicted upon him was to allow him to live amongst them. If he lived amongst them, they would have an opportunity of spitting on him (Laughter and applause), which they would not have if they wiped him out. He (the speaker) would rather hang himself than be spat upon by every man in the street.” —Dan Taylor.
 The passengers landed in small batches in ferry boats, about two hours after the crowd had dispersed. As for Mr. Gandhi, the Superintendent of Water Police was instructed by Mr. Escombe to offer to land him and his family quietly at night that day. Mr. Gandhi accepted the offer with thanks. Later on, the same day, Mr. Laughton paid him a friendly visit on board and suggested that they should land together. The suggestion was accepted,libtech_58_footnotelibtech_59_footnoteand on his own responsibility, at his own risk, and without previously informing the Water Police, [he] landed near Addington with Mr. Laughton at about 5 o’clock. He was recognized by some boys, who followed him and his companion, and as they were proceeding along West Street, the main street of Durban, the crowd became large. Mr. Laughton was  separated from him; Mr. Gandhi was kicked, whipped, stale fish and
 
 other missiles were thrown at him, which hurt his eye and cut his ear, and his hat was taken off his head. While this was going on, the wife of the Superintendent of Police, who happened to be passing by, bravely afforded protection with her umbrella, and the police, on hearing the yells and the cries, came to the rescue and escorted him safely to an Indian house. But the crowd which had, by this time, become very large, did not leave, and blockading the front of the house, demanded “Gandhi”. As darkness deepened, the crowd continued to swell. The Superintendent of Police, fearing serious disturbance and  forcible entry into the house, had Mr. Gandhi removed to the Police Station disguised as a police constable. Your Memorialists do not wish to take any advantage of this incident; it is mentioned here as a part of the events. They are prepared to admit that the assault was the work of irresponsible persons and as such unworthy of notice. But at the same time, they cannot help remarking that had not the responsible members of the Committee incited the populace against him, and had not the Government countenanced the proceedings of the Committee, the incident would never have occurred. This closes the Demonstration.
 Your Memorialists now crave leave to examine the immediate causes of the Demonstration. Statements appeared in the newspapers to the effect that there were 800 passengers on board the two ships, all being for Natal; that there were 50 blacksmiths and 30 compositors, and that there was a printing plant on board the Courland, and that Mr. Gandhi —
 had made a big mistake in imagining that the Europeans of Natal would sit still while he organized an independent immigration agency in India to land his countrymen here at the rate of 1,000 to 2,000 per month. (The Natal Mercury, 9th January)
 The leader of the Demonstration thus explained the cause at a meeting held after the Demonstration:
 At the latter end of December he noticed a paragraph in The Natal Mercury to the effect that Mr. Gandhi intended suing the Government on behalf of the passengers on the two ships, the Courland and the Naderi, for damages, by reason of their being placed in quarantine. This made his blood boil with indignation. He was then determined to take the matter up and, meeting Dr. MacKenzie, suggested that a demonstration would be promoted to protest against the landing of these men . . . He concluded: He had been a volunteer and had served for over 20 years . . . He was as loyal as any man there . . . but when they placed the Indian subjects on one side and his home and family on the other, the birthright of his children and the memory of his
 dear parents and what they had done to make the Colony what it was, he would do the only thing he could, and the only thing they could expect of him. (Applause.) Rather than this evil, he would be content to hand matters over to the tender mercies of the Transvaal Government—that would be simply a drop in the ocean compared with this evil.— (The Natal Mercury, 18th February)
 It was also stated that the Indian passengers, instigated by Mr. Gandhi, and possibly by other lawyers that he may have brought with him, were to sue the Government for damages for illegal detention in quarantine. The Natal Mercury made the following remarks in its issue of the 30th December:
 The report that the Indians on board the s.s. Naderi and Courland intend bringing an action against the Government for damages for alleged illegal detention in quarantine, almost confirms the rumour that Mr. Gandhi is on board. His keen legal instincts have scented a splendid brief to occupy him immediately on his release from the durance vile of the quarantine  and  purifying effects of the carbolic bath. The large sums of money said to have been subscribed for the purpose would naturally go to Mr. Gandhi, whether the case was lost or won, and nothing in fact could suit the gentleman better than such an interesting case to devote his attention to, immediately he got on shore. Probably he has some of the other Indian lawyers he said he intended bringing with him on board, and among them they have persuaded the other Indians on board to sue for damages.
 The Natal Advertiser of the 29th December contained the information about the alleged legal proceedings, and it came out with the following, the next day:
 The feeling against the wholesale importation of free Indians has  steadily increased in Durban, and the recent arrival of 700 more Indians of this class by the steamers Courland and Naderi, would seem to have aggravated the feeling. The announcement that an Indian clique intended to sue the Natal Government for heavy damages for the detention of the steamers in the anchorage, apparently brought the question into more painful prominence still, for yesterday afternoon rumours were quickly circulated in town to the effect that some protestation against the landing of any more free Indians should be made. Some suggestions were made in all seriousness that a mass of Europeans should proceed to the Point on the day fixed for the disembarkation of the Indians from the Courland and Naderi, to actually prevent passengers landing. The method mooted was for the Europeans to form human lines three or four deep, and with locked hands and arms, offer a complete bar to the
 immigrants. Such, however, was probably merely general talk. The growth of the anti-Asiatic feeling is unquestionable, and is plainly evidenced by the following advertisement, which appears in another column at the head of the signature of Mr. Harry Sparks: ‘Wanted every man in Durban to attend a meeting to be held in the large room at the Victoria Cafe, on Monday evening next, at 8 o’clock, for the purpose of a demonstration to proceed to the Point, and protest against the landing of Asiatics.’
 Your Memorialists would beg to draw your attention to the distinction between the causes that led up to the Demonstration and that have been alluded to hereinbefore, and the immediate causes described above. It is quite possible that the Demonstration may not have taken place but for the above-mentioned statements which appeared in the Press. They were, however, absolutely without ground. Even if they were true, your Memorialists submit, the action of the Demonstration Committee could not be justified. As it was, the members of the Committee did an injustice to the European, native, and the Indian communities in the Colony as well as to themselves and Mr. Gandhi: to the European community, because their action created a lawless spirit amongst them; to the native, because the presence of that element at the Point, no matter by whom brought about, tended to excite their passions and warlike spirit, over which, when once aroused, they have little control; to the Indian, because they were subjected to a severe trial, and the bitterness of feeling against them was considerably accentuated owing to the action of the Committee; to themselves, because they took upon themselves the tremendous responsibility of defying law and order, without ascertaining the truth of  their statements; and to Mr. Gandhi, because owing to gross misrepresentations, no doubt made unwittingly, about him and his doings, he very nearly lost his life. Instead of there being 800 passengers for Natal, there were only 600 in all, of whom about 200 were for Natal, the rest being for Delagoa Bay, Mauritius, and the Transvaal; and of these 200, over 100 were old residents of Natal who had gone to India and returned, and less than 100 were newcomers, including about 40 ladies, being wives and relations of the Indian residents of Natal; and the remaining 60 were either storekeepers, their assistants, or hawkers. There was not a single blacksmith  or compositor on board, neither was there a printing plant. Mr. Gandhi publicly denied, through the interviewer of The Natal Advertiser, that he ever instigated anybody on board to bring an action against the
 Government  for  illegal  quarantine;libtech_60_footnotelibtech_61_footnoteand  this   denial   has   not   been contradicted. Moreover, it is easy to see how the rumour arose. As would appear from what has preceded, the owners and the agents threatened some action against the Government for what they considered to be illegal quarantine and detention. Rumour ascribed such an action to the passengers and The Natal Mercury erroneously inferred that Mr. Gandhi must have had a hand in the matter. He has, moreover, denied through  the same channel that there is any organization led by him to swamp the Colony with Indians. And your Memorialists may here assure Her Majesty’s Government that no such organization exists under Gandhi, who was a passenger on the Courland. That he was a passenger by that ship was mere accident. Your Memorialists telegraphed for him on November 13th,libtech_62_footnotelibtech_63_footnoteand  he booked his passage in the Courland, she being the earliest convenient boat for Natal after that date. These denials are easy of verification at any time, and if they are true, then, your Memorialists submit, it behaves the Government of Natal to allay popular feeling by publishing their opinion.
 Some of the incidents of the quarantine are worthy of record, as showing that the quarantine was more a political move against the Indians than a safeguard against the introduction of the  bubonic plague into the Colony. It was first imposed to complete 23 days from the day of departure of the ships from Bombay. The Committee’s report above alluded to (App. Q) advised 12 days’ quarantine after disinfection and fumigation. No steps were taken to disinfect and fumigate till after the expiry of 11 days after the arrival of the ships at Durban. In the mean while, the signals of distress for water and food were tardily attended to, doctors were said to have been privately interviewed by the Hon. the Attorney-General, and asked to give their opinion regarding the period of quarantine (App. P); passengers’ clothing and beds were burnt, and, though they were to remain on board for 12 days after such destruction, the Government made no provision for the supply of bedding and clothing, in spite of the signals from the vessels. And but for the charity of a few well- disposed Indians in Durban,libtech_64_footnotelibtech_65_footnotethe passengers would have been obliged
 
 to remain, for that period, without proper clothing and any bedding, perhaps with grievous injury to their constitutions. With due deference to the authorities, your Memorialists cannot help observing further that so much was the disregard shown by them for the welfare of the Indian community that even the mails on board the ships were not taken away and delivered before ten days had elapsed after their  arrival causing serious inconvenience to Indian merchants. To further emphasize the above contention, your Memorialists would draw your attention to the fact that, even after the pratique was given and the Courland was moored into the channel, she was not allowed a berth at the wharf for some days, while the steamers that arrived thereafter were provided with berths before she was, as will appear from the following:
 The Captain of the Courland calls our attention to the fact that although his vessel has been inside the Port since last Wednesday, he has been unable to secure a berth at the main wharf. Several vessels have arrived within the past few days, and although the Courland might have been expected to have prior claim for a berth, the later arrivals have already secured quay berths, while the Courland remains in the stream. The Courland has about 900 tons of cargo to discharge, and requires about 400 tons of coal. The expense of lighterage to and from the Bluff moorings will amount to a considerable sum.—The Natal Advertiser, 19th January, 1897.
 Your Memorialists may be permitted to quote from the various newspapers to show how the Demonstration was viewed before and after it took place:
 Natal’s present action in connection with the immigration of Indians is not well balanced. To the outside world, the fierceness of the agitation, which has suddenly risen at Durban against the landing of more Indians, is in strange contrast to the fact that Natal has all along been, practically, the one gateway through which these Asiatics have found admittance to South Africa. It was hardly to be expected that the country which had for so long openly  encouraged Indian immigration should quite suddenly turn round upon two ship-loads of them awaiting disembarkation at Durban, and ostentatiously threaten to resort to violence to prevent their landing. By going to such an extreme, the people of Durban, who have identified themselves with the agitation, can hardly be congratulated on their attitude. It is altogether unfortunate that they have gone so far, because, whatever happens now, they are doomed to disappointment and humiliation. . . After all is said and done, a large number of the people of Natal know that they have derived very
 considerable benefit from the presence of the Indian in their Colony. It is surely a fair inference that these continued arrivals of fresh batches of Indians in Natal are the result of the knowledge having reached them that their predecessors had fared well in their new conditions. Now, it may be asked, how could the earlier contingents of Indians have prospered in Natal had they not been, one way or another, assisted by the European settlers? And it may be taken for granted that the Europeans could not thus have assisted the Indian immigrants to prosper had they not, at the same time, been thereby helping on their own prosperity as well. The Indians who come to Natal are of two classes, the indentured and the free. Both these classes have found, despite their superficial antagonism, that the Europeans have been ready to employ or “support” them, and have thereby not merely made them satisfied with their own amelioration but have thus encouraged further arrivals. The indentured Indians are, for the most part, utilized by the European agriculturists; the free Indians who desire to engage in trade are  supported  by  the  European merchants, while the remainder are, in one way or another, encouraged to come and to remain in the country for domestic purposes. That the indentured Indian has proved to be an absolute necessity in Natal, owing to the indifferent and unreliable labour procurable from the Kaffir population, is evidenced by the fact that they are employed in thousands as farm and domestic servants, and that further indentures for hundreds more go to India by almost every mail. “But,” it is often said, “the objection is not to the indentured, but to the free Indian.” In the first place, however, the indentured coolie is  destined ultimately to become free. So that, while importing them under indentures, the people of Natal are thus practically ensuring large and  continuous contributions to the free Indian population. An attempt has been made, it is true, to compel the return of indentured Indians at the conclusion of their contract, but the law could not be made compulsory. Then, as regards the free Indians, these are engaged either in commerce, agriculture,  or  domestic  service. In none of these directions could they possibly succeed except  through the direct help of the Europeans. As regards the Indian trader, he receives his initial “support” from the European merchants. It would probably be difficult to find a single commercial house of any standing in Durban which has not scores of Indians as “clients”. The coolie “farmer” is encouraged and maintained by the Europeans in two ways: he has to rent or buy his land from the original European possessor, and his products are, for the most part, consumed in the European households. If it were not for the coolie market- gardeners and hawkers, the people of Durban (and other parts of the Colony) would find themselves very badly off for many kitchen requisites. Then, with respect to the Indian domestic servants, the only remark necessary is that, as a
 body, they have proved themselves to be much superior, in  capacity, reliability and obedience, to the average Kaffir. It would probably be found, on close examination, that several of those who have associated themselves with the recent agitation have Indians in their employ. Indians are also largely engaged in Government service, while the Government also provides them with the means of education, and consequently of advancement. Seeing, then, that the Europeans are primarily responsible for the benefits that have accrued to those Indians already in the Colony, it has the appearance of unreasonableness on their part to suddenly oppose the landing of any more. But, in addition to all this, there is the Imperial aspect of the question. This is the most formidable of all. So long as Natal remains a part of the British Empire (a circumstance which depends on Britain and not Natal), so long will the Imperial Government insist that the laws of the Colony shall not be repugnant to the general welfare and development of the Empire. India is part of the Empire; and the Imperial and Indian Governments are imbued with a determination to prove to the civilized world that the retention of India by Britain is for the benefit of the Indians. This, however, would not be the case if something could not be done to relieve the congested districts of India of their surplus population. This can only be effected by encouraging the Indians in those parts to emigrate. Britain has not the power nor the wish to force the surplus Indian population upon any country. But she certainly has the power to decline to allow any portion of the British Empire, where her Indian subjects are sought for by one section of the community, to shut its gates against them at the behest of another section of the same community. And so far as Natal is concerned, judging from the number of requisitions that go to India for further supplies of Indian labour, were anything to take place by which that supply was stopped, Natal and not India would be the greater sufferer.— Star, Friday, 8th January, 1897.
 We regard the proceedings as, to say the least, premature, and we cannot regard without apprehension a demonstration which is practically in the direction of mob law . . . The Colony must guard against putting itself in the wrong, which would be the effect of any outburst of violence, before it was definitely ascertained whether a constitutional agitation would be successful . .
 . Meanwhile, we would once more urge upon the leaders of the extreme party to weigh well the responsibilities they are incurring. —The Natal Advertiser, 5th January, 1897.
 If the leaders of the extreme party decide that it is necessary, they must incur a heavy responsibility, and be prepared to face the consequences . . . It might emphasize the fact that Natal wants no more Asiatics, but would it not
 also emphasize the allegations of injustice and unfair treatment which have been brought against the Colonists? —The Natal Advertiser, 7th January, 1897.
 Of the two thousand people said to have been at the meeting, we imagine but a small proportion will be ready to do what is illegal. There exists no lawful power by which the quarantined Asiatics can be sent back, or by which others can be prevented coming in, and, further, the British House  of  Commons would never consent to any law preventing Indian subjects from migrating to any part of the Empire. Although annoying in the present instance, yet it should not be forgotten that recognition of individual liberty is the sheet-anchor of the Constitution. Great Britain herself is suffering acutely from black and yellow competition . . . Many, who are loudest in their condemnation of the Asiatic in the abstract, do not hesitate to support him concretely by buying from him goods they find he sells cheaper.—The Times of Natal, 8th January, 1897.
 The leaders of the Demonstration movement assumed grave responsibilities at Thursday’s meeting, and some of the speeches were not marked for mildness. Dr. MacKenzie, for instance, did not exercise as much discretion as he might have done, and his dark hints regarding the treatment of Mr. Gandhi were extremely incautious. The mobilization of people to the point of the disembarkation of the Indians from the Courland and Naderi is to be a “peaceable” one, it is said; but who is to guarantee that no personal harm will befall any of the Indian passengers, after the assembly was worked up? And who will be primarily and morally responsible if harm does attend the Demonstration? One leader, or a hundred leaders, may urge a few thousands of citizens to be calm; but what control would such leaders have over such an assembly, which naturally bears a bitter grudge against all free Indians, intensified against the new arrivals and Mr. Gandhi, by reason of the recent agitations? —The Natal Advertiser, 9th January, 1897.
 The present agitation is, primarily, the outcome of the attempt  to import Indian artisans by the Immigration Board, which the Press instantly and emphatically denounced . . . But because the Press will not go to extremes and support prematurely drastic measures, it is denounced in unmeasured terms
 . . . We must not blame the Imperial Government for hesitating to take drastic steps for the exclusion of Asiatics, when we recollect that, up to this moment, the Government machinery of Natal itself was utilized for the very purpose of importing these Asiatics to suit our own purposes. It may be argued that there is not the same objection to the indentured Indians as to the free Indians, which is quite true; but may it not appear to the Imperial Government, and to the Indian Government, too that distinction is made purely in  our  own interests, and that it is scarcely fair to encourage immigration of one class of Indians for our own benefit, and to clamour for the rigid exclusion of another
 class, because we imagine they are likely to do us harm?—The Natal Advertiser, 11th January, 1897.
 They have a rough and ready diplomacy at Durban. There is none of your concerts of the powers, or diplomatic exchanges. The whole town goes down to the jetty, and announces that if certain of their fellow-subjects exercise their undoubted right to land, their blood will be upon their own head. Individually, they would be glad to buy cheaply from the frugal Indian; but collectively, they distrust themselves and each other. It is a pity that the agitators should have based their objections upon fallacious premises. The real grievance is an economical one based upon experience of which the theory is not generally understood. The soundest and most peaceable way is to form trade protection societies which shall insist upon a minimum price and a maximum wage . . . Durban is not east of Suez, being situated on nearly the same great circle; but the Durbanites seem to enter into the category of those among whom ‘there aint no ten commandments’, to say nothing of the Imperial Statute-book. It is not a method of civilized men to bring about reform by shooting one another in the streets. If the principles of economy are too hard for them, let them at least sail inside the law, which will be found   a better friend than rioting, and the ‘thousand armed men’,  that  one imaginative agitator conjured up. Britain cannot afford to insult the legions of her Indian Empire; nor does she wish to do so, for protection is classed in the Islands in the deadly sense, and free trade comes in somewhere between the first four and the last six clauses of the decalogue. If Durban wishes autonomy, Durban will get it for the asking; but its people cannot expect the British Isles to countenance illegal action, or encourage unconstitutional agitation. — Digger’s News, 12th January, 1897.
 The Natalians appear now to have lost their heads; and in their hysterical indignation have become desperate and contemplate violence against the much-maligned ‘coolie’. A demonstration has been organized, headed by a local butcher, and the whole town and Colony has taken up the hue and cry. There is something pathetically quixotic about this demonstrative body, each member of which binds himself to proceed to the quay and resist ‘by force, if necessary’ the landing of the Asiatics. It is furthermore said that those participating in the Demonstration intend to prove that they are in earnest, and that the men of Durban can organize an orderly yet emphatic demonstration in contradistinction to a riotous mob. The opinion is that the Indians would not land, and if the ships do bring them inside, those on board will at once recognize the futility of attempting to land when they see the crowd in opposition. Be that as it may, the present Demonstration resembles more the Knight of La Mancha’s mad tilt against the windmill than the action
 of soberminded Englishmen. The Colonists have become crazy and fanatical, and have lost much of the sympathy which they otherwise  would  have enlisted. There is nothing more ludicrous, we are told, than a British community in a state of excitement. In the words of Thomas Hood: ‘Evil is wrought by want of thought, as well as want of art,’ and the Europeans are undoubtedly prejudicing their cause in the action they are now taking.—The Johannesburg Times.
 The opposition to the immigration of Indians to Natal is by no means the least momentous incident of Mr. Chamberlain’s term of  office.  The interests affected are so large, and so intimately concern Great Britain, that it  is slight exaggeration to say the settlement of the difficulty is the most serious problem submitted to him during that time. The discarded immigrants are the representatives of a great population which has been taught to believe itself protected and nurtured by those who now refuse to grant a footing in a new land. India has been encouraged to look upon itself as a favoured daughter of the Empire, and, under the quixotic rule of various Viceroys, it has been taught to assert its independence in a way that is unhealthy for the uneducated Oriental to contemplate. Theory has broken down in practice. The frugal Indian, imported because of his power to assist the Colonist in working his country at a profit, has established himself as a dangerous trade competitor, has himself developed into a settler and a producer, and threatens to oust his old employer from the market. The problem which presents itself to Mr. Chamberlain is, therefore, by no means easy of solution. Morally, Mr. Chamberlain is bound to uphold the righteousness of the Indians’ position; economically, he is forced to admit the justice of the Colonists’ claim; politically, it passes the wit of man to decide which side to favour. —Star, Johannesburg, January 1897.
 The mass meeting held in the Town Hall on Thursday afternoon, on account of the wet weather, instead of on the Market Square as previously arranged, lacked nothing either in number or enthusiasm. That hall, crowded with the manhood of Durban, the grimy son of toil sitting cheek by jowl with the professional man, showed unanimity among all classes of the population, and gave evidence of a stern determination to stop the organized attempt to flood the Colony with Asiatics Mr. Gandhi had made a big mistake in imagining that the Europeans of Natal would sit still while he organized an independent emigration agency in India to land his countrymen here at the rate of from 1,000 to 2,000 per month. He judged the European character badly in thinking that he would be allowed to work such a scheme with impunity. Despite all his cleverness, he has made a sorry mistake, and a mistake that will most certainly defeat absolutely the object he had in view. As the dominant and ruling race in this British Colony, he has forgotten that we have a trust
 reposed in us. Our forefathers won this country at the point of the sword, and left us the country as our birthright and heritage. That birthright we have to hand down to our sons and daughters, as it was handed down to us. It was left to us an entailed estate for all of British and European blood, and we should be false to the trust we have received were we to allow this fair land to be overrun with a people alien to us in blood, in habits, in traditions, in religion, and in everything that goes to make up national life. We have also a very serious responsibility as guardians of the welfare of the aboriginal inhabitants of the land. In Natal there are half a million of natives who look to the white man as the child looks to his father, and as a matter of fair dealing, to put the matter in its mildest aspect, we must safeguard, as far as possible, the rights of the natives of Natal, as the legitimate labourers of the Colony. Then, there are Indians already in the Colony. We brought most of them here, and it is only our duty to see that they are not subjected to the disabilities and disadvantages that would follow on such an influx of their countrymen as would make it a difficult matter for them to make an honest living. We have at least 50,000 Indians in the Colony at present—a population in excess of the European— amply sufficient. As regards the attitude of the Government in the matter, that was very ably explained by Mr. Wylie on Thursday afternoon . . .
 . . . Dr. MacKenzie said he was thoroughly satisfied with the action of the Government, and all the members of the Committee were with him in that feeling of satisfaction. All, therefore, being in accord on the subject, it is sincerely hoped that the Demonstration will be a peaceable demonstration in every sense of the word. It should be used as an object-lesson to the Indians that the long-open doors of the Colony are about to be shut and that they must not, as hitherto, try to induce their friends and relations in India to follow them. A demonstration in itself, if it is kept well in hand, and  if  the programme outlined by the leaders is faithfully carried out, can do no harm. Only, as we have already pointed out, crowds are not easily controlled, and therefore, special responsibility attaches to the leaders. The leaders, however, seem confident of their ability to exercise this control, and are determined to carry out their proceeding to the Point, and if all goes well, the Demonstration will be so much more moral backing to the Government. It will also be an illustration of the true earnestness of the movement. Mr. Wylie very truly said that, while they must show the force they possessed, it was the men who could use that force without abusing it who gained their ends. We cannot insist too strongly on the necessity for the most perfect preservation of law and order. Ultimate success depends upon this, perhaps, as much as upon anything else,
 and we rely upon the good sense and sound judgment of those in charge of the Demonstration to see that the zeal of their followers does not overstep their discretion.—The Natal Mercury, 9th January, 1897.
 After all that has been said and done in Durban during the past fortnight, with a view to intimidate the Indian passengers on board the steamships Courland and Naderi from landing, it must be candidly admitted that the Demonstration has come to an ignominious termination. Although the ringleaders of the Demonstration naturally seek to cover their defeat by claiming a victory, the whole affair has proved an utter fiasco so far as its original and avowed intention is concerned. This was nothing more nor less, than to compel the Indians on board the two steamers to return forthwith to India without touching Natal soil. That has not been accomplished . . . By no sudden and ill-considered action on their part, can the people of Natal interfere with the incursion, allowed by their existing laws, of immigrants from any country. It was, of course, possible that the recent Demonstration, got up against the latest arrivals from India, might have succeeded in scaring them away. But, after all, even supposing that had been the issue, it certainly would have brought the demonstrators little to be really proud of. It would have been   a sorry victory had a small contingent of defenceless coolies been frightened away from the shores of Natal from fear of bodily maltreatment at the hands of the European settlers, assisted by a gang of whooping Kaffirs only too glad of an opportunity to demonstrate their dislike to their coolie competitors. It is far better that the Demonstration has “eventuated” as it has done. The only regrettable feature about Wednesday’s proceedings at Durban is the assault committed on Mr. Gandhi. It is true that the folks of Natal are highly incensed at his having published a pamphlet, charging them with badly treating their indentured Indians. We have not seen the publication in question, and if its charges are directed against Natalians as a community, then they are unfounded. There can be no doubt, however, as a case recently tried in the Natal courts plainly showed, that cases of extreme ill-usage have occurred on at least one of the estates, and Mr. Gandhi, as an educated Indian, cannot be altogether blamed if he strongly resents such treatment of his fellow-countrymen, and seeks to effect a remedy. As regards the assault on Mr. Gandhi, it does not, however, appear to have been perpetrated by any of the more respectable portion of the crowd, although the youths who sought to do Mr. Gandhi bodily harm were, no doubt, incited to do so by the unguarded utterances of some of the responsible organizers of the Demonstration. It was owing only to the alertness of the police that Mr. Gandhi escaped without serious injury, and perhaps with his life.       But South Africa is evidently passing through a
 stage in its transition which evolves abortive demonstrations as one of its characteristics. The whole country is still in its boyhood, and there is nothing   a boy loves more than to refer his disputes to the gory arbitrement of physical force. Looked at in that way, this week’s doings at Durban may be excused
 with an indulgent smile. But regarded from any other standpoint, it is open to severe condemnation, as tending to retard rather than to advance the ultimate solution of a most complex political and economic question, not merely of importance to Natal, but to England, India, and the whole of South Africa.— Star, Johannesburg, January 1897.
 Of what avail, then, was it to forbid a landing to the few hundred immigrants on the Naderi and Courland while the system of trading with Indians is in full swing? Years ago, before the present Act of the Volksraad was in force in the Free State, Arab stores were opened in Harrismith, and at once began to undersell the old-established houses by about 30 per cent. The Boers, who of all men protest against colour, flocked to the Arabs, and, while condemning the principle, were not above pocketing the profit. It is much the same in Natal today. The mention of blacksmiths, carpenters, clerks, printers, etc., as being among the passengers, aroused the “working classes”, and their cause was doubtlessly espoused by those who, in other ranks of life, were feeling the pressure of the ubiquitous Hindoo, and yet, probably, none of these men were mindful of the fact that they themselves are helping to make Natal a desirable objective point for the surplus labour of India. The vegetables, fruits, and fish that adorn a Natal dinner table are grown, caught, and hawked by coolies; the table linen is washed by another coolie, and, in all probability, the guests would be served by coolie waiters and partake of fare prepared by a coolie cook. Let the Natalians be consistent, and begin the work of ostracizing the Indian by dealing with their own poorer classes,  in preference to coolies, and leave the question of restrictive legislation to their elected representatives. While Natal remains such a desirable abiding place for the Asiatic, and Natalians continue to profit largely by the cheap labour the dark man brings, the work of minimizing arrivals will certainly be difficult, if not hopelessly impossible, without legislation on the subject—D. F. News, January 1897.
 It is fortunate for all concerned in Durban’s demonstration against the landing of Indian immigrants that, beyond the effervescent effects of the stump oratory of Dr. MacKenzie, and the inciting diatribes of Mr. Sparks and his neophyte Dan Taylor, nothing very serious has happened to the fair Colony of Natal, its distracted inhabitants, or the much maligned “coolies”. The pseudo-patriotic organizers of an ill-advised  demonstration have attempted to play the Roman fool, and have died on their own swords, Luckily, we say, nothing more serious happened; but the folly of those who took upon themselves the hazardous task of calling the people together and suggesting
 such unconstitutional conduct was never more apparent during the whole time the hubbub lasted, than in the concluding acts of  the  Durban  mob. Unsuccessful in their attempts to prevent the landing of the coolie immigrants, and doubtless humiliated and smarting under the fact that their Demonstration had been somewhat of a fiasco, the mob, in an ill-temper, turned its attention to Mr. Gandhi, an Indian barrister, whose worst crime, in the eyes of Natalians appears to be that he has interested himself in the cause of his fellows, and gratuitously assumed the position of interpreter for the Indians in South Africa. Up to this point the Demonstration had proved quite a harmless one, and might have been likened unto a Christmas pantomime; but, when Mr. Gandhi unostentatiously landed, and was proceeding quietly into town, with Mr. Laughton, an English solicitor, matters took a barbarous turn. We do not presume to take up the cause of the Indian in South Africa, neither do we champion Mr. Gandhi’s arguments, but the treatment to which that gentleman was subjected is scandalous and calls for censure. Mr. Gandhi was surrounded by a jeering crowd of hydrocephalous entities, and was made the vile object of kicks and cuffs, while mud and stale fish were thrown at him. One cad in the crowd struck him with a riding whip, while another plucked off his hat. As a result of the attack, we are told that ‘he was very  much bespattered, and blood was flowing from his neck’. Subsequently, under police protection, Mr. Gandhi was conveyed to the store of a Parseelibtech_66_footnote, the building was guarded by the borough police, and, ultimately, the Indian barrister made his escape incognito. No doubt, all this proved grand fun for the canaille, but apart from the morals of law and order, the British love of fair play must be rapidly on the wane in Durban, when Englishmen resort  to  such  ungentlemanly behaviour and brutality towards an unconvicted free man. Downing Street and the Indian Government cannot be apathetic towards the violent attitude which has been adopted by Natalians towards a lawful subject of Britain’s “magnificent dependency”—India—a land which is spoken of as the brightest territorial jewel in the English diadem.—The Johannesburg Times, January 1897.
 The illegal methods of intimidation, which the people of Durban have employed to raise their grievance into the magnitude they wish it to occupy, have been justified by the grave importance of the interests at stake and by the results so far achieved . . . Quietly, and without boast or bluster, they have all along had the movement under their aegis and control, although to some of the purblind people in the Colony it has seemed as if the administrative power had
 
 been transferred to the leaders of the Demonstration movement.—The Natal mercury, January 14th, 1897.
 It would be a mere affectation to pretend that the Demonstration was a success from the party’s point of view. All the oratory at the Point yesterday, which was couched in a very different key from that at the mass meetings, cannot obscure the fact that the primary object of the Demonstration, the prevention of the landing of the passengers on board the two steamers, has not been achieved. What has been gained could, as we have always maintained, have been equally attained by other means . . . What, we may ask, has been gained by yesterday’s proceedings? If it be said that they have shown the imperative need of doing something to stop the Asiatic invasion, we reply that was shown with equal force by the mass meetings, and was, in fact common cause. If it be urged that the Demonstration showed that the people were in were in earnest, we fear we cannot assent to the proposition, because the assembly dispersed on receiving from the representative of Government exactly the same assurances as they received a week ago. The Government then promised to bring in legislation to deal with the question. Mr. Escombe yesterday repeated the assurance; but he gave no further pledges; he did not agree to a special session of Parliament, nor did he promise to send the Indians back. The Committee in fact, now declare their readiness to leave the whole matter in the hands of Government, without the slightest reason for doing so more than existed a week ago, and while the proclaimed object of the Demonstration is unfulfilled. We are not surprised that a good many persons regard the affair as a mere fiasco—a brutum fulmen—and express the belief that the Durban people will not be very anxious to figure in another such demonstration. The practical abdication by Government of its functions
 during the week, in favour of the Committee, was so extraordinary as to irresistibly produce a suspicion that it was all prearranged. The self-elected committee virtually constituted themselves a sort of provisional Government as regards this particular question. They regulated the movements of the steamers, and assumed the right to grant or refuse “permission” to persons to land on our shores who had as much title to be here as they had; they even proposed a Danegeld policy, to carry out which the public funds would be requisitioned. All this time Government looked on, made no preparations for the protection of the passengers, and contented themselves with a perfunctory protest. We are not now arguing whether the Committee were justified in their course. They thought they were, but that does not annul the fact that they virtually and quite illegally superseded the Government. A long series of negotiations ensues, during which the public is kept in a constant ferment of excitement, until at last the bugle sounds and all Durban rushes to the Point, prepared to do or die. Then, quite casually of course, at the psychological moment, the Attorney-General “bobs up serenely”, tells the people to be good boys and he  will do  all that is  necessary—”fix your eyes upon  your
 Escombe and he will pull you through”—the Committee declare, they had the least idea of doing anything in opposition to the Government, and are quite willing to leave it in the hands of the Government—cheers for the Queen— blessings all round—everybody goes home happy—Demonstration melts away as quickly as it gathered—while the now forgotten Indians quietly come ashore, just as if there had never been any demonstration at all. Who can resist the suspicion that it was a prearranged and foregone conclusion? It has been asserted by the Captain of the Courland that the Committee led him to believe that they were acting on behalf of the Government; and it has also been stated that Government knew and approved of what the Committee were doing. These statements, if correct, imply a serious imputation of the bona fides either of the Committee or the Government. If the Committee had the sanction of the Government, the latter were playing a double game by countenancing in private proceedings which were disapproved in their published reply. If not, the charge of duplicity must be shifted to the shoulders of the Committee. We should be loth to believe these statements, because it is not by such methods that a great cause is conducted to a successful issue.—The Natal Advertiser, 14th January 1897.
 The letter we published yesterday, from the Demonstration Committee to the Captain of the Courland, does not sustain the charge previously made, that the Committee falsely represented themselves as acting on behalf of the Government, although, from its tone, and the reference to the Attorney- General, the Captain may be excused for coming to that conclusion. But it does afford ground for the alternative suspicion that, despite their published warnings against illegal action, the Government were practically in collusion with the Committee. According to this document, the Attorney-General, who had previously admitted that there was no legal means of keeping the Indians out of the Colony, went so far as to pledge the public funds to buying-off policy, at the dictum of a body with no legal status and pursuing illegal methods of intimidation, as is clearly shown by the terms of the letter. When that failed, came the Demonstration, with the opportune appearance of the Attorney-General on the scene. To use the old tag, comment is unnecessary.— The Natal Advertiser, 20th January 1897.
 After all the speechifying and the parading, and the bugle-blowing of the past week, the citizens of Durban have fallen short of making history— unless, indeed, the discharge of a rotten potato at the eye of the unspeakable Gandhi may be considered as an historical act. The heroics of mob are apt to sink from the sublime to the ridiculous, and indifferent arguments are often accompanied by equally indifferent eggs . . . For a week the Natal Ministry permitted the situation to develop, without pretence at the feeblest
 intervention, their policy suggesting and unofficial sanction of the whole business. Then, when the Naderi and Courland are within a few hundred yards of the wharves, Mr. Escombe appears upon the scene, actively intervenes, and the people disperse, to vent their baffled feelings, a few hours later, by upsetting Gandhi’s ricksha, blacking his eye, and savagely assaulting the house in which he is lodged.—Cape Argus, January 1897.
 A little explanation is still wanting in regard of the presence of a force of several hundred Kaffirs in the Demonstration. Did it mean that the cause of the white man and the cause of the native are one and the same? Or, what else did it symbolize? There is one thing in regard of which public opinion is unanimous. It may be unjust in the conclusion it has drawn. But the fact remains that people will not believe that the whole business was not a plot between the Government and the leaders of the late remarkable movement, but one in which the self-appointed Committee failed to score. It was delightfully dramatic. The Ministry handed over their powers to a Committee claimed to represent the people. Whatever you do, they said, act constitutionally. The word was passed round and the magic of constitutional action took effect, though not a soul to this moment knows what it means. The Ministry acted constitutionally, and promised not to interpose if the peace were broken. They would only go to the Governor, and ask to be relieved  of  office.  The Committee acted quite constitutionally in organizing a force, including natives, to oppose by force the landing of British subjects in a British Colony. The concluding act of this pretty drama was played at the Point, when the Committee handed back their powers to Mr. Escombe, reinstated the Government, and everyone went home satisfied. The Committee claimed a moral victory, though they had been beaten from pillar to post; the Ministry pirouetted on their “single plank”; and the Indians, who were never to be allowed to land, landed promiscuously as soon as the crowd had dispersed.— The Natal Witness, January 1897.
 Nothing of what Mr. Wylie stated to the Durban meeting, as having been said by Mr. Escombe to the deputation, has even been traversed, much less denied. It stands on record, then, that the Ministry, on the slightest appearance of a riot at Durban, had resolved that mob law should be supreme. “We shall say to the Governor that he will have to take the  reins of Government into his own hands.” Everyone is aware that we are rapidly nearing another general election, but no one could possibly have thought that any Ministry would have played so low, to gain votes, as to give the population of a large town freedom to break the law.—The Natal Witness, January 1897.
 They cannot go on importing indentured Indians by the hundreds and at the same time shut out free Indians; otherwise they will meet with disappointment. —Pretoria Press, January 1897.
 According to Mr. Wylie’s report of the interview between the promoters of the anti-Indian agitation and Mr. Escombe, the attitude of the Government in the matter appears to be open to grave animadversion. Plainly, though in covert wording, according to Mr. Wylie’s version, the Committee proposed to do what was illegal, and added: “We presume that you, as representing the Government and good authority of this Colony, would have to bring force to oppose us?” To this Mr. Escombe is represented to have replied: “We will do nothing of the sort. We are with you, and we are going to do nothing of the sort to oppose you. But if you put us in such a position we may have to go to the Governor of the Colony and ask him to take over the reins of this Colony, as we can no longer conduct the Government—you will have to find some other persons.” According to this account, the Government have made a confession of most deplorable weakness. A minister, on being informed that a body of people propose doing what is unlawful, should, without a moment’s hesitation, inform his interviewers that the course of law will in no degree be interfered with, and if the occasion calls for it, that minister should say out bluntly that the law, at all costs, will be supported by all available resources. Mr. Escombe, on the other hand, said in effect that the Government would do nothing to oppose the unlawful action proposed. This playing into the hands of men who speak publicly of the Indian Ocean as being the proper place of the Indian immigrants, shows regrettable weakness in a member of the Government in office.—The Times of Natal, January 1897.
The   above   extracts   speak	for	themselves.	Almost	every
 newspaper has condemned the Demonstration, and they further go to show that the Government countenanced the action of the Committee. Your Memorialists may here remark that the leaders of the Demonstration have since denied that there was any “collusion” between the Government and themselves. Nevertheless, the  fact remains, and it is patent from the above extracts, that had the Government contradicted the statement made by Mr. Wylie as to the conversation between Mr. Escombe and himself,  and  publicly declared that the passengers were not only entitled to the protection of the Government, but that it would be given to them, the Demonstration would never have taken place. As the Government organ itself has said, the Government “had the movement under their aegis and control” while it was developing. Indeed, it seems from that article that they were rather anxious that such a  Demonstration should  take
 place, if only the crowd could be managed properly and kept under sway, so that it may serve as an object-lesson to the passengers. To say the least, such a method of intimidation being sanctioned or countenanced by a Government in a British Colony is,  with  the greatest deference to the Natal Government, a  new  experience, opposed to the most cherished principles of the British Constitution. The after effects of the Demonstration, in your Memorialists’ humble opinion, cannot but be disastrous to the welfare as well of the whole Colony as of the Indian community, who claim to be as much a part of the British Empire as the European British subjects. It has already intensified the estranged feelings between the two communities. It has lowered the status of the Indians. All this, your Memorialists humbly submit and hope, cannot and will not be viewed with unconcern by Her Majesty’s Government. If those who are responsible for  the upkeep of the harmony of the British Empire and justice between the various sections of the subjects assist in creating or encouraging division and ill feeling between them, the task of persuading those sessions to keep in harmony, in face of conflict of diverse interests, must be ever so much more difficult. And if Her Majesty’s Government grant the principle that the Indian British subjects are to have freedom of intercourse with all Her Majesty’s Dominions, then, your Memorialists venture to trust that there will be some pronouncement from the Imperial Government that would preclude the possibility of such deplorable partiality on the part of Colonial Governments.
 The following remarks by The Natal Advertiser of January 16, about the behaviour of the Indian community during the crisis are worthy of record:
 The behaviour of the Indian population of Durban during the excitement of the week was all that could be desired. They must have felt sore at the attitude of the townspeople towards their fellow-countrymen. But there was no attempt at retaliation; and by their quiet, peaceable behaviour, and faith in Government, they certainly contributed to the preservation of public order.
 Your Memorialists would have refrained from any further reference to the incident in connection with Mr. Gandhi, but for the fact that, since he acts as an interpreter between the two communities in Natal, any misapprehension with regard to his position may seriously damage the Indian cause. Sufficient has been said herein to justify what he did in India in the name of the Indians in South
 Africa. But, for further explanations as to the matter, your Memorialists hereby refer Her Majesty’s Government to Appendix Y, wherein are collected certain extracts from newspapers. Your Memorialists have been praying Her Majesty’s Government, in the memorials that have preceded this, to define the status of Indian British subjects outside India, and humbly submitting that, in virtue of the gracious Proclamation of 1858, that status should be equal to that of Her Majesty’s all other subjects. Indeed, it has already  been  defined by His Excellency the Marquis of Ripon, in a despatch with reference to the Colonies, to the effect that “it is the desire of Her Majesty’s Government that the Queen’s Indian subjects should be treated upon a footing of equality with all Her Majesty’s other subjects”, but so many changes have since taken place that a formal pronouncement has evidently become necessary, especially in view of the fact that laws have since been passed in the Colony which are in conflict with that policy.
 Another incident of the Demonstration, your Memorialists submit, is worth noting, viz., the massing of natives at the Point. It has already been alluded to above; but the following letter from Mr. G. A. de Labistour, a leading burgess of the town to the Town Council, and the remarks thereon of The Natal Mercury, the Government organ, would give a better idea of the gravity of the situation:
 ‘Gentlemen—I was one of many burgesses who viewed with concern the rowdy behaviour of the natives who took part in the Demonstration yesterday. Along the Point Road several parties of natives, brandishing sticks and shouting at the top of their voices, had taken possession of the pavement, and  at the Point about 500 or 600 boys, mostly Togt boys, all armed with sticks and singing and shouting, congregated with, apparently, the avowed object of committing a breach of the peace. Particulars of this deplorable matter are easily available.
 The evil effect on the natives in general of yesterday’s proceedings will be accentuated, and race hatred fostered, unless steps are at once taken to show that your honourable body, as custodians of law and order in this town, will not countenance conduct of this sort. It can easily be understood that the massing or congregating together of a body of natives, such as that at yesterday’s Demonstration, is a source of great danger to the town, as, for instance, was the case on the occasion of the massing of natives on the racecourse in their feud with the police some time ago.
 I submit that the native element in yesterday’s Demonstration has cast on the fair name of Durban a blot which it is your duty to at once wipe out, and
 I venture to say that your taking up the matter with a vigorous hand will be viewed with satisfaction by the majority of your burgesses. I respectfully suggest that, as a first step, the Corporation should cause an enquiry to be made as to who is responsible for the massing of these natives, their behaviour and control on the occasion alluded to; and, further, that to prevent  a repetition of such conduct, special bye-laws be passed, in case those at present in force are found insufficient to cope with the evil.
 This is rendered all the more necessary as no reference was made by the Honourable the Attorney-General to the rowdy and dangerous element created by the facts referred to. I, however, feel confident  that  his  regrettable omission to do so only arose from the fact that he did not witness what I and others saw. The Togt boys are easily traceable, I should think; others were servants of members of the Committee, one of them especially having taken advantage of the occurrence to advertise his firm by sending down his store boys, each armed with two or three sticks, with his firm’s name appearing in glaring letters on their backs.
 Mr. Labistour’s letter to the Corporation, drawing attention to the danger incurred in the massing of a body of natives armed with sticks for the purposes of the Demonstration on Wednesday, and calling on the Town Council to enquire into the matter, should not be overlooked. We believe the Demonstration Committee were not in any way responsible for the native impi being at the Point; but the natives did not go down there of their own initiative, and it would be as well if the matter were fully investigated and the onus thrown upon the individuals who took upon themselves so grave a responsibility. As Mr. Labistour quite properly remarks, the native element at the Demonstration was a blot on the fair name of Durban, and might have been productive of the most dire results. There is no love lost between the Indian and the native as it is, and to bring together a band of natives and incite them against the Indians may even yet be productive of serious trouble. The native has no reasoning powers in a matter of the kind. His passions are like tinder and his instincts are warlike. The slightest provocation, and he is all aflame and ready for anything where there is shedding of blood. An even more disgraceful incident was inciting the natives to attack Indians after Mr. Gandhi landed and was lodged in Field Street. Had the police not been on the alert and succeeded in dispersing the natives, Wednesday night would have ended in one  of the most disgraceful riots any British Colony ever witnessed, in so far that  a savage warlike race had been set upon a more civilised, peaceful people by men of a higher race than either. The disgrace would have clung to the Colony for many a long day. Instead of arresting the four kaffirs who flourished their
 sticks and whooped in Field Street on Wednesday evening, the white men who brought them there and encouraged them ought to have been brought up before the magistrate and fined as heavily in proportion as the Kaffirs were fined. It was rather hard on the kaffirs to make them scapegoats for really obeying the orders of men who ought to have known better. To call in the natives in a matter of the kind is to exhibit to them a weakness which, above all things, should be avoided, and we trust there will never be a repetition of so dangerous and disgraceful a practice as exciting the racial prejudices of so inflammatory an element as the natives.—The Natal Mercury, 16th January, 1897.
It would perhaps assist Her Majesty’s Government in coming to
 a conclusion if certain facts were placed before them pertaining to the matter. The demand for restriction of free immigration of Indians has been based on the supposition that, of late, there has been a very large influx of Indians into the Colony, irrespective of any organization. Your Memorialists, however, have no hesitation in saying that  the alarm is not justified by facts. It is not correct to say that more Indians have come to the Colony during the last year than during the last but one. Formerly, they came by the German boats as well as by those of the B.I.S.N. Co. Since the latter boats transshipped their passengers in other boats at Delagoa Bay, the Indians came in small batches and were, naturally, not much noticed. Two Indian merchants bought steamers last year and established a fairly regular and direct service between Bombay and Natal. Most of the Indians wishing to come to South Africa availed themselves of this service, and thus, instead of being divided into small batches, they came all at once, and thus drew attention. Moreover, no one seemed to take any notice of those that returned to India. From the following list it will be clear that there has not been a material addition to the free Indian population; certainly not in any way large enough to justify the alarm. It is also worthy of note that the European immigration is and has almost always been in excess of the free Indian immigration.
 A return signed by Mr. G. O. Rutherford, Acting Protector  of Immigrants, shows that from August last to January seven steamship firms deported 1,298 free Indians from the Colony; the same companies introduced 1,964 Indians in the same time, most of the immigrants coming from Bombay.—The Natal Mercury, 17th March, 1897.
 There is no foundation for the statement that there is any competition between European and free Indian artisans. Your Memorialists can speak from their own knowledge that there are very few Indian mechanics and artisans in the Colony, such as blacksmiths,
 carpenters, bricklayers, etc., and those that are, are inferior to the European. (The Indian artisans of high order do not come to Natal.) There are a few tailors and goldsmiths in the Colony, but they minister to the wants only of the Indian community. As to the competition between the Indian and European traders, it has been well said, in some of the extracts quoted above, that, if there is any competition, it is rendered possible by the large support given by the European merchants. But the very fact that the European merchants are willing, nay anxious, to support Indian traders, shows that they  do  not  compete with them to any appreciable extent. They, really speaking, act as middlemen and begin where the Europeans leave. The Commissioners, who were specially appointed to report upon Indian matters nearly 10 years ago, thus report as to the Indian traders:
 We are convinced that much of the irritation existing in the minds of European Colonists against the whole Indian population of the Colony has been excited by the undoubted ability of these Arab traders to compete with European merchants, and specially with those who have chiefly directed their attention to the supply of articles, notably rice, largely consumed by the Indian immigrant population. . . .
 We are of opinion that these Arab traders have been drawn to Natal by the presence therein of those Indians who have been introduced under the immigration laws. Rice is the chief food of the 30,000 Indian immigrants now in the Colony; and these astute traders have so successfully devoted their tact and energy to the supply of that article that the price to all consumers fell from 21s. per bag in former years to 14s. in 1884 It is said that kaffirs can buy
 from Arabs at from 25 to 30% lower rates than those obtaining six or seven years ago . . .
 It does not lie within the scope of our Commission to discuss at length the restrictive measures which some desire to impose upon Asiatics or “Arab” traders. We are content to place on record our strong opinion, based on much observation, that the presence of these traders has been beneficial to the whole Colony, and that it would be unwise, if not unjust, to legislate to their prejudice. (The italics are your Memorialists.) Nearly all of them are
 Mahomedans, either total abstainers from alcoholic liquors or drinking them in moderation. They are thrifty by nature and submissive to the law.
 Mr. Saunders, one of the Commissioners, says in his additional report:
 So far as concerns free Indian traders, their competition and the consequent lowering of the price of articles of consumption by which the
 public benefits (and yet, strange to say, of which it complains), it is clearly shown that these Indian shops have been and are most exclusively supported by the larger firms of white merchants who thus, practically employ these men to dispose of their goods.
 Stop Indian immigration if you will, if there are not enough unoccupied houses now, empty more by clearing out Arabs or Indians, who add to the productive and consuming power of a less than half-peopled country, but let us trace results in this one branch of the enquiry taking it as an example of others, trace out how untenanted houses depreciate the value of property and securities, how after this must result stagnation in the building trade, and those other trades and stores for supplies dependent on it. Follow out how this leads to a reduced demand for white mechanics, and with the reduction in spending power of so many, how fall of revenue is to be expected next, need of retrenchment, or taxation, or both. Let this result and others far too numerous to be calculated on in detail be faced, and if blind race sentimentalism or jealousy is to prevail, so be it.
At a meeting lately held in Stanger, one of the speakers (Mr.
Clayton) said:
 
 Not only the coolie labourer, he said, but the Arab storekeeper had been of benefit to the Colony. He knew it was an unpopular view to take, but he had looked at the question from every point of view. What did they find? The erven round the Market Square were bringing in a good percentage through the presence of Arab storekeepers. The owners of land had been benefited by the coolies taking up land that would never be taken up by anybody else. At the auction sale, the other day, erven abutting on the Market Square fetched a price that would have been out of the question years ago. The Indians had created a trade—a trade that would never have been brought here by the old system of storekeeping. He was quite willing to admit that here and there an European storekeeper had been ruined by the Indians, but their presence here was better than the old days when a few storekeepers had the monopoly. Wherever they met with an Arab, they always found him amenable to law. They had heard it said that the Colonists should not give away their birthright— that the Indians should not be allowed to enter upon the possession of their lands. He was pretty confident that his children, rather than have to work any land he might be able to leave them, would prefer to let it to Indians at reasonable rents. He did not think that that meeting was justified in coming to  a  wholesale condemnatory resolution of the Asiatics.
 A regular correspondent of The Natal Mercury thus writes:
 We brought the coolies here as a necessity, and, undoubtedly they have been a great help towards the progress of Natal. . . .
 Twenty-five years ago, in the towns and townships, fruit, vegetables, and fish could hardly be bought. A cauliflower sold for half a crown. Why did not farmers go in for market gardening? There may have been some laziness, but on the other hand, to grow wholesale was useless. I have known the case of cart-loads of fruit, etc., sent a long way, but in good condition to the city, unsaleable. The party who would give half a crown for a stray cauliflower would naturally demur to give a shilling for one, when he saw a wagon-load of them. Here we needed an industrious class of hawkers who could live cheaply and find pleasure and profit in supplying these wants, and we got it in the time-expired indentured coolie. And for waiters and cooks, public or private, the coolie has supplied the want, for in these matters the mass of our natives are awkward, and when not, as soon as carefully taught, are off to their kraals.
 The free coolie labourer, if an artisan, will work longer hours and take a lower wage cheerfully than the European mechanic, and the coolie trader will sell a cotton blanket three half-pence cheaper than the white storekeeper. That is all.
 Surely the great economic cry of supply and demand, your patriotic league of British subjects, your glorious cry of Free Trade, which John Bull pays through the nose for to show his faith in, all forbid this outcry.
 Australia has forbidden coloured immigration. The strikes and band smashes do not make that a grand example. Coolies wear lighter clothes and slippers than Europeans; anyway, that is an advance on our location native, and, many years ago, boots were rarely seen on white men or women on farms, or children even among the uppish classes of the city, except when they went to the park or meeting. Their feet seemed none the worse, though bad for shoemakers. Coolies don’t eat meat or drink beer, etc. Again, I dare say, bad for butchers and licenced victuallers. Depend upon it, all these things will find their level, but to force by Act of Parliament (beyond what decency and sobriety call for the common weal) what people are to eat and drink and wear is tyranny, not beneficent legislation. Crowds of white immigrants are kept out. Are they? With our native population, unless you can shunt the whole lot, white men will not work for a mere living wage in this Colony. They would rather be loafers.
 We cannot get out of it. Ours is a black Colony, and much as I like our natives in their proper place, and the coolies [sic], too, who is more willing to keep it [sic] in his, the While man’s role is and must be to be boss. Stop at that, I do not want to talk of how poor farmers cannot afford to pay their fashionable friends, the town artisans, their price, and are very glad to put up with even indifferent work by an off-coloured mechanic; but I would appeal to
 the skilled workmen to be content to regulate their own tariffs, and not be afraid of indifferent opposition—a good man is always worth his full value— but avoid, because they are numerically strong in the towns, a class agitation,  a race quarrel. It is the same with the good tradesmen, and though the owners of country stores may have to cut their prices finer, they won’t be ruined. Four hundred gallons of treacle for cash per week isn’t bad. Talk of the federation of the Empire, and we are tabooing our fellow-subjects of India, whose warriors have fought shoulder to shoulder with ours, whose armies have upheld the honour of the flag on many a gory field! There are plenty of European stores in India, and well patronized and flourishing, too.
 It is, in your Memorialists’ humble opinion, because the Indians sell the wares for the European merchants, that there are so many large European houses which afford employment to hundreds of European clerks and assistants. Your Memorialists submit that an industrious and frugal class of men, as the Indians are admitted to be even by their most virulent opponents, cannot but on the whole add to the general prosperity, wealth, and consequently material happiness of the place they go to. The Star sums up the situation with regard to the Uitlanders in the Transvaal—the class of people who so inconsistently object to the presence of the Indians in South Africa, in the following words:
 South Africa is a new country. It should therefore be open to all. Poverty should be no bar to admission. The vast majority of those now in affluence, came here originally with only the proverbial half-crown in their pockets. By all means let us keep the population reputable; do so however, by the just and stringent enforcement of local laws against vagrancy and roguery, and not by the arbitrary exclusion of new arrivals before it is possible to know whether under the better conditions of a new country they might not take their place amongst useful citizens of the land.
 These remarks with the necessary changes are word for word applicable to the Indian community; and if the position there taken up is correct and acceptable with reference to the Uitlanders, much more, your Memorialists venture to submit, should it be in the present case.
 The Natal Government, in virtue of their promise to the Demonstration Committee, propose to introduce the following three Bills into the Honourable Legislative Assembly, which sits on the 18th instant:
 QUARANTINElibtech_67_footnote: (1) Whenever any place has been proclaimed, under Law 4, 1882, as an infected place; the Governor-in-Council may, by a further Proclamation, order that no person shall be landed from any ship coming from such place. (2) Any such order shall also extend to a ship having on board passengers who have come from a proclaimed place, notwithstanding that they may have embarked at some other place, or that the ship has not touched at the proclaimed place. (3) Any such order as aforesaid shall be in force until revoked by a further Proclamation. (4) Any person who shall land in contravention of this Act, shall, if practicable, be at once returned to the ship in which he came to Natal, and the master of such ship shall be bound to receive such person on board, and to convey him from the Colony at the expense of the owners of the ship. (5) The master and owners of any vessel from which any person shall be landed in contravention of this Act shall be liable to a penalty of not less than one hundred pounds sterling for each person so landed, and the vessel may be made executable by a decree of the Supreme Court in satisfaction of any penalty, and the vessel may be refused a clearance outwards until such penalty has been paid and until provision has been made by the master for the conveyance out of the Colony of each person who may have been so landed.
 LICENCESlibtech_68_footnote: (1) Any Town Council or Town Board may, from time to time, appoint an Officer to issue the annual licences (not being licences under Act 38, 1896) required in the Borough or Township by wholesale or retail dealers. (2) Any person appointed to issue licences for wholesale or retail dealers under Law 38, 1884, or any like Stamp Act, or under this Act, shall be deemed to be a “Licensing Officer” within the meaning of this Act. (3) A Licensing Officer shall have discretion to issue or refuse a wholesale or retail licence not being a licence under Act 38, 1896; and a decision come to by a Licensing Officer as to the issue or refusal of a licence shall not be liable to review, reversal, or alteration by any court of law or otherwise than is in the next section provided.

Schedule Blibtech_77_footnoteis a form of application to be filled in by a person claiming to be exempt from the operation of this Act.
 They will, perhaps, soon be before Her Majesty’s Government for consideration. In that case, your Memorialists may have to approach  you  regarding  the  measures.libtech_78_footnotelibtech_79_footnoteFor  the  present,  they   will content themselves with saying that, while none of the Bills openly show their object, they are all aimed at the Indian community. If, therefore, her Majesty’s Government accept the principle that restrictions may be put upon the Indian community in the British Colonies, it will be infinitely better that it were done so openly. That seems to be the feeling in the Colony also, as will appear from the extracts quoted below.
 Referring to the Immigration Restriction Bill, The Natal Advertiser of 12th March, 1897, says:
 It is not an honest and straightforward measure for the reason that it attempts to disguise its real object, and, because it can only be acceptable if it is enforced in a partial manner. If its provisions are strictly enforced against European immigrants, it would be an injury to the Colony. If, on the other hand, it is enforced only against Asiatics it would be equally unjust and unfair in another direction.       If it is an anti-Asiatic Immigration Bill the Colony
 wants, let us have an anti-Asiatic  Immigration Bill	So far we can approve
 of the position taken up by the Demonstration Committee; their tactics, however, were not particularly effective	It was also another mistake  to
 
 drift, as Dr. MacKenzie did, into tall talk about fighting for his rights, and “cocking the rifle at the British Government”. We can assure the worthy doctor that expressions like these only disgust right-thinking Colonists.
 The Natal Witness, of the 27th February, thus remarks:
 There is nothing more repugnant to an Englishman’s feelings than to have recourse to stratagems and chicanery to gain an object, and this Bill to restrict immigration is a flagrant attempt to compass an end by subterfuges. The Colony loses its self-respect and the respect of others in resorting to such means.
Referring to the exemption of the indentured Indians from the
 operation of the Bill, The Times of Natal of 23rd February writes:
 The provision indicates the inconsistency of the Colony generally. All know that the indentured Indians settle in the Colony, and yet all, or, at any rate, a big majority of the electorate, are resolved to have indentured Indians. This inconsistency is remarkable and shows unmistakably how divided is public opinion on the whole subject. Indians are objected to on the score of their ignorance; also because they compete as clerks and artisans, and also because of their commercial rivalry. It may be remembered that, during the recent commotion at Durban, a section of the demonstration was about to proceed to a ship which had just arrived with some Indians from Delagoa Bay, for the purpose of preventing their landing, when some individual called out that the Indians were merchants, and this satisfied the mob. That incident in itself was sufficient to show how sectional is the antagonism to the immigration of the coolie.
 The most fatal objection, however, against those Bills is that they are intended to check an evil which does not exist. Nor is this all. There will be no finality to the anti-Indian legislation, if Her Majesty’s Government do not intervene on behalf of the Indian British subjects residing in the Colony. The Corporations have applied to the Government for powers to enable them to remove Indians to locations, to refuse to issue licences (this is practically covered by one of the Bills quoted above), and to refuse to sell or transfer immovable property to the Indians. It is believed that the Government have not returned an encouraging reply to the first and the last proposals; still, the proposals are there; and there is no guarantee that, because the Government feel disinclined to entertain the proposals at present, for reasons best known to them, they will remain in the same mood for ever.
 In conclusion, your Memorialists pray that, in view of the events narrated and the restrictive legislation forecasted above, a timely pronouncement of the policy with reference to the status of the Indian British subjects, or a confirmation of the despatch referred to above, be made so as to remove and prevent restriction on Her Majesty’s Indian subjects residing in the Colony of Natal, or grant such relief as may meet the ends of justice.
 And for this act of justice and mercy, your Memorialists shall, as in duty bound, ever pray.

 [January 25, 1897]
 By this public instrument of protest, be it hereby made known and made manifest unto all whom it may concern that on this the twenty-fifth day of January, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and ninety-seven (1897), before me, John Moore Cooke, of Durban, in the Colony of Natal, Notary Public, and in the presence of the subscribed witnesses personally came and appeared, Alexander Milne, master Mariner and Commander of the steamship Courland, of the burthen of 760 tons or thereabouts and of 120 nominal horse-power, belonging to this Port, and now lying in the inner harbour of this said Port of Natal, who did solemnly declare and state as follows, that is to say:
 That the said steamer, laden with a cargo of general merchandise and carrying 255 passengers, left the Port of Bombay on the 30th day of November last, and dropped anchor in the outer anchorage of this port, at 6.34 p.m., on the 18th day of December, 1896.
 Before leaving Bombay the crew and passengers were inspected and counted, and a bill of health and port clearance was granted.
 Throughout the voyage, the passengers and crew were absolutely free from sickness of any description whatsoever, and every day during the said voyage, the cleaning, ventilating, and disinfecting of the passengers’ quarters was strictly attended to, and upon arrival here the said appearer handed to the Health Officer of this port the usual documents as to the health of all on board and in reply to the said appearer’s enquiries, the Health Officer informed him that the said vessel would be placed in quarantine until 23 days had elapsed since leaving Bombay.
 On the 19th December, the said appearer signalled the shore: “I am getting short of water and must endeavour to get some.” Cleaning and disinfecting of ship strictly attended to.
 On the 22nd December, the appearer again signalled the shore as follows: “Our days have expired, are we out of quarantine? Please consult Quarantine Officer, report we all well; thanks”, to which the following reply was received: “Length of quarantine not decided yet.” During each of these four days of quarantine, the said appearer’s vessel was cleaned and disinfected and quarantine regulations were strictly adhered to.
 On the 23rd December, the following was signalled by the said appearer: “Distressed for want of water, want grass for horses. Perfect health on board, inform owners, use every exertion to relieve us from quarantine”, to which a reply was received as follows: “From owners: condense water, hope to hear relief from quarantine this afternoon; send hay off tomorrow morning; have you a mail?”
 On the 24th December, the Health Officer boarded, and ordered that all old mats, dirty rags and old clothes be burnt; that the holds were to be fumigated and whitewashed, and all clothes to be hung up and disinfected; that food stuff was to be kept from coming in contact with passengers, and all the passengers’ wearing apparel was to be dipped in carbolic acid, that the passengers themselves were to be washed in    a weak solution of carbolic acid, and every effort was to be used to keep the vessel clear of sickness. He also said, the quarantine would be 11 days from this date.
 On the 25th December, a large quantity of passengers’ sleeping mats were burned; all passengers’ quarters, water-closets and urinals whitewashed  and disinfected.
 On the 26th December, the passengers were washed and their clothing apparel dipped in diluted carbolic acid. The following was signalled to the shore: “Distressed for want of water send at once, also fresh provisions and stuff, according to order of Quarantine Officer. Is there anything to prevent landing horses, Quarantine Officer having visited us. Perfect health on board, and Quarantine Officer’s orders being executed. Relieve us quickly, passengers much distressed at delay. Thanks.”
 On the 27th December, the appearer hoisted the signal: “Are you sending order of yesterday?”, in reply to which the following signal was displayed at the signal station: “Have arranged to supply water 9 a.m. tomorrow.” “ Distressed for want of water” was then signalled by the said appearer and kept flying for 2 hours. As usual, cleaning and disinfecting of the ship throughout was strictly attended to.
 On the 28th December, the following signal was made: “Send everything wanted in order of Saturday, also letters, likewise information respecting landing horses.” At 11 a.m. the steam tender Natal came alongside, and put on board carbolic acid for disinfecting and sulphur for fumigating purposes. The police officer also boarded to superintend the use of the above-mentioned disinfectants. A quantity of fresh water was also put aboard. The ship was thoroughly fumigated with burning sulphur, the upper and lower decks thoroughly washed with carbolic acid, and the
 same disinfectant was used throughout the ship. All bedding, mats, bags, baskets, and all other material likely to propagate disease was burned in ship’s furnaces.
 On the 29th December, the upper and lower decks were washed with carbolic acid, and the same disinfectant used freely throughout the ship. The following signal was hoisted by the said appearer: “Disinfection and fumigation carried out to satisfaction of officer on board. Please inform Quarantine Officer at once.” At 10 a.m., four hours later, the said appearer signalled the shore: “We are ready, waiting for Quarantine Officer.” At 2.30 p.m. the steam tender Lion came alongside and put the Quarantine Officer aboard, who, after inspecting the ship throughout, expressed himself as being perfectly satisfied with the manner in which his orders had been carried out, but said that the vessel should have to remain in quarantine for a further 12 days from this date. At 3 p.m. the following signal was hoisted: “By order of the Government, all passengers’ bed-clothes having been burnt, request Government to renew same at once, as passengers’ lives are in danger without them. Want written instructions how long quarantine is to last, as verbal time changes [with] every visit of Quarantine Officer. No case of sickness occurring in the interval. Give notice to Government our ship has been disinfected every day since leaving Bombay. Want 100 fowls and 12 sheep.” Cleaning and disinfecting of the ship strictly attended to.
 On the 30th December, the said appearer signalled as follows: “Reply to our signal of yesterday. Passengers wish to disembark, will pay their own expenses in quarantine.”
 On the 31st December, the said appearer again signalled the shore as follows: “Do you intend this year to answer my signals of Tuesday and yesterday?” Cleaning and disinfecting of ship strictly attended to as usual.
 On the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th January, 1897, the ship was regularly every day ventilated, cleaned and disinfected throughout, and all quarantine regulations strictly observed.
 On the 9th January, the cleaning and disinfecting was repeated. At 5.30 p.m. the said appearer received a letter per the Natal from the owners through Mr. Gandhi, advising not to remove the steamer without express instructions from them, as it was dangerous to the lives of the Indian passengers. Not even after receiving pratique was the steamer to be moved.
 On the 10th January, the following signal was hoisted: “Quarantine having again expired, wish to disembark at once four European passengers. Also send water and fresh provisions. Want instructions as to landing horses. Send fodder. Report we all well.” These signals were all understood at the Station on shore and the Answering Pennant hoisted in reply to each. Cleaning and disinfecting repeated as usual.
 On the 11th January, the Health Officer visited the ship and granted pratique. At 1.30 the tender Natal put on board 4,800 gallons of water. Four  European passengers landed per Natal after hoisting signal, “My European passengers refused a passage on shore by the Natal. Please give instructions.” At 4 p.m. signals were hoisted on shore, but could not be made out owing to haziness. Cleaning and disinfecting as well as ventilating of holds strictly attended to. A letter was received, signed by Harry Sparks, “Chairman of Committee”, and is hereto annexed and marked “A”,libtech_80_footnoteand copies of which are annexed to the duplicate original and protocol hereof. Certain enclosures were said to be made therewith, but were never received by the said appearer.
 On the 12th January, cleaning and ventilating, etc., having been repeated at
 4.30 p.m., “Captain will be off tomorrow” was signalled from the shore.
 On the 13th January, at 7.10 a.m., the Government tug Churchill came alongside with Pilot Gordon, who ordered the said appearer to heave short the cable, and to be ready to go inside at 10.30 a.m., this being a distinct order from  Government, through the Port Captain. The said appearer having received instructions from the owners of the said Courland not to move without orders from them, requested Pilot Gordon to notify the owners that he was entering the harbour on Government orders. At 11.50, the Pilot came off in the tug Richard King, the vessel was got under way and taken across the bar. At 12.45, the Port anchor was let go and the vessel moored head and stern to buoys. At 1.15, Mr. H. Escombe, the Attorney- General for the Colony, came alongside with the Port Captain, and requested the said appearer to inform the passengers that they were under the protection of the Natal Government, and that they were as safe here as they would be in their own Indian villages. At 3 p.m., orders were received from the Port Captain to inform passengers they were free to land.
 And the said Alexander Milne did further declare that, since the arrival of his said vessel in the inner harbour of this Port, on the 13th January, till the afternoon  of the 23rd instant, his said vessel has been obliged to continue moored in the stream, instead of obtaining a berth at the wharf, while other vessels have arrived, and accommodation has been found for them at the said wharf. And that the Port Captain has refused to explain to the said appearer the reason for such treatment.
 On the 16th January, the said Alexander Milne appeared before the Notary, Frederic Augustus Laughton, at Durban, aforesaid, and cause his protest to be duly noted.
 
 And the appearer protests, and I, the said Notary do also protest against the aforesaid acts of the Government, or Government officials, and all loss or damage occasioned thereby.
 Thus done and passed in due form of law at Durban, Natal, the day, month and year
 first before written in the presence of the witnesses hereunto subscribing.

  Neither 	you nor your passengers may be aware that the feeling in the Colony 	against the inflow of Asiatics has been running very high lately, 	and has culminated on the arrival of your ship and the Naderi.  Following 	on that, public meetings have been held in Durban, at which the 	enclosed resolutions were carried with acclamation. So largely 	attended were these meetings that all desiring it could not get into 	the Town Hall.  Almost 	every man in Durban has signed signifying his intention to prevent 	those on board your ship and the Naderi 	landing in the Colony 	and we are most desirous there should, if possible, be avoided a 	conflict between the men of Durban and your passengers, which will 	most assuredly happen if they attempt to land.  As 	your passengers are ignorant of the state of feeling, and have come 	here in ignorance, and we have it from the Attorney-General that if 	your people are willing to return to India, the Colony will pay the 	expense.  We 	shall therefore be glad to receive an answer from you before the 	ship comes alongside the wharf, whether the passengers elect to 	return to India at the Colony’s expense or to endeavour to force a 	landing against the thousands of men who are ready and waiting to 	oppose their landing.

 By this public instrument of protest, be it hereby made known and made manifest unto all whom it may concern that, on this the twenty-second day of January, in the year of our Lord, one thousand eight hundred and ninety-seven, before me, John Moore Cooke, of Durban in the Colony of Natal, Notary Public, and in the presence of the subscribed witnesses, personally came and appeared Francis John Raffin, Master Mariner and Commander of the steamship Naderi, of the burthen of 1,168.92 tons or thereabouts, and of 160 nominal horse-power, belonging to the Port of Bombay and now lying in the inner harbour of this Port, who did solemnly declare and state as follows, that is to say:
 That the said steamer, laden with a cargo of general merchandise and carrying 350 passengers, left the Port of Bombay on the 30th [28th?] day of November last and dropped anchor in the outer anchorage of this Port at noon on the 18th day of December, 1896.
 Before leaving Bombay, the crew and passengers were inspected and counted and a bill of health and port clearance was granted.
 Throughout the voyage, the passengers and crew were free from sickness save the saloon cook who suffered from swollen feet but who, on being examined on the 19th December by the doctor, was reported to be suffering from a complicated disease of the liver and kidneys of which he died on the 20th December, and upon arrival here, the said appearer handed to the Health Officer of this Port the usual documents as to the health of all on board, and in reply to the said appearer’s enquiries, the Health Officer informed him that the said vessel would be placed in quarantine for five days in order to made 23 days from the time of leaving the Port of Bombay.
 On the following day the decks, passengers’ and crew’s quarters were washed and disinfected.
 On the 20th December, the decks, passengers’ and crew’s quarters and the ship were washed down and thoroughly disinfected fore and aft.
 On the 21st December, the ship was washed down, and all the water-closets, latrines, etc., were thoroughly disinfected and quarantine rules strictly observed.
 On the 22nd December, the decks were washed and the water-closets, latrines, etc., were disinfected.
 The five days imposed upon the ship by the Health Officer having expired, during which time the ship was in quarantine, and the rule of quarantine having been strictly observed, the said appearer signalled the shore station as follows: “What was decided about quarantine, answer will oblige”, to which the following reply was received, “Length quarantine not yet decided.”
 On the 23rd December, the decks were washed down and all water-closets and latrines disinfected, and the said appearer again signalled the shore as follows: “What about quarantine?”, and received the following reply, “Quarantine Officer has no instructions yet.”
 On the 24th December, the decks were washed and the water-closets disinfected, and on that day, the Health Officer and Police Superintendent came on board, whereupon the crew and passengers were mustered and inspected, the ship thoroughly disinfected, in which carbolic acid and carbolic powder were liberally employed. The passengers’ soiled clothing and all mats, baskets and useless articles were destroyed in the donkey furnace by the Health Officer’s instructions and a further term of twelve days’ quarantine imposed. The quarantine regulations have  been strictly observed up to this date.
 On the 25th December, the decks and between decks were washed down with a solution of carbolic and water, in the proportion of 1 to 20, as recommended by the Health Officer.
 On the 26th December, the decks were washed and the  water-closets disinfected, and quarantine rules strictly observed.
 On the 27th December, main deck and between decks were washed and disinfected with a solution of carbolic and water in the proportion of 1 to 20.

Passengers’ beds, bedding, and all soiled clothing destroyed in ship’s furnaces, and all the passengers’ clothing hung on lines on main and between decks, and nine sulphur fires placed, all hatches closed and fires kept burning till 6.30 p.m. Forecastle, saloon, and second-class cabins, water- closets and alleyways treated in a similar manner. Passengers and crew were washed in the solution, decks washed down, and all passengers’ accommodation washed with carbolic and water, and clothing placed in the solution.
 On the 29th December, the following was signalled to  the  shore: “Disinfection completed to the Officer’s satisfaction.” The Health Officer inspected the ship and declared himself satisfied with the disinfection carried out, and imposed twelve days’ quarantine on the ship and crew from this date.
 On the 30th December, the following was signalled to the shore: “Ask Government to supply at once 250 blankets for passengers instead of those destroyed by Government; passengers are suffering greatly without them, other wise disembark them at once. Passengers suffering from cold and wet, fear sickness in consequence.”
 On the 9th January, the following was signalled to the shore by the said appearer: “Quarantine finished. When shall I obtain pratique? Please reply.”
 On the 11th January, the Health Officer boarded and granted pratique, the Quarantine flag was hauled down, and the appearer asked permission to land, and was
 told that he was not allowed to do so, in the presence of the Police Officer and Pilot. The Natal came along with the Pilot who boarded and filled in the papers and port documents, and left orders for the said Francis John Raffin to be ready to enter the harbour, if signalled from shore.
 On the 12th January, there were no signals from the shore.
 On the 13th January, the Churchill came alongside with Government order to be ready to go inside at 10-30 a.m. At half past twelve, the appearer’s vessel dropped anchor and moored alongside the steamship Courland. At 2.30, orders were received from the Port Captain to inform passengers that they were free to land.
 And the appearer protests, and I the said Notary do also protest against the aforesaid acts of the Government or Government officials, and all loss or damage occasioned thereby.
 Thus done and passed in due form of law at Durban, Natal, the day, month and year first before written in the presence of the witnesses hereunto subscribing.

  THE 	HONOURABLE 	HARRY 	ESCOMBE   
  SIR,    I 	have the honour to enclose a copy of a telegram which I today 	despatched to 
  you 	at Pietermaritzburg, not knowing that His Excellency the Governor 	was at Durban.  The 	Courland, s.s., 	and Naderi, 	s.s., left 	Bombay on 	the 28th and 	 30th ultimo,libtech_82_footnoteand on 	their arrival 	here on 	Friday last, 	were placed in 	quarantine under 	a proclamation 	dated the same day and 	published in 	a Gazette 	Extraordinary dated 	the day 	after, although 	there had 	been no 	sickness of 	any sort 	on board 	the respective 	steamers during their 	respective voyages.  Under 	the Law 4 	of 1882, it 	is enacted that it 	shall be 	lawful  for  His  Excellency, 	with the advice 	of his Executive 	Council, from time to 	time, to 	make such 	orders and 	rules as 	may be 	deemed necessary 	to meet exceptional 	cases, and 	to determine whether, and 	under what circumstances, 	any ship 	or vessel 	may be partially 	or wholly, exempted from 	the operation of 	law, and a 	petition is 	being prepared 	to His 	Excellency with the 	object of 	showing that such 	exceptional circumstances exist, 	and I 	am desirous 	of introducing 	a deputation 	to His Excellency 	to present 	the petition, 	and of myself 	appearing before 	His Excellency as 	Counsel for 	 the shipowners 	in support 	of their petition.  The 	vessels are being detained at an expense to the respective owners of 	one hundred and fifty pounds per diem, and they are, therefore, 	anxious to appear before His Excellency on as early a day as he will 	be pleased to appoint.  I 	have the honour to be, Sir,  Your 	obedient servant,  (Sd.) 	F. A. LAUGHTON

  The 	Governor desires me to say that, 	although in such a matter 	 of administration as 	quarantine, he 	will, of 	course, refer to 	ministers for 	advice, he 	will,  if 	it is still wished, 	receive a deputation 	tomorrow in 	Pietermaritzburg, of 	gentlemen interested 	in the Subject.

That 	the Proclamation 	referred [to] is dated 	the 18th 	instant, and was 	published in a Gazette 	Extraordinary, dated 	the 19th instant. 
 That your Petitioners submit as follows:
  That 	a proclamation 	is a 	“publication by 	authority, or 	notice public,” 	and that 	the said 	Proclamation not 	being published until 	the 19th 	instant, could not 	apply to 	said steamers 	which had actually 	arrived on the 	18th instant.  That 	by a strict 	construction of the 	words contained in 	Section 1 	of Law 4, 	of 1882, the 	Proclamation could only 	apply to 	steamers which, after 	the notification 	of the 	said Proclamation both 	left and arrived 	here from the 	infected Port.  That 	the crowding 	of large 	numbers of 	passengers on 	steamers of 	the description of those aforesaid is conducive to illness and epidemic.  That 	from the certificates 	of medical 	men hereto 	annexed, it will 	appear that 	the passengers 	could be landed without 	any danger to  the 	community.  That 	in consequence 	of the acts 	aforesaid your Petitioners are 	sustaining damage 	averaging one hundred and fifty pounds per diem. 
 Wherefore, your Petitioners pray that the Medical Officer of the Port may be directed to grant pratique to the said vessels, or that such relief may be granted in the premises as is meet. And your Petitioners will ever pray, etc.

  1st. 	How long after contraction would the symptoms of bubonic fever or 	plague be manifest?  The 	period of incubation varies from a few hours to a week 	(Crook-shank’s, 4th 	Edition, 1896). I have killed guinea pigs in 24 hours by inoculating 	with the cultivation.  2nd. 	Would you expect the disease to exist on a ship 18 days after 	leaving the infected port, meanwhile no sickness on board?—No.  3rd. 	What would be the effect of keeping 350 Indians cooped up in a small 	steamer at the outer anchorage for a considerable time during this 	hot weather?—Most disastrous to the Indians.

  For 	your information regarding the plague now prevalent in Bombay, I 	will answer your questions seriatim.  Firstly, 	the incubation period is generally considered to be from 2 to 8 	days, though Sir Walter Broadbent considers the period from a few 	hours to 21 days. Twenty-one days appears to be the outside limit 	the disease can require to make itself manifest after contraction.  Secondly, 	in my opinion, if there was beyond doubt a clean bill of health 	during a 21 days’ voyage, there would be no danger of the disease 	in that boat.  Thirdly, 	the keeping 	closely packed of a large 	number of persons 	in a confined 	space is always liable to lead to ill health, and therefore to be avoided if possible.  I 	am, Faithfully yours,  (Signed) 	N. S. HARRISON,  M.D., 	B.A., 	CANTAB.

  Courland, 	s.s., and 	representing the owners of the Naderi, 	s.s., to bring to 	your notice that these vessels with 255 and 356 passengers on board 	respectively, have been lying in the outer anchorage, bound from 	Bombay to this Port, since Friday last, the 18th instant, without 	pratique being 	granted to them by you, although the respective masters have been 	ready and willing, and still are, to sign a declaration in terms of 	Law 3, 1858, testifying to the perfect state of health of all on 	board the said respective vessels throughout the voyage, and to do 	all things necessary to meet the requirement of the law.  We 	are instructed to request you immediately to grant pratique 	to the said vessels 	to enable them to enter the harbour and discharge their passengers 	and cargo.  In 	case you should refuse to grant our request, we shall be glad if you 	will inform us of the grounds of your refusal; and as this is a 	matter of the utmost urgency, we shall feel obliged by giving us 	[sic] 	your reply at your earliest convenience.

  DEAR SIR,  We 	have your letter of today wherein you state, with reference to your 	refusal to grant pratique, 	that you do not do so 	because you do not consider it safe to do so except on the 	conditions stated by you.  In 	reply, we beg to draw your attention to the fact that you still give 	us no reply to the question contained in our letter to you, of 	yesterday .  In 	order that there may be no mistake between us, we beg to draw your 	attention to the Law, by which you will see that pratique 	can be refused on 	certain grounds, and we ask you to state your grounds in this case.

  GOODRICKE, 	LAUGHTON & 	COOKE   GENTLEMEN,  I 	have your letter of 	December 25th, 1896. I 	cannot let 	any risk to 	the Colony 	be run 	by giving 	pratique to 	the steamers without 	proper precautions.  If 	the passengers are not landed into quarantine quarters, 12 days must 	run after fumigation of 	the ship and precautions 	as regards 	clothing, namely, by 	washing and 	disinfecting, and 	the burning of 	sundry old 	rags, mats, sacks, etc., 	in accordance 	with instructions 	given by me to each 	Captain, before pratique 	can be 	given. If 	the owners 	agree to 	bear the expense 	of quarantine, 	then the 	landing must 	be preceded by fumigation and precautions as above, and after the 	landing is effected, the departure of the 	steamers will be 	facilitated; but 	there must be 	no contact with shore 	except under proper 	restrictions. If you 	want to 	get the steamers 	away, the simplest 	course will be  to 	arrange for 	the owners to 	bear the expense 	of quarantining 	the passengers 	on the 	Bluff for twelve 	days after fumigation, 	etc., of 	the ship, 	or for 	any longer period, 	should such necessity arise.  As 	regards any legal points connected with the matter, please write to 	the Clerk of the Peace, as I have nothing to do with them.  Yours 	obediently,  (Signed) 	D. Birtwell   
            TO  D. 	BIRTWELL, 	ESQ., 	M.D.  (APPENDIX 	P)  Copy       DURBAN,  December 	26, 1896 
   DEAR 	SIR,    We 	have your letter of today, We have three times asked you for your 	reasons for refusing pratique 	to the steamers 	Courland and 	Naderi and 	each time you have evaded the question. We must, therefore, take it 	that you refuse to give them.  We 	have been informed by the Principal 	Under-Secretary that 	you have 	informed the 	Government that 	you base 	your refusal on the 	fact that the 	bubonic plague 	is prevalent 	at Bombay, 	and that 	there is danger 	of infection 	if pratique 	is granted to these steamers, and unless we hear from you to the contrary, we shall take 
 it that this is your reason. Presuming this to be a good ground in law, it would certainly have to be based on reasonable grounds.
 Dr. Crookshank, in his recent edition on bacteriology, says “that the period of incubation varies from a few hours to a week.” Drs. Prince and Harrison, in their respective reports which we annexed to our clients’ petition to the Government, say much the same, and you, we are informed, give the period of twelve days. It is now 26 and 28 days respectively since the vessels left Bombay, and they have now, and have had, ever since the commencement of their respective voyages, an absolute clean bill of health; and yet, despite these facts, you declare it as your intention to refuse pratique until a period of twelve days have [sic] elapsed after you have disinfected the passengers and ships. Our clients instruct us to protest against such a course, and to inform you that you will be held responsible for all loss caused to them by reason of your refused pratique, and also for the injury to the health of the passengers, which is likely to ensue from being confined to the steamers for a lengthened period.
 We are, likewise, instructed to draw your attention to the fact that the steamers have now been at the outer anchorage for upwards of eight days, and that it would appear from your letter of today that no steps have been taken to disinfect them, although on Thursday morning last you informed the writer that you would probably do it that afternoon; for this delay you will also be held responsible.
 With regard to placing the passengers in quarantine on shore at the expense of the owners of the vessels, we have to inform you that our clients regard your refusal of pratique as an illegal action, and they will, therefore, be no party to  your proceedings, further than to request you, without one hour’s unnecessary delay, to take such steps as you may think proper for what you are pleased to call disinfecting the vessels. Moreover, the course you suggest would not decrease the damage to our clients because they would be unable to land the ships’ cargo.
 We beg to record the fact that the Health Officer, on the arrival of the steamers, stated it as his opinion that pratique could be granted without any danger, and that, if he were permitted, he would do so, but he was thereupon, suspended by the Government, and you appointed in his place.
 Also that Drs. MacKenzie and Dumat, having been privately interviewed by Mr. Escombe on the question, were at his suggestion (as he informed the writer) called  in by you to give their opinion as to refusing the pratique.
 We are, Sir,
 Your obedient servants,

DURBAN,
 January 8, 1897
  THE 	HONOURABLE 	THE COLONIAL 	SECRETARY 	MARITZBURG 
  SIR,    We 	have the honour to bring the following facts to your notice.  We 	are the owners of the Courland 	s.s., and we 	represent the owners of the 
  Naderi 	s.s., which steamers 	left Bombay for this port on the 30th November last,libtech_83_footnoteand arrived here, 	respectively, on the 18th ultimo at 5.30 p.m. and 2 p.m., having on 	board, respectively, 255 and 356 of Her Majesty’s Indian subjects.  On 	the following morning, a Gazette 	Extraordinary was 	issued by the Government, containing a Proclamation of the Governor, 	proclaiming Bombay an infected port.  The 	above steamers had 	absolutely clean bills of 	health on 	arrival, and 	during the 	whole of 	their respective 	voyages, but they 	were refused pratique 	on grounds 	which the 	Acting Health Officer of 	the Port refused 	to give, 	but which, 	we presume, 	were given to us by 	telegram from 	the Principal 	Under-Secretary, dated 	the 24th 	ultimo, as 	follows: “That 	the Medical Committee has 	advised Government that 	the period 	of incubation 	of the 	bubonic plague being 	sometimes as much 	as twelve 	days, the 	quarantine should be of that period after all chances of 	disinfection [sic] 	have been destroyed, and 	Committee has 	also recommended 	the thorough disinfection 	of immigrants 	and their 	clothing, and 	the burning of 	all old rags 	and dirty 	clothing. Government 	has approved 	the Committee’s 	Report, and 	has instructed the 	Health Officer 	to act upon 	it, and not to grant 	pratique to 	the ships 	until he is satisfied 	that the 	conditions of 	the Report have been fulfilled.”  The 	steamers lay 	at anchor 	in the 	outer anchorage from 	the 18th ultimo, until 	the 28th 	ultimo, without any steps 	whatever being taken to 	disinfect them, but 	on the 	29th ultimo, 	we believe, 	disinfection was 	completed, in 	terms of  the  above 	mentioned report of 	the Medical Committee.  This 	delay in disinfection cost the owners of the steamers one hundred 	and fifty pounds per diem, or a sum of £1,650.  Relying 	on the assurance 	contained in 	the  Principal  	Under-Secretary’s 	telegram of 	the 24th, 	that pratique with 	all its privileges 	would be 	granted to 	the steamers 	if they 	were placed in the 	hands of 	the Health 	Officer, for 	the purpose of 	undergoing the requirements of the Medical Committee’s Report, steamers were so    
 placed in his hands to great injury (1) to the passengers, as all their beds bedding and much of their clothing was burned, and for several nights, many of them were left to sleep on the boards; (2) to us as owners, inasmuch as our steamers have been detained during the days of quarantine at an expense of £150 per diem; and (3) to the friends and countrymen of the passengers, who have supplied their wants by furnishing beds, bedding, clothing and food during the detention.
 During the last few days, two meetings of excited European townspeople have been held at Durban, called together under the following notice which appeared in several issues of The Natal Advertiser:
 “Wanted every man in Durban, to attend a meeting to be held in the large room at the Victoria Cafe, on Monday evening next, the 4th January, at 8 o’clock, for the purpose of arranging a demonstration to proceed to the Point and protest against the landing of Asiatics, Harry Sparks, Chairman of Preliminary Meeting.”
 The two meetings were largely attended, and in spite of the unlawful objects of such meetings clearly indicated in the above notice, the Town Hall of Durban was opened for such meetings.
 We quite recognize the right of Her Majesty’s subjects to ventilate their grievances in public meetings, provided the objects of such meetings are legal, and as regards the first of the said two meetings held on the 4th instant, we would draw your attention to the report of it which appeared in the Mercury and The Natal Advertiser of the 5th instant, by which you will see that, in spite of declaration by certain speakers to the contrary, violence to the passengers or to some of them was contemplated in the event of the Government not granting their request, and in the event of the passengers being landed.
 But as regards Dr. Mackenzie, who formed one of the Medical Committee upon whose report the steamers were placed in quarantine, and who, as on of such  Committee, is supposed to have given his opinion with impartiality and fairness, we would venture to bring to your notice extracts of a speech which he delivered to such meeting in proposing the following resolution, that is to say:
 “Every man at this meeting agrees and binds himself, with a view to assisting the Government to carry out the foregoing resolution, to do all his country may require of him, and with that view will, if necessary, attend at the Point at any time when required.”
 The following are extracts of Dr. MacKenzie’s speech taken from the report of a gentleman employed by us:
 “Mr. Gandhi had dragged their reputation about in the gutters of India, and painted them as black and filthy as his own skin. (Laughter and applause.)”
 “They would teach Mr. Gandhi to come to the Colony of Natal, to take everything that was fair and good in it, and then to go out of it and blackguard them whose hospitality he had been enjoying. They would teach Mr. Gandhi that they read from his action that the coolies were not satisfied with what they (Colonists) had given him, and that he intended to get something more, and gentlemen, he would get something more. (Laughter and applause.)”
 “As the United States sent back some Chinamen to China, and even some people back to Glasgow, because the Yankees did not think them good enough, and they were going to send back a lot of unhealthy bubonic individuals to the place from whence they came.”
 In speaking immediately to the resolution which he proposed, Dr. MacKenzie
 said:
 “Well, they saw that that brought them to the Point, (Loud applause.) He
 hoped they would be all there when required. There was nothing in that that any of them need be ashamed of. Every man, who had any manliness about him, should be prepared to do something for his country when their country required it.”
 “But, if the glimmering outlook that they could gather was going to indicate that the Indians were going to place themselves on the same platform as the whites, that could only be done in one way, and it could only be done at the end of the bayonet. (Applause.)”
 “They there that night were prepared to go to any extreme in defending their own honour, and in securing to their children places in the Colony, which even now they had given away to the heirs and offspring of Gandhiites. (Applause.)”
 “He had come to the meeting in a bit of a hurry, but he thought he had placed before them the leading points, and it meant this, that they were going to back the Government up in this matter, that they believed the Government would co-operate with them, and that not a soul would be allowed to land from those two ships in the harbour of Durban. (Loud applause.)”
 We extract the following from the report of the proceedings at the second meeting held on the 7th instant contained in The Mercury of today:
 MR. J. S. WYLIE: “Somebody said ‘sink the ships,’ and he had heard a naval man say he would give a month’s pay for one shot at the ships.” (Cheers and laughter.) “Was every man prepared to put down a month’s pay in this matter? (Cries of ‘Yes,’ and ‘Unanimous’.)”
 MR. SYKES: “They must make up their minds to lose both time and money; they must be prepared to leave their work and proceed to Demonstration. It must be done on an organized system—they must obey their leader. It was no good for everyone to throw one another overboard. (Laughter.) They must strictly obey orders. At the word of command, ‘fall in’, and do what they were commanded.” (Cheers, laughter and encores). He moved: “That we proceed by demonstration to the Point on the arrival of the Indians, but each man binds himself to conform to the orders of his leaders. (Cheers).”
 DR. MACKENZIE: “Since they last met, the position had become less acute. They had advanced the line laid down, and they knew exactly the position of the Government, the willingness of the Government to assist them by all the power they had at their disposal. As far as the Government was concerned, he was thoroughly satisfied. The Government on this point were absolutely at one with the burgesses of
 Durban, and therefore, they had to set aside any question as to difficulty of conflict with the gentlemen whom the electors had placed, for the time being, in the position of the Government. They were in accord with the Colony, and that was a matter for congratulation. Unfortunately, the Government was so placed that they could not insist on the Indians not landing here, and being sent back in the ships in which they came. That was practically impossible; and the Committee pointed out to Mr. Escombe that this condition of things was an anomaly. There must be some short-fall in the Constitution of the Colony when the best interests and absolute desires of the Colonists could not be achieved and met by the machinery of Government. (Cheers.) They pointed out that the Colonists would insist that that condition of things should cease, and that the Government should be placed in the position of being able to meet the wishes and necessities of the country. Mr. Escombe agreed with them, and they had heard what steps had been taken to meet the urgency of the case. Government was taking all the steps it could, and, within a day or two, he hoped that every meeting held throughout the Colony would show one unanimous desire for and immediate summoning of Parliament. The men of Durban were unanimous. He said the men of Durban-there were a few old women knocking about the place. (‘Hear, hear’, and laughter.) They had only to take the tone of some of the leaders of the newspapers to see the type of men who stuck behind the quill. Men who wrote that sort of thing presumed that the burgesses did not know what was right, and had not got the pluck that was absolutely necessary to do what was right, because a little bit risk attached to it. (Cheers.) If there were any of those old ladies there, they would, doubtless, have stepped up when the Chairman asked for hands against the resolution. They must presume none were there, and they wanted no connection with that class of persons.
 “The resolution had relation to the fair dealing of the Colony of Natal. All but one man on board those boats left India without any reason to suspect that they would not the agreeably received as residents in the colony. One passenger might be reasonably expected to have had some suspicion of that point. (Cries of ‘Gandhi’, laughter and uproar.)”
 “Anything he said regarding the Indians did not refer to that gentleman. (‘no gentleman’.) They laid down the rule, and no more Indians should come in.
 “They had a right to shut the door, and they intended to shut the door. They would deal fairly also with these people now in quarantine—they would even be fair in dealing with respect to that solitary individual, but he hoped there would be a marked distinction between the dealing. (Laughter.) They were prepared to leave the matter in the hands of the Government so far as constitutional and international relations were concerned, but there was a private relation he did not intend to lay down-personal duty   to themselves and the rest of the Colony. They did not intend to lay down the agitation until they achieved something. With that object in view, he wished the
 burgesses of Durban to be ready at any time, as they had been in the past, to go down to the Point when called upon to make a demonstration, and they would show the people who came by these boats what the Colonists of Natal meant, and they would also have a further object, which would be gained from instructions of the leaders when they were there. (Cheers and laughter.) Everyone could associate himself with a certain leader, and through him gain information as to a notice they would get, and that notice meant that they got to the Point, they would get, and that notice meant that they had to throw down their tools and go straight to the Point. (Cheers.) When they got to the Point, they would be under orders—each would know if he took the trouble to find out. Then they would do exactly what their leader told them, if he told them to do anything. (Laughter.) In the course of a day or two, some fresh  development would take place, and it would again be necessary to refer to them in another public meeting, because they did not wish to have their individual views or styles, but absolutely be the representatives of the people. (Cheers.)”
 
 “The Chairman hoped they would all stick to their ‘guns’. Let them not be unanimous then, and when deeds were wanted find only one third of their number. The Demonstration would be a peaceable demonstration as regards the Indians on board— as regards one man it would be left to the leaders and them to deal with him down there. (Loud cheers and laughter.) They now wanted organization to carry out the object in view. Some men had said they would be able to bring fifty or one hundred men who were in their service, and they wanted volunteers of that kind who would lead so many men and be responsible for them. (A voice, ‘Have a review on Saturday.’)”
 “Mr. Wylie said it would assist in the organization, and in the regulation of the Demonstration, if men gave in their names with a list of men who were willing to act with each, and would follow his lead. The Chairman would then know the Section Leaders, to whom to send word, and they in turn would inform their Company. There was, of course, only one leader, Mr. Sparks, but he could not speak to 5,000 men, and this means of communication was necessary. (A voice—It looks more like business now.)”
 The meeting appears to have been greatly encouraged, in the carrying out of their demonstration, by the report made to the meeting of a Committee which had waited on Mr. Escombe, Her Majesty’s Minister of Defence in this Colony. The Committee reported as follows:
 “Mr. Escombe treated the Committee at an interview that morning, extending over two hours, in a fair and reasonable manner. He said: ‘The Government is with you to a man, and wish to expedite this in every possible way. But you must be careful not to do anything which will hamper our hands. Spurring an unwilling horse to death
 is a very different thing to spurring a willing horse to death.’ Then the Committee said: ‘If the Government did nothing, Durban would have to do it herself, and go in force to the Point, and see what could be done.’ They capped that by remarking: ‘We presume that you, as representing the Government and good authority of the Colony would bring force to oppose us?” Mr. Escombe said: ‘We will do nothing of the sort; we are with you and we are going to do nothing of the sort to oppose you. But, if you put us in such a position, we may have to go to the Governor of the Colony and ask him to take over the reins of this Colony as we can no longer  conduct  the Government. You will have to find some other persons.’ (Uproar.)”
 It is not for us to express our opinion regarding such words as these, if they were actually uttered by the Minister of Defence, but we would most respectfully draw your attention to the extreme danger of allowing a large body of excited men to proceed to the point, however peaceful their original intentions may have been, and more especially, when from the utterances of the speakers and the comments thereon of the meeting, the gravest cause of anxiety must be aroused regarding the objects of the Demonstration, and the safety of the passengers on the two steamers.
 We would respectfully submit that as law-abiding inhabitants of this Colony, we have endeavoured cheerfully to submit to the requirements of the Government, despite serious loss to us, and that having so complied, we are entitled, on obtaining pratique, to discharge our steamers’ passengers at the wharf, and that in so doing, we are entitled to the protection of the Government for passengers and property against the lawless acts of any persons, whoever they may be. But, in order to render unnecessary any act on the part of the Government which might tend to intensify the excitement which exists, we are ready to co-operate with the Government in taking all necessary steps for the landing of passengers quietly and unknown to the public. We shall be glad to hear if this suggestion meets with your approval, and if so, what  is required of us in carrying it out.
 We have the honour to be, Sir,
 Your obedient servants,  (Signed) DADA ABDOOLLA & CO.

 COLONIAL SECRETARY’S OFFICE, NATAL, PIETERMARITZBURG,
 January 11, 1897
  GENTLEMEN,   I 	am instructed to reply to your two letters of the 8th and 9th 	instant.  Your 	proposal for the landing of the passengers quietly and unknown to 	the public is impossible. The Government understand that you have 	requested the Port Captain not to bring the vessels inside without 	special instructions. This action on your part, and your letters now 	under reply, show that you are aware of the intense feeling 	throughout the Colony against the landing of the Indians, and they 	certainly should be informed of the existence and strength of that 	feeling. 
            MESSRS 	DADA 	ABDOOLLA 	& CO. 	DURBAN  I 	am, Gentlemen, Your 	obedient servant,  (Signed) 	C. BIRD, 	PRINCIPAL UNDER-SECRETARY 
    	(APPENDIX T)   
           TO  THE 	HONOURABLE 	HARRY 	ESCOMBE  Copy    DURBAN,  January 10, 1897 
    DEAR SIR,    We 	have duly advised our clients, Messrs Dada Abdoolla and Co., of the 	result of Mr. Laughton’s conference with you of yesterday, whereat 	you repudiated Mr. Wylie’s public statement of what had fallen 	from you at your conference with the Committee of the Demonstration, 	and said that your statement to such Committee was to this effect: 	That, if the Ministers were unable to cope with a Durban riot, they 	would be unfitted to hold office, and would resign.  At 	your conference with Mr. Laughton, you also laid down the following 	propositions as recognized by the Government: 
  That 	upon the requirements 	of the 	quarantine being carried 	out, pratique 
 must be granted to the steamers Courland and Naderi,
  That 	upon pratique being 	granted, the steamers 	were entitled to 	discharge their 	passengers and 	cargo at the wharf, either 	by  the  steamers 	themselves being brought inside or by means of tugs and lighters.  That 	the Government 	is responsible 	for the protection 	of passengers 	and cargo 	from the violence 	of rioters. 
 On the other hand, you were informed by Mr. Laughton that, inasmuch as Indians had to dwell in this Colony with Europeans, our clients recognized it as desirable that, in the landing of passengers, as little as possible should be done which would tend to intensify a feeling, which at present apparently exists amongst a certain class of Europeans against the Indians; and, therefore, that he felt sure, that our clients would co-operate with the Government to the extent of postponing the disembarkation for a reasonable time to enable the Government to make proper arrangements.
 We are instructed to inform you that the time of quarantine expires today, and that, under ordinary circumstances, our clients would have proceeded with disembarkation today, but that they are willing to postpone it for a reasonable time to suit the convenience of the Government, provided the loss sustained by them in so doing, that is to say £150 per dies, is borne by the Government.
 We trust you will see the reasonableness of this proposal, and that it will be adopted by the Government.
 We draw your attention to the fact that several gentlemen holding Her Majesty’s commission in Volunteer Forces are organizing the intended riot, called by them a “Demonstration”, and have allowed themselves to be advertised in the newspapers and by placards, as being in command of sections of the intending rioters; also, that Captain Sparks has taken the same means of advertising himself as the Chief in command of the proposed riot.
 We would most respectfully and reluctantly give it as our opinion that, if the organization had at an earlier stage been proclaimed as illegal, instead of being allowed to swell itself under false hopes, the same excitement would not now exist, and there would have been little difficulty in landing the passengers in due course; and that the organization, or the objects of it, having been publicly declared to have the sympathy of the Government, which declaration was apparently confirmed by Government officers being in command, and by Government employees being in the ranks, it has obtained a hold on the public mind which otherwise it could not have done.
 We have the honour to be, Sir,
 Your obedient servants,

  I 	have received your letter dated ‘Durban Club, 10th January, 1897.’  I 	understood that the interview between Mr. Laughton and myself was to 	be regarded as a “private meeting”, the words used by him in his 	note of the 9th instant.  I 	do not accept as correct your record of what was said by Mr. 	Laughton and myself.

  THE 	HONOURABLE 	HARRY 	ESCOMBE  DEAR SIR,  We 	have received your letter of the 11th inst., wherein, in answer to 	our letter of the 10th instant, you state as follows:  	“I 	understand that the interview between Mr. Laughton and myself was to 	be regarded as a ‘private meeting’, the words used by him in his 	note of the 9th instant.  	“I 	do not accept as correct your record of what was said by Mr. 	Laughton and myself.”  In 	reply, we 	beg to 	state that 	it is quite 	true that Mr. Laughton, 	in his 	note of the 	9th inst., asked for 	a private 	meeting with you, but we 	would draw your attention 	to the fact that, 	before that interview 	had continued 	many minutes, 	you told Mr. 	Laughton that he 	was to recollect that 	every word which he 	uttered would be 	reported by you 	the following morning to 	your colleagues 	in the 	ministry; and 	also that you gave 	him your 	permission to repeat 	everything that had taken 	place between us to our 	clients. 
 We beg, on Mr. Laughton’s assurance, to assert what was said at the meeting was in effect accurately recorded in our letter to you of the 10th instant, but in order that there may be no misunderstanding, we shall be glad if you will point out the inaccuracies to which you refer.

  THE 	HONOURABLE 	HARRY 	ESCOMBE 
   SIR,    We 	have the honour to acknowledge a letter, signed by the Principal 	Under- 
  Secretary, 	of yesterday’s date, wherein he informs us that he is instructed 	to reply to our two letters to the Colonial Secretary of the 8th and 	9th instant, as follows:  	“Your 	proposal for the landing of the passengers quietly and unknown to 	the public is impossible. The Government understand that you have 	requested the Port Captain not to bring the vessels inside without 	special instructions. This action on your part, and your letters now 	under reply, show that you are aware of the intense feeling 	throughout the Colony against the landing of the Indians, and they 	certainly should be informed of the existence and strength of that 	feeling.”  We 	cannot but 	acknowledge the 	feeling, which at 	present exists among a 	certain class in 	Durban, against the 	landing of 	the Indians. 	But, at the 	same time, we 	must most 	respectfully inform you 	that this 	feeling has 	been fostered by the 	Government, rather than 	discouraged, in the 	manner pointed out 	to you 	in our 	letters of 	the 8th and 9th instant.  We 	beg to express our surprise at your making no reference to the 	following facts brought to your notice in our above-mentioned 	letters:   That 		meetings with 		illegal objects have been held and 		are being held by 		certain persons in 		Durban, without any 		attempt on 		the part 		of the 		Government to 		inhibit them. 2. 		That Dr. MacKenzie, 		one of 		the Medical 		Board, has been one of 		the most 		energetic instigators of 		the objects 		of these 		meetings. 3. That 		it had 		been stated 		 at some 		of those 		meetings that the 		Government was 		in sympathy 		with the objects 		of the meetings. 		4. That 		the Minister 		of Defence 		had stated 		to the 		Committee of 		the organization, 		practically, that the 		Government would 		take no 		steps to 		hinder the  
 rioters in attaining their illegal objects. 5. That we claimed the protection of the Government for passengers and property against the lawless acts of persons, whoever they may be. 6. To the “Declaration” of the rioters, set out in our letter of the 9th instant. 7. To railway employees of the Government taking part with the rioters. 8. To the leadership of the riot being under Captain Sparks and others of Her Majesty’s commissioned officers taking subordinate positions under him. 9. To our request that we should receive an assurance of the Government that Government servants will be prohibited from taking any part in the demonstration. 10. To our proposal to postpone the disembarkation for a reasonable time to suit the convenience of the Government, provided the loss sustained by us in so doing, that is to say £150 per diem, is borne by the Government.
 We now beg for a reply to each of these allegations and questions, and to request that you will inform us what steps, if any, have been taken to protect the disembarkation of the steamers.
 The steamers have now been at the outer anchorage for 24 days, at a cost of
 £150 per diem to us; and this being so, we trust you will see the reasonableness of your giving us a full answer by noon tomorrow. And we think it right to inform you that, failing a definite reply giving us an assurance that we shall be paid £150 per diem from Sunday last and that you are taking steps to suppress the rioters, so as to enable us to disembark the steamers, preparations will be at once commenced to steam into the harbour, relying on the protection which, we respectfully submit, Government is bound to give us.
 In order that there may be no mistake in the minds of the Government as to the objects of the rioters, we beg to enclose the copy of a notice signed by Captain Sparks, and served yesterday by his deputies, Captain Wylie and others, on the Captain of the Courland, s.s. (This letter appears elsewhere.libtech_84_footnote)
 The effect of this notice signed by Captain Sparks has been to make many passengers afraid of their lives in the event of landing at this port.
 We, likewise, beg to enclose a copy of a memorandum written by Captain Wylie and served upon the Captains of each of the steamers for their signatures, and represented by him as embodying the only terms upon which the ships will be allowed to disembark. (App. Wa.)
 We beg most respectfully to ask, in conclusion, if the Government will allow such flagrant acts to proceed which can only end in injury, if not death, to many of Her Majesty’s subjects.
 We have the honour to be, Sir,
Your obedient servants,
 (Signed) Dada Abdoolla & Co.

 SIR,
 
 I observe, in your leader in this morning’s issue of The Mercury, you give it as your opinion that Mr. Gandhi was ill advised in landing and coming through Durban on Wednesday last; and, as I was certainly a party to his coming ashore as he did, I shall feel obliged by your giving me an opportunity of answering your remark. Hitherto it has been useless to speak unless you were prepared  to  adopt  the programme of the Demonstration party and its particular mode of attaining its ends; but, now that the Committee is dissolved, and the minds of men are no longer being inflamed, I trust that my letter will receive calm and thoughtful consideration. Let me commence by saying that, while the agitation was proceeding, I obtained a copy of Mr. Gandhi’s pamphlet published in India, and concerning which we received Reuter’s cable some months ago, and I can assure your readers that Reuter not only misrepresented the pamphlet, but misrepresented it so much that, on reading the two,  I cannot but come to the conclusion that the writer of the cable had not read the pamphlet. I can say, further, that there is nothing in the pamphlet which anyone could take exception to on the ground of untruthfulness. Anyone can obtain a copy and read it if he chooses. Let your readers do so and answer honestly: Is there anything in it untrue? Is there anything in it which a political opponent was not justified in saying in support of his cause? Unfortunately, the mind of the public was inflamed by Reuter’s version of it,libtech_85_footnoteand throughout the recent disturbances, there was not a man to point out to the public the difference between the true and the untrue. I don’t wish to hurt any man’s feelings by repeating the words which he uttered in the hour of excitement and which, I know, in his calmer moments he will deeply regret, but, in order that the position may be understood, I must place before your readers, shortly, what Mr. Gandhi’s position was before he took the step of landing and coming into town. I shall, therefore, without mentioning names, give the effect of just a few of the public statements made concerning him: (1) That he had dragged our reputations through the gutters of India, and had painted them as black and filthy as his own face. (2) That he might be allowed to come ashore that we might have the opportunity of spitting at him. (3) That some special treatment, at the word of command, should be meted out to him and that he should never be allowed to land in Natal. (4) That he was engaging himself, on board the quarantined ship, in getting briefs from passengers against the Government. (5) That when three gentlemen, representing the Committee of the Demonstration, went on board the Courland, he was in such a ‘funk’ that he was stowed away in the lowest hold; and, on another occasion, that he was seen sitting on the deck of the Courland in a most dejected mood. These are only a few of the things stated against him, but I take them as sufficient for my purpose.
 
 
 If the above charges wee true, if, in other words, he was a cowardly calumniator, stabbing us when at a safe distance, and if he had acted so that he was a fit object to be spat at, and afraid to return and face the consequences, then he was unfitted to be a member of an honourable profession, or to hold the position of leader in a great political question in which his countrymen take as much interest as we do and are as much entitled to ventilate their political views as we are. Before he went to India, I had met him in business matters on several occasions, and was struck with the anxiety shown by him to avoid litigation and to put matters in dispute on a fair basis, and with the honourable manner in which he dealt with business matters, so much so that I formed a very high opinion concerning him. I say this advisedly and I have no doubt my words will be approved by the members of the profession who know Mr. Gandhi. It was once said by an eminent judge that success at the Bar was not attained by endeavouring to injure opponents at the Bar, but only by so qualifying one’s self as to be equal or superior to such opponents. So, in political matters, we must give fair play to an opponent, and answer his argument by counter argument, and not by heaving half a brick at his head. I have found Mr. Gandhi, both in legal matters and on the Asiatic question, a fair and honourable opponent, obnoxious to us as his contentions may be, who would scorn to hit below the belt. To vindicate himself before the public then, it was decided that he should not give his enemies an opportunity of saying that he was ‘funking it’ on board the Courland, where he could have stayed for a week, if he had chosen; that he should not sneak into Durban like a thief in the night, but that he should face the music like man and like a political leader, and—give me leave to say—right nobly did he do it. I accompanied him simply as a member of the Bar, to testify, by so doing, that Mr. Gandhi was an honourable member of an honourable profession, in order that I might raise my voice in protest against the way in which he had been treated, and in the hope that my presence might save him from insult. Your readers have now the whole matter before them, and the reasons which induced Mr. Gandhi, to land as he did. He Might have kept to the boat at Cato’s Creek, when he saw the crowd collecting to receive him; he might have taken refuge in the police-station; but he did not, he said he was quite ready to face the men of Durban and to trust them as Englishmen. Throughout the trying procession, his manliness and pluck could not have been surpassed, and I can assure Natal that he is a man who must be treated as a man. Intimidation is out of the question, because, if the knew the Town Hall were going to be thrown at him, I believe, from what I saw, that he would not quail. Now, you have the tale impartially told, I hope, Durban has grossly insulted this man. I don’t describe the scene; I prefer not [to]. I say Durban, because Durban raised the storm, and is answerable for the
 result. We are all humiliated at the treatment. Our tradition concerning fair play appears to be in the dust. Let us act like gentlemen, and, however much against the grain it may be, let us express regret handsomely and generously,—I am, etc., F. A. LAUGHTON.—The Natal Mercury, 16th January, 1897.
 There has been a good deal said about Reuter’s cabled summary of Mr. Gandhi’s Indian pamphlet, within the last day or two . . . The general impression that is conveyed by these summaries is unquestionably different to the impression created in the minds of those who read the pamphlet . . . Frankly, it may be admitted that Mr. Gandhi’s pamphlet is not an unfair statement of the position of the Indian in South Africa from an Indian’s point of view. The European refuses to recognize the Indian as an equal’ and the Indian, as a British subject, considers he has a right to all the privileges of the British subjects of European birth in the Colony, and under the Proclamation of 1858, he is legally entitled to that claim. That there is a prejudice in South Africa against the Indian, it would be folly to deny, but at the same time, Mr. Gandhi, we think, might make greater allowance for the fact that, as whole, his countrymen in South Africa are not of a class that, even in India, would be allowed to ride in first-class railway carriages or admitted into the best hotels . . . Coming back to the pamphlet and the cabled summaries, these latter might have been as correctly written of some pamphlet describing the treatment of the Armenians by the Turks, and, in fact, Reuter’s cable read by itself gives some such impression. When the pamphlet written by Mr. Gandhi, however, is read in its entirety, the context reveals the fact that, while there are instances of real hardship given, the bulk of it is made up of political grievances in many cases similar to those the Uitlanders complain of in the Transvaal. The pamphlet, in short, contains practically nothing that Mr. Gandhi did not publish previously in Natal, and nothing that is not generally known. On the other hand, it is useless for Mr. Gandhi, or anyone else, to endeavour to have the Indian accepted in South Africa at his own estimate. There is no  use  being  hypocritical in the matter. There is strong and deeply-rooted prejudice against Indians flocking into the country, and against their customs and mode of life. They may be British subjects by law, but they are aliens by what is stronger than law. viz., racial traditions and instincts.—The Natal Mercury, 18th January, 1897.
 It is now beginning to be admitted that the outcry against Mr. Gandhi was much more bitter and violent than warranted by the facts and that his statement, although perhaps exaggerated, did not amount to such a wilful and deliberate attempt to blacken the character of the Colonists as to justify the vindictive attitude assumed, doubtless, under a misconception, by some extremists. Mr. Gandhi is endeavouring to perform for his compatriots similar services to those which Englishmen have
 
 always been ready to perform, and, when time has been afforded for cool reflection, it will be recognized that, however mistaken his methods, or however untenable his theses, it is the worst possible policy to treat him as an outcast and a pariah, because he is striving to secure what he considers to be the rights of his fellow-countrymen. It has always been the boast of Englishmen that they can take up a side without abandoning all fair play to their opponents. Colonists know that it would be dangerous to the well-being of the Colony to grant what Mr. Gandhi demands; they know that the fundamental and abiding racial distinctions between the Asiatic and European for ever preclude anything like social equality, and that no argument will ever bridge the gulf; they know that, even though abstract justice may apparently be against them, the instinct of self-preservation warns them that theirs is the only safe position; in short, they know that the Colony cannot remain a white Colony if no limit is put to Asiatic immigration. All this, however, may be admitted, without spoiling our case by unfair and unnecessary harshness towards those who quite naturally, take other views. Harm has been done already by the accentuation of the personal element, and it is to be hoped that Colonists will, in future, exhibit that dignity and self-restraint in the conduct of the campaign, without which we cannot expect the approval of disinterested observers.—The Natal Mercury, 19th January, 1897.
 Mr. Gandhi’s statements to the Advertiser interviewerlibtech_86_footnotehave been read with considerable interest, and show that he has a good deal to say for himself. If his assertions are correct, there seems to have been a good deal of exaggeration in the statements made about him and his proposed scheme to swamp the Colony with Indians, which have had much to do with the irritation of the public mind against him. In the interests of justice it is to be hoped this matter will be cleared up. It has been asserted that the Government have information in their possession to prove the existence of this scheme. If so, the evidence ought to be brought forward, because this really constitutes the gravamen of the charges against Gandhi. Mr. Gandhi admits that “the leaders of the Demonstration Committee, and anybody in Natal, would be perfectly justified in getting up a constitutional agitation if there was an organized attempt to swamp the Colony with Indians.” So that, if the scheme can be proved, as some people state, Mr. Gandhi’s mouth will be closed . . . Then, again, he totally denies the assertion that he was instigating legal proceeding against the Government for unlawful detention. If there is any proof for that charge, it, too, should be produced. He denies, further, that a printing-press and compositors were brought ever by him, or that the number of passengers for Natal is anything like so great as alleged. These matters are surely capable of direct proof or disproof, and it would be well if they were settled, because, if what Mr. Gandhi says is true, it would
 
 seem that the recent agitation was started on insufficient grounds, and incorrect information . . . It will be necessary, if the aid of the Imperial Government is to be obtained, to have hard facts to go upon. It will not advance our cause to raise an outcry that the country is being swamped, and to talk about thousands of Indians coming across in one or two vessels, and then, when it is all boiled down, find there are only one or two hundred. No good will be gained by exaggeration . . . There is no getting away from the fact that this brutal outrage was committed on the very day of the Demonstration, under the influence of feelings excited by the Demonstration, and what led up to it, and also in defiance of the assurance of the representative of Government that the passengers were absolutely safe. The incident shows what might have happened on a larger scale if the Demonstration had been carried to the lengths which were at first intended. — The Natal Advertiser, 16th January, 1897.

 TO
 THE HONOURABLE THE SPEAKER AND MEMBERS OF THE HONOURABLE
 THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY OF THE COLONY OF NATAL IN PARLIAMENT ASSEMBLED,
 PIETERMARITZBURG
 
 THE PETITION OF THE UNDERSIGNED REPRESENTING THE
 INDIAN COMMUNITY IN THIS COLONY
 HUMBLY SHEWETH:
 That your Petitioners hereby venture to lay before this Honourable House the feeling of the Indian community with reference to the Quarantine, Trade Licences, Immigration and Uncovenanted Indians Protection Billslibtech_89_footnotethat are now, or soon will be, before this Honourable House for consideration.
 Your Petitioners understand that the first three Bills herein- above referred to are meant, directly or indirectly, to restrict the immigration of Her Majesty’s Indian subjects into the Colony. Strange as it may appear there is no mention of the persons whom they are meant to affect.libtech_90_footnotelibtech_91_footnoteWith the greatest deference, your Petitioners venture to submit that such a mode of procedure is un-British and, therefore, it should not receive countenance in a Colony which is supposed to be the most British in South Africa. If it is proved to the satisfaction of this Honourable House that the presence of the Indian in the Colony is an evil and there is an alarming influx of Indians into the Colony, your Petitioners submit that it will be better in the interests of all parties concerned that a Bill directly aiming at the  evil  be passed.
 
 But your Petitioners respectfully submit that it can be easily shown that the presence of the Indian in the Colony, instead of being an evil, is of benefit to it and that there is no alarming influx of Indians into the Colony.
 In is an admitted fact that the Indians, whom the Bills are calculated to keep away from the Colony,  are”sober and industrious”. Such is the opinion pronounced by the highest authorities in the land as well as by those who are their bitterest opponents. And your Petitioners submit that such a class of people cannot but be an economical benefit wherever they may go, more especially in newly-opened-up countries like Natal.
 Your Petitioners further urge that the returns published by the Acting Protector of Immigrantslibtech_92_footnotelibtech_93_footnoteshow that while 1,964 Indians arrived in the Colony between August and January last, 1,298 left it during the same period. Your Petitioners feel sure that this Honourable House would not consider this increase to be such as to justify the introduction of the Bills under discussion. Nor will this Honourable House, your Petitioners trust, ignore the fact that most, if not all, of the 666 Indians must have proceeded to the Transvaal.
 Your Petitioners, however, do not wish to say that the statements made above should be accepted without verification. But your Petitioners submit that the statements furnish a prima facie case for enquiry.
 Your Petitioners fear that the Bills are a present to the popular prejudice. It is, therefore, respectfully submitted that before  considering the Bills this Honourable House should ascertain beyond doubt whether the evil does or does not exist.
 Your Petitioners humbly suggest that a census of the free Indian population, and a searching enquiry in the question of the presence of the Indian being an evil, are absolutely essential to enable this Honourable House to arrive at a right conclusion with regard to the Bills. Nor is this a matter that would take so long a time as to render any legislation after the enquiry ineffectual.
 An examination of the Bills without reference to their veiled object and premature character, your Petitioners submit, shows that they are unjust and arbitrary measures.
 
 As to the Quarantine Bill, your Petitioners assure this Honourable House that in criticizing it they have no wish to oppose anything, no matter how hard it may be, that may be necessary in the interestsof the health of the community. Your Petitioners would welcome and, so far as it may be in their power, cooperate with the authorities in carrying out, any measures of quarantine adopted to guard the Colony against the introduction of infectious disease into it. Your Petitioners, however, venture to submit that the present Bill is simply a part of the anti-Indian policy, and against it as such your Petitioners feel it their duty to enter their respectful protest. Your Petitioners venture to think that such a measure in a British Colony would give an opportunity to those Powers, which are jealous of the British power and trade, to justify the vexatious quarantine rules that they are adopting.
 As to the Trading Licences Bill, your Petitioners welcome it so far as it is meant to teach the communities residing in the Colony to keep their premises in a good sanitary condition  and  to  provide proper accommodation for their clerks and servants.
 But your Petitioners most earnestly though respectfully protest against the discretion being given to the Licensing Officer to refuse or grant a licence “at his own will” and, more especially, against the clause which gives the final power to the Colonial Secretary or the Town Councils or Town Boards, as the case may be. These clauses, your Petitioners are afraid, show most clearly that the Bill is to operate against the Indian community alone. To deny a subject the right to appeal to the highest tribunal of justice against the decisions of persons or bodies who are not unoften guided and carried away by popular feelings or prejudice would be deemed to be an arbitrary measure in any part of the civilized world; in the British Dominions, an insult to the British name and its Constitution which is rightly termed the purest in the world. Nothing, your Petitioners submit, can be more disastrous to the stability of British Rule and the feeling of security that the meanest of Her Majesty’s subjects enjoy, than anything that takes away the right of the subject to ventilate his grievance, supposed or real, before the highest tribunals of justice in the British Dominions, which have, under the severest trials, vindicated their fame for absolute impartiality. Your Petitioners,  therefore, humbly submit that, no matter what this Honourable House decides with regard to the Bills, it will unanimously reject the clause under consideration.
 The clauselibtech_94_footnotein the Immigration Restriction Bill, with regard to the form to be filled in European characters makes it a class Bill and the requirement is, in your Petitioners’ humble opinion, unjust to the Indian community. In the interests of the present Indian population, your Petitioners submit that the clause requires amending. For most of the well-to-do Indians draw upon India for domestic servants who retire at the end of a certain number of years and are replaced by others. That process does not add to the number of Indians in the Colony and yet is beneficial to the Indians. Such servants could not possibly know English or any other European language. They do not come into competition with the Europeans in any way whatever. Your Petitioners, therefore, submit that for this, if for no other reason, the clause should be altered so as not to affect the Indians of that class. The £25 clause is also objectionable  on  the  same  principle.libtech_95_footnoteYour Petitioners submit that the interests of the present Indian population of the Colony should, in such matters at any rate, be sympathetically considered.
 As to the Bill for the protection of Uncovenanted Indians,libtech_96_footnoteyour Petitioners are deeply thankful to the Government for their good intentions, especially because the bill owes its origin to a certain correspondence between the Government and certain members of the Indian community with reference to the matter. But the effect of the favour done by the Government will be absolutely neutralized by the 5th clauselibtech_97_footnotewhich exempts those  who  may  arrest  free  Indians,  not having the pass mentioned in the 2nd clause, from liability to action for damages for wrongful arrest. It was only when an officer showed
 
 “Petition to the Secretary of State for the Colonies”, 2-7-1897, Appendix-D.
 over-zeal in making arrests that the trouble arose.libtech_98_footnoteYour Petitioners think that simple instructions to officials to carry out the clause 31 of Law 25 of 1891 would have been sufficient. The Bill, on the other hand, gives a license to the police to arrest Indians being without passes with impunity. Your Petitioners may mention that the mere taking out of the pass does not render the holder free from vexation. To carry it on the person is not always possible. Instances are on record when Indians, having left their houses without passes for a short time, have been arrested through the over-zeal of officers. Your Petitioners submit that the Bill, therefore, instead of protecting the Indian community, will, because of the clause 5 thereof, render them liable to indignity oftener than usual. Your Petitioners therefore, trust that this Honourable House would so alter or amend the measure as to be a real benefit to the Indian community as it is no doubt intended to be.
 In conclusion, your Petitioners may be allowed to repeat that their main objection to the first three Bills is that the evil which they are intended to check does not exist and, therefore, pray that before considering those Bills this Honourable House would order that a census may be taken of the free Indian population of the Colony, an estimate of the annual increase during a certain number of years be taken, and an enquiry be instituted to ascertain whether the presence of the Indian population is detrimental to the interests of the Colony at large.
 And that the clause 5 of the Bill for the Protection of Uncovenanted Indians may be expunged therefrom or this  House may grant such other relief as it may think fit.
 And for this act of mercy and justice, your Petitioners, as in duty bound, shall for ever pray, etc., etc., etc.

 THE HONOURABLE THE COLONIAL SECRETARY MARITZBURG
 SIR,
 I have the honour to draw your attention to a despatch of His Excellency the Governor, addressed to the Right Honourable the Secretary  of  State  for  the  Colonies,libtech_99_footnoteprinted   in   today’s   Mercury, wherein he states as follows:
 I learn that Mr. Gandhi in coming ashore at so inopportune a moment, when ill-advised persons were angry at the peaceful issue of the demonstration and before passions had had time to cool, acted on advice which he now admits to have been bad.libtech_100_footnote

 PIETERMARITZBURG
 THE PETITION OF THE UNDERSIGNED, REPRESENTING THE INDIAN COMMUNITY IN THIS COLONY
 HUMBLY SHEWETH,
 That your Petitioners humbly venture to approach the Honourable House with regard to the Bill for Protection of Uncovenanted Indians now before you for consideration. Your Petitioners are deeply thankful for the good  intentions of the Government in introducing the Bill, especially as it seems to be a result of certain correspondence that passed between the Government and certain members of the Indian community. But your memorialists are afraid that the good effect of the Bill will be absolutely neutralized by the clause thereof which renders any officer, who may arrest an Indian for being without a pass, exempt from any liability for an action for damages for wrongful arrest. It was only when an officer showed over-zeal in putting Section 31 of Law 25 of  1891  in operation that any trouble or  inconvenience  arose.  Simple instructions, therefore, to the Police Officers to be considerate in enforcing the Law might, in your Petitioners’ humble opinion, have minimized the inconvenience. Under the present Bill,  the inconvenience will, it is feared, increase, because the mere taking out of the pass under it does not free the holder from liability to arrest. It has to be carried on the person, a thing that is not always easy to do. Instances are on record when Indians not far from their homes have been arrested for being without a pass and put to a great deal of annoyance. Such cases, if the fifth clause of the Bill is to remain, are
 
 
 likely to happen oftener than before. And since the Bill has been introduced in the interests of the Indian community, your Petitioners submit that the feelings of that community should receive some consideration. Your Petitioners, therefore, humbly pray that the fifth clause of the Bill be expunged therefrom, or that this House may grant such other relief as may be considered fit and proper. And for this act of justice and mercy, your Petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray, etc., etc., etc.,

17,"March 27, 1897",CIRCULAR LETTERlibtech_104_footnote,"
    
 WEST STREET, DURBAN (NATAL),
 March 27, 1897libtech_105_footnote
   SIR,   We 	the undersigned, representing the Indian community in 
  	Natal, hereby request the favour of your giving attention to the 	memorial herewith enclosed, addressed to the Right Honourable Mr. 	Joseph Chamberlain, which deals with the now all-absorbing Indian 	question in Natal. It is our sincere hope that the importance of the 	subject will fully compensate for its length and that, therefore, it 	will not deter you from perusing the memorial.  	The Indian question in this Colony has reached the  critical  point. 	It affects not only Her Majesty’s Indian subjects residing in the 	Colony, but the whole population of India. It is preeminently 	Imperial in its aspect. “May they or may they not,” as The 	Times puts it, “go freely from one British possession 	to another, and claim the rights of British subjects in allied 	States?” European Natal says they shall not, so far as she is 	concerned. The memorial discloses a sad tale of oppression because 	of this attitude of Natal.     
 There is shortly to be a Conference of Premiers of the British Colonies, in London, where the question how far, if at all, the Colonies will be allowed to legislate to the prejudice of the Indians without such legislation applying to the Europeans, is to be discussed by Mr. Chamberlain with the Premiers. It, therefore, becomes necessary for us to lay before you briefly our position in Natal.
 The following are some of the legal disabilities the Indians at present labour under in the Colony:
  The 	Indians, unlike 	Europeans, cannot 	be out 	after 9 	p.m., unless, 	practically, they can 	produce a pass.  Any 	Indian is 	liable to 	arrest at 	any time 	of the 	day unless 	he can 	show a 	pass to 	the effect 	that he is a 	free Indian. 	(The complaint herein 	is particularly 	against the manner 	 in which the law is applied.)  Indians, 	unlike Europeans, 	when driving 	cattle must be 	provided with certain passes.  A 	bye-law in 	Durban provides for 	the registration 	of native 	servants and Indian 	servants who are 	described as 	“others belonging to 	the uncivilized 	races of Asia”.  An 	indentured Indian, 	when he becomes 	free,  must either 	return to India, 	his passage 	being paid for him, or 	pay an 	annual poll-tax of 	£3 as the price 	of permission 	to live as a somewhat 	free man in 	the Colony. 	(The London 	Times describes 	this condition 	as one 	“perilously near 	to slavery”.)  Indians, 	unlike Europeans, in 	order to 	be entitled to 	the Franchise 	must prove that they 	belong to 	a country 	“possessing elective 	representative institutions founded on 	the Parliamentary 	Franchise,”libtech_106_footnotelibtech_107_footnoteor, must receive an order of exemption from the Governor-in-Council. 	(This law 	was passed last year 	after the 	Indians had 	been in possession 	of the 	Franchise right 	under the General 	Franchise law of 	the Colony 	till then, and 	that law requires 	that the candidate 	voter being an 	adult male, and 	not being 	a native of 	South Africa, 	must  possess  immovable 	property worth £50, or must be paying an annual rental of £10.) 
 
 
  The 	Government High 	Schools are 	closed against Indian 	students, no matter what their abilities, character and standing. 
 The following is the statement of legislation to be passed during the present session of the local Parliament:
  The 	Governor is 	to receive the 	power to refuse 	to allow 	any person coming from 	an infected 	port to 	land at 	all in 	the Colony, 	even though 	such person 	may have 	trans-shipped at 	some other port.libtech_108_footnotelibtech_109_footnote(The Premier, in moving the second reading of 	this Bill, said that it 	would enable the 	Natal Government 	to arrest 	the immigration 	of free 	Indians to the Colony.)  The 	Town Councils 	and the 	Town Boards are 	to be empowered to 	refuse or 	grant trading licences 	at their discretion,libtech_110_footnotelibtech_111_footnotetheir decisions not being subject to review  by 	 the 	highest tribunal of 	justice in 	the land. (The Premier, 	in moving 	the second 	reading of 	this Bill, said that 	such power was to 	be given so 	that the trading 	licences may be 	withheld from the 	Indians.)  Immigrants 	are to be required 	to fulfil 	certain conditions, e.g., to have property worth £25,libtech_112_footnoteto be able to fill in a 	form in 	some European 	language,  the 	 unwritten understanding, 	according to 	the Premier, being that 	these conditions are 	not to be enforced 	against the 	Europeans. (The 	Government have stated 	that these measures would be 	temporary and 	that, after the 	Conference hereinbefore 	referred to,  they 	may be 	able to 	bring in 	such Bills as 	would apply to 	Indians or Asiatics exclusively and 	thus admit of more 	drastic restrictions 	and dispense 	with mental reservations and 	partial operation.)  A 	pass system is 	to be established in 	order to 	protect free 	Indians from the 	unpleasantness of 	an arrest, and 	officers arresting Indians without passes are to be exempt from liability 
 
 to   answer   any   claim   for   wrongful   arrest.libtech_113_footnotelibtech_114_footnoteThe   following proposals for further anti-Indian legislation have  been  laid before the Natal Government:
 The 	Indians should not 	own landed property.  Town 	Councils should be 	empowered to 	compel Indians 	to reside 	in prescribed locations. 
 According to the present Premier, Indians in Natal must for ever be and remain “hewers of wood and drawers of water” and that  “they must not form part of the South African nation which is going to be built up”. We may state that the prosperity of Natal is admitted to depend mainly upon indentured labour from India, and yet it is Natal which denies freedom to the Indian settler.
 Such is, moreover, the position of the Indians, more or less, throughout South Africa. If the Indians are to be denied freedom of intercourse with the British Dominions and allied States, there will be an end to Indian enterprise. Just when, as The Times says, Indians, setting aside their long-cherished prejudices, are beginning to show an inclination to emigrate for purposes of trade, etc., the Colonies are endeavouring to shut them out. If this is allowed by the Home Government, and, therefore, by the Imperial Parliament, it will, in our humble opinion, be a grave infringement of the  gracious Proclamation of 1858, and would deal a death-blow to Imperial federation, unless the Indian Empire is outside its pale.
 We venture to think that the above facts by themselves are sufficient to induce you to extend your unreserved support to our cause.
 
 We remain, Sir,
 Your obedient servants,

 I thank you for your two letters, the last of which was received this week. I am sorry I am unable to write a long letter for want of time. The Indian question almost wholly occupies my attention. The memorial to Mr. Chamberlain on the recent events will be ready next week.libtech_115_footnotelibtech_116_footnoteI shall then send you a few copies. It will give   you  all  the necessary information.
 The Natal Parliament is sitting now and has three anti-Indian Bills before it. As soon as the result is known, I shall write to you with reference to your kind proposal for the propaganda in London. It is a question whether it would be advisable, in the present state of public feeling, for you to land in Natal as a public man. Such a man’s life in Natal is, at present, in danger. I am certainly glad that you did not accompany me. The quarantine regulations, too, have been specially framed to prevent any more Indians from coming.

  	I beg to send a copy of the memorial to Mr. Chamberlain with regard 	to the recent anti-Indian Demonstration. The approaching Conference 	of the Colonial Premiers in London, to discuss this among other 	questions, renders it absolutely necessary that the Indian side of 	the question should be represented as strongly as possible. I know 	that the famine and plague absorb the attention of public men in 	India. But, since this question is now awaiting final decision, I 	venture to think it should receive the fullest attention of the 	public men. Emigration is one of the antidotes against famine. And 	the Colonies are now endeavouring to stop it. Under the 	circumstances, I submit that the matter deserves the most earnest 	and immediate attention of the public men in India.     
 You will be pleased to learn that the Indian community have subscribed over £1,130 to the Indian Famine Fund.
 I remain, Yours obediently,

  	on the Indian question, and a great deal has been said about me, 	much as I would like to avoid it, it seems to be necessary that I 	should say a few words on the matter.

As for the first charge, I believe I need not say anything since you 	have absolved me from it.libtech_127_footnoteI venture, however, to deny formally that I ever did 	anything to merit it. As to the second, I repeat what I have said 	elsewhere: that I have no connection with any organization, nor, so 	far as I know, is there any organization to swamp the Colony with 	Indians. As to the third, I have denied and again deny most 	emphatically that I incited a single passenger to bring an action 	for damages against the Government. As to the fourth, I may state 	that I have no political ambition whatever. Those who know me 	personally know well in what direction my ambition lies. I do not 	aspire to any Parliamentary honours whatever, and, though three 	opportunities passed by, I deliberately refrained from getting 	myself placed on the Voters’ List. I receive no remuneration for 	the public work that I am doing. If the European Colonists can 	believe me, I beg to assure them        
 that I am here not to sow dissensions between the two communities, but to endeavour to bring about an honourable reconciliation between them. In my humble opinion, much of the ill feeling that exists between the two communities is due to misunderstanding of each other’s feelings and actions. My office, therefore, is that of an humble interpreter between them. I have been taught to believe that Britain and India can remain together for any length of time only if there is a common fellow feeling between the two peoples. The greatest minds in the British Isles and India are striving to meet that ideal. I am but humbly following in their footsteps, and feel that the present action of the Europeans in Natal is calculated to retard, if not altogether to frustrate, its realization. I feel, further, that such action is not based on good grounds, but rests on popular prejudice and preconceived notions. Such being the case, I venture to trust that, however much the European Colonists may differ from the above opinion, they would be gracious enough to show a spirit of toleration thereof.
 There are several Billslibtech_128_footnotelibtech_129_footnotebefore the Natal Parliament prejudicially affecting the interests of the Indians. They are not supposed to represent final legislation with regard to the Indians, but the Honourable the Prime Minister has stated that  more  stringent measures may be adopted after the forthcoming Conference of the Colonial Premiers has taken place. This is a gloomy outlook for the Indians, and if, in order to avert it, they put forth all the legitimate resources at their disposal, I venture to think that they should not be blamed. It seems that everything is being hurried on as if there was any danger of thousands of Indians of all sorts and conditions pouring into Natal.libtech_130_footnotelibtech_131_footnoteI submit that there is no such danger and the late quarantine would serve as an effective check, if there was any. The suggestion that there should be an inquiry as to whether the Indian is an evil or a benefit to the Colony has been pooh-poohed and an opinion expressed that he who has eyes can see how the Indians are ousting the Europeans in every direction. With deference, I beg to differ. The thousands of free Indians, apart from the indentured, who have developed the large estates in Natal and given them a value, and turned them from jungles into productive soil, I am sure you will not
 
 call an evil to the Colony. They have not ousted any Europeans; on the contrary, they have brought them prosperity and considerably increased the general wealth of the Colony. Will the Europeans—can they? —perform the work done by those Indians? Have not the Indians very much helped to make this the Garden Colony of South Africa? When there were no free Indians, a cauliflower sold at half a crown; now, even the poorest can buy it. Is this a curse? Has the working man been injured in any way thereby? The Indian traders are said to “have eaten into the very vitals of the Colony”. Is it so? They have made it possible for the European firms to extend their business in the way they have done. And these firms, because of this extension, can find employment for hundreds of European clerks and book keepers. The Indian traders act as middlemen. They begin where the Europeans leave. It is not to be denied that they can live cheaper than Europeans; but that is a benefit to the Colony. They buy wholesale from European stores, and can sell with a trifling addition to the wholesale prices, and are thus a benefit to the poor Europeans. It might be said in answer to this that the work now done by the Indian storekeepers could be done by Europeans. This is a fallacy. The very Europeans who are now wholesale dealers would be retail dealers but for the presence of the Indian storekeepers, except in  isolated instances. The Indian storekeepers have, therefore, raised the Europeans a stage higher. It has, further, been said that, in time to come, Indians may usurp the wholesale trade also  from  the Europeans. This supposition is not borne out by facts, because the wholesale prices in Indian and European stores are, if not exactly, almost the same, thus showing the competition in the wholesale lines cannot by any means be said to be unfair. The cheaper living of the Indian is not an important factor in determining the wholesale price, because the cheaper living of the one is counterbalanced by the more methodical business habits and the mercantile “home connections” of the other. It is objected, on the one hand, that the Indians buy landed property in Natal and, on the other, that their money does not circulate in the Colony but goes to India, because “they wear no boots, no European-made clothing, and send their earnings to India”, thus constituting a terrible drain on the Colony. These two objections completely answer each other. Assuming that the Indians wear no boots and European-made clothing, they do not send the money thus saved to India, but invest it in buying landed  property.  What, therefore, they earn with one hand in the Colony they spend with the
 
 other. All, then, that the Indians send to India can only be a portion of the interest in the shape of rents received from such property. The purchase of landed property by the Indians is a double benefit. It increase the value of land, and gives work to the European builders, carpenters, and other artisans. It is a mere chimera to say  that  European workmen have anything whatever to fear from the Indian community. There is absolutely no competition between the European artisans and the Indian, of whom there are very few, and the few are indifferent workmen. A project to import Indian artisans to construct an Indian building in Durban failed. No good Indian artisans would come to the Colony. I do not know of many Indian buildings which have been constructed by Indian artisans. There is a natural division of work in the Colony, without any community encroaching upon the work of the other.
 If there is any reason whatever in the views put forward above, I beg to submit that legislative interference is unjustifiable. The law of supply and demand will naturally regulate the supply of free Indians. After all, if the Indian is really a canker, the more dignified course, since it has been admitted that the Indians can thrive because of the European support, will be that such support should be withdrawn. The Indians, then, may fret awhile, but cannot legitimately complain. But it should appear unfair to anybody that legislation should interfere with the supported on the complaint of the supporters. All, however, I venture to claim on the strength of the above argument is that there is sufficient in it to justify the inquiry hereinbefore suggested. No doubt there would be the other side of the question. If there was an inquiry, both sides could thoroughly be thrashed out and an unbiased judgment obtained. Then there would be some good material for our legislators to go on with and for Mr. Chamberlain to guide him. The opinion pronounced 10 years ago by a Commission of Inquiry, consisting of Sir Walter Wragg and other Commissioners, is that the free  Indian  is  a  benefit  to  the  Colony.libtech_132_footnotelibtech_133_footnoteThat  is  the  only  reliable material at present before the legislators, unless it is proved that the conditions during the last 10 years have so far changed as to prevent them from accepting that opinion. These, however, are local considerations. Why should not Imperial considerations also guide the
 
 Colonist? And if they should, then, in the eye of the law, the Indian is to have the same rights as all other British subjects. India benefits hundreds of thousands of Europeans; India makes the British Empire; India gives an unrivalled prestige to England; India has often fought for England. Is it fair that European subjects of that Empire in this Colony, who themselves derive a considerable benefit from Indian labour, should object to the free Indians earning an honest livelihood in it? You have said that the Indians want social equality with the Europeans; I confess I do not quite understand the phrase; but I know that the Indians have never asked Mr. Chamberlain to regulate the social relations between the two communities; and so long as the manners, customs, habits, and religions of the two communities differ, there will, naturally, be a social distinction. What the Indians fail to understand is, why that difference should come in the way of the two living cordially and harmoniously in any part of the world without the Indians having to accept a degradation of their status in the eye of the law. If the sanitary habits of the Indian are not quite what they ought to be, the Sanitary Department can, by strict vigilance, effect  the needed improvement. If Indians have not got decent-looking stores, licensing authorities can soon turn them into decent-looking ones. These things can only be done when European Colonist, as Christians, look upon the Indians as brethren, or, as British subjects, look upon them as fellow-subjects. Then, instead of cursing and swearing at the Indians as now, they would help them to remove any defects that there may be in them, and thus raise them and themselves also in the estimation of the world.
 I appeal to the Demonstration Committeelibtech_134_footnote, who are supposed more particularly to represent the working men. They now know that the Courland and Naderi did not bring 800 passengers for Natal, and that, in what they did bring, [there] was not a single Indian artisan.libtech_135_footnotethere is no attempt on the part of the Indians “to put the Europeans in the  kitchen,   and   to   become   masters   themselves’.libtech_136_footnoteThe   European working man can have no complaint against the Indian. Under the circumstances, in my humble opinion, it behoves them to reconsider their position and direct the energy at their disposal in such channels that all sections of Her Majesty’s subjects in the Colony may live in
 
 harmony and peace, instead of under a state of excitement and friction. Information has appeared in the papers that a gentleman is shortly to proceed to England on behalf of the Indians and the evidence against the Colony is being collected. In order that there may be no misunderstanding about the matter, I may state that, in view of the approaching Conference, a gentleman is going to London on behalf of the Indian community in South Africa, to place the Indian side of the question before their sympathizers and the general public, as   also,   if   necessary,   Mr.   Chamberlain.libtech_137_footnotelibtech_138_footnoteHe   is   to   receive   no remuneration for his services but passage and expenses. The statement that evidence is being collected against the Colony is very ugly and, unless it were true, could only be made by a person writing under an assumed name. The gentleman in question will certainly be put in possession of all the information about the Indian question in South Africa, but that appears in the papers already published. The Indians never have wished, and do not now wish, to make out a charge of brutality or general bodily ill-treatment by the Europeans towards them. Nor do they wish to make out that the treatment of the indentured Indians in Natal is worse than elsewhere. Therefore, if collecting evidence against the Colony is meant to convey some such impression, it is a groundless statement.

 THE HONOURABLE SIR FRANCIS W. MACLEAN, KNT. CHAIRMAN OF THE CENTRAL FAMINE RELIEF COMMITTEE CALCUTTA
 SIR,
 As soon as your telegram addressed to the Mayor of Durban asking for subscriptions to Famine Fund was published in the papers
 
 the Indian Community in Durban deemed it their duty to open a Subscription List, and circulars in English, Gujarati, Hindi and Tamil were forthwith issued,libtech_139_footnotecopies of which we venture to enclose herewith.
 When, however, His lordship the Mayor of Durban opened the General Subscription, we decided to send the collections to the general list.
 The collections have been made by special workers from all parts of the Colony of Natal and in some cases, even outside Natal.
 The total collections up to date in the hands of the Mayor amount to £1,535-1-9, of which over £1,194 have been received from the Indians.
 We herewith enclose a list of subscribers to the extent of 10/- upward and venture to suggest that the list should be published in the chief Indian dailies.
 We are grateful for the telegram of thanks received through the Mayor of Durban. Our feeling is that we have done nothing more than our duty. We only feel that we could not do more.
 
 We have the honour to remain,

    HIS 	HONOUR 	THE BRITISH 	AGENT 	PRETORIA  May 18, 1897libtech_143_footnote 
    SIR,   With 	reference to the interview you were good enough to grant 
  	with reference to the British Indians in this Republic, whereat I 	ventured to submit that, in the event of a test case being brought 	by      
 the Indian community here as to the interpretation of the Law No. 3 of 1885libtech_144_footnotelibtech_145_footnote, the expenses should be paid by Her Majesty’s Government, I have to request you on behalf of the deputation to telegraph to the Right Honourable the Secretary of State for the Colonies as to whether Her Majesty’s Government would defray the cost of the conduct of the case. The following are the grounds for such request:
  The 	test case has 	been rendered necessary 	owing to the 	award of 	the Chief 	Justice of the 	Free State and 	the arbitration was 	agreed to 	by Her 	Majesty’s Government 	without reference to the 	feeling on 	the matter 	of the 	Indian community in 	the Transvaal 	whose interests were at 	stake, and 	in spite 	of their 	respectful protest 	as well against the 	choice of the 	arbitrator. (Blue 	book C. 	7911 of 1895, p. 35, paragraph 3.)  The 	Telegraphic despatches 	published in 	the above  Blue book, 	pp. 34 	(No. 9) 	and 46 	(Enclosure in 	No. 12), 	show that Her Majesty’s 	Government contemplated bringing a 	test case. While the 	case will be entered 	in the name 	of a member 	of the 	Indian community, 	it is, 	I submit, 	reasonable to 	infer that 	the cost will be 	defrayed by 	Her Majesty’s Government.  The 	British Indians have 	already incurred heavy 	expenses in 	their struggle against 	degradation and 	disabilities sought to 	be placed upon 	them in the 	Transvaal in 	spite of 	the protection 	afforded to them 	against such 	degradation and 	disabilities by 	the 14th Article 	of the 	Convention of 	1884, and, 	comparatively speaking, 	their pecuniary 	position is 	not such 	as to bear 	any strain 	put upon 	their purse. 	I venture 	to hope 	that in your 	telegram you 	would mention a 	summary of the grounds on which the request as to the costs is based.libtech_146_footnote 
 Personally and on behalf of the deputation you were kind enough to receive today, I beg once more to tender my thanks for the courteous manner in which you received us and the patient, sympathetic hearing you granted us.

35,"July 	2, 1897",PETITION TO SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES,"
    
 
 
 
 DURBAN,
     TO  THE 	RIGHT 	HONOURABLE 	JOSEPH 	CHAMBERLAIN  July 	2, 1897 
  HER 	MAJESTY’S 	PRINCIPAL 	SECRETARY 	OF STATE 	FOR THE COLONIES 	LONDON  THE 	PETITION 	OF THE UNDERSIGNED 	BRITISH 	INDIANS 	REPRESENTING 	THE INDIAN 	COMMUNITY 	IN NATAL   HUMBLY 	SHEWETH:  	That your Petitioners hereby respectfully venture to approach you 	with reference to four Indian Bills passed by the Honourable the 	Legislative Assembly and the Honourable the Legislative Council of 	the Colony of Natal and which, having received the Governor’s 	assent, have been gazetted as Acts. These Bills were, in the order 	in which they were passed respectively: the Quarantine Bill, the 	Immigration Restriction Bill, the Trade Licences Bill, and the Bill 	to protect the Uncovenanted Indians from liability to arrest.  	Your  Petitioners  alluded  to  the  first  three  Billslibtech_156_footnotein  their  last memorial and said therein that, if 	these Bills passed the Natal Legislatures, they might have to 	approach you again with special reference thereto. It has now become 	your Petitioners’ unfortunate duty so to do, and they confidently 	trust they would be excused for the trouble they have to give you, 	seeing that the question underlying these Bills touches the very 	existence of the Indian community in Natal.  	As soon as the last two of these Bills were gazetted as Acts, your 	petitioners wrote to the Honourable the Colonial Secretarylibtech_157_footnotepraying that the despatch of the Bills to Her 	Majesty’s Government should be postponed till the receipt hereof; 	a reply from the Honourable the Colonial Secretary was received to 	the effect that the Bills had already     
 been forwarded. Thereupon, the following humble telegramlibtech_158_footnotewas sent to you:
 Indian Bills mentioned last memorial Gazetted Acts. We humbly request deferring consideration. Memorial preparing.
 Copies of the four Bills mentioned are appended hereto, and marked A, B, C and D respectively.
 Your petitioners ventured to approach both the Houses of the local Parliament with reference to these Bills,libtech_159_footnotewithout avail.
 Copy of the petition to the Honourable the Legislative Assembly is  annexed  herewith  and  marked   Elibtech_160_footnote.   It   endeavours   to   show  that restrictive legislation for Indians is not warranted by the circumstances and, therefore, that before embarking upon such legislation a census should be ordered to be taken of the total Indian population of the Colony and inquiry instituted as to whether the presence of the Indian in the Colony is a benefit or an evil to the Colony.
 The Quarantine Bill gives the power to the Governor not only to return any ship coming from infected ports without allowing her to land her passengers and cargo, but also prevent any person coming, in the first instance, from an infected port from landing in Natal, even though such person may have transshipped into some other boat on his way to Natal. Your petitioners can have no objection against any Quarantine Law, no matter how severe, so long as it is meant as a protection against the introduction of infectious diseases. But the present Bill is merely a part of the anti-Indian policy of the Natal Government. As has been pointed out in the anti-Indian Demonstration Memorial, the Natal Government made a promise to the Demonstration Committee that a Bill to extend the Governor’s powers of imposing quarantine was under consideration.libtech_161_footnotelibtech_162_footnoteThe present Bill has been looked upon as one of the Indian Bills of the session; thus, says The Natal Mercury, 24th February 1897, with reference to the Quarantine and other Indian Bills:
 The first three Bills published in the Gazette this week are in fulfilment of the promise of the Government that measures to deal with the question of Indian immigration would be introduced during the forthcoming session of
 
 
 Parliament. None of the Bills specifically relates to Asiatics and, therefore, [they] do not come under the suspensory conditions attached to such measures. They have been drafted to apply to all and sundry and certainly no fault can be found with their comprehensive character. It may be frankly admitted that the Bills are more or less of an objectionable character, but desperate diseases require desperate remedies. It is to be regretted that such measures are necessary, but that they are necessary is beyond dispute, and however disagreeable it may be to pass such legislation, it has been an imperative duty and must be undertaken. The Bill to amend the laws relating to quarantine may be fairly termed an extraordinary measure of precaution taken in the face of plague-stricken countries. Something more than the ordinary measures are necessary if we are to secure immunity from dread diseases.
 The same paper, in answering the objections to the Immigration Restriction Bill, says again in a leading article dated  30th  March, 1897:
 It has been urged by those people who consider the Bill (i.e., the Immigration Restriction Bill) objectionable because it is not straightforward, that a Bill should be passed against Asiatics in particular, that we should enter upon the “long constitutional fight”, and, in the mean time, we should protect ourselves with the Quarantine Act; the inconsistency of such a course is very apparent. It would imply that we were much too high-minded to be dishonest with regard to the Immigration Bill, but we had not the slightest objection to take a mean advantage of the provisions of the Quarantine Bill. To prevent the landing of Indian immigrants in Natal, on the ground that they came from a country infected with dangerous infectious disease within a thousand miles of the district they come from, is just as disingenuous as the operations under the Immigration Restriction Bill.
It is, then, because the Quarantine Bill is intended indirectly to
 prevent Indian immigration to Natal that your Petitioners deem it necessary to enter their respectful protest against it. For, why should an Indian, trans-shipping into a German liner at Zanzibar bound for Natal, be prevented from landing there while other passengers may do so without difficulty? If an Indian is likely to bring an infectious disease into the Colony, so are the other passengers who have come into contact with him.
 The Immigration Restriction Bill provides, among other things, that any person who is a pauper and is likely to become a public charge, and cannot write out an application to the Colonial Secretary according to the form given as a schedule to the Bill, shall be treated as a prohibited immigrant. Thus, an Indian, who is learned in any of
 the Indian languages, but does not know any European language, cannot land in Natal even though it be temporarily. Such an Indian may go to the Transvaal, a foreign territory, but may not set his foot on the Natal soil, Even in the Orange Free State, any Indian may remain for two months without having to undergo any ceremony, but he may not do so in the British Colony of Natal. This is, therefore, going further than either of the above independent States. If an Indian Prince wanted to travel round the world and came upon Natal, he would not be allowed to land there unless special permission was accorded to him. Ships on their way to Mauritius, having Indian passengers, have been calling here after the Immigration Law came into operation, and the Indian passengers are not even allowed to land and have exercise or fresh air while the ships are at anchor. By order of the Immigration Department they are kept under strict supervision, and their luggage is stored away in the hold lest they should evade the supervision and land. In other words, British subjects, because they happen to be Indians, are practically treated as prisoners on the British soil.
 It has been authoritatively stated that no Government would dream of applying the Law to the Europeans in the same manner as the Indians. In dealing with the clause 3, sub-clause (b) now modified, the Honourable the Prime Minister said as follows, on the second reading of the Bill:
 As to immigrants being in possession of twenty-five pounds, when those words were introduced it never occurred to him that it would be applied to the Europeans. It could be so applied if the Government were foolish enough. The object, however, was to deal with the Asiatics. Some people said they liked an honest straightforward course. When a ship was heading against a wind, she had to tack, and by and by she accomplished her goal. When a man met difficulties, he fought against them, and, if he could not knock them over, he went round them instead of breaking his head against a brick wall.
 The want of straightforwardness about the Bill has appealed to almost everyone in the Colony. The Farmers’ Conference at Maritzburg, the capital of the Colony, a meeting held in the Durban Town Hall for the purpose of giving the members of the Borough an opportunity to express their opinion on the Bills, and other meetings protested against it on the ground that it was un-British; several members of the Parliament also expressed themselves strongly against it. Mr. Binns, the leader of the unformed opposition in the House of Assembly, said:
 They ought to guard against taking a purely local view of so serious a question. The Bill was not straight. It did not go straight to the point, and nothing could be more appropriate than the remark that was made in the petition read that afternoon, that it was un-British. Nobody liked the Bill. There was not a man in all Natal that liked the Bill, and the Premier certainly did not like it. He might think that there was a necessity for it, and that the Bill should assume the form it has done. But if there was one thing clear in his speech, it was that he did not like the Bill.
Mr. Maydon, another member of the Assembly,
 ventured to strongly express the opinion, and he believed the majority of the Colonists of Natal agreed with him, that rather than accept this measure, they would continue to wallow in the mire of the Asiatic immersion.
Mr. Symons, another member, said:
 They could not remove the Indians in our midst, nor withdraw the privileges they possess as British subjects. Would any Englishman that called himself a statesman produce such a Bill, and expect it to pass? The Bill was a monstrous Bill. Such a Bill was a disgrace to a British Colony; why not call it an Asiatic Restriction Bill? They did not talk of tacking in these days of steamship, but went straight ahead.
 Thus, seeing that there is no unanimity of opinion about the Bill, your Petitioners submit that their modest prayer that a census should be taken of the Indian population, and an enquiry made as to the allegation that the presence of Indians is an evil to the Colony, might have been complied with before passing such a drastic measure. Your Petitioners submit that there was absolutely no justification for the measure. It has not been proved that the number of the Indians is more rapidly increasing than the number of Europeans. On the other hand, the last report shows that, while there might have been an increase of 666 Indians during the last six months ending January,libtech_163_footnotethe increase in the number of the Europeans was close upon 2,000. Further, the class of the Indians whom the Bill is intended to prevent from coming number about 5,000 in the Colony as against 50,000 Europeans. Also, the deliberate opinion of the Commission that sat ten years ago in Natal under the Chairmanship of Sir Walter Wragg, the first Puisne Judge, stands on record, namely:
 
 We are content to place on record our strong opinion based on much observation that the presence of these traders has been beneficial to the whole Colony and it would be unwise if not unjust to legislate to their prejudice.
 This is the only authoritative opinion that the local legislatures could be guided by. In the teeth of these facts, your petitioners yet venture to trust that Her Majesty’s Government would order that the inquiry of the nature above indicated be instituted before arriving at a decision as to the necessity of legislation restrictive of the freedom of the British Indians in Natal; that is, if Her Majesty’s Government decide that, in spite of the Proclamation of 1858, a British Colony can legislate to the prejudice of British Indians, and if Her Majesty’s Government come to the conclusion that the Proclamation does not confer any such privileges as are contended for herein, and, if they are satisfied that the number of Indians in Natal is increasing at an alarming rate, and that the presence of the Indians is an evil to the Colony, it would be far more satisfactory that a  Bill  specially applicable to the Indians should be introduced.
 With the greatest deference, it does seem strange that, while the Transvaal Government have been compelled to withdraw their Aliens Lawlibtech_164_footnote, the Natal Government have passed an Immigration Act which is far more severe than the Transvaal one.
 Your Petitioners would now crave leave to give extracts from the Press, showing how the Immigration Restriction Act is viewed by the Press:
 Section 4 defines the penalties to which any prohibited immigrant, making his way into the Colony in disregard of the Act, is liable, viz., deportation and (or) six months’ imprisonment. Now, we think most people will agree with us that, however necessary it may be for the Colony, for its own benefit, to impose restrictions on immigration, it is not a crime for any person to endeavour to come into the country. It is morally certain, too, that the class of persons to whom the Bill applies will, as a rule, be totally ignorant of the fact that, by entering the Colony, they are breaking any of its laws. Such a law is in a different position from the ordinary laws of the country, since it applies to people who have no opportunity of making themselves acquainted with its laws. It is, moreover, the duty of the officials appointed, therefore, to see that no prohibited immigrants are landed, and under these circumstances we think deportation is sufficient, and penal laws should be eliminated. A similar criticism applies to Section 5, which provides
 
 for a deposit of £100 as a sort of guarantee, to be forfeited should the immigrants eventually prove to come under the category of “prohibited immigrants”. We see no justice whatever in annexing this deposit. If he is treated as a prohibited immigrant and compelled to leave the Colony, his money should be returned. The clause imposing heavy penalties on shipmasters is only sure to provoke criticism. It virtually imposes upon the captains of vessels the duty, before leaving the port of departure, of a minute examination into the circumstances and position of every one of their passengers. This may be necessary for the effectual operation of the law, but it nevertheless inflicts a great hardship upon the masters.
 The Bill, it will be observed, applies to persons entering the Colony by land and sea. We are of opinion that it would be much less obnoxious and more easily enforced if it applied to immigrants by sea only. There is very little reason to fear any considerable influx of Asiatics by land, and the only other persons are travellers from one South African State to another, who should be as free from restriction as possible, and natives, the greater part of whom would be excluded by the educational tests, possibly to the detriment of our labour supply.—The Natal Advertiser, 24-2-’97.
 Would it not be a reasonable position to take up to say “If you won’t have the one class, you shan’t have the other?” That this attitude is not an unlikely one is apparent from the tone of the Indian Press. We published, a few days ago, an article from The Times of India which practically calls upon Natal to choose between unrestricted immigration or none at all. That may be only a local view, but we think we are not far wrong in saying that it is just the sort of answer we should give if the cases were reversed. It is not an unfair argument to say that if the Colony finds it necessary for its own benefit to exclude a certain class of Indian immigrants it cannot complain if the  Indian Government refuses to allow it to import, also for its own benefit, another class of Indian immigrants. —The Natal Advertiser, 5-4-’97.
 We question whether any Act so drastic in its tendency, and so wide in its scope, has been adopted by any British Colony, and it is no honour to a Colony, which professes such devotion to progress and freedom as ours, to be the first to inscribe such a measure on its statute-book.—The Natal Advertiser, 26-2-’97.
 It may be fairly argued that, having regard to its purpose, it is dishonest and hypocritical in principle, because its real object is not its ostensible object. It professes to be a measure to restrict immigration generally, when everybody knows that in reality it is intended to stop Asiatic immigration.— The Natal Advertiser, 26-2’97.
 Let us try to get what we want by an honest, fair, and aboveboard measure, which does not seek to hide the real issues under a cloud of vague, unworkable and un-English restrictions. Until we can do this, there is ample scope for the energies of Government, and the Colonial municipalities in carrying out local regulations which will do a good deal towards minimizing the evil complained of.—The Natal Advertiser, 12-3-’97.
 The Natal Immigration Law represents one of the most contemptible tricks to which a Government and legislature could be party.—The Star, 20-5- ’97.
 The session of 1897 will be known hereafter as having given birth to that most objectionable law, which in some respects is even worse than the enactmentlibtech_165_footnotepassed by the Transvaal Volksraad last year with a similar object.  It is within the knowledge of everyone that Mr. Chamberlain protested against the law, and that it was promptly repealed by the Volksraad. But it is certain that, if the law is good for Natal, it can scarcely be bad for the Transvaal.—The Transvaal Advertiser, 22-5-’97.
 The new Natal law is more than a violation of this general principle. It is, in addition, a dishonest law, if the contention produced in favour of passing it is to be recognized. While its terms are of universal applicability, the Government openly admitted in the Legislature that it would only be applied to certain classes. Such a mode of securing class legislation is pernicious in the extreme. Class legislation is generally wrong or undesirable; but when a class law is passed in a shape that does not show it is meant for only one section of the community, its inherent faults become greatly intensified. It is further an act of cowardice on the part of any Parliament to shirk the consequences that may ensue from the candid adoption of a class measure by resorting to the pretence that a law is not meant to be a class one at all. The avowed object of this Natal Immigration Restriction law is to deal with the influx of free Indians; not, be it well marked, with all Indians. Indentured ‘coolies’ are to be included in the same category of persons exempt from the operations of this law as, say, the Prince of Wales. Yet, as a matter of fact, the indentured coolies brought to Natal largely consist of the very lowest class of natives to be picked out of the gutters of Calcutta and Bombay. Man for man, the free Indian coming to Natal at his own expense is likely to be of a better stamp than the destitute coolie shipped across at  other  people’s expense. But this indentured fellow-countryman of the lowest caste is to be admitted because he is a bondsman. Yet, in five years’ time, the semi-slave
 
 
 thus allowed in can, if he chooses, demand his freedom and settle in Natal as a free Indian.—The Star, 10-5-’97.
 The Natal Law cannot with any sense of fairness and justice be countenanced by Mr. Chamberlain after the attitude he has taken up towards a much less offensive enactment passed in his State, which is very much less within his ‘sphere of influence’ than Natal.—The Star, 7-5-’97
 The Dealers’ Licences Billlibtech_166_footnotelibtech_167_footnoteis, if possible, the worst of all. It not only requires that traders should keep their books in English, but gives absolute power to the licensing authorities to refuse to issue or renew licence without the right to the aggrieved party to appeal to the highest tribunal of justice. It is thus subversive of one of the most cherished principles of the British Constitution. Your  Petitioners cannot better express their objections to the Bill than in the words of Mr. Tatham, a member of the Legislative Assembly:
 He had no hesitation in saying that this Bill would establish a monopoly in favour of existing traders. Members who had discussed the Bill discussed from the point of view of the trader apart from the point of view of the consumer. One of the most disastrous courses which legislation could take was a course which had for its object the restraint of trade, and so far was this principle recognized that, by the common law of England, a private contract entered into between two persons was invalid if that contract could be shown to be prejudicial to the community by placing restraint on trade. It was recognized as a principle of trade all the world over that there was nothing like competition, not only for those engaged in the competition but also for consumers. The effect of a Bill of this sort would simply enhance the profits of traders at the expense of the consumers. He dealt with this Bill not from the point of view of its effect as an Asiatic repression Bill, but from the point of view upon which it was presented to the House. The Bill included all sections of the community, whether Europeans or Asiatics, and it contained provisions of an alarming character. It was provided that licences would be issued by one individual, and licences already in existence were liable to be taken away by that individual. That applied to country districts. How did it apply in towns and municipalities? Let him take Durban as an example. The Town Council might consist of a majority of persons who studied their own interests before
 
 the interests of the community, and might refuse licences to trade in that borough. The Premier would say that these people were subject to the control of the popular vote, but how was the popular vote to be brought into operation when it was a case of one individual against the whole body.
Even the Honourable the Prime Minister found it very difficult
to justify the Bill, and was not eager that it should pass. He said:
 They asked that powers be given to each municipality, in excess of its present powers, to control the issuing of licences, and there need be no hesitation in saying what their object was. It was to prevent persons who competed with Europeans from getting licences to trade, as Europeans were required to do. This was the intention of the Bill, and, if that intention were accepted, then, of course, the second reading would pass, and then they would have to deal with details. It would not be possible to pass this Bill without appearing to take away a part of the liberty of the subject, because the subject now had a right to a licence as a matter of course, and if this Bill were passed into law, the subject would no longer have the right. He would only have that right if the licensing authority thought fit to grant it. This Bill interferes with the course of law, because the Bill would be defeated in its objects if the courts had jurisdiction. The Town Councils would be responsible to  their constituents, and there would be no appeal from their decisions, as regards the granting of licences, to a court of law. The objection had been taken to this Bill that it would not allow the law to have its natural course. The answer was if they should be granted, then they would not pass this Bill; but under this measure the licensing authorities only would have this discretion. (Hear, hear.) He thought it right to emphasize the fact that the courts of law would have no jurisdiction over trade licences under this Bill. This jurisdiction would be exercised by the licensing authorities. If the Assembly thought that the Bill should go through the second reading then there would be a discussion on details in Committee. He submitted the Bill to the Assembly, and wished to point out that the main object of it was to affect those persons dealt with under the Immigration Bill. Ships would not bring these people if they knew they could not be landed, and the people would not come here to trade if they knew they could not get licences.
 Mr. Symons “opposed this Bill. He looked upon the measure as most un-English and oppressive.”
 It would be noticed that even hawkers, who move about with a few pounds worth of goods from place to place, would be expected to keep their books in English. As a matter of fact, they do not keep any books at all. The objection to the aggrieved party going to the highest
 
 tribunal of justice in the land seems to be based on the ground that the Licensing Officer will not be able to justify the use  of  his  discretionary power in a court of law.
 The question also arises as to what would be done with reference to renewals of licences. Are the merchants, with hundreds and thousands of pounds worth of goods, to be called upon to shut up their businesses if the Licensing Officer thought it fit to order so? It suggested itself to Mr. Smythe, a member of the  Assembly,  who moved that an year’s time should be given to persons in possession of licences, and drew the House’s attention to the fact that even the Free State gave the traders reasonable time before compelling them to close their businesses. But, unfortunately, the motion was lost.
 The Natal Advertiser, 5-4-’97. thus expresses itself on the Bill:
 It is a matter for regret that so many members, who boldly protested against the violation of British traditions embodied in the Immigration Bill, should have swallowed, without a grimace, the much more  serious  infringement of the liberty of the subject involved in the Licences Bill. With the object of the Bill we are in thorough accord; and we do not either attach very much weight to the fears of some of the members as to the large powers granted to corporations. A very much graver danger is the negation of appeal to the courts of justice. It is only this, in fact, which could make the powers granted under the Bill dangerous. It would have been easy to frame a measure which would safeguard the interests to be protected quite as effectively as this one, without resorting to the crude and unstatesmanlike expedient of depriving persons of their right to appeal to a court of law. No urgency could justify such a provision. The Premier’s argument that “there would be no discretion if the discretion was to be in the Supreme Court or any other court; they could not give discretion to a licensing authority and allow the discretion to  be  exercised by somebody else,” is unworthy of himself and his audience. Licensing authorities under the existing law have discretion, but that does not exclude the ultimate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. Moreover the argument   is destroyed by the provision in the Bill itself which allows appeal to the Colonial Secretary. So that it actually does give discretion to a licensing authority, and then allow the discretion to be exercised by some-body else.
 Your Petitioners have not attempted to discuss the details of the above Bills at length, since, in their humble opinion, the principle of the Bills is so utterly opposed to the spirit of the British Constitution, as also of the Proclamation of 1858, that it seems useless to discuss the details.
 This is clear, however, that if the Bills are not disallowed, Natal would have gone much further than the Transvaal in oppressing the
 Indians. The Indians in virtue of the Immigration Law cannot enter Natal, except a few who are able to read and write English, though they may go to the Transvaal without any hindrance. The hawkers may not get licences to hawk in Natal, though they can get them as of right in the Transvaal. Under such circumstances, your Petitioners venture to trust that, if nothing else is done, Indian immigration to Natal would be stopped, and a great anomaly, i.e., the fact that Natal gets all the advantage of the presence of the Indian in the Colony while she would give none, removed.
 The Bill to protect Uncovenanted Indians from liability to arrestlibtech_168_footnoteis not in answer to the anti-Indian clamour in the Colony, but has its origin in a certain correspondence that passed between  the Government and some Indians. Indians that are not under indenture are sometimes arrested under the indentured  Indians Immigration Law, as being deserters from their estates. To avoid this inconvenience, some Indians approached the Government with a view to get it minimized. The Government were good enough to issue a Proclamation authorizing the Protector of Immigrants to issue certificates to free Indians, certifying that the bearers were not indentured Indians. It was, however, meant to be a temporary measure, and the present Bill is intended to replace it.  Your  Petitioners recognize the good intentions of the Government in introducing the Bill;  but  your  Petitioners  are  afraid  that,  owing   to   the   clause   3libtech_169_footnotelibtech_170_footnote, rendering the Police, arresting any Indians for being without a pass, free from liability for wrongful arrest, takes away all the good that the Bill is no doubt intended to do, and makes it an engine of oppression. The taking out of passes is not compulsory, and it is admitted that only the poorer Indians would take advantage of the pass clause. Before; too, much trouble only arose through the overzeal of officers in making arrests. Now, the 3rd clause gives almost a license to arrest with impunity any Indian they choose. Your Petitioners further draw your attention to the argument against the Bill as set forth in the memorial to the Honourable the Legislative Assembly herein before referred to (Appendix E), and venture to hope that the Bill will be disallowed. Instructions to the Police to use caution when making
 
 arrests under the Indenture law would have met the difficulty.
 In conclusion, your Petitioners pray that the above Bills be disallowed, in virtue of the power reserved to the Crown under the Constitution Act to disallow any Act within two years after its promulgation, or the enquiry of the nature above indicated be ordered before Her Majesty’s Government refuse to disallow the above Acts or any part of them, that a definite pronouncement as to the status of the British Indians outside India be made, and that, should it not  be deemed feasible to disallow the above Acts, the indentured immigration to Natal be stopped, or grant such other relief as Her Majesty’s Government may think fit.
 And for this act of justice and mercy, your Petitioners, as in duty bound, shall for ever pray, etc., etc.

Any 	prohibited immigrant 	making his way into, 	or being 	found within 	Natal, in 	disregard of 	the provisions of 	this Act, shall be 	deemed to 	have contravened 	this Act and shall be 	liable, in 	addition to 	any other 	penalty, to be removed 	from the 	Colony, and upon 	conviction may 	be sentenced 	to imprisonment 	not exceeding 	six months without hard 	labour. Provided that 	such imprisonment shall 	cease for the 	purpose of 	deportation of 	the offender, 	or if he shall 	find two approved 	sureties each  in the sum of fifty pounds sterling, that he will leave the Colony within one month.

  Any 	person who 	shall satisfy an 	officer appointed under 	this Act that 	he has 	been formerly domiciled in Natal, and that he does not come within the meaning of 
 any of the sub-sections (c), (d), (e), (f) of Section 3 of this Act, shall not be regarded as a prohibited immigrant.
  The 	wife and 	any minor child of 	a person not 	being a 	prohibited immigrant 	shall be 	free from any 	prohibition imposed by 	this Act.  The 	master and 	owners of 	any vessel 	from which any prohibited 	immigrant may be 	landed shall 	be jointly 	and severally 	liable to a 	penalty of 	not less than one 	hundred pounds sterling, 	and such 	penalty may be 	increased up 	to five thousand 	pounds sterling by 	sums of 	one hundred pounds 	sterling each for every 	five prohibited 	immigrants after the 	first five, and 	the vessel may 	be made 	executable by a decree 	of the 	Supreme Court in satisfaction of any such penalty, and the vessel 	may be refused a clearance 	outwards until such 	penalty has 	been paid, and 	until provision 	has been 	made by 	the master 	to the 	satisfaction of 	an officer appointed 	under this Act for the 	conveyance out of 	the Colony 	of each 	prohibited immigrant who 	may have been so landed.  A 	prohibited immigrant 	shall not 	be entitled 	to a 	licence to 	carry on 	any trade 	or calling, 	nor shall 	he be entitled 	to acquire 	land in leasehold, 	freehold, or otherwise, 	or to exercise 	the franchise, 	or to be enrolled 	as a burgess 	of any 	borough  or 	on the roll 	of any 	township; and 	any licence or 	franchise right 	which may have 	been acquired in 	contravention of 	this Act 	shall be void.

 “TO PROTECT UNCOVENANTED INDIANS FROM ARREST IN MISTAKE FOR ABSCONDING INDENTURED INDIAN SERVANTS”
 
 BE IT ENACTED by the Queen’s Most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Council and Legislative Assembly of Natal, as follows:
  Any 	Indian who 	has not been liable to 	service under 	indenture in 	terms of 	Law No. 25, 1893, or 	any Act amending 	the same, may, on 	application through the 	Magistrate of 	his Division 	to the 	Protector of 	Indian Immigrants, or 	to the Protector 	of Indian 	Immigrants direct, obtain a 	pass in 	the form provided in 	the Schedule to 	this Act, 	on satisfying 	the Magistrate, 	or the 	Protector of 	Indian Immigrants, 	with the 	information required for 	the purposes of 	such pass, and 	upon providing 	a shilling 	stamp to 	be affixed to 	the pass.  The 	possession and 	production of 	a pass under this Act 	shall be 	prima facie 	evidence of 	the status 	of the 	bearer of 	such pass, 	and of 	his exemption 	from liability 	to arrest under Section No. 31 of Law No. 25, 1891.

Any 	person who 	obtains a 	pass by 	false representations, or 	who allows 	any fraudulent 	use to 	be made of 	his pass, 	shall be guilty 	of an offence 	against “The Fraudulent 	Passes Act, 1895”.

               SIR,           53A 	FIELD 	STREET, 	DURBAN (NATAL), July 10, 1897 
  	I beg to draw your attention to a copy sent to you of the Indian 	Petition to Mr. Chamberlain regarding the anti-Indian Bills of the 	last session of the Natal Parliament. The Bills have received the 	Governor’s assent and are Acts in operation. The crown has the 	power to disallow any Acts of the Colonial Legislatures within two 	years after     
 their passage, and it is on the strength of this proviso that  the petitioners rely for Mr. Chamberlain’s intervention.
 The Bills, in my humble opinion, have only to be read in order to be condemned. Comment thereon seems superfluous. Unless there is a powerful public opinion against the disabilities that are being heaped upon the Indians in Natal our days are numbered. Natal beats both the Republicslibtech_174_footnotelibtech_175_footnotein its studied persecution of the Indians, and it is Natal that can least do without Indians. She must have them under indenture. She won’t have them as free men. Would not the Home and the Indian Government stop this unfair arrangement and stop indentured emigration to Natal? We have but to request you to redouble your efforts on our behalf and we may yet hope to get justice!
 I am,
 Your obedient servant,

 WILLIAM COOLEY, ESQ. (TOWN  CLERK) DURBAN
 SIR,
 Mr. V. Lawrence is a clerk in my office. He has often to go out in the evening either to attend meetings or to give Tamil lessons which do not terminate before 9 p.m. He was twice or thrice interfered with by the Police and asked to produce a pass. I brought the matter to the notice of the Superintendent of Police who advised that in order to save inconvenience I should apply for the mayor’s pass of exemption for Mr. Lawrence. Being of opinion that the by-law No. 106 section
P. does not apply to Mr. Lawrence I was loath to take that step. Mr.
 
 Lawrence however was again asked to produce a pass three days ago, though after he had explained where he had gone to, he was allowed to go. In order to save such inconvenience though I still retain the opinion that the Law does not apply to Mr. Lawrence, I think a pass of exemption is necessary for Mr. Lawrence.
I therefore beg to apply for such a pass for him.
 I remain, Sir,
 Your obedient servant,

 [Before September 18, 1897]libtech_179_footnote
   SIR,     We are aware that the 	troubles in Poona as well as in parts of 
  	Indialibtech_180_footnoteoccupy 	very largely the attention of the public men interested in Indian 	affairs and, were it not for the gravity of the situation as regards 	Indians in Natal, we would not have trespassed upon your time and 	attention.  The Natal Government Gazette publishes this week the address 	of Mr. Chamberlain to the Colonial Premiers who had assembled in 	London during the Diamond Jubilee season. The followinglibtech_181_footnoteappears in the address with reference to the 	legislation in regard to the immigration of Indians to this Colony 	and other parts of the British Empire.  	In spite of Mr. Chamberlain’s eloquent tribute to the loyalty of 	the Indians to the British Crown as well as their civilization, the 	conclusion is irresistible that the Right Hon’ble gentleman has 	completely given up the India 	cause and yielded to the anti-Asiatic clamour of the different 	Colonies. He has indeed granted that the traditions of the British 	Empire “make no distinction in favour of or against race or 	colour,” but, in the same breath,  he  accepts  the position taken 	up by the Colonies w ith regard to the Indians and almost 	unreservedly approves of the Natal Immigration Restriction Act, 	Petition regarding which, with copy of the Act, was forwarded to you 	some months ago.libtech_182_footnote  	Mr. Chamberlain cannot be unaware of the fact that the Natal Act was 	passed with the deliberate intention of applying it almost        
 exclusively to the Indians. The extracts quoted in the petition amply prove this. It was also stated by the Right Hon’ble Mr. Escombe, the Premier of the Colony of Natal, at the time of introducing the immigration Bill, that it was because the desired end, namely, the stopping of free Indian immigration, could not be obtained by direct means he had to resort to indirect means.
 The measure was almost unanimously pronounced to be un- British and dishonest. It was in fact a stab in the dark. And Mr. Chamberlain, much to our disappointment, sets the seal  of  his approval on such a measure. We do not know now where we are and what we are to do. The Act has already begun to tell upon us. Only a few days ago, seventy-one Indians, who had their rooms in Natal but had gone over to the Transvaal to dispose of their goods and had returned to Natal, were arrested some time after their return and kept in prison for six days for being prohibited immigrants while their trial was going on.libtech_183_footnotelibtech_184_footnoteThey were discharged on technical exceptions but, had it been otherwise, the trial might have gone on for some days more and it might have cost them several hundreds of pounds before they could have got the right to remain on a British soil. As it was, it cost them not a little during the seven days’ trial. Such cases are bound to happen from time to time. And then, only those who have been formerly domiciled in Natal could come.
 Mr. Chamberlain says that a man may be an undesirable immigrant “because he is dirty or he is immoral or he is a pauper or he has some other objection which can be defined in an Act of Parliament.” Indians whom the Natal Act debars from coming to Natal are, as Mr. Chamberlain has himself admitted in his despatch to the Transvaal Government, neither immoral nor dirty. They are certainly not paupers. The weakest point in the Natal Act is that it makes special provision for the admission of those that are perhaps likely to be immoral or dirty because they are drawn from the lowest strata of society, namely, the indentured Indians. Immediately after the Act was passed, the Indian Immigration Board sanctioned an indent for 4,000 indentured Indians—probably the largest indent yet on record on a single occasion. How could Mr. Chamberlain ignore these facts we do not know. We still venture to maintain, as we have maintained all along, that the agitation against the Indians is due to colour and trade jealousy. We have courted an impartial inquiry and,
 
 if it is granted, we have no doubt the result will be that the presence of the Indian in Natal will be found to have been beneficial  to  the Colony. The commissioners, who sat in Natal about 12 years ago to enquire into certain Indian matters, have recorded that the presence of the Indian has been a blessing to the Colony.
 Really speaking, Mr. Chamberlain has practically granted that an Indian so soon as he leaves India, ceases to be a British subject, with the awful result that we have to witness, from day to day, the painful spectacle of Indian British subjects deported from or debarred from entering Natal, a British soil, to or to be driven to the Transvaal or Delagoa Bay, both foreign territories.
 The Transvaal Alien Act was, comparatively speaking, a boon. An Indian taking a passport from Natal, Delagoa Bay or India, or an Indian getting previous employment in the Transvaal, could enter it while the Alien Law was in force. Moreover, it was not  specially applied to the Indians. Therefore, any Indian who was not absolutely a pauper could enter the Transvaal, yet the Transvaal Law, because it told severely upon the Uitlanders, was repealed owing to the pressure from Downing Street. The same pressure, unfortunately for us, though we are British subjects, is not available on the British soil. The Natal Act debars any Indian from entering Natal who cannot read and write any of the European languages, unless he has  been formerly domiciled in the Colony. Therefore, the Mahomedan community would not be allowed to bring to Natal a Moulvi nor the Hindu community a Shastri, no matter how learned each may be in his own department, because, forsooth, he does not know English. An Indian merchant who has been domiciled in Natal may come back to the Colony, but he dare not bring any new servants with  him.  The inability to import new Indian servants and assistants is a very grave inconvenience to the Indian community.
 Even if the Immigration Act is to remain on the statute-book of Natal for ever and Mr. Chamberlain refuses to disallow it, the clause with regard to the European languages needs to be modified so as to admit all those who can read and write their own language and are otherwise eligible as immigrants under the Act. We are sure that this is the least that might be granted to us. And we would beseech you to exert your influence in bringing about that change, if nothing else. Mr. Chamberlain’s address portends, perhaps, that he would not disallow the other anti-Asiatic Acts also, to which the petition herein
 mentioned refers. If that be so, it is practically a notice to the free Indians in Natal to quit the Colony, for that will be the effect of the Dealers’ Licences Act, if it is enforced rigorously as it is likely to be now that the Colonists know that they would get almost anything from Mr. Chamberlain for the asking of it-only if what is required to be done is done by indirect, and, shall we say, unfair methods. It breaks our hearts to think that Her Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies should approve of any unfair method, but that is the unanimous opinion of the Europeans and the Indians. Even the Europeans who are the bitterest opponents of the free immigration of Indians, though they do not mind it, think and admit, that the above methods of restricting free Indian immigration are unfair.
 We are powerless. We leave the case in your hands. Our only hope lies in your again bestirring yourself with redoubled vigour in our favour. And we feel sure that you would do it, for our cause is absolutely just.

 APPENDIX
 [EXTRACTS FROM CHAMBERLAIN’S ADDRESS]
 One other question I have to mention, and only one; that is, I wish to direct your attention to certain legislation which is in process of consideration, or which has been passed by some of the Colonies, in regard to the immigration of aliens, and particularly of Asiatics.
 I have seen these Bills, and they differ in some respects one from the other, but there is no one of them, except the Bill which comes to us from Natal, to which we can look with satisfaction. I wish to say that Her Majesty’s Government thoroughly appreciate the objects and the needs of the Colonies in dealing with this matter. We quite sympathize with the determination of the white inhabitants of these Colonies which are in comparatively close proximity to millions and hundreds of millions of Asiatics that there shall not be an influx of people alien in civilization, alien in religion, alien in customs, whose influx, moreover, would most seriously interfere with the existing rights of the labour population. An immigration of that kind must, I quite understand, in the interest of the Colonies be prevented at all hazards, and we shall not offer any opposition to the proposals intended with that
 
 object, but we ask you also to bear in mind the traditions of the Empire, which make no distinction in favour of, or against, race or colour; and to exclude, by reason of their colour, or by reason of their race, all Her Majesty’s Indian subjects, or even all Asiatics, would be an act so offensive to those peoples that it would be most painful,   I am quite certain, to Her Majesty to have to sanction it. Consider what has been brought to your notice during your visit to this country. The United Kingdom owns, as its greatest and brightest dependency, that enormous Empire of India, with 300,000,000 of subjects, who are as loyal to the Crown as you are yourselves, and among them there are hundreds and thousands of men who are every whit as civilized as we are ourselves, who are, if that is anything, better born in the sense that they have older traditions and older families, who are men of wealth, men of cultivation, men of distinguished valour, men who have brought whole armies and placed them at the service of the Queen, and have, in times of great difficulty and trouble, such, for instance, as on the occasion of the Indian Mutiny saved the Empire by their loyalty. I say, you, who have seen all this, cannot be willing to put upon these men a slight, which, I think, is absolutely unnecessary for your purpose, and which would be calculated to provoke ill-feeling, discontent, irritation, and would be  most unpalatable to the feeling not only of Her Majesty the Queen but of all her people.
 What I venture to think you have to deal with is the character of the
 immigration. It is not because a man is of a different colour from ourselves that he is necessarily an undesirable immigrant, but it is because he is dirty, or he is immoral, or he is a pauper or he has some other objection which can be defined in an Act of Parliament, and by which the exclusion can be managed with regard to all those whom you really desire to exclude. Well, gentlemen, this is a matter, I am sure, for friendly consultation between us. As I have said, the Colony of Natal has arrived at an arrangement which is absolutely satisfactory to them, I believe, and remember they have, if possible, an even greater interest than you, because they are closer to the immigration which has already begun there on a very large scale, and they have adopted legislation which they believe will give them all that they want, and to which the objection they have taken does not apply, which does not come in conflict with this objection which I am sure you share with us; and I hope, therefore, that during your visit, it may be possible for us to arrange a form of words which will avoid hurting the feelings of any of Her Majesty’s subjects, while at the same time it would amply protect the Australian Colonies against any invasion of the class to which they would justly object.

 SIR,
 I have the honour to enclose herewith a letterlibtech_185_footnotelibtech_186_footnoteaddressed to you by the representatives of the Indian community of Natal with reference to Mr. Chamberlain’s address to the Colonial Premiers. The newspaper cutting enclosedlibtech_187_footnotelibtech_188_footnotewas seen after the letter was in print. It gives great force to the argument contained in the letter. Mr. Chamberlain’s address has naturally created surprise amongst both the communities, European as well as Indian. I venture to trust that your powerful influence will be exerted in order to bring about the changes in the Immigration Act referred to in the letter if nothing more can be done. The kind of Indians referred to in the letter whom the Act at present debars from entering into Natal, while absolutely necessary for the regular conduct of Indian houses already  established, cannot in any way interfere with Europeans if they were allowed to enter the Colony.

          DURBAN, 
   THE 	EDITOR  The Natal 	Mercury  SIR,  November 	13, 1897 
  	It appears that some people are bent upon keeping up the ill feeling 	against the Indian community in Natal, and, unfortunately, the 	newspaper writers have allowed themselves to be duped. Some weeks 	ago, a correspondent of yours, evidently  an  irresponsible  person, 	stated that the Indians who were tried in Dundee  under  the 	Immigration Act were new arrivals from India, and had 	surreptitiously entered the Colony. Then appeared the correspondence 	between the     
 Government   and   the   Demonstration   Committee   on   the   subject,libtech_193_footnoteleading the public to believe that there was an attempt on a large scale to evade the Immigration Act. You based a leader on these and other similar statements that appeared in the papers, accepting them as correct, and further informing the public that these men had secured certificates of domicile at Durban. A telegram was flashed from Delagoa Bay telling the public that 1,000 free Indians had landed at Delagoa Bay, and that they were on their way to Natal. A telegram appears in today’s issue of the Mercury to the effect that the Government have issued instructions to the police to keep a look-out for Asiatics from the direction of Delagoa Bay. This is all dramatic, and would be highly amusing if it were not calculated to inflame the passion of the European community. The “Man in the Moon” puts the finishing touch to all this by giving a paragraph in his weekly columns. His is the unkindest cut of all, especially because his paragraphs are not only eagerly devoured by the public but they carry weight. So far as I know, this is the second time that he has lost his power of distinguishing between fact and fiction with respect to the Indian question. If it were allowed to the Indians to use  strong language on sufficient provocation, there is more than enough of that in the “Man’s” paragraph on the subject in question in today’s columns to justify the use of such language. But it cannot be. I must simply content myself with placing the facts, as I know them at first- hand, before the public.
 I had the privilege, with two brother lawyers, of defending the Dundee Indians, and I deny most emphatically that any of the Indians charged were new arrivals from India. Proofs to that effect are still in possession of the Immigration Officer at Dundee. It is possible to establish conclusively that all those Indians came to South Africa, or rather to Natal, before the passing of the Immigration Act. Their licences, other documents and records in the steamship offices, cannot lie. As soon as the correspondence between the Government and the Demonstration Committee appeared in the papers, I offered to bring most of the men before a competent Court and to prove their innocence; that is to say, to prove that they were all formerly domiciled in Natal, and that, therefore, they had a perfect right to enter the Colony. One of the men is at present in Durban, and he can be brought before the Magistrate at any time the Government likes.
 
 It is not true to say that these men got their certificates  at  Durban. Some of them, after their discharge on technical grounds, applied to the Magistrate at Dundee for certificates of domicile. The application was refused. The papers were sent to me, and I went to the Government for the certificates, but failed. Most of the men have now gone to the Transvaal without such certificates. It is true that three Dundee men got their certificates at Durban. Proofs on which the certificates were granted consisted of affidavits which are filed on record. But there is a world of difference between Dundee men getting certificates at Durban, and those who get them contrary to the provisions of the law. A man from Umzimkulu, and men from other districts outside Durban, got such certificates at Durban. The question was fully argued before Mr. Walter before such certificates were ordered to be issued.
 There is absolutely no foundation for the fear that the Indians who land at Delagoa Bay enter the Colony in defiance of the law. I will not take it upon myself to say that not one new arrival has attempted to cross the border at Charlestown, but, so far as I know, not one has yet successfully escaped the eagle eye of Sergt. Allan, at Charlestown. Before the Act came into operation, and at the time the Demonstration Committee came into being, it was publicly stated, on behalf of the Indian community, that most of the Indians who landed at Durban from month to month were passengers for the Transvaal. It was particularly stated—and the statement remains to this day without contradiction—that out of the 600 passengers on board the Courland and Naderi, less than 100 were new arrivals for Natal. The position is not changed now, and I venture to say that, out of the 1,000 passengers alleged to have landed at Delagoa Bay, most of them are passengers for the Transvaal. It is that country which has the capacity to absorb a large number of new-comers of various nationalities, and so long as the Transvaal continues to absorb Indians, and the Government is good enough to let them come, you will find Indians coming to Delagoa Bay in large numbers. I do not say that none of them want to come to Natal. Some of them have inquired about the conditions on which they could come, and, on being told that they could not satisfy them, have remained in the Transvaal. They are certainly not angels, and a few may try to evade the Act, and may enter the Colony if there is no supervision.
 My point is that there is no wholesale attempt to defy the law. There is no organization, no advice to set the law at defiance and
 come by the back door, such as the “Man in the Moon” conjures up in his fertile imagination. With due respect, his appeal to the Demonstration Committee, advice to the officers and insinuations are painful in the extreme, because unnecessary, and not warranted by facts. One would have thought that he, of all men, holding a very responsible position, would take the greatest care before  giving currency to fiction as if it were fact. Mischief once started may not be averted.
 The Indian shipowners in Durban, on the Act coming into operation, received a letter requesting them to co-operate with the Government in enforcing it, and I happen to know that they wrote in reply saying while they disapproved of the Act they would loyally abide by it and aid the Government, so far as it lay in their power, as long as the Act remained on the statute-book. And I am not aware that any responsible Indian has departed from the attitude taken up by the shipowners in question. Indeed, whenever occasion has arisen, whether in or out of the Congress Hall, the leaders of the Indian community have endeavoured to impress upon the Indians the necessity of not evading the Act. How could it be otherwise? If the Act is to be ever removed, it can only be by persuasion and by the Indian community showing a clean record. The policy of evasion is on the face of it suicidal, and the past record of the Indian community is not, I venture to submit, such as to justify the belief that the community is likely to commit a suicidal act. After this, is it necessary to assure the “Man in the Moon” that the Indians have no wish to play with the Colony, if only because they cannot afford to do it?
 Let, there, however, be a full public inquiry, and if an organization to defy the law is proved to exist, smash it by all means. But, on the other hand, if there be no such organization or “wholesale invasion”, let it be publicly acknowledged, so that causes of friction may be removed. The Government can do it, but you also can do likewise. Newspapers before this have sent special correspondents to make inquiries into public matters, and if you really believe that the Indians, as a community, are attempting to evade the Act, you will render a public service, and lay the Indian community under deep obligation, by instituting a preliminary inquiry, with a view to enable the Government to undertake a public inquiry, or to force their hands if they are unwilling to make any inquiry at all. At any rate the Indians court such an inquiry.
 As the matter is very important, I venture to ask your contemporaries to copy this letter.

 THE HONOURABLE THE COLONIAL SECRETARY MARITZBURG
 SIR,
 I venture to enclose herewith a cutting from the Mercury.  Reports have for some time been appearing in the papers that the Indians are attempting to defy the Immigration Act by entering, or trying to enter, the Colony via Delagoa Bay and Charlestown. It was not, till today, thought necessary to take any notice of the reports; but the cutting puts the matter in a more serious light and is likely to inflame the passions of the European community. I therefore venture, on behalf of the leading Indians in Natal, to suggest that the Government be pleased to contradict the report. I am to say that there is no organization in Natal or elsewhere for the purpose of setting the Act at defiance, and that the responsible Indians in Natal have, ever since the passing of the Act, loyally abided by it, and have impressed upon others the necessity of so doing. If, however, the Government think otherwise, I am to ask for a public inquiry into the matter.
 I have the honour, etc.,

DURBAN,
    THE 	EDITOR  The 	Natal Mercury  SIR,  November 	15, 1897 
  	Perhaps in justice you will allow me to say a few words on your 	remarks in your today’s issue on my   letterlibtech_195_footnotelibtech_196_footnoteregarding 	 the  alleged organization to evade the Immigration Act. I am afraid 	my letter has been misread. I have not therein dealt with the  	treatment  of  the Indians in Natal. I have, in order to avoid the 	needless alarm, simply denied the statement that has appeared in the 	papers to the effect that the Indians who recently landed in Delagoa 	Bay were on their way to Natal, and such other statements. I do not 	dispute the right of the Europeans to be on the “qui vive, 	to see that the law of the last Session is not evaded”.  	On the contrary, I say that the responsible Indians intend to 	loyally abide by the Act so long as it remains on the statute-book, 	and to help the authorities so far as they can.  	What I do respectfully object to is the circulation of false rumours 	and assumptions based thereon which are likely to create uneasiness, 	and disturb the equanimity of the European mind. The inquiry I have 	suggested, with due deference to your opinion, is clearly necessary. 	There are two contradictory statements before the public. The one is 	that there is an attempt at wholesale evasion of the Immigration 	Act, backed, in the opinion of the “Man in the Moon”, by an 	organization; on the other hand, there is a total denial of the 	statement. Which story are the public to believe? Would it not be 	better in the interest of all concerned if there was an 	authoritative statement as to which story is worthy of credence?  	As to what I said in India, you have justified me. You were good 	enough to say, when the matter was before the public, that from an 	Indian standpoint I had said nothing to which exception could be 	taken. And I am yet prepared to substantiate every statement I made 	there. If I had no faith in the strong sense of justice of the 	British     
 Governmentlibtech_197_footnote; I would not be here. As I have said before elsewhere, I repeat here that British love of justice and fair play are the sheet- anchor of the Indians’ hope.

 The Law 3 of 1885, as amended in 1886, denied “the coolies, Arabs, Malays and Mahomedan subjects of the Turkish Empire” citizenship rights, including the right of owning immovable property. The Imperial and the Transvaal Governments differed as to the applicability of the law to Indians. The issue was referred for arbitration to the Chief Justice of the Orange Free State, who decided that the Transvaal Government was bound and entitled, in its treatment of Indian and other Asiatic traders, to enforce the law, subject to interpretation by the law courts if an objection was raised on behalf of such persons that the treatment  was  against its provisions. The following letter relates to the subsequent development.

50,"December 	31, 1898",THE SOMNATH MAHARAJ CASE,"
  Enclosure 	in Confidential Despatch dated 9.3.1898 from the Honourable High 	Commissioner to the Republic of South Africa to Her Majesty’s 	Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies, London.  Colonial 	Office Records. C. 0. 417, Vol. 243.         Under 	the Dealers’ 	Licenses Act, 1897, 	Town Councils  	and  Town 	Boards in 	Natal were authorized 	to appoint 	 “Licensing 	Officers” for 	issuing licences 	to traders 	and to 	hear appeals 	against their 	decisions and 	also against 	their own 	confirmation of 	such decisions. 	The report 	of the 	proceedings of 	the Durban 	Town Council 	in the Somnath 	Maharaj Case, in 	which Gandhiji 	appeared in the 	latter appeal, is 	given below. This 	report was 	incorporated by 	him as 	an appendix to 	the petition 	of December 	31, 1898 	to Mr. Joseph 	Chamberlain, 	Secretary of 	State for 	the  Colonies.  The  adverse decision 	of the 	Town Council 	was set aside 	by the 	Supreme Court 	of Natal 	in Somnath 	vs. Durban 	Corporation, on 	March 30, 	1898 on the 	grounds of 	improper procedure. 	In a further 	appeal, on 	June 6 	(reported in 	The Natal Advertiser, 7-6-1898), 	the Town  Council 	 upheld the 	Licensing Officer’s reason 	for refusal of a 	licence to Somnath 	Maharaj—“as 	the class 	of trade 	he was 	engaged in 	was sufficiently 	provided for in 	the town 	and borough”.  THE 	INITIAL 	HEARING  Mr. 	C. A. de R. Labistour appeared for the applicant, and said his 	client had ample capital to start in a decent way of business in the 	premises, which had been most satisfactorily reported upon by the 	Sanitary Inspector. The applicant was a capable businessman.  Mr. 	Collins: Have we had the Licensing Officer’s reasons? The Mayor: 	No.    
 Mr. Taylor: I don’t think the Licensing Officer need give reasons, unless requested to do so by a majority of the Council. All that we have to do is to decide whether or not we will confirm the Licensing Officer’s decision. I move that we confirm it.
 Mr. Henwood seconded the motion.
 Mr. Collins moved, as an amendment, that the Licensing Officer be requested to give his reasons.
 Mr. Ellis Brown seconded, remarking that it would be more satisfactory to have the reasonsThe amendment was rejected by four votes to three.
 Mr. Collins pointed out that they were establishing a precedent, and he thought they were establishing an undesirable one. Of course, what was done in one case must be done in all, and under the circumstances, he would feel compelled to vote against the resolution.
 The Mayor remarked that the Council had by a majority decided not to ask the Licensing Officer for his reasons.
 The original motion was then put and carried, and the Licensing  Officer’s decision was accordingly confirmed.
 [March 2, 1898]libtech_205_footnote
 THE SUBSEQUENT APPEAL
 An Indian, named Somnath Maharaj, appealed against the refusal of a licence for premises belonging to the Natal Indian Congress, in Umgeni Road.
 Mr. Gandhi, who appeared for the appellant and the owners of the premises, said he had written to the Town Clerk for the reasons of the Licensing Officer for refusing the licence, but had been told that the reasons could not be given.
 In reply to a question from the Mayor, Mr. Gandhi said that the trustees of the Natal Indian Congress were the owners of the property. Mr. Gandhi, resuming, said he also asked the Town Clerk for a copy
of the record, and was told that he could not be furnished with it. He
 contended that he was entitled by law to have it, as the ordinary rules of procedure in appeal cases would apply before that tribunal, and he was also entitled to the reasons. There was nothing whatever in the Act to show that the ordinary rules of procedure were to be subverted. The 11th section of the Act provided for the rules, which had been framed thereunder, but he did not know that the rules were constitutional. He did not propose to read authorities, because it seemed to him that common sense would show that if a right of appeal were allowed, the
 
 ordinary procedure would guide the conduct of such appeals. If that were not so, it would appear that the law had given a right to the subject with the one hand and taken it away with the other, for if he appealed to the Town Council and did not know why his licence had been refused, and was not allowed to obtain a record of the  application, then he had practically no right of appeal. If he was allowed to appeal, surely he was entitled to a complete record of the proceedings; and, if not, he was an outsider. Was the Council going to decide that he was an out sider, although he had large interests at stake? He was told “You may come, you may say anything you like, without knowing what the ins and outs of, the case are,” and he had come before them; but, if there were any reasons, they would be surprised upon him, and if there was a report from the Sanitary Inspector, it would be surprised upon him also. He submitted that he was entitled to a copy of the record of the Council’s proceedings, and to the reasons, and if not, then the right of appeal had been refused to him. His client was one of the burgesses, and as such was entitled to every consideration a burgess should receive at the hands of the Council; instead of which he was practically opposed by the whole municipal machinery, had to anticipate the reasons for which his licence was refused, and had had to come to the Council, and then, possibly, after spending a lot of money, would perhaps be told that the Licensing Officer’s decision is upheld. Was this an appeal under the British Constitution?
 Mr. Evans: Has the applicant had a licence before?
 The Mayor: He has kept a store in another part of the Colony, but he has only been in Durban three months.
 Mr. Collins said Mr. Gandhi asked their decision on a point of law. They were a lay court, but he did not know that they were competent to give an answer without reference to their legal adviser. Under the law, the Council could require the Licensing Officer to state his reasons in writing, but he was bound to admit that he did not like the law on this point, as it did not seem to him to reflect true justice However, the law must be abided by, but it also provided means by which the Council could rectify what appeared to him to be an injustice. It was competent for them to get the reasons of the Licensing Officer in writing, and then to adjourn that meeting so as to give the appellant an opportunity of answering them. He thought that line should be adopted and he accordingly moved that the Licensing Officer be asked to furnish his reasons.
 Mr. Challinor seconded.
 Mr. Evans said that as the reasons of the Licensing Officer were privileged to the Council, he thought they should have them in writing.
 Mr. Ellis Brown: Yes; let them be handed round.
 Mr. Clark moved that they retire to the Mayor’s parlour for five minutes, in order to see the reasons.
 Mr. Collins seconded, and remarked that he had often heard that justice was blind, but had never seen so forcible an illustration of it before. Some members of the Council were prepared to vote on the matter without knowing why the licence had been refused.
 Mr. Taylor agreed with Mr. Collins that justice was blind, but said there were councillors who could see the Licensing Officer’s reasons without looking at a bit of paper. He was sorry there were those present who were so ignorant that they could not see it.
 The motion was carried, and the members of the Council then retired. On returning to the Council Chamber,
Mr. Gandhi: I want a decision on the points I have raised.
 The Mayor: The Council is against you.
 Mr. Gandhi said that the only fault that could be found with his client was that he had a brown skin, and that he had never held a licence in Durban before. He was told that the Council would refuse any application for new licences, no matter whether the applicants had good business qualifications or not. If that was correct it was unjust, and if a man was not to have a licence because he had a brown skin, such a decision savoured of injustice, and was certainly un-English. There was nothing in the law to show that licences must be refused to persons because of their nationality. The tribunal should not beguided by what was said during the time of panic, but rather by the words of the late Premier, who said it should be borne in mind that the Town Council had been given a giant’s strength, but they should take care that they did not use it in that fashion. The applicant had been a storekeeper at Mooi River for six years, and was a thoroughly respectable man, whose straightforwardness and business capacity had been vouched for by four Natal European firms. He  hoped  the Council would grant the licence.
 Mr. Taylor moved that the decision of the Licensing Officer be confirmed.
 Mr. Clark seconded the motion, which was carried nem. con.

The 	event derives great importance among the Indian community, as you 	are the first Indian in the Colony to have gone up for and passed    
 that examination. The fact that you have failed before, to our minds, speaks in your favour; it shows that you persevered in spite of difficulties and failures, which are but a stepping stone to success. We cannot omit to mention here that Mr. Subhan Godfrey deserves the thanks of the Indian community for having given you opportunity to prosecute your studies. He has indeed set an example to the other Indian parents in the Colony as to what a father should do to educate his children, as you have shown what an Indian youth in this Colony can do in the educational line if he has the opportunity. An even more striking instance of his liberality in educating his children is to be found in the fact of his having sent your eldest brother to Glasgow to pursue his medical studies. We are glad to know that your ambition does not end with the Civil Services examination, but that you still wish to continue your studies much further. We pray that God may grant you health and long life to enable you to fulfil your desires, and hope that your perseverance and industry will be copied by other young Indians in the Colony, and that your success will serve as an encouragement to them.
 We remain,
 your sincere well-wishers and friends

NOTES ON THE TEST CASE","
 
 This and the following item comprise legal “Notes” prepared by Gandhiji to assist the counsel who represented Tayob Hajee Khan Mahomed in the Test Case.
 [Prior to April 4, 1898]libtech_208_footnote
 
 With deference to Counsel’s opinion expressed when I was in Pretoria, I submit that according to Clause 1 in the Act,libtech_209_footnotelibtech_210_footnotethe Indians to whom an attempt is being made to apply the Law do not come under it.
 The Clause reads: “This Law is applicable to the persons belonging to one of the aboriginal races of Asia, among whom are comprehended the so-called Coolies, Arabs, Malays, and Mahomedan subjects of the Turkish Empire.”
 I take it that the meaning of the various expressions in the clause to be accepted by the Court will be the meaning which a standard
 
 work, as for instance, a Dictionary, would give them, and not the meaning given to them by the populace, either through ignorance or prejudice; I mean, in the absence of a definition of these expressions in the law itself.
 If this be so, the meaning of the expression “aboriginal races of Asia” can only be found by a reference to an historical work. A reference to Hunter’slibtech_211_footnotelibtech_212_footnote“Indian Empire”, chapters   3  and  4,  would shew at a glance who are the aborigines and who are not. The matter is put so plainly that there can be no mistake about the distinction between the two. It will be seen at once from the book that the Indians in South Africa belong to the Indo-Germanic stock or, more properly speaking, the Aryan stock. I do not know that there is any authority that has opposed this view. Works by Morris and Max Müller, easily obtainable in Pretoria, also support this view, and if this meaning of the expression is not accepted, I do not know what other meaning is to be attached to the expression.
 A  reference  to  the  Green  bookslibtech_213_footnotewould  shew  that   even   Sir Hercules Robinson (I am not sure as to the name) excepts from the clause under discussion the Indian Traders under somewhat similar grounds, and if the Indians in the Republic are not included in the expression “aboriginal races of Asia”, they are certainly not to be classed among Coolies, Arabs, Malays, and Mahomedan subjects of the Turkish Empire.
 Are they Coolies or Arabs? If books and despatches are to berelied upon, they are not either. And it may be stated here parenthetically that, if it was really intended to apply the Law to the Indians, the Law should have stated so clearly by putting the very word in. And if the matter has been left in doubt, the interpretation must be in favour of the Indians, the Law being a restrictive law. To return, the word “coolie”, according to Webster, means  an  East  Indian porter or carrier, especially a labourer transported from India, China, etc., for service in some other country and that is exactly the meaning given to it by the Natal Laws as well as other authorities. Sir Walter Wragg, in his judgment in the case of Vinden versus the Ladysmith Local Board, deals with the question pretty fully. Copy of
 
 the full report of the Case is hereto attached, vide pp. 10, 11 and 12.libtech_214_footnoteThat the Indians in the Republic are not Arabs does not require
any authority to  support  this  contention.  They  never   belonged   to
 Arabia, and the Indian Mahomedans, whom the populace miscalls Arabs, are simply converts from Hinduism. That fact no more makes an Indian an Arab than conversion from Buddhism to Christianity would make a Chinese a European.
 The word “so-called” appears before “coolies”: I don’t know that that would alter what has been stated above.

 (Appendix)
 SIR WALTER WRAGG’S JUDGMENT
 Mr. Justice Wragg: It appears to me that the important question, directly put to the Court for decision, is whether or not Mrs. Vinden is a ‘Coloured Person’ within the meaning of Law 15, 1869.libtech_215_footnoteI understand that my learned Brethren hesitate to decide this paint and therefore what I have to say must be taken as my opinion only. I hold strongly the view that the plaintiff is not a ‘Coloured Person’ within the meaning of that Law, on the following grounds.
 Under Law 15, 1869, Sec. 2. any ‘Coloured Person’, who is found wandering abroad unable to give a good account of himself, is liable to punishment. In Section 5 the term ‘Coloured Person’ is defined as including, among others, ‘Coolies’. Before that Law of 1869 was passed, there were in existence several Laws relating to Indian Immigrants. Looking at  the preamble of that and the later Laws, we find that the term ‘Coolie’ means persons who, under these Laws, have been introduced from India into this Colony at the public expense, or by private individuals at their own expense, for a particular class of service. Then came the ‘Coolie Consolidation Law’ of 1870, in which the term ‘Coolie’ was again used and in the same sense. Lastly, we have the existing Law No. 25 of 1891, which was passed as the outcome, in many respects, of the labours of the Indian Immigration Commission of
 
 
 1885-1887. In this Law the offensive word ‘Coolie’ does not appear, its place being taken by the term ‘Indian Immigrant’, which, in Section 118, is defined as meaning and including “all Indians introduced from India into Natal under the provision of the Laws regulating such introduction and those descendants of such Indians who may be resident in Natal.” Persons usually described as Asiatics, Arabs, or Arab traders, who have been so introduced, are expressly excluded.
 Now Mrs. Vinden came to this Colony at her own expense and she is wife of David Vinden, who was not brought here as an Indian Immigrant. How can either of them be considered a ‘Coloured Person’ within the meaning of Law 15, 1869? I say, most emphatically, that they are not ‘Coloured Persons’ within the meaning of that Law.
 A ‘free’ Indian, that is to say, an indentured Indian who, having been introduced under the Immigration Laws, has completed his term of service, is, with his descendants, a ‘Coloured Person’ within the meaning of the Law, because he comes within the definition of Law 25, 1891, Sec. 118. But that is not the case of either David Vinden or his wife.

NOTES ON THE TEST CASE","
 DURBAN,
 April 4, 1898
 
 NOTES	ON	THE	EVIDENCE	REQUIRED	IN	TAYOB   HAJEE	KHAN MAHOMED vs. DR. LEYDS
Evidence is required to prove that
  Plaintiff 		is a subject 		of the Queen 		of Great Britain.  He 		has been established 		and [has] carried 		on business 		as a 		merchant in 		Church Street, 		Pretoria, since 1893.  He 		has during 		that time conformed to 		and has obeyed 		the laws 		of the land. He 		is not an Arab. He is not a Mahommedan subject of the Turkish Empire. He 		is not a Malay.  He 		is not a coolie in 		any sense of 		the term. As 		to (a):  
 Plaintiff is a native of Porbunder, a port in Kattywar,libtech_216_footnotelibtech_217_footnotea Province in the south-west of India. Porbunder is under British administration. Mr. H. O. Quin, styled the State Administrator, manages the States. A reference to any map of the world would show that the Province of Kattywar is included in British India and is marked red. In a separate map of British India, Kattywar and other portions would be found marked yellow. These are two divisions of British India, viz., that portion which is called  Khalsa,libtech_218_footnotelibtech_219_footnoteor British  India  proper,  under  the direct control of British political officers, and the other, Protected British India, where there is an intermediary between the people and a British Officer. Nevertheless, inhabitants of both parts of India are, for our purposes, equally British subjects and entitled to the  same privileges outside India. This portion can be proved by putting in any map, a standard. Geography, or even by getting the evidence of’ the British Agent. Further, Plaintiff has very often transacted business with the British Agents in his capacity as a British Indian trader and has been accepted as such.
 The illuminated address that went to the Queen on behalf of the British Indians in the Transvaal bore his among the other signatures. This also the British Agent could prove. And if that course is thought advisable and adopted, it may lend a certain dignity to the case, if it does nothing else.
 I am also told that Plaintiff was, at one time, required to fill in a form by one of the Landdrosts,libtech_220_footnotewherein he described himself as a British subject, and this was accepted by that officer.
As to (b):
 It appears that, in 1882, he was a partner of Tayob Ismail; in 1883, joined the firm of Aboobaker Amod and Co., and was the resident partner and manager of the firm’s business in Pretoria. Aboobaker Amod and Co. was transformed into Tayob Hajee Abdoolla & Co., in 1888 and, since 1892, he has been carrying on business as Tayob Hajee Khan Mahomed & Co., either with or without partners. He had and has other businesses also in the Transvaal. Many witnesses could prove this, or it might be possible to produce deeds of
 
 
 partnership or even the licenses, if they were granted.
As to (c):
 Plaintiff has regularly paid taxes for properties belonging to him or occupied by him. There are no convictions against him. Receipts for ‘the taxes might be put in. He contributed his share, I believe, to the Commando levy.libtech_221_footnotelibtech_222_footnoteHe has kept his premises in good sanitary condition, as Dr. Veale can testify.
As to (d), (e), and (f):
 If (a) is proved, i.e., if he is proved to be a British Indian, (d), (e), and (f) are proved ipso facto; for if he is an Indian he cannot be an Arab, or Malay [either], and if he is a British subject he cannot be a Turkish subject. It is not denied that he is a Mahomedan, and the confusion has arisen because of that fact. Somehow or other, peoplein South Africa have come to look. upon Indian Mahomedans as Arabs and Turkish subjects. Plaintiff is neither. He has never been to Arabia, even as a pilgrim, and he has never been to Turkey. An Indian Arab or an Indian Malay is an impossibility. Malays, I understand, are, or were formerly, natives of Java and were first brought to South Africa by the Dutch.
As to (g):
 The expression “Coolie” was first officially used by the Natal Legislature when they introduced into the Colony the bona fide “Coolies”, i.e., field labourers, for their estates. There were no other Indians in the Colony or South Africa at the time, and it was not before 1870 that the first Indian trader came to South Africa. By this time, there was a large population of Indian field labourers, and they were at the time, without meaning any offence to their feelings, called “coolies” by the white men. As the Indian traders came, white men, not having known any other Indians, called them also “coolies”, forgetting the specific meaning of the expression as applied, not to a nation, but to a class of labourers. Gradually, trade jealousy grew up, and the expression degenerated into a term of contempt as applied to Indian traders and began to be freely and consciously used. Some Europeans, having some respect for the traders and in order to make a distinction, began to call the Indian traders “Arabs”. The expression “coolie” then followed the Indians wherever they went in South
 
 Africa, generally as a term of contempt; and remains so to the present day. For its legal or dictionary meaning, Webster might be taken as an authority. For its commercial and popular meaning as understood there, many merchants might be found willing to testify that they would never think of calling Plaintiff and Indians like himself “Coolies”, except in order to insult them.
 Attention is also drawn to my notes sent some time ago specially as to the expression “coolie” and generally as to the interpretation of the Law, as also to the case of Vinden v. Ladysmith Corporation, sent herewith, and containing Sir Walter Wragg’s dissertation on the expression “Coolie”.libtech_223_footnote

 SIR,
 I applied to the Immigration Officer at Durban for temporary permits for certain four Indians. The officer is prepared to grant the permits on a deposit of £25 each. On my applying to him to take £10 each, he informs me he has no authority to accept such small deposits.
 I beg to draw your attention to the fact that a deposit of £10 is accepted at Charlestown. The system of deposits is a source of very great annoyance, and I submit that £10 is ample for the purpose for which the deposit is intended.
 If the holders of temporary permits forfeit the deposits, the law can still reach them and they could be deported from the Colony. Under the circumstances, I trust you will be pleased to authorise the Immigration Officer at Durban to accept a deposit of £10 for each
 
 person requiring a temporary permit.

 On the Transvaal High Court deciding that Indians must live and trade only in Locations, they made the following representation to the Indian National Congress.
         TO  THE 	CHAIRMAN 	AND MEMBERS 	OF THE  INDIAN 	NATIONAL 	CONGRESS 	GENTLEMEN,  JOHANNESBURG, 	SOUTH  AFRICAN REPUBLIC,  August 	22, 1898 
  	We, the undersigned British subjects residing at Johannesburg, in 	the South African Republic, desire to respectfully draw the 	attention of your Congress to the following facts:   That 		we are 		British subjects, born 		in British 		India and trading 		at Johannesburg 		as merchants 		and shopkeepers.  That 		some of us have 		resided in this 		Republic for twelve 		years and 		upwards, and 		have valuable stocks of 		goods in 		our business 		premises at Johannesburg.  That 		we respectfully 		submit that as 		British subjects 		we are entitled 		to the 		full benefit of 		the Convention, 		known as 		the London 		Convention, entered 		into in 		the year 		1884 between 		Her Majesty’s 		Government and the 		Government of the 		South African 		Republic, Article 14 		whereof provides that all British subjects shall have the right to 		reside and 		carry on 		business in 		any part 		of the South 		African Republic.  That 		the High 		Court of 		this Republic 		has recently 		decided that 		all Indians and 		other Asiatics must 		reside and 		trade in 		certain Locations 		to be pointed-out 		by the 		Government of 		this Republic, 		and not elsewhere.  That 		the said 		decision of 		the High 		Court was based 		upon an enactment of the Volksraadlibtech_227_footnotelibtech_228_footnoteof this Republic, passed subsequent to the Convention 		aforesaid, to wit 		in the 		year 1885, 		being Law No. 3 		of 1885, which said Law is in direct conflict with the express terms of the      
 said Convention.
  That, 	even assuming that 	we are 	bound by 	the provisions 	of the said 	Law No. 3 	of 1885, 	which we deny, 	then we 	respectfully submit that 	the said 	decision of the 	High Court of 	this Republic is 	bad in 	law, and 	manifestly contrary to 	the true 	meaning and 	intent of 	the said 	Law, which provides that 	the Government of 	this Republic 	shall have the 	right to 	fix places 	of residence 	in Locations 	for Asiatics 	in this 	Republic, but 	in no way 	restrict the 	right of 	Asiatics to 	trade in 	any part 	of this Republic.  That 	the said 	decision of 	the High 	Court is 	final and 	no appeal 	lies therefrom.  That 	we cannot 	believe that 	it was 	or is the 	intention of 	Her Majesty’s 	Government to consent 	to our 	being deprived  of 	 those rights 	expressly secured to 	all British subjects by 	the London 	Convention aforesaid and 	to consent 	to Indian 	British subjects being 	placed in 	a worse 	position, so 	far as 	treaty rights are 	concerned, than 	European British subjects.  That 	we have 	no doubt 	that the said 	decision of 	the High 	Court of 	this Republic 	will be 	enforced forthwith, and 	that we will 	be obliged 	to close 	our places 	of business 	in and 	about Johannesburg 	and to 	reside and 	trade in 	Locations to 	be fixed at 	the arbitrary 	choice of 	the Government 	of this 	Republic, which 	proposed Locations are 	situate about three 	miles from Johannesburg, 	and adjoining 	the Kaffir 	Location; the 	result of 	which measure will be 	that we 	will be 	ruined in 	our businesses, 	and be 	deprived of 	the means 	of earning 	a livelihood, 	and will be 	compelled to 	leave this 	State, as 	Johannesburg is 	the only 	important business 	centre in this 	Republic and the place 	where most of the 	Indians in 	this Republic reside and 	carry on business.

63,"September 14, 1898",DADA OSMAN’S CASE,"
    
 The following is a report of the proceedings of a case before the Durban Town Council, in the course of  which  Gandhiji,  who appeared in appeal, addressed the Council and made a strong plea against the refusal of trade licences to Indians on racial grounds. The Council dismissed the appeal.
 DURBAN,
 September 14, 1898 A special meeting of the Town Council was held yesterday afternoon, to consider   an   appeal   against   the   Licensing   Officer’s    decision    upon the
 application of Dada Osman for a wholesale and retail license for the premises No. 117, Grey Street. His Worship the Mayor (Mr. J. Nicol) presided and there were also present the Hon. Mr. Jameson, M.L.C., Messrs. M. S. Evans, M.L.A., Henwood, Collins, Challinor, Hitchins, Taylor, Labistour, Garlicke (town solicitor) and Dyer (Licensing Officer). Mr. Gandhi appeared for the applicant.
 The Town Clerk (Mr. Cooley) read the Licensing Officer’s reasons for his decision as follows:
 “The Act 18 of 1897, as I understand, was passed with a view of
 
 placing some check on the issue of trading licenses to certain classes of people, generally regarded as undesirable, and, as I believe I am right in assuming that the applicant in question is one that would be included in that class, and, moreover, as he has never before had a license in Durban, I have felt it to be my duty to refuse the Iicense.”
 The report of the Sanitary Inspector on the premises was also read, and was to the effect that they had been previously licensed and were suitable.
 Mr Alexander McWilliam, merchant, of West Street, called as a witness, said he had dealt largely with the applicant, who had owed him as much as
 £500 at a time. He had found him a good business man, and honest in his dealings. In fact, he was prepared to trust him to the extent of £500 again. Witness considered the premises suitable and respectable for such a business as it was sought to carry on.
 By Mr. Collins: Is the applicant capable of keeping books?
 Witness: I do not know, but from the way he expresses himself in his letters to me, I should imagine that he would be able to keep books.
 Dada Osman, the applicant, also gave evidence, and said he had been in Natal about 18 years. He had been engaged in business the whole of that time. He had two stores in Umsinga. He wanted to open a store in Durban, because his family lived here. Witness’s private expenses here were £20 per month, and his rent for his house and store amounted to £11 per month with taxes. His house and store were lighted by electricity, and his household furniture, of the value of over £100, was purchased in Durban. He had business dealings with a number of large firms in Durban, and could keep books in English, being acquainted with both single and double entry systems. Applicant’s books had been inspected and passed by the Licensing Officer. A license was not absolutely necessary for the supply of his up-country stores but he desired a license so as to cover his living expenses in Durban, where he was obliged to keep a house, as his wife could not very well travel with him between Vryheid and Umsinga, to which places he had to go from time to time in connection with his businesses. He had 2 stores in Umsinga, and had never had a license in Durban. The Umsinga stores had been in his possession over 15 years, and, during that time, he had bought all his goods in Durban. If the Council refused his license, he would not have to shut up his up-country stores. His wife had been in Natal 5 months. He was married in India 8 years ago and had visited India since.
 Abdul Cadir, managing partner of the firm Mahomed Cassim & Company, owners of the premises in respect of which the application was made, was called, and said the rent fixed was £10 and taxes. The store had been
 licensed before. Witness owned 3 or 4 properties in Durban, amounting in value to between £18,000 and £20,000. Most of this property was let and if Osman did not obtain a license, witness would lose the rent of that particular store. He had known the applicant a long time, and knew that he would be a good tenant.
 Further evidence as to applicant’s respectability was given by another Indian merchant.
 Mr. Gandhi stated that the last occasion on which he addressed the Council he, unfortunately, failed to convince them that the landlord’s interests should be considered. The managing partner of the firm of Mahomed Cassim & Company told the Council that day that the present applicant was the best tenant he could get for the premises and that he owned property of the value of £18,000, most of which he hired to persons such as the applicant. He further said that if the license was withheld from the applicant, he would not be able to get a tenant for his premises. It was clear that the landlord’s interests ought to be considered. Mr Abdul Cadir was a rate-payer just as good as any of the ratepayers of the Borough, and his voice should be heard by the Council. In the applicant, Abdul Cadir had a tenant whom he had known for a very long time and it would be a hardship to the landlord if the license was refused. The premises were suitable for a store, and it would not be possible for the landlord to hire them for any other purpose. Evidence had been led to the effect that the store had been previously licensed, and Mr. McWilliam, a perfectly disinterested witness, stated that the premises were decent and respectable. Under the circumstances, he hoped the Council would give due weight to the interests of the landlord. As to the applicant himself, testimony had been brought forward to show that his evidence was true, and he desired to do some business in Durban to meet the expenses entailed in maintaining a household here. They had in the applicant a man perfectly decent and respectable, straight in his dealings, who could speak English sufficiently to make himself understood, and kept books in English. Applicant’s books had previously been passed, and he thought the Council would admit that the applicant had stood the test very well indeed. There could not be the slightest objection either to the premises or the applicant. There was nothing objectionable in the applicant except what the Licensing Officer had been pleased to state in his reasons, and, with all deference to the Council, he submitted that the Licensing Officer had nothing whatever to do with the speeches made in the Legislative Assembly at
 the time the Act was passed. There was nothing in the preamble of the Act to show that this was the intention of the measure. It merely said that it was necessary to regulate the issue of licenses to wholesale and retail dealers, no distinction being made as to desirables  or undesirables, and yet the Licensing Officer, who was supposed to have a judicial mind at the time of considering applications, had actually gone out of his way to refer to speeches made at the time the Act was passed. This was a most extraordinary course for a Licensing Officer to take, and he hoped that because the Licensing Officer had seen fit to refuse the license for the reasons given, they would upset the decision. The Licensing Officer stated that he believed he was right in assuming that the applicant would be included in the undesirable class, but what right had he to make such an assumption? He (Mr. Gandhi) would like to know who was an undesirable and how such a person would be described, and would venture to cite the opinion of the Secretary of State for the Colonies on the point. Mr. Gandhi read extracts from a speech delivered by Mr. Chamberlain  at  the conference with the Colonial Premiers, when the Right  Hon. gentleman said they had to bear in mind the traditions of the Empire, which made no distinction in favour of or against a race on the  grounds of colour, and referred to the wealth and civilization of Indians, and the services they had rendered the Empire in times of trouble. According to Mr. Chamberlain, it was the character of the immigrants they had to deal with, and it was not because a man was of a different colour to themselves that he was undesirable, but because he was dirty or immoral, or a pauper, or because he was in some other way objectionable. That was what an undesirable immigrant was in the opinion of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, and no such objection could be brought against his client. The only objection that had been raised to the applicant, and that had been discounted by the Secretary of State, was that he was an Indian, and, therefore, came to be classed as an undesirable person. He hoped that that reason would not be accepted by the Council. The Licensing Officer had placed the Indian community under a deep debt of gratitude by giving the only reason for which these licenses were refused. It had been said in that Council Chamber that the objection to Indians was not their colour, or because they were Indians, but because they would not live in a decent manner. That objection could not be advanced against his client. He wished to point out that if the Council refused that license, they would place all Indians in the same scale, and would not encourage them to
 live in premises that were decent and respectable and to live in every way like respectable citizens. Everything done with regard to these licenses became known outside, and if a license was refused to such a man as his client, Indians would say that the Town Council did not want them to live decently and honestly, but anyhow. The Council should not allow such a feeling to be created among the Indian population. It was said on a previous occasion that it was necessary that these licenses should not be increased, but that question did not arise in the present case, as the store for which a license was applied for, had been licensed that year. By granting the application the  number of licenses would not be added to. If these stores were to be shut up, the Indian landlords would have to shut up their businesses, and he hoped the Council would give due consideration to the appeal, and order the issue of a license to his client.
 Mr. Taylor said he was not convinced that the Licensing Officer was in error, and he, therefore, moved that the decision be confirmed.
 Mr. Collins said that he was not at all surprised that there was a very great deal of reluctance on the part of the Council to refuse the license, but he believed the license was going to be refused, and he had no hesitation in saying that the reason was not that the applicant was not suitable except for the fact of his being an Indian. What Mr. Gandhi had said was perfectly true, and he (Mr. Collins) felt Some relief in saying that most of these licenses, if not all, had been refused mainly on that ground. The Council had been placed in a very unhappy position because it had to carry out a policy which, in the discretion of Parliament, had been considered necessary. Parliament, representing the community, had come to the conclusion that it was undesirable that Indians should increase their hold on the trade of Durban, and it was on that ground that the Council was practically called upon to refuse licenses which were not otherwise objectionable. He thought the applicant would have a grievance by the refusal of the license, but it had been found expedient, as a matter of Colonial policy, that these licenses should not be increased, and he, therefore, seconded Mr. Taylor’s motion.
 The Mayor said that Messrs. Evans, Labistour, and Hitchins would not be able to vote as they had come in late.
 Mr. Labistour said that, with regard to his being late, he thought an apology was due from him to His Worship and the other members of the Council, but he would like to explain that he had studiously avoided attending these licensing meetings, as he thoroughly disagreed with the dirty work they were called upon to do. He had come into that meeting expecting that the licensing business would have been concluded earlier, and that the ordinary
 business would be commenced by the time he arrived. The remarks made by Mr. Collins met with his approval, but any councillor could mark his dissent with what they were called upon to doby not taking part in it. He held that, sitting as a court of appeal, it was for them to hear the evidence, and, unless there was some good ground against an applicant, they ought to grant the license. If the burgesses of Durban, or the people of the Colony, wished these licenses to be stopped, they could go to the Legislature and put an end to applications for licenses by members of the Indian community.
 On being put, Mr. Taylor’s motion to uphold the Licensing Officer’s decision was carried em con., and the appeal was consequently dismissed.

68,"December 22, 1898",BRIEF FOR COUNSEL’S OPINION,"
      
 Gandhiji’s approach to the legal issues involved in the operation of the Dealers’ Licenses Act is indicated by the following brief prepared by him.
 DURBAN,
 December 22, 1898
 BRIEF   FOR  COUNSEL’S OPINION   UNDER   ACT   18   OF   1897   TO   AMEND THE
 LAW RELATING TO LICENSES TO WHOLESALE AND RETAIL DEALERS.
 A Town Council issues secret or public instructions to the Licensing Officer appointed by it under the Act:
 Not 	to grant licenses to Asiatics. Not 	to grant licenses to 	certain persons.  Not 	to grant licenses to 	most of 	the Asiatic traders. 
 Could the Supreme Court be moved by an intending applicant to direct the Town Council to appoint another officer and not in any way to interfere with such Officer’s discretion?
 A Town Council appoints one of its permanent officials, as for in stance, the Town Clerk, the Town Treasurer, the Chief Cashier.
 Could an intending applicant move the Supreme Court to direct the Town Council to appoint an absolutely independent person on the ground that the permanent officer would be so much under the influence of the Town Council that he could not be expected to give an unbiassed decision uninfluenced by the views of the Town Council, and on the ground thatthe intending applicant would practically be denied the right of approaching two separate tribunals—one original and the other appellate?
 A Licensing Officer, under the Act, refuses to issue a license to a person on the ground that he is an Indian. Could the Supreme Court be moved to tell the Officer that the fact of a person being an Indian is no reason for a refusal, and that he should reconsider his decision subject to that direction?
 If a Licensing officer arbitrarily refuses to issue licenses to all the Indians or a majority of them, can he be said to have used a discretion in either or both the cases?
 A person having applied for and been refused a license to trade carries on his trade without a license. He is tried for contravention of Section 9 of the Act, and convicted. He pays the penalty but continues to trade. Is the trading after the conviction, but during the statutory year, a fresh offence?
 Does a person trading without a license for so many  days commit so many offences under the Act?
What would be the procedure for collecting the fine?
 If the person convicted is bonded to another person and if the bondholder takes possession, will the penalty be a preferent charge against the goods so bonded? (Note: All penalties recovered under the Act in respect of a business within a Township are payable to the funds of such Township.)
 Will it be competent for the Governor-in-Council to pass, under the last section of the Act, such rules as would control the discretion of the Licensing Officer, and make it practically obligatory on the Licensing Officer to issue licenses under certain conditions?

 The manner in which the Dealers’ Licenses Act was being operated in violation of the rights of Indians formed the subject of a representation to the Imperial Government which is given below. Gandhiji sent it with a covering letter addressed to  the  Natal Governor. Vide p. 50, infra.
 DURBAN,
 December 31, 1898
 TO
 THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN HER MAJESTY’S PRINCIPAL SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES
 LONDON
 THE	HUMBLE	PETITION	OF	THE	UNDERSIGNED	REPRESENTING	THE BRITISH INDIANS RESIDING IN THE COLONY OF NATAL HUMBLY SHEWETH,
 That your Petitioners hereby venture to approach Her Majesty’s Government  with  reference  to  the  Dealers’   Licenseslibtech_239_footnoteAct,  against which your Petitioners unsuccessfully protested last year.
 Your Petitioners might have approached Her Majesty’s Government earlier, but it was their intention, first, to watch the operation of the Act patiently for some time, and to see whether the fears anticipated in the memorial submitted to Her Majesty’s Government embodying the above protest were well-founded or not; and, secondly, to exhaust all the resources available in the Colony, and to obtain a proper judicial interpretation of the Act.
 It is with great regret that your Petitioners have to record that the fears expressed in the memorial above referred to have been more than realised, and that the judicial interpretation has been  given  against the British Indians in the Colony. In a case, herein below referred to,libtech_240_footnotelibtech_241_footnoteTheir Lordships of the Privy Council have decided that, from the decisions of the Town Councils or the Town Boards, there is no appeal to the Supreme Court of the Colony, under the above Act. This decision has paralysed the Indian traders. Consternation has seized hold of them, and there prevails amongst them a feeling of
 
 insecurity and a nervous fear as to what may happen during the ensuing year.
 The troubles the Indian community is passing through are numerous. The working of the Immigration Restriction Act, against which also your Petitioners ineffectually protested, is causing much vexation. Lately, the Government have passed Rules under it whereby a fee of one pound is required from each person not being able to pass the tests imposed by the Act, and wishing to sojourn for from one day up to six weeks, or to pass through the Colony for the purposes of embarkation. While a memorial was being prepared in connection with these Rules and other matters arising out of the above Act, the decision of the Privy Council came upon the Indian community like a bomb-shell, and all the other troubles dwindled into comparative insignificance in the face of the awful future awaiting the Indian traders. It has, therefore, become absolutely necessary to give the first place to the Dealers’ Licenses Act.
 The only hope of the Indian traders in Natal now lies in the relief that might be granted through the intervention of Her Majesty’s Government. Your Petitioners venture to claim in all parts of Her Majesty’s dominions the same privileges and rights that are enjoyed by Her Majesty’s other subjects, in virtue of the Proclamation of  1858, and more especially in the Colony of Natal, in virtue of the following statement in your predecessor’s Despatch with reference to previous memorials, viz., “It is the desire of Her  Majesty’s Government that the Queen’s Indian subjects should be treated upon a   footing   of   equality   with   all   Her   Majesty’s   other   subjects.”libtech_242_footnoteMoreover, your Petitioners trust that Her Majesty’s  Government  would be pleased to secure from the Colony of Natal, which owes its present prosperity to the indentured Indians, a fair treatment for the free Indians in the Colony.
 All over the world, whenever necessary, Indian soldiers have been fighting the battles of Great Britain, and Indian labourers have been opening up fresh fields for colonisation. Only the other day, a Reuter’s cablegram stated that Indian soldiers would be requisitioned to train up the natives in Rhodesia. Can it be that  the fellow-countrymen of these soldiers and labourers are not to be allowed to earn an honest living in a portion of Her Majesty’s dominions?
 
 
 And yet, as will appear hereinbelow, there is an organised attempt being made in the Colony of Natal not only to deny to the Indian traders the right of earning an honest living, but also to deprive them of such right which they have been enjoying for years past in the Colony; and the instrument whereby the European Colonists in Natal hope to achieve their purpose is the above Act.
 The Durban Town Council consists of eleven councillors, and is the premier Corporation in the Colony. Of these councillors, one is an avowed and out-and-out opponent of the Indians. He played a leading part in the Demonstration against the landing of the passengers on board the Courland and the  Naderi early last year.libtech_243_footnotelibtech_244_footnoteHe was noted for his most violent speeches. He has carried his hatred of the Indians into the portals of the Town Council, and has so far invariably, and irrespective of persons, opposed the granting of trade licences to Indians. As there are only twoclasses of Europeans—the one violently against the Indians, and the other indifferent—this councillor, as a rule, carries the day before him whenever a matter concerning the Indians comes for disposal before the Council. The Licensing Officer appointed under the Act is a permanent officer of the Corporation, and is, therefore, in your Petitioners’ humble opinion, more or less under the influence of the councillors. In a case presently to  be referred to, Sir Walter Wragg, the first Puisne Judge, who was then acting for the Chief Justice, has thus observed about the danger of a permanent officer of a Town Council being appointed its Licensing Officer:
 It has been suggested to the Court that an officer so appointed must have a certain amount of bias in his mind, because he was an officer permanently under the Town Council, and must be in the Council’s confidence. His lordship was not going to decide the matter on that point; but he could quite see that the Licensing Officer should be some person who was not in the Town Council service, and who was not in the confidence of the Council. (The Natal Witness,  31 March 1898.)
 This Licensing Officer examines the pecuniary position of applicants for licences, asks them questions as to their stock, capital, and generally inquires into their private affairs. He has made it a rule not to grant a trading licence to any Indian who has not before held such a licence in Durban, whether the applicant has held a licence
 
 elsewhere in the Colony or not, whether he is an old resident or a new arrival, whether he is an accomplished gentleman knowing English or an ordinary trader, and whether the premises in respect of which the licence is sought are suitable in every respect and have been before licensed or not.
 Somnath Maharaj, an Indian, early this year, applied for a  licence to carry on a retail trade in the borough. His application was taken in. He was examined at length as to his position  by  the Licensing Officer. Nothing could be found against him. The Sanitary Inspector made a favourable report regarding the premises in which he intended to carry on his trade. The premises had just been vacated by an Indian storekeeper who had left for Johannesburg.  The Licensing Officer, however, after having failed to find fault either with the person or with the premises, refused a licence without giving any reason for his decision. The matter was heard in appeal before the Town Council.libtech_245_footnotelibtech_246_footnoteIt was proved that the applicant had served the Colony for five years under indenture, had been resident in the Colony for thirteen years as a free Indian, had by dint of perseverance raised himself to the position of a trader, had held a licence in Mooi River in the Colony over six years, had a cash capital of fifty pounds, held a piece of freehold land in the borough, had his dwelling house separate and some distance from the intended store, and had engaged the services of a European book-keeper to satisfy the requirements of the Law. Three well-known European merchants certified as to his respectability and honest dealings. He was to trade in a locality mostly inhabited by Indians, and his custom was to be entirely Indian.  Counsel for the applicant asked for the Licensing-Officer’s reasons for refusal, as well as a copy of the record of the application. Both these applications were rejected, and the Licensing Officer’s decision was upheld by the Town Council. An appeal to the Supreme Court was noted against the decision —not on its merits, for, that Court had already by this time decided by a majority that, in virtue of  the Dealers’ Licenses Act, it had no jurisdiction to hear licence appeals on merits, but on grounds of irregularity: viz., that reasons were refused, that a copy of the record was withheld from applicant’s counsel, and that the councillors with the Town Solicitor, the Town Clerk, and the Licensing Officer, while the appeal was being heard, retired for secret deliberation into a private room. The Supreme Court entertained the
 
 
 appeal, quashed the proceedings of the Town Council, with costs, in favour of the appellant, and directed a re-hearing. In  giving  the Court’s decision, the Acting Chief Justice remarked:
 What struck one as being wrong in this case was that the copy of the record should be withheld. The application was made to the Council by the appellant for a copy of the record and reasons why the licence had been refused. There was nothing wrong in the application. It was one which, in the interests of justice, should have been granted. But it was refused. And when the appellant’s counsel came before the Council, he was in the dark as to the record, and he did not know what was operating in the mind of the Licensing Officer.   It seemed to him that the action of the Town Council in this case had
 been oppressive.	It seemed to him that the refusal of both requests was
 unjudicial and an improper proceeding. (The Times of Natal, 30 March 1898.)
Mr. Justice Mason:
 Considered the proceedings under appeal were a disgrace to the Town Council, and he did not hesitate to use this strong language. He considered under the circumstances that it was an abuse of words to say there had been an appeal to the Town Council. (The Times of Natal, 30 March 1898.)
 The appeal was reheard before the Town Council. This time a copy of the record was given; and when called upon to give further reasons for his refusal, the Licensing Officer stated:  “that  the applicant had no claim whatever upon Durban, as the class of trade he was engaged in was sufficiently provided for in the town and borough.” The Officer’s decision was however upheld, a councillor moving “that it was undesirable that the licence should be granted in view of the fact that the percentage of licences already granted was in excess of the requirements of the population.” The Council took no notice of the facts that, only a few months before, there was a store-keeper in the premises sought to be licensed,  that  the store-keeper had left Durban, that, therefore, there was no question of increasing the number of licences, and that the landlords, who are Indians and were also represented, had, too, a claim for consideration at the hands of the Council. The premises in question, which are only suitable for a store, have to this day remained practically vacant, causing a loss to the owners of £35 to date. Your Petitioners venture to annex hereto a report of the proceedings of the first hearing of the above appeal before the Town Council, which clearly shows its spirit. (Vide Appendix A.)
 Mahomed Majam & Co., applied to the Licensing Officer for a trade licence, with respect to premises belonging to an Indian gentleman who owns large pieces of freehold property in Durban, and whose principal source of income is renting of his properties to tradesmen. The Licensing Officer refused to grant the licence for reasons similar to those given in the case above referred to. The landlord appealed to the Town Council against the decision of the Licensing Officer. The Town Council dismissed the appeal. As a consequence, he, the landlord, was compelled to reduce the rent of his property, and Mahomed Majam & Co., are reduced to poverty, and have to live entirely on the work of one of their partners who is a tinsmith.
 Hasam Mahomed is a hawker by profession. He has been a hawker before in Durban. He went to the Licensing Officer, and from him to the Town Council, but was denied the privilege of hawking. He told the Council that to deny him that privilege was equivalent to asking him to court starvation. He had tried to earn his bread otherwise, but had failed, and was without capital to undertake anything else. He submitted to the Council that he did not come in competition with any European, that hawking was practically a speciality of the Indians who raised no objection to his getting the licence; but all these representations were of no avail.
 Mr. Dada Osmanlibtech_247_footnotelibtech_248_footnotehas been in the Colony for over fifteen years, has received a fairly good English education, was connected with the then premier Indian firm in South Africa, and has now a business in Umsinga in this Colony, and another in Vryheid in the Transvaal. This year he sent for his wife and children from India. As he could not find suitable society for his wife in either of the above places, and in order to meet the extra expense required owing to the arrival of his family, he intended to settle in Durban, so that he could supply his businesses upcountry with goods himself, and also do some business in Durban. So sure did he feel of securing the licence that he rented a spacious building in a principal street in Durban from a  firm  of Indian merchants at £11 per month, bought over £100 worth furniture, and approached the Licensing Officer who, as usual, thoroughly went into his affairs, tested his knowledge of English as well as of book-keeping, and after having required Mr. Dada Osman to appear before him thrice, declined to entertain his application. Both the
 
 landlord and he appealed against the decision. Required by the Town Council, the Licensing Officer gave the following reason:
 The Act 18 of 1897, as I understand, was passed with a view of placing some check on the issue of trading licences to certain classes of people, generally regarded as undesirables. And as I believe I am right in assuming that the applicant in question is one that would be included in that class, and moreover as he has never before had a licence in Durban, I have felt it my duty to refuse his licence.
It was thus, in this case, for the first time that the real reason for the
 refusal of so many licences was given in all its nakedness. A principal merchant of Durban, Mr. Alexander McWilliam, said in his evidence before the Council:
 I have known the applicant for a great number of years—12 or 14 years.  I have dealt very largely with the applicant. He has owed me at times as much as £500. My dealings with him have been perfectly satisfactory. I found him to be a very good business man, and respectable. I have always been able to take his word for anything he says....As a rate-payer, I should have no objection to his getting a licence. I do not know whether he is capable of keeping books, but he can express himself well in English in writing. I should imagine from the way he writes here and the way he conducts his business he would be able to keep books. (handed in a letter written by applicant.)
In addition to the facts related above about the applicant’s
 position, the following was brought out in his (applicant’s) evidence given in English:
 My private family expenses are about £20 per month, apart from the store.... I have a house apart from the store.   My house and store are lighted
 by electricity.   I deal with S. Butcher & Sons, Randles Brother & Hudson, H.
 & T. Mc Cubbin, L. Kehrmann, A. Fass & Co., M. Laurie, and others. I can write simple letters in English. I know book-keeping. I have kept books in Vryheid. I keep ledger, journal, day, cash, stock, account, and invoice books. I know the single and double entry systems.
 Mr. Abdool Kadir, the landlord, said:
 I am manager to the firm of M. C. Camroodeen & Co.	The store (in
 question) was licensed before. I. Timol, had a  licence there:      own 3 or 4
 properties in Durban, of the total value of about £18,000 to £20,000, on the valuation roll. Most of this property I hire out to tenants. If Dada Osman does not get his licence, I shall lose rent. He is a very good tenant.    I have known
 him a long time. He is living well. He has plenty of furniture in his house.   I
 am not satisfied with the decision of the Licensing Officer.
 The Council was reminded of the definition given by you to the Colonial Premiers, of “an undesirable person”, viz., “It  is  not because a man is of a different colour from ourselves that he is necessarily an undesirable immigrant. But it is because he is dirty, or immoral, or a pauper, or has some other objection which could be defined by an Act of Parliament.” But all this proved to be a mere cry in the wilderness. The Councillor, who had borne the Demonstration Committee’s flag in 1897, and was ready to return “by force, if necessary” the Indian passengers on board the Courland and the Naderi, “failed to be convinced” that the action of the Licensing Officer was an error, and moved that his decision be confirmed. No one would rise to second the motion, and for a moment it seemed as if the Town Council was ready to do justice. But Mr. Collins, another Councillor, came to the rescue, and seconded the motion in the following speech:
 He was not surprised that there was a great deal of reluctance on the part of the Council to refuse the licence. But he believed that the licence would be refused, and the reason was not because the applicant or the premises were unsuitable but because the applicant was an Indian. What Mr. Gandhi had said was perfectly true, and he (Mr. Collins) felt some relief in saying that most of these licences had been refused principally on the ground of the applicants being Indians The Council was placed in a very unhappy position in having to carry out a policy which in the discretion of Parliament was considered necessary. Parliament, representing the community of Natal, had come to the conclusion that it was undesirable that the Indians should increase their hold on the trade of Durban. And it was on that account that they were practically called upon to refuse the licences which were not otherwise objectionable. Personally, he considered the refusal of the licence a  grievance  to  the applicant who was a most suitable person to appear before the Council to ask for a licence. But it had been found expedient as a matter of Colonial policy, that these licences should not be increased. (The Natal Advertiser, 13 September, 1891.)libtech_249_footnote
 It may be here remarked that Mr. Collins holds a prominent position among the public men of Natal. He has often occupied the position of the Deputy Mayor, and has more than once acted for the Mayor. Coming as it did from such a source, the pronouncement was most painful, if also equally important. It is respectfully submitted that
 
 the Natal Legislature, if the then Prime Minister correctly voiced its feeling, never meant, as it would appear later, to go the length Mr. Collins did. The intention of the Legislature was to prevent new comers—by no means all new comers —being Indians,  from obtaining licences; and your Petitioners venture to feel certain that, had the view taken by Mr. Collins of the Act been placed before Her Majesty’s Government, it would never have received the Royal assent. Mr. Collins evidently seems to think that the Parliament represents only the European community of Natal. Your Petitioners can only say that it is lamentable, if it is true. The Indians were told differently when the attempt was made to disfranchise them entirely. Again, Mr. Collins thought the granting of the licence in question would mean an increase; as a matter of fact, the premises sought to be licensed had been licensed for the year; they had become vacant as the licence holder had suffered misfortune and stopped business. The present applicant, therefore, would not have added to the number of licence-holders in the borough.
 Mr. Labistour, another Councillor, and a prominent local Advocate, was so disgusted with the whole procedure that he thus gave vent to his sentiments:
 He had purposely refrained from attending the meeting owing to the anomalous policy pursued in appeals of that kind. He disagreed with the dirty work they (councillors) were called upon to do. If the burgesses wished all such licences stopped, there was a clean way of going about the matter: viz., getting the Legislative Assembly to enact a measure against the granting of licences to the Indian community. But, sitting as a Court of Appeal, unless there were good grounds to the contrary, the licence should be granted. (ibid.)
 Mr. Labistour having, as he said, come purposely late could not vote, and the motion was carried unanimously, and the appeal dismissed.
 In your Petitioners’ humble opinion, it is almost impossible to imagine a stronger case than the above, or greater injustice than that done by the Durban Town Council—a Town Council of a British Colony—sitting in appeal as a judicial body. It has put a premium upon insanitation and questionable trade practices. What incentives could your Petitioners hold out to the weaker members of the Indian community? They, the weaker members, might say: “You ask us to adopt the modern sanitary methods, and live better; and you promise that the Government should deal fairly by us: we don’t believe this.
 Does not your Dada Osman live as well as any European on the same platform? Has that meant anything to the Town Council? No; whether we live well or live ill, we would fare neither better nor worse.” The European Colonists have been proclaiming that they would have no objection to respectable Indians living in the modern style. Your Petitioners have always contended that the objection on the ground of alleged insanitation is a fiction, and the Durban Town Council, it would appear, has proved the contention.
 The Newcastle Town Council has, however, gone one better than the Durban body. Its Licensing Officer, apparently acting under orders, refused to grant the licences this year, under the Act, to each and every one of the eight Indian store-keepers that had held the licence last year. Such a wholesale refusal struck terror in the hearts of the Indian traders in the Colony. Suspension of the trade of these store-keepers would have not only ruined them and their dependants, but would also have resulted in the collapse of some houses in Durban which support them. The assets of these men were then estimated at over ten thousand pounds, and hands directly dependent on them were over forty. At great expense, therefore, Mr.Laughton, a leading Advocate, was engaged to carry the appeal to the Town Council; and, as a result, six licences out of nine (held by eight storekeepers) were granted. The remaining three, having been refused, the three holders thereof appealed to the Supreme Court which, by a majority, threw out the appeal on the ground that, in virtue of Section 5 of the Act, it had no jurisdiction to entertain it. As the matter was very important, and as the Chief Justice dissented from the other two Judges and favoured the contention of the appellants, the matter was taken to the Privy Council. A cablegram from the appellants’ Solicitors in London states that the appeal has been lost. It must in justice be said that the Newcastle Town Council has been gracious enough to allow the three storekeepers, pending the appeal, to continue their trade. Its policy, however, is unmistakable. It would have wiped out the Indian from Newcastle if it could have done so with decency, and without stir, regardless of the consequence to the parties affected. The reasons given by  the Licensing Officer for his refusal were the same with reference to all the above licences: viz., “The report framed by the Sanitary Inspector in terms of Sec. 4 of the’ Rules under Act 18 of 1897, in connection with this application being of an unfavourable nature, and the  premises not being fit for the intended trade, as required by Sec. 8 of the Act referred to, the application was refused by me.” None of the
 applicants knew anything about the Sanitary Inspector’s report, or the Licensing Officer’s reasons before their licences were refused; nor were they asked to make any improvements or alterations in their premises. The reasons were furnished by the Licensing Officer only after he was required so to do by the Town Council when the matter came before it in appeal. After the three applicants were refused their licences, and they came to know why the licences were refused, they offered at once to make such alterations in their premises as the Sanitary Inspector may suggest; but the Licensing Officer would not hear of it, and declined to entertain their applications on the ground that the Town Council had already decided to sustain his previous decision. (Vide Appendix B.) It may be here remarked that the applicants never admitted that their premises were in an insanitary condition, and had produced medical evidence to prove that the premises were in a satisfactory condition. Your  Petitioners  attach hereto (vide Appendix C) an extract from the Record of Proceedings before the Town Council, which would show more fully the case for the three applicants. The Newcastle Town Council consists of 8 councillors—a medical practitioner, a solicitor, a carpenter, a canteen keeper, a miner, a bookseller and two storekeepers. The Licensing Officer is also the Town Clerk who would be the Clerk of the Court when the Town Council sits in appeal against the decision of the Licensing Officer.
 The Dundee Local Board, however, promises to outdo both the Durban and the Newcastle Town Councils. In November last, a trade licence was granted by the Licensing Officer to a Chinaman, and a majority of the rate-payers appealed against the decision of  that officer. The Local Board, by a majority of 3 to 2,  cancelled  the licence solely on the ground that the applicant belonged  to  the Chinese nationality. The applicant’s solicitor, in his  notice  to  the Local Board of Appeal against its decision, recited the following grounds of appeal:
  That 	your Board, by reason 	of certain 	of the 	members on 	it being merchants 	and storekeepers and holders of retail licences, was unable and 	could not possibly 	deal with the 	subject matter 	of appeal without 	prejudice to Hoi-Lee 	& Co.’s interests.  That 	the constitution of 	your Board 	was such that several 	of the 	members of 	it were personally and 	directly interested 	pecuniarily in the 	refusal of the retail licence to Hoi-Lee & Co., and should not therefore have sat on 
 your Board and voted on the question.
  That 	certain members of your Board who sat showed personal animus 	and bias against the 	firm of 	Hoi-Lee & 	Co., on 	account of 	the members 	being natives 	of China, 	and one in 	particular stated: 	“I would not 	even give 	a Chinaman 	the chance 	of a dog.”  That 	no evidence or legal 	proof was adduced 	by the appellant 	rate-payers that 	Hoi-Lee & 	Co. were undesirable persons 	to have in the 	community.  That 	no evidence or legal 	proof was adduced 	by the appellant 	rate-payers that 	the premises that 	had been licensed by 	the Licensing 	Officer were 	totally unfit 	and unsuitable for 	business purposes, 	pending erection of the 	premises agreed to 	be erected by 	the landlord 	under his lease 	with the said 	Hoi-Lee & Co.  That 	the decision 	and resolution 	of the 	Board was 	inequitable and 	unjust both in Equity and Law. 
What happened to the Chinaman who appears, from the record of the
 case, to be a British subject, is not unlikely to happen in the case of the Indians. The Supreme Court refused to entertain the appeal in the above case in virtue of the decision in the Newcastle case referred to above.
 In November last, a meeting was convened by the Chairman of the Dundee Local Board at the request of the rate-payers “to discuss the advisability of allowing Asiatics to trade in the township”. There are at present about ten Indian stores in Dundee.  The  following extract from the proceedings of the meeting would show how the Local Board proposes to deal with them next year:
 Mr. C. G. Wilson (the Chairman of the Local Board) made a very good impression with his remarks. He defended the action of the Board in all matters, and said it was their endeavour, if possible, to rid the town of the Asiatic curse. They were not only a curse here, but to the whole Colony of Natal. He assured the meeting that their actions in the case of the Chinaman were disinterested and unbiased, and they honestly did what they thought to be their duty to the towns, by cancelling the licence. He hoped they (the rate-payers) would show, by strongly expressing their opinions, that they meant to abolish this curse.
 Mr. W. L. Oldacre (a member of the Board) said that he and other members of the Board did what they thought to be right; and assured the meeting that there was no bias attached to its proceedings, and they could depend upon him doing his duty as a member of the Board.
 
 Mr. S. Jones then proposed that the Local Board do all in its power to prevent the granting of further licences to undesirables; that the Licensing Officer also be instructed to this effect; and that steps be taken to cancel as many of these licences as possible. This proposition  was  unanimously carried, amidst cheers.
 Mr. C. G. Wilson wished to thank the meeting for the decision arrived at, as it had greatly strengthened the hands of the Board, who would act upon the decision of the meeting.
 Several other gentlemen having spoken, Mr. Hastings proposed that the Town Clerk and Licensing Officer should be two separate persons.
 Mr. Wilson said he was of opinion that it would be far better to have the of officers remain as at present; then if the Licensing Officer did not act as the Board did in matters such as these, they had their remedy. (The Natal Witness, 26 November 1898.)
The undesirables referred to in the preceding extract are, of
 course, the British Indian traders of Dundee. Here there is a frank avowal of the policy the Dundee Local Board, intend to pursue. The Licensing Officer has received, and is still further to receive, from the appellate body created by the Act, instructions as to what he is to do; and thus, the aggrieved parties are to be deprived of the right of placing their case before two tribunals contemplated by the Act: viz., the Licensing Officer and the Town Council or the Local Board, as the case may be. These are only some of the instances that have come under your Petitioners’ notice which conclusively indicate the policy the various Town Councils and Local Boards would pursue if unchecked.
 Your Petitioners are free to acknowledge that the other Town Councils and Local Boards do not appear as yet to have shown any desire to act in an oppressive manner; though there, too,  it  is practically impossible to obtain new licences even for old established Indians. The power, your Petitioners were almost going to say, the despotic power, given to them under the Act is there, and there is no guarantee that they will not copy the example set them by Durban, Newcastle, and Dundee.
 In order to ascertain the views of the solicitors who have had anything to do with the working of the Act, a letterlibtech_250_footnotewas addressed to them asking them to be good enough to give their experience of its working. Three out of the four gentlemen to whom the
 
 communication was sent, have returned their replies which are hereto attached. (Vide App. D, E, F.) Mr. Laughton, who dealt with the Newcastle and the Chinaman’s cases, as also with that of Somnath Maharaj referred to above, remarks:
 I regard the Dealers’ Licenses Act a very discreditable and dishonest piece of legislation. Dishonest and discreditable, because no secret was made that it was intended to apply to Indians and to them alone. Indeed, it was passed at a session of Parliament called about a month earlier than otherwise it would have been, as a concession to an anti-Indian mob and yet, in order to gain the approval of the Secretary of State, the Act is made to apply to all.
 The effect of the Act is to place in the hands of the declared enemies of Indian traders the power to grant or refuse trade licences; the consequence is as might be expected, and we all feel humiliated at what we see, whether we admit  it or not.
Mr. O’Hea, another gentleman, who is also the Honorary
 Secretary of the Colonial Patriotic Union, whose avowed object is to prevent the further influx of Asiatics, says:
 I do not think that this Law is being administered in accordance with the spirit of the Legislature. The then Prime Minister who introduced the Bill said its main object was to affect those persons dealt with under the Immigration Bill. Ships would not bring those persons if they knew they would not be landed; and the people would not come here to trade if they could not get licences.
 I had a case in point not long ago. A man of Chinese nationality, who had been thirteen years in the Colony, was refused a licence for no other reason, I am convinced, than because he was a Chinaman. The statistics of Durban show that the town has more than doubled in extent and population within the past ten years; and’ yet, this man who had linked his fortunes with the Colony, a man of unblemished character—who arrived when there were only about 40 human beings for every 100 there are today—this man’s character and long residence were ignored, and a means of earning an honest living in Durban was denied him. In like manner, I have seen that in Newcastle an Indian, who had been 15 years resident in Natal, was refused a licence which would have been granted to a European if he had been the applicant. This is not  as it ought to be.
Messrs. Renaud & Robinson say, among other things:
 But to our mind the principal defect in the present Act is that, no appeal being allowed from the Town Council’s decision, injustice has been done and is likely to be done to applicants for licences.
 
 While this was in print, Mr. C. A. de R. Labistour’s opinion was received, which is annexed hereto (vide Appendix G).libtech_251_footnote
 “Consistency”, a correspondent of The Times of Natal (believed to be the Government organ), who, it would appear from his letter ( vide Appendix H), is a Colonist of over 20 years’ standing, and a merchant, says:
 By all means make them (Indian traders) adhere to the strictest sanitary regulations, keep their books in English, and otherwise do as English traders do: but when they have met these demands, give them justice. No honest thinking man can say that the new Bill gives these people justice, or the community justice, be cause it puts into the hands of interested parties the power to push out competition which is beneficial to the multitude and enables these interested parties to fill their own pockets....I saw in one of your contemporaries, the other day, that the Dundee Local Board had resolved not to renew any Arab licences for the coming year, and had instructed the Licensing Officer accordingly. These men are the English merchants, and wish all the business to themselves, when the public will have to pay them any prices they ask. Surely it is time the Government gave these men the limit.
 The Times of Natal, dated the 21st December, 1898, after dealing with the above letter, and justifying its opposition to the Indian traders on the ground of self-preservation, observes:
 At the same time, we are far from desiring that these Indian traders should be treated harshly.	We do not believe, however, that any considerable
 number of Colonists wish to see the powers given under these laws used oppressively. If it be true, as reported, that the Dundee Local Board has resolved not to renew any Indian licences for the coming year, we would strongly urge upon the Board, in the interests of its own rate-payers and in the interests of the Colony generally, to rescind that resolution forthwith. The Board has power to refuse the renewal of these licenses, but it was never contemplated for a moment that this power would be exercised in this wholesale manner. Mr. Escombe was responsible for the Traders’ Licenses Act, and he never dreamt that the power it confers would be used in this way. The Act was passed, not so much with a view to enabling the licensing bodies to deal with the Indians already trading in the Colony, as to prevent others coming here to trade. In moving the second reading of the measure, Mr. Escombe explained that it was introduced at the request of the Town Councils, and said:
 
 “There is no hesitation on their part in saying what their object is, and there is no objection on the part of the Government in admitting their proposal, to prevent certain persons coming to this country to compete with Europeans on unequal terms, and getting the licences to trade which are required by the Europeans.” Again, “No people will come here to trade if they think there is a doubt as to their having a license. So that, if the law is in the book, it will answer without much application.” It will thus be seen that while the Act gives extensive powers, the Minister responsible for it relied on the moral effect its existence would have, rather than upon the application of its provisions, to effect his purpose. This purpose was not to deprive traders already here of their licenses, but to prevent others coming here and getting licences. It was not expected that the Boards and Councils, which were appointed courts of appeal under this Act, would misuse their powers as the Dundee Board threatens to do. Said Mr. Escombe, in replying to the debate on the second reading: “I have got no doubt that this Bill in principle can only be warranted by the serious danger threatening this land. But 1 have got that belief in the fairness of the municipal authorities and of the Colony that I believe this Bill will be administered with what I call justice and moderation.” The Dundee Board will do well to note those words, for so sure as it exercises its powers in the wholesale manner now proposed, so sure will it defeat the end we all have in view. By all means let the undesirables be weeded out, bat the process must be very gradual, so as to accomplish what is desired without inflicting any great injustice. It may be said: “There is the Act, and we will enforce it.” Yes, there is the Act, but how long will the Act be there if injustice is inflicted under it? The fact that a very large number of voters draw on India for their labour supply must not belost sight of, for in it the Indian Government have the means of screwing a good deal more out of this Colony than many realise. Suppose the Indian Government were to say, “You cannot have more labour until you repeal that Act under which our people have been grossly ill-treated,” what would be the result? We do not care to speculate on this. If Local Boards, Town Councils and Licensing Boards are wise, they will never do anything to put the employers of Indian labour to such a trial.
 Your Petitioners offer no apology for having given the long extract, as it is very important, not only because of its source, but also because of the manner in which the subject has been dealt with. The good intentions of the Legislature are not in the Act itself, though they might have been reproduced therein, which would have spared the Indian traders the anxiety as to their bread being suddenly snatched from their mouths. The Government organ has betrayed itself into an admission which is entirely inconsistent with its own
 admonition to the Dundee Local Board, and seems to be an insidious hint to the Board as to how they can achieve their end  without attracting notice; for it too would have the undesirables “weeded out” by a “very gradual process”. How can this attitude be compatible with the desire not to touch those that are already established? What the Dundee Board may fail to accomplish owing, to use the expression of the then Prime Minister, to their “brutal frankness,” The Times would have them accomplish indirectly and diplomatically so as to keep the real aim in the background.
 A correspondent of The Natal Mercury (14 December, 1898) signing himself ‘A Colonist of close upon 20 years’, thus writes:
 Sir: I notice in your paper of today a letter from Newcastle, stating that the mighty Corporation of that town had won their case brought against them by one Vawda, to whom they had refused a licence, and giving the information that the result will be welcome throughout the Colony. Vawda is an Indian who has been trading in Newcastle for the past 15 years, during which time he has been a good citizen; but, unfortunately for him, he has also been a successful merchant, a fact which evidently the members of the Licensing Board in Newcastle, who are merchants themselves, don’t like. That the Corporation can be congratulated upon such a miserable misconstruction of their powers, or that the decision of the Privy Council will be welcomed by fair-minded people in Natal, is questionable.
 —I am etc.
 A Colonial of close upon 20 years.
 The Transvaal Government has been trying to remove the  Indians to Locations; but even they are willing to give some time, however inadequate, to the Indians in order to enable them to remove their businesses without in their view incurring loss. Her Majesty’s Government are naturally not satisfied with such a meagre concession, and it is within your Petitioners’ knowledge that an attempt is being made to induce that Government not to interfere with those that are already established. The Government of the Orange Free State, though quite independent, gave a year’s notice to the Indian traders to close their businesses. The Colony of Natal which boasts of its being the most British Colony in South Africa, has acquired the  power  to deprive the Indian traders abruptly of the right of trading, and has attempted and threatens to exercise that power. The Natal Advertiser (dated 13 December, 18983 thus notices the anomaly:
 ...We can only say that we deeply regret the decision (of the Privy
 Council)     It is an Act which might have been expected from the Transvaal
 Raad. That body, in the Aliens Expulsion Law, has ousted the jurisdiction of the High Court, and our readers will remember the outcry raised about it in the Colonies. But it is not one whit worse than this Act; indeed, if there is any difference, ours is the worse, because it is likely to be much more frequently enforced. It is absurd to say that the Act would not have been effective if right of appeal to the Supreme Court had been allowed; surely, that body could be trusted to exercise common sense.   Far better, indeed, that in one or two cases
 the latter (the desire of the municipalities) should have been overruled than that the principle should be laid down in a self-governing community under representative institutions that, in any case affecting the rights of the citizen, recourse to the highest judicial body in the State should be deliberately barred. Your Petitioners very much fear  that   the   Government  of  the
Colony  are  not  likely   to   help   your  Petitioners.   The   Rules (vide
 Appendix I) that have been passed under the Act, regulating the mode of obtaining licences and appeals from the Licensing Officer have, in your Petitioners’ humble opinion, been framed in a manner to strengthen the Licensing Officer and the appellate body in the arbitrary powers given to them. It is but fair to state here that they were passed in September 1897; your Petitioners, however, had hoped that the Colony having been invested with powers of exceptional severity, the Indian community could be allowed to have some rest, and that, in isolated cases of hardship, they would be able to obtain redress without the necessity of approaching Her Majesty’s Government. That belief was strengthened by a speech made by the late Premier after his return from London, expressing the hope that those powers would be judiciously and moderately exercised. Unfortunately, this had not been the case. It is for that reason that your Petitioners raise objections to the Rules over a year after their publication. Be that, however, as it may, your Petitioners submit that the absence of any provision made in the Rules as to requiring the Licensing Officer to furnish reasons for his decision to the applicant, has worked much mischief. So it struck Mr. Collins also (Appendix A).
 What your Petitioners fear most is the process of gradual weeding out referred to above. Those on the spot understand the process only too well. Many small storekeepers have been weeded out this year: some because they, having hardly a gross out-turn of ten pounds per month, buying cash and selling cash, could not afford to keep any books at all, as is not unoften done even among small
 European storekeepers; and some because they could not afford to comply with the requirements of the Sanitary Inspector having connection, not with the cleanliness of the premises, but with their structural arrangements. If the Licensing autho- rities were, year by year, to wipe out some small Indian storekeepers, it would not require many years to bring down the larger houses without their having to refuse their licences. Messrs. Mahomed Cassim Camroodeen &c Co., the first signatories hereto for instance, have outstanding debts among nearly 400 Indian storekeepers and hawkers in Natal, to the extent of over£25,000; and own landed property in Durban tenanted by Indian storekeepers. If one-eighth of these storekeepers were to be refused their licences, the firm’s position would be damaged. They have already felt the pinch. They had to suffer owing to the refusal of the licence to Mr. Dada Osman (above referred to). Mr. Amod Jeewa owns properties in Estcourt, Dundee, Newcastle and Durban, which are almost entirely tenanted by Indian storekeepers, and most of which can be used for no other purpose. The shutting up of only a few of the businesses would mean practical ruin. These are but typical instances which can be multiplied.
 Your Petitioners have been taught to believe from their infancy that in all Her Majesty’s dominions there is absolute security of life and property. So far as the latter is concerned, that belief has received  a rude shaking in this Colony: for, to be deprived of the means of making the only use available of one’s property is, your Petitioners humbly submit, little less than total deprivation thereof.
 It has been suggested that in self-governing Colonies Her Majesty’s power of interference is very limited. However limited it may be, your Petitioners venture to think that it is not less for the self-governing Colonies than for the Transvaal. Unfortunately, your Petitioners have to face an Act which has already been approved of by Her Majesty. But your Petitioners apprehend that, when Her Majesty was advised not to exercise the power of disallowing the Act, it was little thought that the powers given thereby would be so abused as, it is submitted, they have been.
 Your Petitioners submit, with the greatest deference, that sufficient has been shown above to justify a strong remonstrance and advice to the Government of the Colony to so amend the Act as to render a recurrence of the injustice described above impossible, and thus to bring the Act in harmony with the noble British traditions.
 But if this be not possible, your Petitioners humbly venture to submit that the Colony should no longer be allowed to enjoy the privilege of using Indian labour which is acknowledged to be indispensable for its advancement. The Times of Natal, in the extract quoted above, anticipates a withdrawal of the supply of the indentured labour from India in the event of injustice being done by Licensing authorities. The Times (London), the East India Association, Sir Lepel Griffin,libtech_252_footnotelibtech_253_footnoteDr.  Gust,  the  prominent  bodies   in   India,   and   the   entire Anglo-Indian and Indian Press have already suggested that remedy; but so far Her Majesty’s Government do not appear to have been pleased to accept it. Your Petitioners humbly submit that it  is impossible to make out a stronger case than herein for such withdrawal, failing redress of acknowledged grievances.
 How the next year will open for the Indian traders your Petitioners do not know. Every storekeeper is, however, in a state of feverish anxiety. The suspense is dreadful. The larger houses, fearing that their customers (small storekeepers) might be refused their licences, and having the only hope that they had of securing some check on the Licensing authorities taken away from them by their lordships of the Privy Council, have become despondent and hesitate to clear their goods.
 Your Petitioners, therefore, respectfully venture to hope  that your Petitioners’ prayer will receive the early attention of Her Majesty’s Government.
 And for this act of justice and mercy, your Petitioners, as in duty bound, shall ever pray, etc., etc., etc.

 DEAR SIR:

NEWCASTLE,
 January 11th, 1898
  I 	am instructed to forward to you the enclosed Applications for Retail 	Shop Licenses on behalf of Suleiman Ebrahim, Sajad Meajan, and 	Abdool Rassool.  These 	Licenses were refused by you last month, on the ground, as I 	understand, that you did not consider the Report of the Sanitary 	Inspector to be sufficiently favourable, and I am now directed to 	inform you that, with the object of obtaining renewal of the 	Licenses, my Clients will use every endeavour to meet the objection 	by carrying out such alterations as may be recommended by the 	Sanitary Inspector.  In 	the case of Sajad Meajan, I understand that alterations have been 	made since the inspection 	by the 	Sanitary Inspector in 	December, and 	these alterations 	will, I 	believe, remove 	any objection 	which previously 	existed. In the 	other two 	cases, I 	desire, if 	it should meet 	with your approval, to 	accompany the 	Sanitary Inspector on 	his visit, 	and to 	take a 	note of 	any objections 	he may 	make, with the 	object of 	rectifying any deficiency.  I 	trust that my 	Clients will be 	able to 	satisfy you, as 	the refusal 	of Licenses 	is  of 	very serious consequence 	to them.  I 	am, Sir,  your 	obedient servant  (Sd.) 	W. A. VANDERPLANK, 	ATTORNEY FOR SULEMAN 	EBRAHIM, SAJAD 	MEAJAN, & ABDOOL 	RASSOOL.  A 	reply similar to the following was returned in each case.  The 	application of S. E. Vavda under date 15th December 1897, for a 	Retail shop License in name of Suleiman Ebrahim for premises at Erf 	37, Murchison St. . . having been refused by me, and my decision 	thereon upheld by the Town Council on Appeal, on the 8th January 	1898, the annexed application is refused.

 APPENDIX C
 Extract from a certified copy of the minutes of special meeting of the Town Council of the Borough of Newcastle held in the Council Chamber on Saturday, January [8], 1898, to hear the appeals against the decisions of the borough Licensing Officer appointed under Act No. 18 of 1897, with reference to the applications of S.
 E. Vavda (two licenses), Abdool Rassool and Sajad Meajan—license to Vavda with reference to Erf 37, Murchison Street, and the licenses to Abdool Rassool and Sajad Meajan refused both by the Licensing Officer and the Town Council on appeal:
 At the outset Mr. Laughton desires that his protest should be recorded against any officer of the council being appointed to fill the position of Licensing Officer under Act 18 of 1897, and addresses the council in support thereof.
 APPEALS
 Suleiman Essop Vavda, Applications Nos. 20, 21—1898.
 Mr. Laughton reads notice to applicant from Licensing Officer dated the 23rd December 1897, and Sanitary Inspector’s report, viz.:
 SANITARY REPORT
 I inspected the premises at 37 Marchison Street sought to be licensed as a Retail Shop, and like all Arab’s premises are badly ventilated, otherwise the building is in fairly good condition; found them busily fitting up bedroom but communication at present between store and bedroom direct. Great efforts have been made to make the building look clean and fit in view of anticipated inspection, one good resulting from the provisions of the Licensing Law.
 (Signed) JAS MACDONALD SANITARY INSPECTOR
 and, Licensing Officer’s decision, and reasons on application for license for premises at Erf 37, Murchison Street and contended that the Sanitary Inspector’s report was satisfactory and that, if not, the license might be issued conditionally.
 Mr. Laughton further read notice to applicant dated 23rd December, 1897, Sanitary Inspector’s Report, viz.,:
 SANITARY REPORT SULEIMAN ESSOP VAVDA
 The premises sought to be licensed in this case are situated at the corner of Scott and Allan Street, a conspicuous part of the town. The bedroom for assistants is the small store adjoining. The Applicant himself is living behind the large store. The store premises are commodious but like others badly ventilated. The yard premises are small and cramped where it is crowded by kitchen, bathroom and closet. Three of the assistants now sleep on the premises recently acquired by Applicant at 36 Scott Street. Otherwise, the
 
 bedroom accommodation attached to the store would be insufficient and unsanitary.
      December 	15, 1897.  (Signed) 	JAS MACDONALD 	SANITARY 	INSPECTOR 
    and 	Licensing Officer’s reasons on the application for licence for 	premises at Erf 33, Scott Street, and called Suleiman Ebrahim Vavda, 	who, duly sworn, stated:  I 	am the 	applicant for 	licenses for 	premises at 	37 Murchison Street, and 	33 Scott 	Street, where I carry 	on business. 	I held 	three licenses last year, but 	only apply 	for two this year. I have 	been in Natal 	about 17 years 	and in Newcastle 	10 years. 	I have 	held a license 	for 37 Murchison 	Street for seven 	years and for 33 Scott 	Street for about 	five years. The value 	of the stock 	in the two stores 	is about 	£4,500; the value 	of the outstanding 	liabilities due to 	the firm is 	about £700. I 	hold 37 	Murchison Street 	on monthly tenancy and the lease of 33 Scott Street expires in six months’ time  [Questioned] 	By the Mayor: I and Mahomed Essop Tomor are in partnership and have 	separately conducted the business in the same name.  APPEAL  Abdool 	Rassool. Application No. 9—1898.  Mr. 	Laughton read letter to applicant from Licensing Officer dated 23rd 	December 1897, Licensing Officer’s decision and reasons and 	sanitary report, viz:  SANITARY 	REPORT  I 	examined the premises referred to in application which is a small 	store in decayed condition. No direct communication with bedroom, 	occupied solely by Applicant—and is kept fairly clean. Applicant 	is in the fruit trade which would probably form part of his business 	at this store—a feature that might have a different bearing on the 	sanitary condition of the premises under consideration a month 	hence. Formerly the Applicant occupied a small store next to Mahomed 	Saffee’s as a fruit shop.  (Signed) 	JAS. 	MACDONALD SANITARY INSPECTOR  and 	quoting section 8 of Act No. 18 of 1897, contended that the sanitary 	report did not show that the premises were unfit for the intended 	trade. He called Abdool Rassool who, being duly sworn, stated:  I 	am the applicant for the license. I have been in the Colony about 	ten years and in Newcastle about 8 years. I have held a license for 	three years, two years at the fruit shop, 42 Scott Street, and one 	year at the present store. Neither the inspecting officer nor any 	other officer of the borough has pointed out any objection to the 	premises to me. I do not know why my license was refused. The 	Licensing Officer has never been inside my premises. I have made no 	alterations since the inspecting officer visited my premises. The 	value of my stock is about £400. 
 [Questioned] By Councillor Hastie: I have occupied the present premises for about one year.
 APPEAL
 Sajad Meajan. Application No. 10—1898,
 Mr. Laughton read Sanitary Inspector’s report, viz.,:
 SANITARY REPORT
 I examined the premises sought to be licensed as a Retail Shop at 36 Murchison Street. The premises are in a most unsanitary and filthy condition and have direct communication with bedroom occupied by himself, wife, daughter, and assistant.
 
 (Signed) JAS. MACDONALD SANITARY INSPECTOR
 and submits Licensing Officer’s decision and reasons and letter from the Licensing Officer to the applicant dated 23rd December 1897. He further calls Sajad Meajan who, being duly sworn, stated:
 I am the applicant for the license. I have been in Natal seven years and in Newcastle seven years. I have held a corporation license for five years for the same premises.
 Since making the application for my license the sanitary inspector or other officer of the corporation has not pointed out to me why a license was refused to me. I do not know why the license was refused. Since making my application the Licensing Officer has not inspected my premises. The value of my stock is about £600. I, my wife, my daughter, and assistant do not occupy one bedroom as stated in the Sanitary Inspector’s Report, nor did they at the date of the report. The assistant occupies a separate room. I have made alterations in the premises since the date of the report. The closet has been removed to the far corner of my plot of ground. I was not aware that the premises were in a filthy condition at the date of the report and was not informed so at the time by the inspector.
 [Questioned] By Councillor Kemp: I made alterations myself without being told to do so.
 Charles O’Grady Gubbins on further oath states: I inspected Sajad Meajan’s premises today and found them in a satisfactory condition. There are two bedrooms very clean, and boarded, lined and ceiled.
 From a sanitary point of view I do not think the license should be refused. [Questioned] By Councillor Hastie: I do not know how many occupy the
 bedrooms. The measurements of the rooms are 17’X12’ and the second 11’X12’ and
 10’ high.
 Note:—The reasons of the Licensing Officer appear in the body of the memorial. Sajad Meajan has since, the creditors having stopped custom, become insolvent.

 DURBAN,
 24 Dec. 1898
  I 	have your letterlibtech_254_footnoteof 	yesterday. I 	regard the 	“Dealers’ Licenses 	Act” as a very 	discreditable and 	dishonest piece of 	legislation. Dishonest 	and discreditable 	because no 	secret was 	made that it 	was intended to 	apply to 	Indians and 	to them alone; indeed 	  it was passed 	at a session 	of Parliament 	called about a month 	earlier than otherwise it 	would have been as a 	concession to 	an anti-Indian. mob, and 	yet, in 	order to 	gain the 	approval of the Secretary of State, the Act is made to apply to all.  The 	effect of the Act is to place in the hands of the declared enemies 	of Indian traders the power to grant or refuse trade licences; the 	consequence is as might be expected and we all feel humiliated at 	what we see, whether we admit it or not.  Yours 	very truly,  F. A. LAUGHTON   
          M. K. GANDHI, 	ESQ. 	14 MERCURY LANE 	DURBAN  DEAR 	SIR,  APPENDIX E                  RE: 	DEALERS’ 	LICENSES ACT    39 GARDINER STREET,  DURBAN,  December 	23rd 1898 
  In 	reply to your letter of this day’s date, I do not think that this 	Law is being administered in accordance with the spirit of the 	Legislature. The then Prime Minister who introduced the Bill said: 	“Its main object was to affect those persons dealt with under the 	Immigration Bill. Ships would not bring those persons if they knew 	they would not be landed; and the people would not come here to 	trade if they knew they could not get Licences.”  I 	had a case in 	point not 	long ago. A 	man of Chinese 	nationality who had been 	thirteen years 	in the Colony 	was refused a Licence for 	no other reason, 	I am convinced, 	than because 	he was 	a Chinaman. 	The statistics 	of Durban 	show that the 	Town has more than 	doubled in 	extent and 	population within the 	past ten years; and 	yet this 	man who had linked 	his fortunes 	with the 	Colony—a man 	of unblemished 	character— who 	arrived when 	there were 	only about 40 	human beings for 	every 100 	there are today: this man’s character and long residence were ignored, and a means of    
 earning an honest living in Durban denied him. In like manner, I have seen that in Newcastle an Indian, who had been 15 years resident in Natal, was refused a Licence which would have been granted to a European if he had been the applicant. This is not as it ought to be.
 Yours faithfully,
 P. O’HEA

  In 	reply to your letter of the 23rd inst. re. Dealers’ Licenses Act. 	We prefer to say nothing on the political aspect of the question.  We 	are of opinion that the Licensing Officer should be appointed from 	outside the permanent staff of the Town Councils or the Local 	Boards, as the case may be. There should be an Appeal from his 	decision to the Town Council and from theirs to the Supreme Court.  We 	think that compensation should be awarded to landlords who by reason 	of the operation of the Act have lost their tenants.  There 	are several matters of minor importance which we think might be 	improved, but to our mind the principal defect in the present Act is 	that, no appeal being allowed from the Town Council’s decision, 	injustice has been done and is likely to be done to applicants for 	licences.  Yours 	faithfully,  RENAUD 	& ROBINSON   
          M. K. GANDHI, 	ESQ. 	DURBAN  DEAR 	SIR,  APPENDIX G    23 FIELD 	 ST. BUILDINGS,  DURBAN, NATAL  4th 	Jany. 1899 
  Referring 	to our interview of this date on the subject of the Licensing Act 	18/97, I can only state that, from my experience, the same, although 	not so 
 expressed, is only intended to apply to Indians and Chinese—at any rate, it appears  to me to be so.
 I have made several applications to the Licensing Officer for new licences which have been rejected without reasons being given therefor, and on appeals to the Town Council I have invariably found that body uphold the Licensing Officer’s decision, without previously calling upon him to furnish his reasons for such refusal.
 I have not tried to ascertain the number of licenses refused to Europeans, but I am inclined to believe they were only refused to those whose character, &c. did not justify them holding one.
 Yours faithfully,
 A. 	DE R. LABISTOUR 
 P.S. The most inequitable part of the Act is that which precludes an appeal from the Town Council to the Supreme Court.

 APPENDIX H
 TO
 THE EDITOR
 THE TIMES OF NATAL
 SIR,
 I have to thank you for your attention to my letter in The Times of Natal of the 16th instant under the heading “An Important Decision,” and for your remarks in reply thereto. You say: “As to the butchers’ ring, it is only necessary to point out that through it the cost of living has been very materially increased, and meat, we have been told, put beyond the means of the poorer classes of the community. It is, therefore, a menace to the welfare of the community.”
 I entirely agree with you. All combinations of this kind are morally wrong, and a menace, because the few benefit while the multitude suffer. Further on you say: “In the other case the Indian traders have also become a menace, in that, by reason of the fact that they can live so much cheaper than Europeans, they are driving the latter out of trade, and out of the Golony.” It is one of our axioms that competition is the life of trade, and while admitting that all competition is a menace, I have to submit that the Indian traders are not a menace in the same way as the butchers’ ring.
 The Indian storekeepers, by causing strong competition among storekeepers, are reducing the cost of all necessaries of life. In other words, they are benefiting the many at the expense of the few, which is exactly the opposite of the butchers’ ring.
 I well remember, twenty years ago, when I came to the Colony, we got 20 per cent. more profit than we get now—then the few benefited and the many suffered; but competition, and principally Indian competition, has brought prices down all over the country; and now the many benefit while the few suffer, and this is how it should be.
 You push these people out, and the multitude will again suffer by having to pay much larger prices for all they consume.
 I remember, some sixteen years ago, falling out with an up-country townsman because I declined to join a ring of other storekeepers to charge 5s. a bag profit on flour. In those days such a combination, detrimental to the public, but beneficial to the pockets of the storekeepers, could have been carried out, but such a combination today would be utterly impossible, and if you could get such competition into the butchery business, you would shortly hear less about the price of meat.
 You appear to complain that these people can live cheaply. Yes, they can live cheaply—don’t drink, give the authorities little trouble, and are, in fact; law-abiding subjects, and if they can sell cheaply by living cheaply, the benefit is surely the public’s. By all means make them adhere to the strictest sanitary regulations, keep their books in English, and otherwise do as English traders do; but when they have met these demands, give them justice. No honest thinking man can say that the new Bill gives these people justice, or the community justice, because it puts into the hands of interested parties the power to push out a competition, which is beneficial to the multitude, and enables these interested parties to fill their own pockets. We have now sufficient rings —insurance rings and butchers’—and goodness knows where we will stop if the diffusers of knowledge and learning, like the newspapers, are on the wrong side.
 I saw in one of your contemporaries the other day that the Dundee Local Board had resolved not to renew any Arab licenses for the coming year, and had instructed the Licensing Officer accordingly.
 These men are the English merchants, and wish all the business to themselves, when the public will have to pay them any prices they ask.
 Surely it is time the Government gave these men the limit.
 We have entrusted you with great powers, but if you are to use them unjustly, we will take them away from you.—Yours, &c.

72,"January 	21, 1899",TO PRESS AND PUBLIC MEN IN INDIA,"
        DURBAN, 
    SIR,  January 	21, 1899   The 	memoriallibtech_260_footnotelibtech_261_footnotesent herewith tells its own sorrowful  tale.  The 
  	grievance complained of is not sentimental but it is very serious 	and very real. Unless it is removed promptly, it bids fair to snatch 	the bread away from hundreds of mouths. The licensing authorities in 	Natal intend to deprive the respectable Indians of their  acquired 	rights. The matter. demands immediate, earnest and 	continuous attention of the Press and our public men. Nothing 	short  of prohibition of indentured immigration to Natal will meet 	the case, unless the Natal Government can be induced to amend the 	Licensing Law so as to bring it in harmony with the principles of 	justice as known to the British Constitution.       
 All the other grievances can wait for academic discussion. This brooks no delay.
Indians own land in the Borough of Durban worth over
 £l00,000 stg. Licenses have been refused with respect to some of the best premises, the property of Indians, in spite of excellent report by the Sanitary Inspector.
 A merchant wants to dispose of his business. All his profits are in his stock. He cannot find a purchaser as there is no certainty that the purchaser can obtain a license."

    TO  THE 	RIGHT 	HONOURABLE 	GEORGE 	NATHANIEL 	BARON 	CURZON 	OF KEDLESTON, 	VICEROY AND 	GOVERNOR-GENERAL 	OF INDIA, 	CALCUTTA  January 	27, 1899 
  THE 	MEMORIAL 	OF THE UNDERSIGNED, REPRESENTING 	THE BRITISH 	INDIANS, 	RESIDING IN THE COLONY 	OF NATAL  HUMBLY 	SHEWETH,  	That your Memorialists venture to draw Your Excellency’s attention 	to a copy of the memorial addressed to Her Majesty’s Principal 	Secretary of State for the Colonies with reference to the Dealers’ 	Licenses Act passed in the year 1897 by the Natal Legislature. Your 	Excellency will notice therefrom that   the 		Act complained of 		constitutes a present,  		real  and tangible 		grievance, and, in 		the way it 		is being 		worked, is calculated 		to tell 		very seriously upon 		the acquired rights of 		the Indian 		traders residing in the 		Colony of 		Natal; that 		the interests 		at stake 		represent thousands of pounds;  that 		the Natal 		Legislature has gone, 		as it is acknowledged 		by some of the Natal publicists, much further than even the  
 South African Republic has ventured to go;
  that 	the operation of 	the Act has turned 	out to 	be contrary to 	the assurance 	publicly given by the 	Right Honourable Harry 	Escombe, who 	carried the 	Act through, and 	was then 	the Prime Minister of 	the Colony, viz., that 	he had  full 	confidence in 	the Town Councils 	and the Town Boards 	not disturbing 	the then 	existing trading licenses;  that 	several Town Councils or 	Local Boards have 	already seriously 	interfered with the 	existing licenses, and 	threatened to 	do so yet more extensively. 
 Your Memorialists have, under such circumstances, prayed for either such an amendment of the Act as to bring it in harmony with British principles of justice, or suspension of the supply of indentured labour to the Colony.
 Your Memorialists venture to think that the active and effective intervention of the Indian Government is necessary, if the rights of British Indians outside British India are to be rescued from extinction. Agreeably to the resolution of the Dundee Local Board to wipe out as many Asiaticsas possible, referred to in the Annexure, its Licensing Officer has, your Memorialists are informed, refused to renew the licenses of seven or eight Indian Storekeepers out of about sixteen. One of them, who has been refused the license, is the largest Indian Storekeeper in Dundee, having a stock of several  thousands of pounds. The Licensing Officer at Newcastle has again refused to issue the three licenses—also referred to in the Annexure—that were withheld last year. The applicants are still doing all they can locally to secure their licenses. The result is not, therefore, yet final. It, however, sufficiently shows the seriousness of the position.  Applications  in many other places in the Colony are still under consideration.
 Whatever the ultimate outcome this year, the possibility of mischief under the Act is, in your Memorialists’ humble opinion, enormous, and your Memorialists earnestly hope and humbly pray that the prayer contained in the Annexure will receive Your Excellency’s sympathetic and early consideration.
 And for this act of justice and mercy your Memorialists, as in duty bound, shall ever pray, etc., etc.

They left Bombay on or about the 14th January by the S. S. Safari which, after calling at Lamu and Mombasa, went to Zanzibar. At Zanzibar they transshipped into the S.S. General on or about the 9th ult. They have now landed at Delagoa Bay. Two of them would remain in Natal and are not prohibited immigrants within the meaning of the Act. The other five want to come to the Colony as visitors. They would submit to any quarantine the Government may think fit to impose on land. The Companies would not issue a passage without an assurance from the Government that their ships would not, on account of the mere presence of Indians on board, be placed under quarantine.
 Under the circumstances, I trust the Government would be pleased to make such orders as would enable the men to come to the Colony.

 DURBAN,
 [Prior to March 8, 1899]
 With reference to the sanitary precautions that are being taken to prevent the entry of bubonic plague into this Colony, may I suggest that a pamphlet giving detailed instructions as to sanitary rules, lime-washing, disinfecting, &c., might be of great use, and a useful supplement to the Corporation advertisement that appeared some time ago? If the suggestion is accepted, I shall be pleased to have the pamphlet translated in the Indian languages spoken in the Colony, and distributed free of charge, if necessary, the Corporation paying for the printing and postage.

  The Times of 	India  [BOMBAY]  SIR,  	I venture to enclose herewith a copy of a letter received by the 	Indian community in Natal from the Indian traders in Umtali, 	Rhodesia.libtech_262_footnoteThe 	letter speaks for itself. The authorities seem to have rendered 	assistance to the Indians, but, in my humble opinion, nothing less 	than an emphatic declaration from the Colonial Office to the effect 	that the white settlers in British South Africa cannot with impunity 	interfere with the liberty of the British Indian settlers, in 	addition to adequate punishment to the wrong-doers, will meet the 	case. It will be noticed that Justices of the Peace and other 	prominent Europeans took part in the violence. The omission on the 	part of Mr. Chamberlain to take any notice of the unlawful 	proceedings of the Durban mob in 1897libtech_263_footnotehas, I am afraid, led the white settlers to think 	that they can do anything they like with the Indians. In the Durban 	case there was no necessity to punish the mob. But we here feel that 	a despatch from Mr. Chamberlain strongly disapproving of the whole 	thing would have produced a salutary effect. 
      (Enclosure)      GENTLEMEN,  Yours faithfully,  M. K. GANDHI    UMTALI, RHODESIA,  January 	22, [1899] 
  We 	beg to call your attention to the following circumstances.  We 	have been trading both at Beira and Macequece, and last March we 	applied     
 for a licence to trade at Umtali in Rhodesia, which was granted in April. We then built  a store, but found that the European traders were very indignant, and they held a meeting protesting against the issue of licences to British Indian subjects, as they considered them undesirable, but they were not supported by the High Commissioner.
 We traded peacefully up to the 7th of last December, when a countryman of ours (a merchant of Beira) also applied for a trading licence, which he got. This again excited the traders of Umtali, and they laid the matter before the Chamber  of Commerce, requesting that body to take the subject up and oppose the granting of licences to Asiatics. Their meetings were reported in the local papers, and had a serious effect upon the minds of the public. The Government, however, took little or no notice of the agitation. Later the European merchants of the town, headed by Justices of the Peace and officers of the local Volunteer force, in all a mob of about one hundred and fifty persons, attacked and broke into our store by violence about 9
 p.m. on the 4th of January 1899. Seeing how violent the attitude of the mob was and how unlawful their action was, we were very frightened, but, fortunately before our persons or goods were removed over the Portuguese border, Inspector Birch, with some constables, came on the scene and informed the raiders that their action was grossly wrong and illegal, and that the ringleaders would be prosecuted.
 The police only being ten in number, the raiders practically defied them. The Inspector fearing violence, which certainly would have been accompanied with loss of property, and possibly with loss of life, suggested that we should be allowed time  to make arrangements about leaving. After a good deal of discussion, this was agreed to. Immediately the crowd had dispersed, the Inspector informed us that we were not even to think of going, but that he had merely suggested this allowance of time in order to summon assistance. All the available mounted police were then called in from old Umtali and guard placed over our store. The same evening about midnight fifteen Englishmen attacked the store of Allarakhia Hussein in this town. They broke the doors open, threw the goods about, assaulted the shop assistants and the policemen. The assistants, three in number, ran away, deserting the store, and leaving the goods to the mercy of thieves. Inspector Birch, acting on behalf of the Government, has rendered us all the protection in his power.
 On the morning of the 5th January, the members of the Chamber of Commerce came over to our store, and reminded us that the time for packing up and going had already expired. We replied that matters were now altered. The promise to go was extracted from us by violence and not binding; further that there were sufficient police   in the town to protect us from the mob. The members of the Chamber of Commerce then left in a dissatisfied humour. The ringleaders of this raiding had been bound over to keep the peace towards us for three months in sureties of one and two hundred pounds.
 Two of them had been committed to the High Court for trial. We have resumed business as usual, but the Rhodesian merchants are now fighting the question of allowing Indian traders in Rhodesia.
 Their first step will be to bring the matter before the new Legislative Council of Rhodesia praying them to grant power to local bodies to refuse licences to “undesirables” (which is the term they apply to us). They have been guided in this line of action by the decision recently upheld by the Privy Council regarding the refusal of the licensingsing board of Newcastle, Natal, to grant a licence to an Indian. We understand your Congress have taken this in hand.
 In conclusion, we beg to inform you that, as the Europeans in South Africa in combination are fighting hard for our expulsion from this territory, we also desire to combine and fight for our rights as British subjects. We respectfully request you to give the matter your earnest consideration and take up our cause, and, in fact, that of the British Indian subjects in general.
 As we are allowed to trade freely in some parts of South Africa both under the Portuguese, French, German, and Dutch Governments, we cannot understand why we should be opposed in British territory, seeing that we are by right under the protection of the British flag.
 It appears also to us the Indian policy of Great Britain is directly opposed to the persecution of British Indian subjects.
 We have communicated with our English agents about this matter, and also with Lord Curzon, Viceroy of India. We are determined to have the matter brought before the British parliament, and we would pray for your assistance in fighting out this great question upon constitutional lines.

 "
80,"March 	20, 1899",THE PLAGUE PANIC IN SOUTH AFRICAlibtech_264_footnote,"
        DURBAN, 
  March 	20, [1899]  	The cup of woe of the Indians in South Africa evidently does not 	appear to have as yet become full; and the bubonic  plague promises 	to fill that cup well up to the brim. A rumour, now proved to    
 be false, that there was a plague case in Lourenco Marques, created quite a sensation in South Africa, and the various Governments of this continent began to adopt stringent measures applicable chiefly to the Indians. While this was going on, it was rumoured that an Indian who, after having been in Lourenco Marques for some time, had gone to a place called Middelburg in the Transvaal, had died of the bubonic plague. It was at once assumed that no period could be definitely assigned for incubation, and entire prohibition of Indian immigration was suggested. The Transvaal Government issued a proclamation prohibiting the entry of Indians into their country from even the neighbouring States, no matter whether the Indian desiring an entry was a very old resident of one of these States or whether he was a new arrival from India, unless he was armed with a permit from the State Secretary—a permit, it may be said, not easily obtainable by any and every Indian. Internal travelling, too, by the Indians was practically suspended. At the time of writing this, a telegram appearsin the newspapers, saying that the proclamation above referred to has been modified to the extent that the Indians would be allowed to enter the territory without a permit on their satisfying the officer at the border that they are not recent arrivals from Mauritius, Madagascar, or any of the infected districts of India.
 The medical gentleman who conducted the post mortem examination in the case above referred to had reported that the case was not one of the bubonic plague. Mischief, however, has been done, and there is a hysterical scare throughout South Africa. In Lourenco Marques, a most malarial district noted for insanitation and without any sanitary service, the regulations regarding the plague, it would appear. from the meagre news telegraphed from that place, are not only most stringent and unreasonable but oppressive and unbusinesslike. In the Transvaal, business amongst the Indians is suffering seriously. Several unfortunate hawkers came to Natal to buy their stuff; they are now most of them shut out. They have left their goods and their book debts behind them. As may be imagined, they cannot afford to obtain the permit; nor could they, without much difficulty, pass through the examination by the Transvaal officials. It is said—that is to say, the hawkers themselves complain—that in the Transvaal itself they are not allowed to hawk their goods about. This reacts upon the Indian firms that are dependent on these hawkers.
 The Cape Government do not appear to have lost their heads; but an agitation has been going on, calling upon the Government to
 prohibit any Indian from landing at any of the Cape ports. A few days ago, a meeting was held in Port Elizabeth, when speeches of a more or less violent character were made, some of the speakers going so far as to say, if the Government would not conform to the wishes of the people of Port Elizabeth, they would have to take the law in their own hands. The Natal Government are evidently anxious not to be carried away by the scare; but, it is feared, that they will not long be able to retain their self-possession.
 There are two conflicting interests at work in Natal. On the one hand, the farmers and the planters, who are, all over the Colony, entirely dependent on the indentured Indian labour, cannot afford to do without a continuous supply of such labour; on the other, the people in the towns and the cities, such as Durban and Maritzburg, having no such interests at stake, would gladly see the  entire prohibition of Indian immigration, indentured or otherwise. It is interesting to note that, throughout the whole controversy, the people of South Africa have not once allowed themselves to think of Indian interests. It seems to have been tacitly assumed that the Indians who are at present resident in South Africa need not be taken into consideration at all. It does not appear to have struck them that these men, some of them very well-to-do and respectable, may have to bring their wives and children or servants from India. People in India would be surprised to learn that a suggestion has been seriously made that the  Indians should  be  compelled to   live   on   mealie   (maize) meal, when the present stock of rice in the Colony is exhausted; and, as for other foodstuffs and the materials for dress imported from India, that, of course, is a mere detail. The Maritzburg Town Council has issued a circular addressed to the Indian storekeepers in that borough, informing them that they should begin to reduce their stock as they might, in view of the near approach of the plague, be called upon, each and all of them, to remove to a Location. Steamship companies, even the very best of them, entirely refuse to take Indian passengers for any of the South African ports. Several Indian merchants are suffering great inconvenience and undergoing terrible anxiety owing to members of their family or partners being in Lourenco Marques and yet not being allowed to come to Natal—not that Lourenco Marques has been declared to be an infected port, or that there is any plague there. Natal has used itself now to indirect and questionable methods of achieving its purpose, as witness its anti-Asiatic legislation, wherein an innocent person would fail to find
 
 the slightest mention of Indians. The same course has been adopted, so it would seem, with reference to the plague. No ship that brings an Indian is allowed pratique—by the Health Officer without reference to the Government—a procedure which of itself  necessitates  the detention of such a ship; although, it must be remembered, there may be no sickness on board, and the ship may have come from a clear port. Naturally (that is to say, in South Africa, for one would have thought that first-class steamship companies would not, through fear of vexatious quarantine, abandon their function; viz., the carrying of passengers from one place to another), therefore, the steamship companies refuse to take any Indian passengers. The Government have suspended indentured immigration for the time being, save as to those awaiting departure at Calcutta.
 As if all this was not sufficient, the Maritzburg people met in the Town Hall of that place a few days ago, when the Borough medical officer delivered a violent harangue in support of a drastic resolution. Owing to an agitation advocating an entire stoppage of the import of rice and other foodstuffs from India, the Government here asked the Indian Government whether rice was considered to be susceptible to infection. The Indian Government have replied in the negative. Dr. Allen, the officer in question, thus impeaches your Government:
 He supposed that they had all read the telegram which had been despatched to the Indian Government and the reply which had been received and published. He would like to ask them if they thought it likely that, if the Attorney-General had a prisoner in one of the Government gaols suffering under an accusation of some offence, that, the Attorney-General  would telegraph to him and say: ‘Are you guilty or not?’ He thought they would have no hesitation in saying what answer the gentleman in  the  gaol would telegraph back. He would say that the answer would be an emphatic ‘no’.   The
 Attorney-General would not apply the principle to his own trade.	He dared to
 apply it in this stupendous question, and to bring it forward as evidence that they were free from danger. The evidence was as worthless as it was in the case  of the prisoner.
 The foregoing suggests many sad reflections. It is beyond question that all this agitation [and] all this panic, have their source not in anentirely bonafide fear of the bubonic plague, but in the anti-Indian prejudice which is due chiefly to trade jealousy. That spirit Pervades the proceedings of the plague meeting in Maritzburg, more particularly, Dr. Allen’s speech. In his estimation, everything Indian is
 bad. He did not hesitate to impute corrupt motives to what he calls the “low officials” of the Indian Government. He said:
 But a very strange thing occurred in Bombay which it was important for them to remember, and this was that the number of deaths from dysentery and diarrhoea rose above the normal by 50,000. The Government of Bombay were well aware that those cases, or the greater number of them, were cases of plague, and that influential Indians were able to get the deaths which took place in their family registered by native practitioners under other heads so as to escape the visit of the sanitary officers. That kind of thing pervaded the whole of India. . . . The Commission proved clearly that the same thing was going on in Calcutta	That was known to the Government, but, chiefly
 because they feared a riot, they did not do it. . . The Indian Government absolutely could not depend upon its petty officers with regard to that plague. There was deceit right through the lower officers of the Indian Government as to where the plague was.
 If it is an Indian ship it must have a secret manifest. Infection, unlike everywhere else, is in South Africa personal to the Indian. He and his goods only can bring the infection. No objection is taken to other passengers, even though they may come from infected districts. The steamship companies that touch Madagascar and Mauritius, which are declared to be infected ports, may bring European passengers but dare not bring Indians. It must be admitted that the Natal Government, as well as the Cape Government, are most anxious to avoid injustice being done during the panic. But they are so afraid of the voters, to whom the present members owe their position, that unconsciously but nonetheless surely, much needless inconvenience is caused to Indians. Heaven spare us from an actual visitation of the plague; if it does come, the condition in which the poor Indians will find themselves is too dreadful to contemplate. It is at times like this that the deplorable omission on the part of Mr. Chamberlain to take any notice of the illegal proceedings of the Durban moblibtech_265_footnotein the beginning of   1897, when for twelve days practically the Government abdicated their function in favour of a mob, is felt. In a continent like this, where there are diverse and conflicting interests belonging to the various races, the strong and powerful influence of the Home Government is ever necessary. Once give latitude to a particular section of the various peoples, and you never know when an ebullition will take place. Already, as stated before, the Port Elizabeth people have threatened to
 
 
 take the law in their own hands should the Government refuse to bend their will to their own. Anonymous letters have been appearing in the newspapers in Durban advocating the same policy; and this bird’s-eye view of the history of the plague panic, which has by no means yet died out, may fittingly close with the following extract from the correspondence to The Natal Mercury which is, perhaps, a fair sample of the feeling of the man in the street in this part of the world:
 . . .If Government are timid and irresolute in action, let the people act for themselves, and go en masse again to the Point, and camp out there this time to stop all Asiatics from landing. We do not want them here at any price. Let the objectionable Indian immigration stop once and for ever; and I, for one, would join a crusade to make it too hot for those that are here.

 THE HONOURABLE THE COLONIAL SECRETARY PIETERMARITZBURG
  SIR,   The 	Indian community have noticed with satisfaction the 
  	removal of the fee of £l for visitors on embarkation passes under 	the Immigration Restrictions Act.  	I may state that before drafting the petition about this matter 	alluded to in the petition regarding the Dealers’ Licenses Act,libtech_266_footnoteI was asked to collect the opinions of the learned 	lawyers in the Colony and, in the event of a favourable opinion 	being received, to approach the Government again with a view to 	urging the removal of the rule in question and that the opinions so 	far received favour the view that the rule in question was illegal.  	I am to request you to bring the contents of this letter to the 	notice of the Right Honourable the Secretary of State for the. 	Colonies so as to inform him that the Government have graciously    
 removed the cause of complaint as to the £1 fee.
 
 
 I have the honour to be, Sir,

  THE 	RIGHT 	HONOURABLE 	JOSEPH 	CHAMBERLAIN 	HER 	MAJESTY’S 	PRINCIPAL 	SECRETARY 	OF STATE 	FOR THE COLONIES  THE 	MEMORIAL 	OF THE UNDERSIGNED 	REPRESENTING 	THE BRITISH 	INDIANS 	RESIDING 	IN THE SOUTH 	AFRICAN 	REPUBLIC  HUMBLY 	SHEWETH,  	That your Memorialists regret that they have again to trouble Her 	Majesty’s Government with reference to the unfortunate and 	embarrassing position in which the British Indians in  the  South 	African Republic are placed.  	On seeing the correspondence between the Government and Sir William 	Wedderburn,libtech_268_footnotea 	short while ago, your Memorialists had hoped that the trouble of the 	British Indians in the Transvaal was practically over, but the 	Notice of the Government of the South African Republic,     
 published in the Staats Courant dated 26th April, 1899 (copy of translation whereof is hereto attached), and which necessitates  a  further representation, soon followed to undeceive the British Indians residing in the Republic; and it would appear that this time the Republican Government intend seriously to enforce the Law 3 of 1885, as amended in 1886. There is a reference to the matter in the Presidential speech, too, delivered on the opening of the Volksraad.
 Your Memorialists venture to draw your attention to the fact that ever since the judgment in the matter of Tayob Haji Khan Mahomed vs. F. W. Reitz. N. O.,libtech_269_footnotethe Indian community in the   Republic  has known no rest. Several Notices were published with reference to the summary removal of the Indians to Locations. This has naturally dislocated their trade, and given rise to much uneasiness.
 Your Memorialists would sooner welcome a final settlement of what is to them a momentous issue than a painfully unsettled state. It is respectfully submitted that, apart from the question urged in the last memoriallibtech_270_footnotelibtech_271_footnoteas to the decision of the majority of the Court in the case above referred to, there are questions arising out of the Law and the Notice, the subject matter hereof, which would justify effective interference on the part of Her Majesty’s Government.
 Unlike, as in the previous Notices, the Transvaal Government have, in the present Notice, closely followed the Law 3 of 1885, with its amendment. The first part of the preamble of the Notice proceeds:
 Whereas Law 3 of 1885, Article 3 (d), gives the Government the right to point out for sanitary purposes certain streets, wards and Locations for habitation to persons belonging to one of the aboriginal races of Asia, including the so-called Coolies, Arabs, Malays, and Mahometan subjects of the Turkish Empire. . . .
Her Majesty’s Government have accepted the Law. The  Courts
 of the South African Republic have interpreted it to mean that the word habitation includes the dwelling place as well as the place of business. Thus far, therefore, your Memorialists have to submit to the inevitable. But they take the liberty to point out, as they have done before, that the Law gives the Government the power under certain conditions, and with respect to certain persons only. They should prove to the satisfaction of Her Majesty’s Government that sanitary
 
      supra.   
 reasons exist for the removal of the persons affected by the Law, and that those reasons, and those alone, guide their action before they could summarily remove such persons to Locations. It is further submitted that they should prove that your Memorialists are the persons referred to in the Law.
 Your Memorialists have endeavoured to show in the memoriallibtech_272_footnoteprinted in the Blue Book C. 7911, of 1895, pp. 35-44, that there are no sanitary grounds for the removal of the Indians to the Locations, and that the reasons for such removal are to be sought for, not in the alleged insanitary habits of the Indians, but in trade jealousy. Your Memorialists make no apology for reproducing the testimony then produced to controvert the charge of insanitation brought against the Indian community in the Republic. Dr. Veale, of Pretoria, who has a considerable practice among the Indians, stated in 1895:
 I have generally found them cleanly in their persons, and free from the personal diseases due to dirt or careless habits. Their dwellings are generally clean, and sanitation is willingly attended to by them. Class considered, I should be of opinion that the lowest class Indian lives better, and in better habitation, and with more regard to sanitary measures than the lowest class white. Generally, in my opinion, it is impossible to object to the Indian on
 sanitary grounds, provided always the inspection of the sanitary authorities is made as strictly and as regularly for the Indian as for the white.
 Dr. Spink, of Johannesburg, stated that the ‘residences of the bearers of this note’ were ‘in a sanitary and hygienic condition, and in fact suchas any European might inhabit,. Dr. Nahmmacher, of the same place, said:
 Having frequently occasion to visit the better class of the Indian population of Johannesburg (merchants &c., coming from Bombay) in my professional quality, I give as my opinion that they are as clean in their habits and domestic life as white people of the same standing.
Over thirty European firms of Johannesburg said:
 The aforementioned Indian merchants, the majority of whom come from Bombay, keep their business places as well as their residences in a clean ant proper sanitary state—in fact, just as good as the Europeans. That it is a distinct error in calling them coolies, or inhabitants of British India of a lower caste, as they decidedly belong to the better and higher caste of India.
What was true in 1895 is none the less so in 1899. Even at the
 
 time of the recent plague scare, so far as your Memorialists are aware, there was nothing of a serious nature to be found against them. It is not contended that there are, no Indians in the Transvaal over whom sanitary supervision is unnecessary; but your Memorialists do submit, without fear of contradiction, that a charge justifying the wholesale removal of Indians to a Location cannot be brought home to them. Your Memorialists submit that isolated cases of insanitation could be effectively dealt with under the sanitary regulations, and your Memorialists could have no objection to such regulations being made stricter, if necessary.
 Your Memorialists have always respectfully insisted that the Law does not apply to the better-class Indians from which class the traders are drawn, and against whom alone the whole agitation is, in fact, directed. Can it be too much to request Her Majesty’s Government to keep the Government of the South African Republic to the exact wording of the Law which applies to ‘aboriginal races of Asia, among whom are comprehended the so-called coolies, Arabs, Malays, and Mahomedan subjects of the Turkish Empire’? Your Memorialists respectfully but emphatically protest against the term ‘coolie’ being applied to them. They are certainly not Arabs, neither Malays, nor Mahomedan subjects of the Turkish Empire. They claim to be loyal, peaceful and humble subjects of Her Most Gracious Majesty the Queen-Empress, whose protection they seek in their struggle against prejudice and trade jealousy, which protection, they feel confident, will be extended to them. In your address to the Colonial Premiers, on the occasion of their visit to London in the year of the Diamond Jubilee, you were graciously pleased to refer to the Indians in most flattering terms. May your Memorialists hope for the practical application of the ideas therein expressed to the British Indians in the South African Republic? It will be a great Birthday honour for the British Indians in South Africa to have the insult implied in the above terms removed, and their status well defined in accordance with the letter and the spirit of the Gracious Proclamation of 1857.libtech_273_footnote
 The Government of the South African Republic have the ‘power for sanitary purposes of showing them (Coolies, Arabs, &c.,) fixed streets, wards, and Locations for habitation’, that is to say, in the respective townships, not the power to ‘force’ them, in the words of
 
 His Honour the late British Agent, ‘into a small Location on a spot used as a place to deposit the refuse of the town without any water except polluted soakage in the gully between the Location and the town’, which ‘must inevitably result in malignant fevers and other diseases breaking out amongst them, whereby their lives  and  the health of the community in the town would be endangered.’ Even if it were necessary to separate the Indian community from the European, it is difficult to understand why the former should be relegated to a place where they cannot trade, where there are no sanitary conveniences, and where there is no water supply. Your Memorialists respectfully submit that streets and wards could with equal facility be selected in a more convenient place in the townships themselves, if there were no other reasons than the sanitary.
 In conclusion, your Memorialists venture to draw your attention to the comparatively enormous interests that are at stake, and the ruin that would be caused, by the contemplated removal, to the Indian traders, and to lay the matter in the hands of Her  Majesty’s Government in the full hope that some definite and  satisfactory solution of the difficulty in which they are placed will be arrived at.
 And for this act of justice and mercy, your Memorialists, as in duty bound, shall for ever pray, &c., &c.

 APPENDIX
 THE NEW REGULATIONS
 PUBLISHED IN Staats Courant, APRIL 26, 1899
 Whereas Law 3 of 1885, Article 2 (d), gives the Government the right to point out, for sanitation purposes, certain streets, wards, and Locations for habitation (“ter bewoning”) to persons belonging to one of the Aboriginal races of Asia, including the so-called Coolies, Arabs, Malays, and Mahomedan subjects  of  the  Turkish Empire; whereas, according to the judgment of the High Court in the case of Tayob Hajee Khan Mahomed vs. F. W. Reitz, N. O., these places can be pointed out for business as well as residential purposes; whereas the Government has deemed fit to point out such streets, wards, and Locations for the said purposes, in, at, or adjoining the proclaimed established dorpen (villages) and standdorpen, and have the same surveyed and brought into order; whereas it is desirable for the proper control of the sanitary condition of the streets, wards, and Locations pointed out, as stated, that the same shall be placed under the local authority or board; so therefore I, Stephanus Johannes Paulus Kruger, State President of the South African Republic, with advice and consent of the Executive Council, by virtue of the Article 420 of its minutes of
 24th April, 1899, proclaim and stipulate as follows:
 The streets, wards, and Locations in, at, or adjoining the villages or standdorpen pointed out and surveyed as places of residence and business for the said persons, which do not form part of such villages or standdorpen, and which do not fall under the local authorities or board of management, shall, as from now, form part of such villages or standdorpen, and are placed under such authority or board, be it the local Landdrost, Mining Commissioner, Responsible Clerk, or any Town Council, or Town Board. God save “Land en Volk.”
 Given under my hand at the Government Office, Pretoria, this 25th April,
  1899.    S.J.P. 	KRUGER, 	STATE PRESIDENT  F. 	W. REITZ, 	STATE SECRETARY  The following Government Notice is likewise published, viz., reference to the 
  Government 	Notice of November 18, 1898, No. 621, published in the Staats 	Courant,  No. 	621, of November 23, 1898:  	“The 	following is additionally made known for general information:   Coolies, 		Arabs, and other 		Asiatic coloured persons, who 		do not 		yet live and do 		business in 		the streets, 		wards, and Locations 		pointed out for that 		purpose, but live 		and do 		business, in 		conflict with 		the law, 		in a 		village or 		standdorp, outside 		the streets, 		wards, and Locations 		pointed out, or 		at any other place not 		pointed out 		for this 		purpose, outside a 		village or 		standdorp, shall go 		and live, and 		do business, before 		July 1, 		1899, in 		the streets, 		wards, and Locations 		pointed out for that 		purpose, according 		to Law 		3 of 		1885, regarding 		Coolies, Arabs, and 		other Asiatics, 		and in 		particular Article 2, 		Section D, 		thereof, which, 		after amendment by 		the Volksraad 		besluit, Article 1, 		419 of 		August 12, 		1886, reads as 		follows, viz.: ‘The 		Government shall-have 		the right, 		for sanitation 		purposes, to 		point out 		for habitation (‘ter 		bewoning’) by 		them (that is, 		Coolies, Arabs, 		and other 		Asiatic coloured 		persons), fixed 		streets, wards, and 		Locations.’ This 		stipulation is 		not applicable 		to those 		who live 		on their 		masters’ premises.”  In 		terms of 		the above, 		Arabs and other 		Asiatics shall get a 		licence, after June 		30, 1899, 		only for a 		business in 		the streets, 		wards, and Locations 		pointed out according 		to law.  Coolies, 		Arabs, and 		other Asiatics, 		who now still 		do business 		outside the 		streets, wards, 		and Locations 		pointed out for that 		purpose, shall 		have to take 		out a 		licence therefor 		until June 30, 		1899, and 		after that date such 		licence will only be 		granted them 		for carrying 		on business 		in streets, 		wards, and 		Locations pointed out 		according to law.  Hawkers’ 		licences can be 		issued to 		Coolies and 		other Asiatics and 		coloured persons who live in the streets, wards, and Locations pointed out for that purpose for  
 the quarter ending June 30, 1899.
  Coolies, 	Arabs, and other 	Asiatics who live 	and do business 	at places 	outside a village 	or standdorp, 	are given 	time until 	July 1, 	1899, to 	remove their dwelling and 	business to the 	streets, wards, and 	Locations pointed out, 	in terms 	of the 	law.

83,"May 	17, 1899",83. INDIANS IN THE TRANSVAALlibtech_274_footnote,"
 
 
 DURBAN,
  May 	17, [1899]  	I propose in this letter to give a bird’s-eye view of the series 	of blunders committed by one Colonial Secretary after another in Her 	Majesty’s name, whereby inch by inch they gave up the case of the 	British Indians in the South African Republic, and which have now 	culminated in a pompous notice issued by the Government of that 	Republic, calling upon the Indians, on pain of being deprived of 	their licenses, to remove to Locations which have been described by 	the eminent writer of the series of articles headed “Indian 	Affairs” in The Times (London) as “Jewish ghettoes”, 	and by one of Her Majesty’s British Agents in Pretoria as a spot 	used as a place to deposit the refuse of the town, without any water 	except the polluted soakage in the gully between the Location and 	the town.” In the course of a single newspaper article I must be 	brief, and cannot afford, in a rapid survey of the situation, to 	give lengthy quotations. For the edification of. the curious and 	those who would care to learn the full history of the question, I 	must refer them to a Blue book, published in 1895, on the question 	(Papers relating to the Grievances of Her  Majesty’s Indian 	subjects in the South African Republic—C. 7911, 1895), and two 	Green Books of the Transvaal Government published in the year 1894, 	from which and other recent literature I have extracted the 	following summary:  	As early as 1884, when the presence of a respectable number of 	Indian traders in the Republic attracted general notice, and  their 	success the jealousy of their European rivals, the Transvaal 	Government, yielding to the outcry of a few interested merchants who 	thought nothing, in order to gain their end, of making what may 	fairly be called deliberate misrepresentations about the docile  	Indians’  habits and morals (as witness the following quotations 	from a libellous petition presented by the Europeans to the Orange 	Free State Volksraad, and sent approvingly to the Transvaal 	Volksraad by the Pretoria Chamber of Commerce: “The dangers to 	which the whole community is exposed by the spread of leprosy, 	syphilis and the like loathsome diseases engendered by filthy habits 	and immoral practices of these people. As these men enter the State 	without wives or  	female relatives, the result is obvious. Their religion teaches them 	to    
 consider all women as soul-less, and Christians as natural prey.”) proposed to enact severe laws with a view to drive the Indians out of the Transvaal by imposing a poll-tax of £25 on each new arrival, and by compelling those that would live under such conditions and the old residents to reside and trade in Locations which, in plain terms would mean denying them the right of trading. The London Convention of 1884 which, owing to other causes, has now come into such prominence, however, stared the Government in the face. This Convention protects the rights as to trading, &c., of all other than natives of South Africa. Nothing daunted, by. a reasoning worthy of the Boer Government, they proposed to include the Indians in the term—Natives. This, however, was too much, even for the obliging
 High Commissioner, Sir Hercules Robinson, who let them understand that the British Indians could not be included in the term “natives of South Africa”. But (and here mark the first blunder) without going into the allegations against the Indians  that  were brought to his notice, he was prepared to advise Her Majesty’s Government to agree to such an amendment of the Convention as would enable the Boer Government to pass anti-Indian legislation. Lord Derby, however, knew better, and instead of adopting that suggestion, he was prepared to let the Transvaal Government pass the laws in the interests of public health, provided that the £25 were reduced to £3, and that a clause was added stating that, for sanitary reasons, the Indians could be made to reside in Locations. Thus, he, too, instead of examining the allegations, took what the Transvaal authorities said for granted, and bartered away with a light heart the vested rights of the Indians, all the while remaining under the delusion created by one of the High Commissioner’s. despatches, that the law, as it applied to the so-called coolies, &c., would leave the respectable Indian merchants untouched.
 No sooner, however, was the law passed, than the Colonial Office was undeceived. The very persons who it was thought were left out, were called upon to remove to Locations, and found themselves deprived of their right to own landed property, travel first or second class on the railways, and generally classed among the raw Zulus. It did not strike either the High Commissioner or the authorities in Downing Street to secure a promise from the Transvaal Government to leave those people untouched. Their mental reservation at the time of assenting to the legislation could not, and that quite naturally, bind the Republican Government. A series of negotiations took place
 
 between the Indians and the British Agent on the one hand, and the High Commissioner and the Transvaal Government on the other, the former trying, it must be said, though in a half-hearted manner, to regain the lost ground. All along, however, the Transvaal Government very naturally have scored heavily. Lord Ripon came to the helm when the thing was one mass of confusion, and he  suggested arbitration as to the interpretation of the laws. Unfortunately, however, even then the real question was left untouched. The submission was, so those who are qualified to judge say, loosely drawn, and a gentleman, however estimable in other respects, but with a great bias against the Indians, was selected as the arbitrator, viz., the Chief Justice of the Orange Free State. It may be here parenthetically remarked that this arbitration has been used by President Kruger as a precedent for having other questions of dispute between the two Governments referred to arbitration, and it must have  caused  Mr. Chamberlain many an anxious half-hour in order to get rid of the dilemma. The arbitrator sat, and he too would not discuss the question whether there were any grounds for the charge of wholesale insanitation against the Indians. Armed as he was with the widest powers, he made liberal use of them, and delivered an awardlibtech_275_footnotelibtech_276_footnotewhich left the Indians entirety where they were. He was asked, regard being had to the despatches that had passed between the two Governments—despatches which could not possibly be considered by a judicial tribunal, but which could very properly be considered by him—to interpret the laws, and to say to whom they applied and what was the meaning of the word “habitation”. (If the last question put to the arbitrator excites a smile in Bombay, my answer is, South Africa is not Bombay.)  The arbitrator, however, learned lawyer though he was, did nothing of the kind, but delegated his function to the Transvaal Courts, that is to say, he decided that the interpretation of the laws could only be given by those Courts.
 As soon as the precious award was published, the Indians approached the Colonial Secretary, and besought him not to accept the award, and protested that they were allowed to have no voice in all these proceedings—not even as to the selection of an arbitrator. To a lay mind it would appear that there would have been absolutely nothing wrong in Mr. Chamberlain insisting upon the  arbitrator  giving his interpretations of the laws in view of the despatches. The
 
 Indians produced voluminous evidence to prove that the assent to the laws was obtained under misrepresentations; that the charge of insanitation was groundless, three medical gentlemen of standing in the Transvaal certifying that the Indians lived as well as the Europeans and one of them going so far as to say that, class considered, they lived better and in better habitations than the Europeans, and that the real reason which was all along suppressed was trade jealousy. This resulted in extorting from Mr. Chamberlain the certificate that the Indians were a “peaceable”, law-abiding, and meritorious body of persons, with their undoubted industry and intelligence, and their indomitable perseverance. But the certificate is one thing, and relief is quite another. The Test Caselibtech_277_footnotelibtech_278_footnotethat was tried last year is still fresh in the public mind. As will be recollected, it resulted in the interpretation of the laws which was forestalled by the memorial of the Indians above referred to, that is to say, in the opinion of the Judges of the High Court of Pretoria the phrase “for the purposes of habitation” means “for the purposes of dwelling and business”. The last ray of hope, therefore, that was left for the unfortunate Indians in the Transvaal disappeared with this last act of the tragedy. Notices after notices have been issued by the Transvaal Government threatening to remove the Indians to Locations. This has disorganised their trade, unsettled their minds, and they are resting on the edge of a sword.  The correspondence between the Colonial Secretary and Sir William Wedderburn, early this year, came as a bright spark in the darkness. But, alas! It was only a spark, for the pompous notice above referred to has again created a panic, and the poor people do not know where they are and what to do. The notice is supposed to be a final notice— it reads more like an old-fashioned legal document with many whereas-es and contains copious references to the anti-Indian laws passed, and calls upon “the aboriginal races of Asia, among whom are included the so-called coolies, Arabs, Malays, and Mahomedan subjects of the Turkish Empire”, to remove to Locations on or before the 1st of July, provided, however, that the Government might — (observe the vagueness when it is a matter of granting a concession)
— allow those holding long leases to live out the term of their leases
in their present places of business.
 Such is the awkward position that awaits Her Majesty’s Indian subjects in the South African Republic, whose only fault is that they
 
 are frugal, industrious, abstemious, and fond of earning a livelihood by honest means. They have made a desperate effort and sent again a representation to Mr. Chamberlainlibtech_279_footnotelibtech_280_footnoteasking him to present them with a Birthday honour in the shape of a clear definition of their status in that gold-producing country. We all await anxiously the result of the representation. In justice to the indefatigable Colonial Secretary, it must be confessed that he has only inherited the errors of his predecessors, and there is no doubt that he is doing what he considers to be his best to regain the lost ground. May he succeed in his efforts is the prayer of every Indian in South Africa.

84,"May 	18, 1899",LETTER TO COLONIAL SECRETARY,"
          MR. 	C. BIRD     14 MERCURY LANE,  DURBAN,  May 	18, 1899 
  THE 	HONOURABLE 	THE 	COLONIAL 	SECRETARY 	PIETERMARITZBURG  SIR,  	With some diffidence I venture to draw your attention hereby to some 	aspects of the Bill to amend Indian Immigration  Law,  now before 	the Legislative Assembly.  	I understand the Bill has been drafted in reply to the complaint of 	the Indian Immigration Trust Board as to the alleged frequency of 	the complaints made by the indentured Indians, which are said to be 	used as a pretext by the complainants to leave their work. The 	Bill proposes to remedy the alleged evil—   by 		making it 		lawful for 		the Protector, the 		Assistant Protector 		or any Magistrate 		to cause 		any complainant 		to be sent 		back after he has 		lodged his complaint;  by 		authorising the 		employer under 		certain circumstances 		to deduct 		the expenses 		of the 		safe return of 		the complainant;  by 		making the 		complainant under 		those certain 		circumstances liable to be punished as if he was illegally absent.   	With deference, it is submitted that this Bill would render more 	difficult the precarious position of men serving under indentured    
 labour which has been acknowledged, by the Imperial Government, to be a necessary evil and, by those best acquainted with such form of labour, to be “semi-slavery” or “a state perilously near to slavery”.
 In my humble opinion, the existing law coupled with the decision of the Supreme Court in the matter of Ramsamy and the Protector of Indian Immigrants is sufficient to meet the requirements of the employers, if it does not, indeed, act as a deterrent even against bona fide complaints. No law will be, can be, sufficient for those who would not work and would rather ‘rot’ in the gaol than do honest work. If, however, the Government consider it necessary to conciliate the employers and make the existing law more explicit, I feel that nothing need be said from the Indian standpoint against the proposed amendment so far as the first two alterations are concerned. But I venture to submit that the last clause, viz., the power to charge a complainant with illegal absence when, rightly or wrongly, he fancies he can leave his work with immunity in order to make a complaint, is uncalled for and is calculated to interfere with the right, reserved  under the Law 25 of 1891, to leave his work for the sake ofmaking his complaint. An Indian may fancy that he has a wrong to be redressed in that he does not get ghee instead of oil. The complaint would, in all probability, be treated as frivolous by a Magistrate or Protector; nonetheless, I hardly think the frivolity is so great as to turn him from complainant into defendant. I submit that every facility should be given to a man, who honestly believes that he has a complaint, to make it, and this the proposed amendment does not do, unless a legal and logical mind is to be attributed to an average indentured Indian.
 The safeguards provided against frivolous complaints, it is submitted, are sufficiently severe without the addition of the penalty clause. The deduction of wages is perhaps more painful for an indentured Indian than imprisonment.
 The fact that the Bill, if I read it rightly, is an enabling Bill, does not, in my humble opinion, in any way weaken the above argument. I have some little experience of the working of the present law. The manner in which these trials take place does not always favour the complainants and the Magistrates, being unable to wade through a maze of exaggeration, are often obliged to set down complaints as “vexatious and frivolous” though they may be perfectly true.
 The remedy, if I may suggest one, and if, indeed, it is necessary, is to be found in a speedy settlement of such complaints. An Act to
 give these complaints a preference to be heard before all others, and enabling the prosecutor to bring these cases up on the shortest notice, and perhaps compelling other work from such men, while away from their estates, so as to discourage idleness, would meet the evil if it does exist to any great extent, without curtailing the liberty of the persons affected, or without rendering it next to impossible for them to complain.
 I beg to be excused for the lengthy argument; as I know the Government are anxious to do justice between man and man and to hear both sides of the case, I thought I would be failing in my duty if  I did not place before the Government the view that the Indians have taken of it. The employers of labour from the very nature of their position can take only one view of the question. The free Indians, being the kith and kin of the indentured Indians and not being employers, may be allowed to take a dispassionate view.
 Under the circumstances, may I venture to hope that the Government would be graciously pleased to take out the clause complained of or so alter it as not to deprive the indentured Indian practically of his right of complaint.libtech_281_footnote

         DURBAN, 
    THE 	RIGHT 	HONOURABLE 	JOSEPH 	CHAMBERLAIN 	HER  	MAJESTY’S 	 PRINCIPAL 	 SECRETARY 	 OF STATE 	FOR THE COLONIES  [Prior 	to May 27,] 	1899 
  THE 	PETITION 	OF THE UNDERSIGNED JOHN 	FRAZER 	PARKER,  OF 	PRETORIA, 	IN THE SOUTH 	AFRICAN 	REPUBLIC, 	GENTLEMAN HUMBLY SHEWETH: That 	your Petitioner is a natural-born British subject residing in Pretoria 	in the South African Republic.  	Your Petitioner owns considerable freehold as well as leasehold 	property in the Transvaal. Your 	Petitioner has carefully read the latest notice issued by the     
 Transvaal Government requiring the Indians and other Coloured people to remove to Locations on or before the 1st of July, 1899. The notice, however, states that the Government might deal leniently with those who hold long leases.
 Your Petitioner owns ten cottages built on his own freehold property in the town of Pretoria, which he has let to (ten) Cape Coloured persons, commonly known as “Cape boys”, whereby your Petitioner receives per month a sum of twenty pounds (£20) as rent.
 Your Petitioner has a lease of property in a street called Prinsloo Street in Pretoria the term whereof has yet to run for 8_ years. Your Petitioner has, as is common in the Transvaal, as well as in other parts of South Africa, built wood and galvanised iron buildings on the leasehold valued at over £4,500.
 The above-mentioned leasehold is occupied entirely by British Indian tenants and the value of their tenancy to your Petitioner according to the present rental, apart from this freehold property, would amount to the sum of £19,380 during the unexpired period of the term.
 Your Petitioner apprehends that, if the notice is allowed to affect the present Indian traders in the Transvaal or their successors in business, it would involve a great loss to your Petitioner, and is likely to deprive your Petitioner of the chief source of his income.
 Your Petitioner, relying fully on the 14th article of the London Convention, always held the belief that the position of these British subjects was unassailable, and your Petitioner’s sense of justice, seeing that the Indians were British subjects as much as any other persons, refused to believe that, in spite of the arbitrationlibtech_284_footnoteand the recent Test Caselibtech_285_footnoteregarding  the  status  of  British  Indians  in  the  Transvaal,  the position of the Indians already settled could or would be disturbed.
 Your Petitioner’s own experience of the Indians in the Transvaal is very happy. Your Petitioner believes them to be his best tenants, who have always paid the rents regularly and without demur. In your Petitioner’s opinion, they are unobtrusive, docile and extremely well-behaved. They are law-abiding and always willing and ready to conform to the laws of the country which they may go to. Their habits are cleanly and they keep their stores and dwelling-places clean and
 
 neat. Their courtyards will compare favourably with those of many Europeans. Their sobriety i.e., of the trading class, is proverbial. In your Petitioner’s opinion, the charges of immorality and uncleanliness one so often notices in the papers made by ignorant and, for most part, anonymous, writers are grossly unfair to them. The patience with which they have put up with the constant “nagging” they have been subjected to for the last ten years is or would appear to a Britisher to be simply marvellous.
 The Cape Coloured people who, too, are affected by the notice, are your Petitioner’s equally valuable tenants. They are cabmen or cigar makers, &c., and have adopted the  European  habits  and customs.
 In your Petitioner’s humble opinion, it is the fact of a person being a British subject that renders such a person liable to disabilities in the Transvaal which he could not otherwise be subjected to. The Indian subjects of the King of Portugal are free to hold licenses and to enjoy the rights commonly enjoyed by the other residents of the Transvaal.
 Your Petitioner submits that, so far as Pretoria is concerned, as it is, the bulk of the Indians are already separated from the Europeans, only not so as to ruin their trade or to subject them to indignity, as is sure to happen if they are relegated to a Location. The  business section of Prinsloo Street, which runs across the middle of Church Street, the principal street of Pretoria, is almost entirely inhabited by Indian traders. Here the Government could exercise any control they chose in the interests of sanitation, if it was merely a question of separating the Indians from the Europeans and  bringing  them together in one place with the object of more supervision. The few Indian merchants that are to be found in Church Street have such large businesses and keep their stores and courtyards in such good condition that, in your Petitioner’s humble opinion, to disturb them would be wanton injustice as, indeed, it would be in all the other cases, only the effect would not be so disastrous as in the cases  of  the Church Street merchants, whose long-standing businesses have given the positions they occupy considerable trade value.
 Your Petitioner has seen the Location intended to be used by the Indians. It would place them, who are undoubtedly infinitely superior to the Kaffirs, in close proximity to the latter. A sluit, which receives the filth and the dirt from the cantonment, which lies some distance
 
 upwards, separates the Location from the Town. It is situated in an out-of-the-way corner relieved by nothing less than the refuse of the Town, which is deposited nearby and is absolutely unprotected against storms, which are by no means uncommon. As a man of business your Petitioner can say that the place is absolutely unfit for trade, it being frequented neither by Europeans nor the large stream of Kaffirs continually passing through Pretoria who form these unfortunate people’s chief customers. It is needless to say there is no effective arrangement for the removal of nightsoil nor a water supply except the filthy and polluted water from the sluit.
 Your Petitioner has thought it necessary to mention these facts in order to show that, in asking Her Majesty’s Government to protect his interests, he asks for nothing that would be inimical to the interests of the general population of Pretoria. For, your Petitioner is free to admit that, if even a fourth of the charges brought against the unfortunate Indian traders were true, your Petitioner’s interests would have to give way before those of the social body at large. Your Petitioner may incidentally mention that there are other natural-born British subjects placed more or less in the same position that he is placed in.
 The fact that the Government have expressed their willingness to leniently consider the question of the Indians holding long leases, does not affect the position herein taken up by your Petitioner, who can ill-afford to give these merchants very long leases for the simple reason that they would mean a much lower rent than what your Petitioner is able to obtain for shorter terms.
 Your Petitioner has had on several occasions an interview with His Honour the British Agent, who was gracious enough to give to your Petitioner such information and advice as he could give. A time, however, your Petitioner humbly submits, has now arrived for a more formal and fuller representation, and your Petitioner  respectfully  prays that the matter would receive the consideration it deserves and for this act of justice and mercy your Petitioner shall, as in duty bound, for ever pray, &c., &c.,

DURBAN,
 
         SIR,  14, MERCURY LANE,  May 	27, 1899    	I  venture to  enclose herewith a  copy of  the Memorial of the 
  	British Indians in the Transvaal with reference to their position in 	virtue of the latest notice issued by the Transvaal Government, 	requiring the Indians in that country to remove to Locations on or 	before the 1st July this year.  	It will be seen from the notice that the Government propose to 	remove the Indians to Locations for the purposes of sanitation. 	Would it, then, be unreasonable to ask the Colonial Secretary to see 	that the sanitary reasons do exist before the Indians are removed to 	Locations? The petition furnishes, in my humble opinion, ample proof 	to show that there can be no sanitary reasons for the measures 	proposed to be adopted by the Government.  	The grievances of the Uitlanders which have attracted world-wide 	attention and which nowadays fill up columns of the leading 	newspapers are, it is submitted, insignificant compared tothose of 	the British Indians in the Transvaal as well as other parts of South 	Africa. Will it, then, be asking too much of the sympathisers in 	England and the Indian public to give this very important matter 	(important because it affects the future of the whole of India so 	far as emigration outside India is concerned) their best attention?  	The petition referred to in this letter is in the hands of the 	British Agent in Pretoria, but pending the result of the Conference 	between the High Commissioner and the President of the Republic at 	which the Indian question will also be discussed, the despatch of 	the petition to Mr. Chamberlain has been delayed. It may not even be 	sent to him. But as time is of utmost importance in this matter, it 	was considered prudent to send the petition lest the negotiations 	referred to above might prove abortive.  	A copy of the petition by Mr. Parker, of Pretoria, a natural-born 	British subject, with reference to the same matter, is also sent 	herewith.    
 It may throw a great deal of light on the question.

 The following is a press report of Gandhiji’s speech and the address read by him on the occasion of the presentation of a souvenir to Mr. G. M. Rudolph,  a retiring magistrate of Ladysmith, by the Indians of the town.
 [July 5, 1899]
 Mr. M. K. Gandhi said it gave him the greatest pleasure to be called upon by his countrymen in Ladysmith to take part in this function. It was a privilege and an honour. Since the presentation by the Court officials a healthy jealousy had arisen among Ladysmith Indians, who, through Mr. Vinden, instructed him to see that. the present address and souvenir were in no way inferior to those already presented. The execution of the address wax left in the hands of Mr. Singleton, who executed eight out of every twelve addresses in the Colony, and selection of the souvenir with Mr. Ferguson, who assured him that the centrepiece was a unique piece of good workmanship. He mentioned this to show the gratitude and affection of Ladysmith Indians towards His Worship. When he was lately there his countrymen vied with one another in telling him of His Worship’s stern impartiality, loving kindness, and gentle disposition, and herein they now found expression to their sentiments on His Worship’s retirement. The lamp of gratitude and affection in the Indian heart was ever ready to respond to the spark of sympathy, of which they had in abundance from His Worship, and it was a matter of pride that he was associated with that happy event. He then read the following address:
 SIR,
 We, the undersigned, representing the British Indian residents of Ladysmith, hereby venture to place on record our deep sense of gratitude, on this the eve of your retirement from active service in the Colony, for the impartiality with which you have administered justice during your tenure of office in Ladysmith. We have noticed with joy that the people of the Colony, through the local Parliament, have decided to recognise your long record of exceptionally useful service by granting you full pension. Whilst we rejoice that you are about to enjoy well-earned rest, we cannot cherish the prospect from a selfish point of view without sorrow. Your kindness towards the litigants, the patience with which Your Worship endeavoured to master the essence of cases that came before you, and the even-handed justice that was dealt to all, without fear, favour or prejudice, have endeared you to the
 Indian community, and have added lustre to the British Constitution, so worthily represented by you for so long in Ladysmith. We beg that you would be pleased to accept the accompanying souvenir as a token of the esteem of the Indian community of this town for Your Worship. With respectful wishes for a long, happy and peaceful life, and with prayers to the Almighty that He may fulfil our wishes,
        The 	Natal Mercury, 7-7-1899  We 	are, &c.,  AMOD 	MOOSAJIE 	OMAR 	AND OTHERS "
92,"July 	6, 1899",LETTER TO COLONIAL SECRETARY,"
       14, MERCURY LANE,  DURBAN  July 	6, 1899  TO  THE 	HONOURABLE 	THE 	COLONIAL 	SECRETARY 	PIETERMARITZBURG  SIR,  	With further reference to your letter dated the 13th ultimo, in view 	of the correspondence that is going on between the Imperial and the 	local Governments, it may not be amiss to show how far the fears 	expressed in the “Dealers’ Licenses Memorial” have been 	realised. I have not been able to collect accurate information from 	all the places, but so far as the information has been received, it 	is of an extremelydiscouraging nature.  	In Dundee, the licenses were first refused and on an appeal they 	were granted under certain qualifications endorsed on the back of 	the licenses, viz., “This license is granted upon the distinct 	understanding that it will not be renewed in the present buildings. 	By order of the Board. (Sd.) Fras. J. Birkett, Licensing Officer and 	Town Clerk”. In answer to an enquiry, several of the license 	holders said that they thought the licenses were so granted because 	their stores were wood and iron buildings. It appears Messrs Handley 	& Sons and Harvey Greenacre & Co. in Dundee have a brick 	front but the rest of their stores is wood-and-iron. Messrs Taylor & 	Fowler, merchants of Dundee, have their store entirely of wood and 	iron. In Newcastle the licenses refused last year have been refused 	this year also. The Town 
 Council were good enough to give some time to two of the applicants in order to enable them to sell off their stock, but this could hardly act as a remedy against the loss occasioned to the parties concerned. One of them, Abdool Rassool, had a large business and owned a wood and iron store. It was pointed out to the Council that the building which represented to him a value of £150 would fetch practically nothing if it had to be sold.
 In Verulam, I understand, two applicants who held a license last year have been refused their licenses this year and the men as well as their servants are now comparatively reduced to poverty.
 In Ladysmith, one M. C. Amla, who has been trading there for several years, has been deprived of his license on the ground that the place where he was trading was situated in the chief street of the Township and that it was suitable only for a European trader. The owner applied for a license with reference to another building immediately near an Indian store and owned by the owner of that store. That application, too, has been refused on the same ground. I might be permitted to mention that there are other Indian stores in the same street.
 In Port Shepstone, two large Indian merchants have lately sold their businesses to two other Indians. These applied for licenses and the Licensing Officer refused them. An appeal was taken to the Licensing Board with no better result, and the parties are now considering what to do.
 It is humbly submitted that it is a serious matter when one man, because he is an Indian, cannot sell his business to another, also because that other is an Indian, for the refusal to grant the license in such cases is tantamount to forbidding a purchase and sale unless it were done in an underhand manner.
 An Indian, who had sold out his premises to the Dundee Coal Co. and had therefore entirely wound up his business, came down to Durban and purchased a previously licensed store on the Umgeni Road and applied for a license for himself. The Licensing Officer, after the man had made several applications and after he had gone to the expense of engaging aneminent counsel in Durban at a heavy cost, granted the licenseand then only for a limited period in order to enable the applicant to sell out the goods he had already bought in anticipation of receiving a license.
These are some of the cases where vested interests have been
 prejudicially affected. But cases where thoroughly good men with capital have been refused licenses because they were Indians who did not hold a license to trade the previous year are too numerous to mention.
 The Indians have noticed with satisfaction and gratitude the fact that the Government are anxious to see that the vested Indian interests are not injured, in that they have addressed letters to the several Town Councils and Town Boards to the effect that unless they took care not to touch vested interests, legislation giving Indians right of appeal to the Supreme Court might become necessary. I am, however, to point out that such an appeal to the Boards may not have a permanent effect, if at all, and would still leave the Indian traders in a state of dreadful suspense. The alteration suggested by the letter  above referred to would indeed, in my humble opinion, be only a small measure of justice, but extremely desirable in the interests of  the Indian community, already settled in the Colony.
 I am to request that the contents of this letter may be communicated to the Right Honourable the Secretary of State for the Colonies.
 I have etc.,

 "
93,"July 12, 1899",THE INDIAN QUESTION IN SOUTH AFRICAlibtech_287_footnote,"
  
 DURBAN,
 July 12, [1899]
 I dealt in my last letterlibtech_288_footnotelibtech_289_footnotewith the Indian question as it stands in the now greatly agitated South African Republic, which is the centre of attraction to the whole world. I dealt with the plague panic in South Africa in my first letter.libtech_290_footnotelibtech_291_footnoteI propose now to discuss a   phase  of  the Indian question in Natal, as affecting the education of the Indian children, which would show how far prejudice has been allowed to go.
At present there are about twenty-five schools expressly meant
 
 for the education of the children of indentured Indians, attended by nearly 2,000 pupils. Most of these schools are managed by the missionaries, chiefly representing the Church of England Mission, superintended, as to its Indian section, by the Rev. Dr. Booth, a venerable gentleman very much loved by the Christian portion of the Indian community. These schools receive from the Government a grant by no means adequate for their support. The buildings, as a rule, are of the most primitive type—a few corrugated iron sheets and a few planks of wood composing the material. They are wretchedly constructed and, in country places, are devoid even  of  flooring, mother earth serving the purpose. In one instance, a stable has been turned into a school. The pupils, being drawn from the poorest  Indians, are naturally not well clad. The tuition imparted is in keeping with the surroundings, the schoolmaster drawing from £2 to £4 a month—in some instances more. The cost of living—I mean decent living—for a person occupying such a position would be, in the case of a careful bachelor, not less than £8. Labour for an Indian affords a better opportunity than the vocation of a teacher; naturally, therefore, the teachers are of a very poor type, though under the circumstances they do their best. The respectable portion, then, of the Indian community, such as clerks, interpreters, storekeepers and others, do not care to send their children to these schools. Hitherto, such as would pay the high fees that are levied here have been able, though by no means without much difficulty, to enter the general public primary schools. An agitation was started some few years ago to prevent any Indian children from gaining entrance into public schools unless they had exhausted the resources of their own schools; and thus an attempt was made to foist the above described Indian schools for the poorest children on the respectable Indians. Since then the difficulties in the way of respectable Indian parents sending their children to the Government schools have been increasing. Now, it is the headmaster who would put difficulties in their way, and now it is the Government. Latterly, very few Indian children, hardly half a dozen, have been able to enter the public primary schools, and that  after  undergoing immense difficulties.
 The present Government, however, have made a big bid for popularity, and have declared their intention of entirely shutting these schools against the Indian children. There is a humorous, if it were not painful, side to this eruption of racial feeling. If an Indian parent has six children, of whom five have received their education in the
 primary schools, he cannot now give the same education to the last child. If there is a parent ready to disown his Indian nationality, he can send his child to the public schools, thus, unfortunately for the Government, crushing their argument to the effect that the admission of the Coloured children leads to ill-feeling and uproar. A child born of prostitution, where one parent is European, is admissible. It is the full-blooded Indian alone who has the ban of excommunication stamped upon him. The Government seem to have shrunk from their own unjust action, and as a sop to their conscience and in order to satisfy the claim of some of the Indian applicants for the admission of their children to the public primary schools, have opened what they are pleased to call a higher grade school for Indian children, which is supposed to be, in all respects, equal to the above schools. The applicants can hardly be said to have been satisfied; and while the higher grade school is undoubtedly far superior to the wretched tin shanties referred to Above, and is manned by a staff of European it can in no way be said to be equal to the other primary schools in every respect. This school by no means provides for all standards as yet, and the girls are entirely overlooked. Even if it were accepted as a compromise, it leaves many requirements yet unsatisfied. There is absolutely no provision for the Indians to go beyond the three R’s! All attempts to gain admission into the high schools of the Colony have so far failed, the Government absolutely declining to entertain any such application.
 The prospect is indeed very gloomy, unless aid comes in time from Downing Street or Fort William. It is impossible to withhold one’s sympathy from parents who are ready to give their  whole fortune for a thorough training to their children, and yet who are simply unable to do so owing to the Government restrictions. One Mr. Godfrey, a respected Indian Mission schoolmaster, is a case in point. Though his own education is not very liberal, he is most anxious to bring up his children in the best possible way. All his children but one have been educated in the Government schools. He sent his eldest son to Calcutta, gave him a University training there, and has now sent him to Glasgow to study medicine. His second son is the first Indian to have passed the competitive examination for the Civil Service of the Colony. He is unable to send his youngest daughter to  the  Government Primacy School and, in spite of his efforts, was prevented from getting his third son, a promising youth, admitted to the Durban High School. It may be stated that this family has been living in the
 European style. All the children have been brought up from their infancy to speak English, and naturally they speak it very well. Why this child should be shut out when all is other children have been allowed to enter the Government School passes comprehension. This instance shows, more vividly than anything else could, how difficult the position of the Indians inferior to Mr. Godfrey must be.
 The Natal Parliament, dubbed by Mr. Rhodeslibtech_292_footnotelibtech_293_footnote“the parochial assembly” in South Africa, is now sitting, and the Attorney-General who is also Minister of Education and who is supposed to be a gentleman with a conscience, and who is undoubtedly an otherwise esteemed gentleman, has been telling the inquisitive members of the Natal Parliament that his Government have been the first to close the doors of the Government schools against the Indians. Therefore, a simple appeal to him to do justice by, at any rate, leaving the Government schools free to the children of those parents that have hitherto been allowed to educate their children there, has absolutely no effect, and all for the sake of a few miserable votes—for that is what is at the bottom of all this unrighteous and unreasoning opposition to the Indians. The ministers do not—dare not—do what is right, lest their doing so may jeopardise their position at the next general election. When responsible Government was granted to Natal, those who clamoured for it were loud in their protestations that full justice would be done to those who did not possess the franchise. After the Colony became a self-governing Colony, Sir John Robinson, the first Prime Minister under the new form of Government, in introducing the Indian Disfranchising Bill, said that the Colony—that is to say, in his estimation, the Europeans—were fully aware of the increased responsibilities that naturally went with the  increased freedom they enjoyed, and their still further increased responsibilities in that they were depriving the Indians of the franchise they possessed. The unfortunate Indians, it would appear, almost prophetically said that talk of that description was meant for consumption in the Colonial Office in Downing Street, and that it deceived nobody in Natal. They said that the disfranchisement was merely the thin end of the wedge and that, if the Home Government yielded to the pressure from the Natal Government,  it  would practically mean ruin for the Indians. All this has come only too true. The poor Indians have known no rest since responsible Government
 
 
 has been granted. One after another, the elementary rights of British citizenship have been snatched away from them; and, if Mr. Chamberlain and Lord Curzon are not wide awake, the British Indians in Natal will, one of these days, find themselves stripped of all that they have been taught to believe they possess as subjects of the Queen-Empress.
 The dissatisfaction that the latest move on the part of the Natal Government in the matter of education has caused amongst the Indian to Christianity, of whom there is a large number, is indeed  very intense. They, of all others, know fully, and have been taught to understand, the advantages of Western culture. They are taught by their religious teachers the doctrine of equality. They are told, Sunday after Sunday, that their Great Master knew no distinction between a Jew and a Gentile, a European or an Asiatic. Small wonder, then, if they feel keenly the disabilities that are sought to be imposed upon them in the educational line. It is difficult to say where the present agitation against the Indians will end. The wish of the white Colonists may perhaps fairly be said to be embodied in the following extracts from the speeches of well-known members of the Natal Parliament:
 Mr. Palmer thought it undesirable that so large an increase should be made in the money voted for the education of Indians, who were thus being fitted to supplant the children of white Colonists.
Mr. Payn moved that the item be struck out, remarking that:
 Indians who came here had the right of leaving the Colony. There were thirteen blacks (?) to every white in Natal, and yet Parliament was voting money to educate the blacks to oust Europeans. Some people were doing worse than that—selling land to blacks which would be foundation of the strength of the coloured people here in the future. (Natal Mercury, 8th June, 1899.)
 It need not take a long time to know on which side justice lies. Sir Harry H. Johnston, whose name is well known to your readers, rightly says in his recent book on the “Colonization of Africa”:
 On the other hand, from the Imperial point of view—from what I call the policy of the Black, White, and Yellow—it seems unjust that Her Majesty’s Indian subjects should not be allowed to circulate as freely as those of her lieges who can claim European descent. (p. 177)
 And, after all, is it not the Imperial point of view alone which is worth considering, and before which every other view must bend? It is to be hoped that the public in India will be sufficiently alive to the
 importance of the question, which in its widest aspects affects not only the fifty thousand Indians in Natal, but each one of the three hundred millions who may care to go out of India in search of livelihood.

       Colonial 	Office Records: Memorials and Petitions, 1899.           TO  I 	have etc.,  M. K. GANDHI          JOHANNESBURG,  July 21, 1899libtech_294_footnote 
  HIS 	HONOUR 	THE 	BRITISH 	AGENT 	PRETORIA   
  SIR,   On behalf of the 	Indian community in Johannesburg, I beg to 
 lay 	the following before Your Honour:   At 		the interview 		you were 		graciously pleased to 		grant the 		deputation,. consisting 		of Mr. Hajee 		Habib Hajee Dada, Mr.   	H. O. Ally, Mr. Abdul Rahman, and myself on Thursday last (July 20, 	1899), you informed the deputation that Her    
 Majesty’s Government would not at present interfere as regards the general question, viz., the whole status of the British Indians in the Transvaal; that the Indians must abide by Law 3 of 1885, as amended in 1886, but that Her Majesty’s Government would be prepared to interfere at any time with reference to special cases, such as the sites of Locations, cases of long leases, etc.
  I 	am to say that Her Majesty’s 	 Government  having 	accepted the above 	law, there is no desire 	on the 	part of 	the Indian 	community not to 	abide by 	the law, 	so long 	as it remains on 	the Statute 	book of the Republic.  But 	I am to point out, as 	it was done at 	the above interview, 	with due deference, 	that as 	the Locations 	are to 	be pointed out, as 	the law states, 	for the purposes 	of sanitation, the 	necessity on 	that ground 	ought to be clearly 	established. And 	if in that 	case the question 	be that of 	each Indian having 	to prove 	that he has 	been living in 	accordance with 	the sanitary 	regulations, and that 	his presence in 	town is 	in no 	way a danger 	to the community 	generally from 	a sanitary 	point of view, 	the matter 	even then seems 	to be 	extremely simple. If 	Her Majesty’s 	Government succeed in 	establishing the 	point that the 	Transvaal Government 	would not remove 	those Indians who 	produce satisfactory evidence 	as to their 	sanitary condition, I 	venture to 	submit that the 	rest of 	the burden 	could be discharged 	by parties 	affected, without having 	to trouble 	Her Majesty’s 	Government.  In 	Johannesburg. and 	the suburbs, apart 	from the present 	Indian Location, 	there are, it 	appears, about 125 	British Indian 	storekeepers and 	about 4,000 hawkers, the 	storekeepers possessing 	unliquidated assets 	collectively estimated at about 	£375,000, and 	the hawkers about 
£400,000.
  Most 	of the 	storekeepers possess 	leases, with the 	exception of 	3 or 	4. However, none 	of them has 	availed of the 	Government Notice 	calling upon 	them to 	register their leases.  The 	people were 	and are in 	a state 	of terror; 	they do 	not know 	what to do. The 	cablegram appearing in the 
 newspapers to the effect that Her Majesty’s Government were still in communication with the Transvaal Government, and that Her Majesty’s High Commissioner. was instructed to take up the matter at the Bloemfontein Conferencelibtech_295_footnotelibtech_296_footnoteserved   as   an   effective   check   against   the storekeepers registering their leases.
  The 	Indians residing in 	Johannesburg cannot, 	even if 	they wanted, remove to the Location situated in the Brickfields.  It 	contains, according to 	the report of 	the Inspector 	of Nativesand Traffic 	in Johannesburg, 	dated the 10th January, 1896, 	ninety-six stands, 	each 30 by 50 ft. 	The Location was 	even at that date, as the Inspector 	states, overcrowded, 	containing a population 	of 3,300. 	The state 	of the 	Location at 	present, from that 	point of 	view, is 	probably worse than it 	was in 1898.  The 	Government of the South 	African Republic, 	it is understood, intend 	to remove 	the Indians 	in town 	to a place 	called Waterval, 	4_ miles 	distant  from  	Johannesburg Market 	Square, the central 	part of Johannesburg. 	Surveyor’s diagram and 	medical report 	thereon are 	hereto attached.libtech_297_footnoteThe diagram shows the distance also from 	 the 	end of 	the inhabited 	portion of the town.  It 	is submitted that 	to ask 	the Indians to 	remove to 	that place would 	be practically asking 	them to leave the 	Transvaal. The 	storekeepers could 	never do any 	business there. 	The hawkers 	could not be expected 	to walk 	with their wares 	from and to that 	place every day.  The 	fact that there are 	no sanitary 	arrangements there, no 	water, no 	police protection and 	that the place is 	situated in 	the vicinity of 	the place 	where the refuse 	of the 	town and 	night-soil are 	deposited, are minor 	considerations in 	comparison with 	the fact 	that it is situated 	at such 	a great 	distance as 	4-miles with 	no population 	of any 	kind within 	practically a two-mile radius. 
 
  The 	Government appear to 	have entered 	into an 	agreement with 	Herman Tobiansky, of 	Johannesburg, in 	connection with  this  site,  as 	 will  appear  from 	 copy 	 thereoflibtech_298_footnotehereto 	annexed.  The 	lease bristles with 	provisions extremely 	harmful to the 	persons that might be 	located on 	the ground 	leased, but it 	is unnecessary to 	dilate thereon as 	the site itself is so manifestly 	unsuitable for the 	purposes mentioned.  It 	appears that 	the Kaffirs too, who are most of 	them labourers 	and not affected 	from a 	commercial point 	of view, 	have lodged their protest against their removal to 	the above 	site.  It 	has often 	been submitted that the 	removal of 	the Indian 	storekeepers to 	Locations, wherever they 	may be, 	would mean almost 	certain ruin for them.  It 	is respectfully 	submitted that if Her 	Majesty’s Government 	could not 	see their 	way to move in the  	direction humbly 	suggested in paragraph 	3 hereof, 	the least 	that would prevent 	the entire 	ruin of 	the  Indian 	 storekeepers would 	be to leave the present 	storekeepers untouched. 	The hawkers 	could, if absolutely 	necessary, be removed 	to a Location 	if it is suitably 	 situated  and 	otherwise not 	objectionable. Exceptional sanitary provisions 	might, if necessary, be made 	regarding the 	storekeepers.  If, 	however, relief of 	the nature 	above indicated 	could not 	be secured, I am humbly 	to submit 	that a spot  in  the 	business portion of 	the town set apart 	for the 	Indian storekeepers for 	their business 	purposes, subject to 	such rent and 	other regulations 	that may 	be necessary, might 	enable a 	large number 	of the 	traders to earn their livelihood; but 	such an arrangement 	would not 	by any 	means afford relief to 	the few large 	Indian merchants.  While 	the matter 	is in course 	of settlement, 	the extension 	of time 	enabling the 	Indians to 	obtain temporary 	licences, or an 	understanding that 	they will not be 	interfered with 	in pursuit 	of their 	trade in the 	meantime, is 	very necessary 	by way 	of immediate 	temporary relief. 
 
  It 	may be 	stated that 	the Transvaal Government 	seem to 	have granted the 	above relief in 	Johannesburg. I 	am further to 	state that the 	Government of 	the Republic 	has served 	the following 	notice on the 	owners of 	the stands 	in the 	“Coolie Location”, 	dated the 23rd May, 1899: 
 You are hereby warned that, in accordance with the Government Notice No. 208, appearing in the Staats Courant of the 26th April, 1899, only you and your family will be allowed to reside on your Stand, after June 30th of the present year.
 
 (Signed) A. SMITHERS
  It 	appears that 	a protest 	with reference 	to this 	notice has 	already been lodged 	with His Honour 	the British Vice-Consul. 	The intention underlying 	the notice 	is obvious. 	It is submitted 	that in Law 3 of 	1885 and 	its amendment, 	there is 	absolutely no 	sanction for 	any such restriction.  It 	is hoped that 	the Transvaal 	Government have 	no right and that 	they will not insist 	upon disturbing the 	rights of 	the present 	population in the 	Indian Location.  But 	if the town population 	must be partly 	or wholly 	removed to 	a Location, it is clear 	that another site 	will become necessary.  The 	Town Council, with the 	approval of 	the Transvaal 	Government, have adopted 	certain regulations 	regarding Locations, 	which go 	far beyond 	the scope 	of Law 3 of 1885, 	and its amendment. 	Copy of the 	regulations is 	hereto attached marked D.libtech_299_footnote  It 	is much feared 	that the Transvaal 	Government would 	apply these regulations 	to any 	new site they may select 	for the 	removal of 	the Indians 	residing in the 	town. Indeed, the 	Annexure Clibtech_300_footnoteshows this quite clearly.  Any 	scheme, therefore, 	for the 	removal of 	the Indians, whether 	hawkers or others, 	in order 	to be at all 	satisfactory, should 	give the Indians 	the same 	proprietary rights 	in the 	Locations as are granted to the other communities in town 
 
 generally.
  There 	is no prohibition 	in the 	law above referred to 	against Indians 	owning land in 	Locations or 	dealing with 	it as they 	choose. Indeed, hawkers 	could not be 	expected to 	buy land 	and erect 	their own buildings 	in the 	Locations. And 	it is 	respectfully submitted 	it would 	be a 	great injustice 	if the 	land in Indian 	Locations or the 	right to 	build thereon 	is given 	to any 	but Indians.  In 	conclusion, it 	is to be hoped that 	before accepting any 	scheme for 	a Location 	or a general 	settlement, the 	responsible Indians 	will, if 	possible, be taken into 	confidence, so 	as to enable them 	to make 	suggestions if 	necessary.  Now 	that there is 	a prospect 	of Indians generally 	being shifted 	to Locations, 	will it be too 	much to 	expect a 	change of 	official name 	“Coolie Location” 	for “Indian 	Location”?  I 	may state that I 	had the honour 	to wait 	upon His Honour the  State  Secretary  on 	  Saturday 	  morninglibtech_301_footnotelibtech_302_footnotenot  in  my 	representative capacity, 	but in 	my individual capacity, 	and while telling 	him that 	with regard to their 	grievances they 	must in 	future, as 	they had 	done in 	the past, lay  them 	before their own 	Government, humbly 	pleaded for 	magnanimity in 	view of 	the fact that the 	Indians possessed 	great antecedents, were, 	no matter 	where they went, most 	law-abiding, and 	instead of 	being in 	any way a 	harm to 	the Burghers 	of the 	State, they 	were rendering a 	humble but 	useful service 	to them 	In their 	various pursuits. The 	State Secretary 	was good 	enough to 	extend to 	me the utmost 	courtesy, and granted 	me a long 	and patient hearing. 
 I have the honour to be, Sir,
your obedient servant,

 [Prior to July 27, 1899] Questioned by the  Star,libtech_303_footnotelibtech_304_footnoteMr. Gandhi stated that in Pretoria the Indians are permitted by the State Attorney to trade without licences
until water is laid on. Now that this work has been  completed,  the
 authorities will insist on the Asiatics removing into the Location. In Johannesburg, the officials do not, for the present, intend to  take active measures. The Waterval Location, from every point of view, is entirely unsuited. It was out of the question that hawkers should walk such a distance morning and night; and, as regards storekeepers, transfer of businesses meant that they might as well give up trading altogether, for, with the exception of other Coloured residents, there were no people within a radius of two miles. As yet there were no sanitary arrangements, while the place was in proximity to the depositing site for refuse. The Indians were prepared to show that on sanitary grounds there was no justification for their removal, and, if there were cases of insanitation, these could always be dealt with under regulations. It seems probable the main reason the authorities have postponed action is that not a few of the stands and buildings belong to Indians, and those men cannot be dispossessed. Mr. Gandhi saw no reason why a satisfactory arrangement could not be come to between the Imperial and the Transvaal Governments.

From the  following  it  would 	appear that Mr. Chamberlain is in correspondence with the Natal 	Government regarding the measure:     
 PIETERMARITZBURG,
 13th June, 1899
 With further reference to your letter of the 11th January last,libtech_307_footnoteaddressed to His Excellency the Governor, containing a Memorial signed by certain Indians on the subject of the Dealers’ Licences Act No. 18, 1897, I have the honour to inform you that the Secretary of State for the Colonies is in communication with this Government with reference to the petitioners’ complaint.
 The following appears in The Natal Witness, dated 4th July, 1899, with reference to the letter addressed by the Government to the Ladysmith Local Board:
 A letter was read from the Principal Under Secretary advising the Board to exercise caution in refusing Indian licenses so as not to interfere with vested interests, as unless this was done the Government would be obliged to introduce legislation giving Indians right of appeal from the decisions of Local Boards to the Supreme Court. But if care was exercised in refusing Indian licenses, such legislation need not be introduced.
 It was decided to inform the Government that the matter should have full consideration and the Town Clerk was instructed to lay the matter before the Board.
 It is presumed that a similar communication has been addressed to each of the Local Boards or Town Councils in the Colony.
 It is gratifying to note that Mr. Chamberlain is alive to the danger that besets the Indians in the Colony If the strong arm of protection from the imperial Government is not stretched forth in their behalf, and that the Natal Government is evidently anxious in some way or other to meet Mr. Chamberlain. But at the same time it is extremely desirable that the real bearing of the above letter should be understood, and that the Colonial Office, or the sympathizers, should not be lulled into the belief that the letter in any way solves the difficulty or removes the anxiety that is preying upon the Indian mind in Natal. The Town Councils and the Local Boards have got certain powers under the Act, and they are entitled to use those powers in the way it pleases them without let or hindrance. Strictly speaking, the letter is unconstitutional, and at best a gratuitous piece of advice which the Local Boards or the Town Councils are in no way bound to  follow. Indeed, there is no knowing that it will not be resented by some at least of the more forward municipalities as an unwarranted
 
 interference by the Natal Government. Be that however as it may, we are prepared to assume, for the sake of argument, that the municipalities concerned may, for a time, use their powers in such a manner as not to appear to be affecting “vested interests”. they may take the hint given by The Times of Natal referred to in the memorial, and perform the process of “gradual weeding out” so as not to cause a commotion. Certain it is that the relief, if any is afforded by the letter, will be merely temporary, and may in the end aggravate the disease instead of removing it. What is needed, and what is also the least that ought to be given is, in our humble opinion, the alteration In the Act suggested by the Government, viz., the giving of the right of appeal to the Supreme Court against the decisions of  the municipalities. For, it is the Act that is really bad and un-British. The powers given thereby are arbitrary, and a gross encroachment upon the elementary rights of citizens in the British territories. The municipalities, so far as we know, never asked for such powers; they certainly asked for discretionary powers, but the Act goes much further: it constitutes them their own Supreme Court.
 With a view then to inform you as to what is going on here with reference to the Dealers’ Licenses Act, and to show how far the fears expressed in the memorial referred to above have been realised, we have ventured to approach you in the matter. The following letters have been addressed to the Natal Government on our behalf which speak for themselves:
 With further reference to your letter dated 13th June in view of the correspondence that is going on between the Imperial and Local Governments, it may not be amiss to show how far the fears expressed in “the Dealers’ Licenses Memorial” have been realised. I have not been able to  collect accurate information from all the places, but so far as the information has been received it is of an extremely discouraging nature. In Dundee the licenses were first refused and on an appeal they were granted under certain qualifications endorsed on the back of the licenses, viz.,: ‘This license is granted upon distinct understanding that it will not be renewed in the present buildings. By order of the Board, (Sd). Fras. I. Birkett, Licensing Officer andTown Clerk.’ In answer to an enquiry, several of the license-holders said that they thought the licenses were so granted because their stores were wood and iron buildings. It appears Messrs. Handley & Sons and Harvey Greenacre & Co., in Dundee, have brick fronts but the rest of their stores is wood and iron. Messrs. Taylor & Fowler, Merchants of Dundee, have their stores entirely of wood and iron. In Newcastle the licenses refused last year have been refused this year also. The
 
 Town Council were good enough to give some time to two of the applicants in order to enable them to sell off their stock, but this could hardly act as a remedy against the loss occasioned to the parties concerned. One of them, Abdool Rassool, had a large business and owned a wood and iron store. It was pointed out to the Council that the building which represented to him a value of £150 would fetch practically nothing, if it had to be sold.
 In Verulam, I understand, two applicants who had a license last year have been refused their licenses this year, and the men as well as their servants are now comparatively reduced to poverty.
 In Ladysmith, one M. C. Amla, who has been trading there for several years, has been deprived of his license on the ground that the place where he was trading was situated in the chief street of the township and that it was suitable only for a European trader. The owner applied for a license with reference to another building immediately near an Indian store and owned by the owner of that store. That application too has been refused on the same ground. I might be permitted to mention that there are other Indian stores in the same street.
 In Port Shepstone, two large Indian Merchants have lately sold their businesses to two other Indians. These applied for licenses and the Licensing Officer refused them. An Appeal was taken to the Licensing Board with no better result, and the parties are now considering what to do.
 It is humbly submitted that it is a serious matter when one man, because he is an Indian, cannot sell his business to another, also because that other is an Indian, for the refusal to grant the license in such cases is tantamount to forbidding a purchase and sale unless it were done in an underhand manner.
 An Indian who had sold out his premises to Dundee Coal Co., and had therefore entirely wound up his business, came down to Durban, and purchased    a previously licensed store on the Umgeni Road and applied for a license for himself. The Licensing Officer, after the man had made several applications and after he went to the expense of engaging an eminent counsel in Durban at a heavy cost, granted the license and then only for a limited period in order to enable the applicant to sell out the goods he had already bought in anticipation of receiving a license.
 These are some of the cases where vested interests have  been  prejudicially affected. But, cases where thoroughly good men with capital have been refused licenses because they were Indians who did not hold a license to trade the previous year are too numerous to mention.
 The Indians have noticed with satisfaction and gratitude the fact that the Government are anxious to see that the vested Indian interests are not injured,
 in that they have addressed letters to the several Town Councils and Town Boards to the effect that unless they took care not to touch vested interests, legislation giving Indians right of appeal to the Supreme Court might become necessary. I am, however, to point out that such an appeal to the Boards may not have a permanent effect if at all, and would still leave the Indian traders in   a state of dreadful suspense. The alternative suggested by the letter above referred to would indeed, in my humble opinion, be only a small measure of injustice but extremely desirable in the interests of the Indian community already settled in the Colony.
 I am to request that the contents of this letter may be communicated to the Right Honourable the Secretary of State for the Colonies.
Second letter:
 With reference to my letter dated 6th instant regarding Dealers’ Licenses Act, I wish to correct an error that has crept therein.
 I find that only one case of the hardship of the description mentioned in my letter has happened in Port Shepstone. The other case never went to the Licensing Officer as the attorney who had charge of both the cases, owing to the unfortunate result of the first case, advised the other client not to go on with his application. Steps are now being taken to make the other application also.
 With reference to Port Shepstone, it may be mentioned that the refusal to grant the licence has followed close upon a question asked by a member of the Natal Assembly from that district, as to whether in such districts licences to Indians were granted indiscriminately. The Government replied saying that they had informed the magistrates in such districts, who are also the Licensing Officers, to the effect that they have discretionary powers. The Magistrate at Port Shepstone evidently took the hint, and refused the licence. This happened some days before the letter addressed to the Ladysmith Local Board above referred to appeared in The Natal Witness.
 It is hardly necessary to state that the cases that come before the authorities in some way or other are not the only cases of hardship.
 The Act has a terribly deterrent effect and many poor traders simply from hopelessness refrain from applying for a renewal of their licences, and many more from taking their cases before the appellate body, viz., a municipality or a Licensing Board, in the event of being rejected by the Licensing Officer. The second case in Port Shepstone is an instance in point.
 There is no grievance more keenly felt than the one under the
 
 Act; for, it affects the bread and butter of hundreds of industrious and peaceful Indian traders from the lowest to the highest. There is no certainty that because the best of us have received a licence this year we would receive it the next also. In a state of such insecurity business naturally becomes paralysed and uneasiness takes hold of our minds. The sole hope lies in something being done by and through the Imperial Government.
 We venture to draw your attention to the following leading articles on this matter in The Times of India:
 We have dealt with the question of the rights of Indians in British Africa so often that there is no need to repeat upon this occasion the arguments we have frequently adduced. . . . But while  the  Colonists  gladly  availed themselves of the services of Indians as hewers of wood and drawers of water, they have constantly attempted to deprive them of those rights of free competition in trade which should be their inalienable privilege as British subjects. They decline to compete with the Indian traders in the open market, and endeavour to foster Protection in its most contemptible form by hedging them round with vexatious restrictions. . . . It is in the highest degree humiliating to know that the traditions of British impartiality to men of all races and creeds have been so far departed from in South Africa that British subjects are being compelled to seek sanctuary upon Portuguese soil from the tyrannous oppression of men with whom they are supposed to enjoy common rights under the British Crown. The injustice suffered by Indian traders in Africa will never be removed until the Home Government decides to accord to them the protection they have a right to expect. (15th April 1899, Weekly edition.)
 To the Englishman in India the spectacle of Indian traders being denied entrance and domicile anywhere under the British flag is irritating and repugnant, inasmuch as it gives his fellow-subject unquestionable reason for asking what are the advantages of the citizenship that he enjoys. To the native the spectacle must be a temptation to think that the British flag is  a meaningless symbol, for under it one British subject may vex and constrain another without leaving the latter any redress. We, who speak for Englishmen in India, would give much if home opinion could be aroused to that aspect of the case of the Indians in South Africa. The equities of the case leave no room for dispute even on a Durban platform. But there is a political and sentimental side to it, too, which could be made to seize the popular imagination in England if people could once be got to think of so many thousand honest and well-behaved subjects of the Queen on their removal from one part of the Empire to another, being denied the most ordinary rights of citizenship. Is
 there no one in the House of Commons who can tell this tale of shame and injustice with some hope of getting redress for the victims.	(22nd April
 1899, Weekly edition.)
 We hardly think we need add more. We trust that as in the past you will be pleased to exert yourself in our behalf, and bring the present painful position to speedy termination.
 We remain, Sir,
 your obedient servants,
 ABDUL CAADIR

100,"October 11, 1899",THE SECOND REPORT OF THE NATAL INDIAN CONGRESSlibtech_313_footnote,"
  	I enclose herewith copy of the communication sent to His Honour the 	British Agent at Pretoria on behalf of the British Indians in the 	Transvaal.libtech_311_footnotelibtech_312_footnoteThe tension is hourly increasing and by the time this 	is in your hands it is difficult to say what will happen. But lest 	the Indian question might be kept in the background in any 	compromise that may be arrived at between our Government and the 	Transvaal, it has been thought advisable to keep you informed of the 	position affecting the British Indians. The accompanying would show 	how the Transvaal Government have gone beyond the Law 3 of 1885 in 	sanctioning the regulations of the Johannesburg Town Council. There 	is absolutely no warrant for such regulations or for preventing the 	Indians from owning land in the Locations. The chief point, however, 	is that urged in paragraph 3 of the letter to the British Agent, 	namely, sanitary reasons must be established in terms of the law for 	removing, the Indians to Locations. Here there is ample ground for 	intervention.  I 	remain, yours obediently,  M.  K. GANDHI  From 	the photostat of a signed copy of the original: S. N. 3295a.         [Post 	October 11, 1899]  	The first report was published in August of 1895,libtech_314_footnotelibtech_315_footnoteone 	year after the establishment of the Congress. Owing to various 	causes, it has not been possible to prepare another report during 	the interval that has      
 elapsed.
 INCOME AND EXPENDITURE
 From the memo annexed hereto,libtech_316_footnotethe members will be able to see at a glance what has been spent during the three years. It will be noticed that the chief items were incurred during the Demonstration crisis,libtech_317_footnotelibtech_318_footnotethe memoriallibtech_319_footnotelibtech_320_footnotealone costing close on £100. If the expenditure has, on an average, been larger during the years under review than during 1894-95, the income, too, has considerably increased. One good result, and perhaps the most important, of the publication of the first report was that the Congress at once decided to make the annual subscriptions payable for the whole year in advance and the cumbrous method of collecting the subscriptions every month was given up. As a result, the subscriptions for 1895-96 were collected at once, and the activity shown in the year 1896 by some of the workers was really marvellous. They not only gave their time, but those that were able came forward with their carriages to go about collecting. The visit to Stanger in this respect was the most memorable. The President, Mr. Abdul Karim Haji Adam, Mr. Abdul Kadir, Mr. Dowd Mahomed, Mr. Rustomji, Mr. Hassam Juma, Mr. Madanjit, Mr. Paruk, Mr. Hoosein Meeran and Mr. Kathrada, including the Hon. Secretary, went out to Verulam, Tongaat, Umhlali, Stanger and the district beyond, in the carriages placed at the disposal of the workers by the President, by Mr. Abdul Kadir and Mr. Dowd Mahomed. At Tongaat, the members stayed at the store of Mr. Kasim Bhan till midnight, not caring  whether they had their food or not, in order to induce that gentleman to become a member, but he was obstinate and the workers had to retire. But they did so only to put forth redoubled efforts the next morning. One of them rose up very early and without having even a drop of tea invaded Mr. Bhan’s store, and the members sat there without having anything to eat till noon and left the store only after Mr. Bhan became a member and gave his subscription. They then went to the next station On the way, Mr. Hassam Juma was thrown off his horse and was perfectly insensible for a few seconds. It was suggested that all should return as the road was bad and evening had
 
 set in. But Mr. Hassam Juma would not listen and the journey was kept up. At Stanger all these efforts were crowned with success. Mr. Mohomed Essopji, now unfortunately deceased, saw the zeal of the workers at Tongaat and became himself enthused, so much so that, although he was on his way to Durban on an important business, [he] chose to accompany the workers to Stanger where he entertained them all and was instrumental in securing for the Congress, in Stanger  alone, the sum of over £50.
 Many such instances can be given of the splendid devotion of the members under the leadership of our late President, Mr. Abdul Karim Haji Adam. The visit to Newlands through an uphill tract without anywell laid-out roads, the journey to the Buttery place at night time through the fields without a guide, the journey to Isipingo, the pilgrimage to the store of Mr. Essopji Umar, where the members went at 5 o’clock in the evening and remained till 11 o’clock without food—all these deserve a chapter each. Suffice it, however, to say that the energy, devotion and single-mindedness shown for the cause by the workers during that time have seldom, if ever, been equalled. The same, however, unfortunately for us, cannot be said now. The fiery enthusiasm seems to have died out. Causes for such a state of things are many, some of which are such that they cannot be controlled by the members. But it is painful to have to record that much that might have been done has not been done by them; and the confident hope that was entertained now two years ago that we would by this time have a fund amounting to £5,000 has, for the present, become  a dream. The Congress has to discharge a liability of £300, perhaps
 £400, and it is difficult to say how the monies are to be got in. The subscriptions at Maritzburg, Charlestown, Newcastle, Verulam, Tongaat, Stanger and the other places have become overdue, and nothing has yet been done to call them in. While, at one time, the number of members reached the respectable total of nearly  300, strictly speaking, the number now is only 37! That is to say, that there are only 37 who have paid up their subscriptions up to date. It is time the members woke up from their long sleep, or else it might be too late.
 THE CONGRESS WORK IN THE MONTH OF OCTOBER 1895
 The Transvaal Volksraad passed a resolution in October 1895 exempting British subjects from compulsory military service with the proviso that Indians were not included in the term “British
 Subjects”.libtech_321_footnoteThe  Congress,  although,  strictly   speaking,   we  are   not supposed to actively interfere with the affairs of our fellow-brothers in the South African Republic, with their concurrence, took up the question. A cablegram was drafted and was forwarded from the Transvaal to our sympathisers in London,libtech_322_footnoteand a memorial was also sent in due course,libtech_323_footnotewith the result that the obnoxious resolution, so far as is known, has not yet been accepted by the British Government.
 That month introduced us to Mr. Earnest Hatch, a Conservative member of the British Parliament. He was touring through South Africa. Some persons in Johannesburg took him to the Indian Locations, showed him the worst parts in the Indian quarters, and the papers said that Mr. Hatch was very much disgusted with what he had seen and that he was going to study the Indian question. From Johannesburg he came to Durban and some of the members of the Congress thought it advisable to meet Mr. Hatch and place before him the Indian view of the question. He met a deputation of about 50 representative Indians and returned a very sympathetic answer to what was said to him and promised to do what he could in England. He marked with approval the moderation with which, in his opinion, we carried on our work. Mr. Hatch was presented with some Indian curiosities.
 The Franchise question had not yet been settled and during the latter part of the year 1895, it was very much discussed in the papers. Everybody seemed to think that the Indians were attempting to claim a new privilege which had been, hitherto, withheld from them, that they wanted a vote for each Indian, that they never possessed any franchise right in India and that if the Natives of South Africa could not possess it, much less could an Indian. It became very necessary to answer all these misrepresentations and to remove the misunderstanding. A pamphlet entitled The Indian Franchise: An Appeal to Every Briton in South Africalibtech_324_footnotelibtech_325_footnotewas prepared. Seven thousand copies were printed, one thousand of which were paid for by Mr. Abdul Karim Haji Adam, and they were widely distributed, some in England also. It was largely noticed by the South African Press and it
 
 gave rise to some sympathetic and some bitter and much indifferent correspondence. A special article was devoted to it in the London Times and all the propositions advanced therein were accepted by the writer. This was in December 1895.
 In the early part of 1896, as most of the questions placed by the Congress before the Secretary of State for the Colonies were yet unsettled, it was considered necessary to place a review of the whole situation before our friends in London and India. A general letter was, therefore, prepared and was sent to them under the signatures of the representative   Indians   in   Natal.libtech_326_footnoteIt   was  about   this   time   that   the regulations with reference to the then newly established township of Nondweni in Zululand were published.libtech_327_footnotelibtech_328_footnoteIt was provided therein that the Indians could not buy or possess  ervenlibtech_329_footnotelibtech_330_footnotein that township. As soon as they were published in the Government  Gazette,  a memoriallibtech_331_footnotelibtech_332_footnotewas drawn up protesting against the exception and submitted to H. E. the Governor. The Natal Mercury admitted the justice of our contention. His Excellency, however, could not see his way to remove the prohibition.
 Thereupon, a petition was forwarded to Mr. Chamberlain,libtech_333_footnotelibtech_334_footnoteand Sir M. M. Bhownaggree on receipt of the memorial put a question in the House of Commons. The London Times gave nearly two columns to the matter andthe Committee of the National Congresslibtech_335_footnotelibtech_336_footnotealso took it up. It might be noticed here, parenthetically, that the publication of the above regulationsbrought to light the fact that similar regulations were passed with reference to the earlier established townships of Melmoth and Eshowe. The above memorial included these two townships also. The prohibition has now been removed. Had it not been for the vigilance of Mr. Adamji Miankhan, this matter might have altogether escaped the notice of the Congress; for, he it was who first came to know about it, and brought it to the notice of the Honorary Secretary.
About May 1896, after inspection of many properties and after
 
 much consultation and deliberation, the property registered in the name of Niddha, a free Indian woman, with a brick house and store, was bought by the Congress for £71,080. It was unanimously resolved that it should be registered in the names of the seven persons who have the power of signing cheques on behalf of the Congress as trustees therefor. The property now brings a rental of about £l0 per month, its rateable value is £200 and the yearly rates payable to the Corporation this year have been £9-17-6. The buildings are insured for £800 by the Gardiner Fire Assurance Society. Most of the tenants are Tamil people. A bathroom was badly required by them and a temporary structure has been put up by volunteers, Mr. Amod Jeewa supplying the bricks free of charge. It is reckoned that this work has saved the Congress over £8. In April of 1896, as the funds of the Congress thus seemed to be in a prosperous condition and  as  it became necessary to remove from Mr. Moosa Hajee Adam’s place, it was felt that the Congress might well take a step forward and be better housed. Accordingly, the spacious hall now occupied by the Congress was rented at a monthly rental of £5, being an increase of £3 per month over the rent previously paid.
 During the first session of the Natal Parliament, 1896, it became known that Mr. Chamberlain had decided to advise the Natal ministers to amend the Franchise Act specially preventing persons of Asiatic extraction from being placed on the Voters’ Roll from the statute book of the Colony by passing a general Act. A Bill repealing that Act and disqualifying persons and descendants of persons belonging to countries that have not hitherto possessed elective representative institutions founded on the parliamentary franchise from becoming voters at the parliamentary elections was thereupon brought in. The Congress felt that, although this Bill did not apply to the Indians,libtech_337_footnotelibtech_338_footnoteas it was to be passed with a view to disfranchise them alone, it was necessary to oppose it and, therefore, a petition embodying the views of eminent persons as to the existence of representative institutions in India was  submitted  to  the  Legislative  Assembly.libtech_339_footnotelibtech_340_footnoteThis  evoked  so much opposition to the Bill on the part of some of the members of the Legislative Assembly that, at one time, it seemed as if the Bill would be thrown out. Sir John Robinson cabled to Mr, Chamberlain and obtained his permission to add after ‘institutions’ the phrase
 
 ‘founded on the parliamentary franchise’.libtech_341_footnotelibtech_342_footnotelibtech_343_footnoteThis addition materially disarmed opposition to the Bill and it passed both the Houses in spite of our petition to the Legislative Council.libtech_344_footnotelibtech_345_footnoteMr. Laughton, at the time of the controversy, wrote a letter to The Natal Advertiser and gave it as his opinion that, in spite of the addition above referred to, the Bill would be inoperative so far as the Indians were concerned. The Bill reserves to the Governor the right to grant special exemption to those coming under it. A petition protesting against the Bill was sent to the Secretary of State for the Colonies,libtech_346_footnotelibtech_347_footnotebut  it  has  received  the  Royal assent and is now the law of the land. It is quite competent for us at any time to bring up a test case as to whether or not we have institutions in India such as are contemplated by the Act, or to apply to the Governor for special exemption. The necessity for either has not yet arisen. We have all along contended that it was not political power that we wanted, but that it was degradation which The first franchise Bill involved that we resented, and our protest has evidently been respected by Her Majesty’s Government.
 The birth of a son to Mr. Abdul Kadir in the month of March, 1896, deserves a special paragraph. At the ceremony performed in the Congress Hall to commemorate the event, over 500 people gathered together. The Hall was brilliantly lit up, Mr. Abdul Kadir made a present to the Congress of £7. This was followed by others and the donations given on the occasion amounted to £58.
 During the presidency of Mr. Abdulla Haji Adam, a resolution was passed to the effect that members who collected for the Congress
 £25 and upward should receive a silver medal. After the institution of the medals many members had, before the month of April 1896, qualified themselves for the honour. Mr. Dowd Mahomed was the most conspicuous in this respect, and it was the unanimous wish that the resolution should be put in force with respect to his work. Consequently, a special meeting was held and a silver medal with a suitable inscription, accompanied by a testimonial, was presented to him.
 By this time it became necessary for the Honorary Secretary, owing to domestic reasons, to leave for India for a short visit. The Congress decided that he should take advantage of his visit home and lay before the Indian public the grievances of the British Indians
 
 residing in South Africa. A letter appointing him as delegate was consequently given to himlibtech_348_footnotelibtech_349_footnoteand  a  draft  for   £75  was  also  given  to defray the expenses of travelling, printing and other out-of-pocket disbursements   in   connection   with   the   work.libtech_350_footnotelibtech_351_footnoteAn   Address   was presented to him by the Congress and a gold medal. The Tamil members of the Congress held a special meeting and presented a further Address.libtech_352_footnotelibtech_353_footnoteThe Honorary Secretary in reply to all the Addresses said that the presentation was premature, the work  was  not yet finished. He, however, took theAddresses and the presents as tokens of love, and said that, if the sentiments expressed by the people were genuine, before his return the members would so work as to swell the Congress balance from £194 to £1,194 by the addition of £1,000 by subscriptions and donations. These presentations were widely noticed by the S. African Press, not altogether in an unfriendly spirit. He left for India by the Pongola on the 5th of June 1896.
 During his absence, Mr. Adamji Miankhan was appointed acting Honorary Secretary. Soon after his reaching India, the Honorary Secretary published a pamphlet entitled Grievances of the British Indians  in  South  Africa:  An  Appeal   to   the   Indian   Public.libtech_354_footnoteFour thousand copies were printed and widely distributed. The Times of India was the first to notice it and, in the course of a sympathetic leading article, advocated a public inquiry. Almost every newspaper of note in India took up the question. The Pioneer, while admitting the grievances, thought that the question was. extremely complicated, that it was difficult to dictate a particular policy to the self governing Colonies, and that, under the circumstances, South Africa for better-class Indians was a country to keep away from. The Simla  corres pondent of the London Times cabled a summary of the pamphlet, adding thereto the views expressed by The Times of India and The Piorteer. After the publication of the pamphlet, the leading men in Bombay were waited upon by the Honorary Secretary who was frequently accompanied by the late President, Mr.  Abdulla  Haji Adam, who happened at the time to be in Bombay.
At the suggestion of the Hon’ble Mr. P. M. Mehta, a public
 
 meeting was held in the hall of the Framji Cowasji Institute on the 26th September, Mr. Mehta presiding. The hall was packed. After the Honorary Secretary had read his Address,libtech_355_footnotelibtech_356_footnotea resolution sympathising with the Indian’s in South Africa and authorising the President to draw up and forward to H. M.’s Principal Secretary of State for India  a memorial in connection with the matter was unanimously passed. The late Hon’ble Mr. Jhaverilal Yajnik, the Hon’ble Mr. Sayani and Mr. Chambers, the Editor of the Champion, spoke to the resolution. Full reports of the meeting appeared in the daily newspapers, and the Presidency Association forwarded by a cable a summary of the proceedings to London.
 Madras was next visited, and the leading men were interviewed. Under the auspices of the Madras Mahajan Sabha a circular was drawn up calling a public meeting at Pachaiyappa’s Hall. The circular was signed by about 40 representative members of the various  communities in Madras, Raja Sir Ramsamy Mudliar being the first signatory. The Hon’ble Ananda Charlu presided. The hall was  crowded and after the Address was read resolutions similar to those passed in Bombay were unanimously carried. A special resolution was also passed suggesting the stopping of indentured labour to Natal. Mr. Adams, Mr. Mr. Parameshvaram Pillay, Mr. Parthasarathy Naidu  spoke to the resolution. All the leading dailies fully reported the proceedings. After the meeting was over, there was such a scramble for the above pamphlet that all the available copies were taken up and to meet the demand of the public 2,000 copies were  printed  in Madras. On the appearance of the cable of the Simla correspondent of the London Times in that paper, Sir (then Mr.) Walter Peace, the Agent-General for Natal, was interviewed and he stated in reply that there were no grievances and made many other statements. The special feature of the Madras Address was an exhaustive reply to Sir Walter Peace. This reply was printed as an appendix to the 2nd edition of the pamphlet.
 After a fortnight’s stay in Madras, the Honorary Secretary travelled to Calcutta. There he interviewed the leaders of public opinion. Sympathetic notices were taken by The Englishman, The Indian Mirror, The Statesman and other English and vernacular papers. The committee of the British Indian Association met to hear the Honorary Secretary, and decided to adopt a memorial to the
 
 Secretary of State for India. While arrangements were being made to hold a public meeting, a cable from Natal was received asking the Honorary Secretary to return at once. The meeting had, therefore, to be abandoned and he left Calcutta for Bombay. A meeting was however, held in Poona under the auspices of the Sarvajanik Sabha. Prof.. Bhandarkar presided. The meeting passed resolutions on the lines oft’ those passed at Madras, to which Prof. Gokhale, the Hon’ble Mr. Tilak; and . . .libtech_357_footnotespoke.
 The Honorary Secretary left India by the Courland on the 27th November,   1896.libtech_358_footnoteA   summary   of   the   cablegram   by   the   Simla correspondent of the Times, referred to above, was sent by Reuter to the South African press. This summary gave an impression of the pamphlet circulated in India that cannot be borne out by a perusal thereof. It, however, gave offence to the European Colonists. The newspapers published violent articles. This gave rise to an anti-Asiatic agitation on an organized scale and the Colonial Patriotic Union was established. It ‘appears that, soon after the publication of the articles, copies of the above-mentioned pamphlet, which were forwarded here, were supplied to the Press which, thereupon, took the right view of the situation and admitted that there was nothing in it to  justify  the violence of the language used against it. The agitation, however, continued, and many exaggerated statements likely to inflame the public mind were made by the Union. Meanwhile, the Courland arrived, preceded by the Naderi, by a few hours, which also brought Indian passengers. The prolonged quarantine of 23 days, the formation of the Demonstration Committee, the marching of the Committee procession to the Point to prevent the  Indians from landing, the landing of the passengers, the mobbing of the Honorary Secretary, his narrow escape in the guise of an Indian constable, the splendid help rendered by Supdt. Alexander and his force, the sudden change of the tone of the Press, the severe verdict passedby it on the action of the Demonstration Committee, the recognition of the services rendered by the Police on the part of the Indian community, the Demonstration memorial to Mr. Chamberlain containing . . . pageslibtech_359_footnotelibtech_360_footnotegiving the full history of the crisis are all fresh in the minds of
 
 the members of the Congress. Two traits of Indian character came out prominently during the critical) period. The establishment of the Quarantine fund for the relief of the sufferers on the two illfated vessels was a work which showed Indian liberality to the  best advantage; and the peaceful behaviour and the quiet  resignation during the most irritating times extorted the admiration even of those who were least likely to notice the good traits of our people.
 During the session of Parliament that followed, the Government, according to their promise to the Demonstration Committee,  introduced four anti-Asiatic Bills, viz., the Quarantine, Immigration Restrictions, Dealers’ Licenses, and Uncovenanted Indians Protection Bills. Petitions were sent to both the Houseslibtech_361_footnotelibtech_362_footnotebut in vain; and the Bills were passed. A petition was therefore sent to the Secretary of State for the    Colonies.libtech_363_footnotelibtech_364_footnoteThe    reply    is    not    altogether    satisfactory.    Mr. Chamberlain, however, sympathises with us and grants our request with reference to the Indians Protection Act. This legislation  may fairly be said to have closed one part of the Asiatic question and that, it would appear, to an extent in our favour. Ever  since  the establishment of our institution, we have fought against colour legislation—against legislation imposing special disabilities on the Indians. That principle has evidently been admitted. Of course this does not mean that we have nothing further to do or that the Solution is satisfactory. On the contrary, we have now the fight against opposition much more subtle because indirect. The above legislation, although nominally directed against all persons, is in practice applied to the Indians alone. We have, therefore, to endeavour not only to get the legislation repealed or modified, but we have also to watch the operation of the various Acts and so far as possible to induce the authorities not to make it unduly severe and irksome. All that requires on our part constant efforts, unceasing watchfulness, un-breakable union amongst ourselves, a large measure of self-sacrifice and all those qualities that ennoble a nation. And then victory must be ours, for our cause has been universally regarded as just, our methods, moderate and without reproach.
 In this connection it might be well to consider and dispose of one complaint that has been raised against the Congress and that is
 
 due to ignorance of past events. It has been said that, if we had not started the movement to obtain redress, our position might not have been so bad as it now is. Little do those people who advance this argument know that the agitation against the Indians is as old as their advent to the Colony. What would have happened if we had not attempted to stem the tide of that agitation? The answer is simple— what has happened to the Indians in the Orange Free State. The Europeans there agitated against the Indians who sat silent until it was too late, and we have now no foothold in that State. In the Transvaal we awoke when half the ground was lost, and because we raised our voice against the European opposition we have yet hopes that, though we may not be able to recover the lost ground, we would at least be able to retain what little yet remains to us. Similarly, in Natal we woke just when the anti-Asiatic feeling was being crystallized into legislation and, therefore, our position is not what it might have been otherwise. If the above feeling had not been allowed to assume the proportions that it did in 1994, we might fairly infer, from the course events took in the other States of South Africa, that our position might have been much better than what it is. To prosecute the enquiry further, the repeal of the anti-Indian regulations for the township of Nondweni in Zululand, the repeal of the first Franchise Act which especially applied to the Indians, the non-acceptance of the anti-Asiatic clause in the Commando Treaty in the Transvaal, Mr. Chamberlain’s famous dispatch in reply to the Transvaal Memorial entirely sympathising with us, the marked improvement in the tone of the Press in Natal and other matters which would readily occur to those who have cared to follow our proceedings, may be claimed as the direct and tangible results of our movement.
 In the beginning of 1897, a cablegram was published in the papers from the Chief Justice of Bengal, in his capacity as the Chairman of the Indian Famine Charitable Relief Committee, appealing for help to the fund. As soon as the cablegram became known, it was realized that a special effort on the part of the Indians in Natal was necessary. A meeting of the Colonial-born Indians was held in St. Aidan’s school room, and there all present promised not only themselves to give what they could but to work also in getting in donations. A meeting of the merchants took place on Mr. Peerun’s premises and a fund was started; but that did not seem to satisfy the gentlemen present and they thought that something more was necessary. Another meeting, therefore, took place on the premises of
 Messrs. Dada Abdulla & Co., and almost all those who had subscribed on Mr. Peerun’s premises doubled or trebled the amounts first put by them, Mr. Abdul Karim rising from £35 to £101, Mr. Abdul Kadir from £36 to £102, Mr. Dawad Mahomed putting down £75. A strong committee representing all classes and creeds amongst the Indian community was formed. Circulars in English, Gujarati, Tamil, Urdu and Hindi were issued and widely distributed.libtech_365_footnotelibtech_366_footnoteWorkers went out all over the Colony collecting subscriptions from high and low  and within a fortnight a sum of £1,150 was collected, the expenses for collection amounting to less than £20.
 The N.I.E. Associationlibtech_367_footnotelibtech_368_footnoteunder the superintendence of Dr. and Mrs. Booth gave two benefit performances in the Congress Hall. An improvisedstage was erected and the members with  some non-members played ‘Ali Baba and Forty Thieves’, the hall being packed full on both the occasions and the proceeds amounting to £40. Capt. Young-husband, the special correspondent of  the  London Times, who was for some time on duty in India, paid a visit to Durban. The Indian side of the Indian question in South Africa was placed before him and all the documents were supplied to him. Messrs Dada Abdulla & Co., entertained him to dinner at the Congress Hall and invited the leading Indians. He has devoted a special chapter to our question in his book on South Africa and, while favouring the attitude taken up by the Europeans, places the Indian side of the question pretty fairly.
 Congress was not behind-hand in connection with the Diamond Jubilee festivities. An address carved on a silver plate in the shape of a heart mounted on a plush and framed in Natal yellow wood was presented to Her Majesty on behalf of the Indians in Natal. A deputation consisting of our leading members specially waited on His Excellency the Governor for the presentation of the Address. An Address similarly worded was sent from the Transvaal Indians also.
 Under the auspices of the N.I.E. Association the Diamond Jubilee Library was opened on the Jubilee Day by Mr. Waller, the then Magistrate of Durban. The Mayor, Mr. Laughton, Mr. Osborn, the Librarian of the Durban Library, Dr. Booth and a few other Europeans attended the opening ceremony. Letters of sympathy were received from those who were unable to attend, among them being the
 
 Hon. Mr. Jameson and the Deputy Mayor, Mr. Collins. The Congress Hall was brilliantly lighted for the occasion. The credit for the success of the opening ceremony and the decorations is entirely due to the efforts of Mr. Bryan Gabriel, though it is but fair to mention that during the last portion of the decorations he was assisted by other workers also. It is painful to have to report that the library has not been as successful in its career as was its opening. The attendance has been nil. The expenses of the library were subscribed for by the members of the Educational Association and an equivalent amount had been voted by the Congress.
 During all this time, between June of 1896 and that of 1897, as has been said above, Mr. Adamji Miankhan held the post of the Hon. Secretary. It was now time for him to go to India. He, therefore, handed over his charge to the Hon. Secretary. A special meeting of the Congress was held to consider the advisability of doing some honour to Mr. Adamji Miankhan to mark its appreciation of Mr. Adamji’s services during the trying times. While all the members recognized the self-sacrifice, the zeal and the ability and tact with which Mr. Adamji worked for the Congress, opinion was divided as to whether or not an Address should be presented to Mr. Adamji. After some discussion the resolution to present him with an Address was carried by a narrow majority, but the opposition was so strong that the majority decided not to proceed with the Address as it was considered that in such matters unanimity of opinion was necessary. And Mr. Adamji Miankhan left for India unthanked and unhonoured.
 This is one of the slips committed by the Congress and shows that we are but a human institution liable to err as any other. The Hon. Secretary as such held a party at his house in honour of Mr. Adamji. Printed invitations were issued and all leading Indians attended. Laudatory speeches were made to which Mr. Adamji gave a suitable reply. The President, the Hon. Secretary and other members saw Mr. Adamji off at the Point. Mr. Adamji Miankhan has proved worthy of the responsibility that was placed upon him by the Congress. During his tenure he convened the meetings regularly, collected the rents properly and kept a very accurate account of all that was spent. He undoubtedly seems to have cultivated good relations with members of the Congress generally. Above all, the one quality that is needed in the holder of that post more than any other, namely, calmness of mind under all the irritation from within and without and the ability to put up with the different dispositions of the members, he displayed in
 abundance. The Jubilee Address might never have been sent but for the care and anxiety with which he worked in order to have it ready in time. Mr. Adamji has shown that the Congress can go on and its work can be properly done by local men.
 When it was announced in the papers, two months prior to the day of celebration of the Diamond Jubilee, that Mr. Chamberlain would take advantage of the occasion to meet the Premiers of the different Colonies and discuss with them certain questions affecting the British Empire, among them being included the Indian question, it was thought advisable to send somebody to London with a view of watching the Indian interests. Mr. M. H. Nazar of the firm of Nazar Bros. of London, a member of the Stockholm Oriental Congress and nephew of the late Justice Nanabhai Haridas, who had come to Natal in the December of 1896 and who had rendered splendid help to the community during the Demonstration crisis, was unanimously selected as the delegate and he went duly authorized to England. Mr. Nazar went to England without any remuneration being paid for his services. The Congress was to pay his out-of-pocket expenses only.  He remained in London in connection with the work beyond  the expected time on the advice of the gentlemen whom he was specially requested to consult in everything he did and whose advice he was to be guided by. He received much support from our sympathizers in London. He was able to move the East India Association on  our behalf and that influential body has forwarded a powerful memorial to Lord George Hamilton and has also sent a communication to the Indian Government directly. Mr. Nazar holds letters of sympathy for our cause from several distinguished Englishmen, and Sir M. M. Bhownaggree in a letter addressed to us speaks very highly of his work In this connection, the extraordinary self-sacrifice made by the Colonial-born Indians and the subscription raised  at  a  single evening’s sitting to the extent of over £35 amongst themselves, numbering about fifteen poorly paid youngmen who have never extended their horizon beyond  South Africa, cannot but  be mentioned. Mr. C. Stephen laid aside his silver watch and all he had in his pocket, and his example, to their credit, was followed by the others present at the meeting, and the Nazar Fund Committee were able next day to cable him £75.
 About the end of last year, the Durban Town Council passed certain Ricksha regulations, one of which prevented Indians from
 owning or holding licenses for rickshas. A protestlibtech_369_footnotelibtech_370_footnotewas at once drawn up, signed by the leading Indians and forwarded to the Governor. Copy of the protest was sent to the Town Council which at once decided to take off the prohibition. Soon after the Immigration Restriction Act came into operation, seventy-five Indians were arrested wholesale in Dundee on the alleged ground that they were prohibited immigrants. Ultimately they were discharged. Last January, the Licensing Officer appointed by the Newcastle Town Council, in virtue of the Dealers’ Licenses At above referred to, declined to issue  licenses to any of the Indians. On appeal, the Town Council granted six licenses and refused three. The matter was taken before the Supreme Court and Mr. Laughton, the appellant’s counsel, ably  argued that the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, even on the merits of the case, was not ousted by the Act. The court however, decided against the appellant, His Lordship, the Chief Justice, dissenting. The Congress has taken the matter up and an appeal has been lodged in the Privy Council— Mr. Asquith the leading counsel has been retained in the case. The result is likely to be known in November.libtech_371_footnoteThe question as to whether vendors without any shop are required to take it a retail licence was raised and the case was  taken to  the Supreme Court in the name of one Moosa, a vegetable dealer, and that court has decided that no licence is required to be taken out by such vendors. This matter was brought  before the Congress by  the vegetable vendors and it was taken up, a member promising to pay the out-of-pocket expenses. The case was won, but the disbursements have not yet been paid by him and they will be a charge on the Congress.
 In the month of March, an illuminated address was presented to Mr. G. V. Godfrey for his being the first Indian to have passed the Civil Service examination of the Colony.libtech_372_footnoteSpecial subscriptions were raised for the purpose and a special committee was formed. In this connection, it ought to be mentioned that Mr. Godfrey Senior has set an example which otherparents may follow with much profit. Himself by no means a particularly educated man, he had made it his sole aim to bring up his children in a suitable manner and to provide for them the best education. He sent his eldest son to Calcutta and gave him a
 
 
 University training there. He (the eldest son) is now gone to Glasgow and is studying for medicine.
 About 20,000 pamphlets, copies of memorials and letters, have been written and have been distributed during the years under review.
Presidents
 In the month of August 1898, Mr. Abdul Karim Hajee Adam Zaveri, having occupied the Congress chair ever since his brother’s departure in 1896, with much credit to himself and to the universal satisfaction of the members, sent in his resignation. He was requested to reconsider his decision but he said he could not, and Mr. Cassim Jeewa was elected in his place. He occupied the chair till the March of this year and then resigned as he wanted to leave the Colony. Mr. Abdul Kadir was unanimously elected in his place and still holds the position of the head of the community. It is sad to record that Mr. Cassim   Jeewa   was   drowned   last   May   while   on    his    way from Calcutta to Rangoon. Much sympathy was shown to his bereaved father, and the Congress authorised the President to send him a letter of condolence.
Visitors
 Dr. Mehta, a graduate and gold medalist of the Grant Medical Collegelibtech_373_footnoteand Barrister-at-Law of  the  Middle  Temple,  London,  and sometime Chief Medical Officer of the Idar State, paid a visit to Durban. He was well received by the community and feted by the prominent members.
 Mr. Rustomjee’s generosity has provided Congress with linoleum worth £22-10-1, a costly brass-plate Congress board, lamps and other knick-knacks.
 MISCELLANEOUS
 During the early part of Mr. Abdul Karim’s tenure of office, the institution of fines for late attendance at the Congress meetings was founded. Many members paid five shillings for each late attendance. It has now fallen into/disuse, and so much have we fallen back from our first love that now it is difficult to form even a quorum at the Congress meetings before 9 p.m., that is, one and a half hours after the appointed time. It was due to the special exertions of Mr. Abdul Karim that it was decided that every merchant should pay a farthing on every packet he imported, four packets of salt being counted as
 
 one. Nearly £195 have been thus received by theCongress, but the sum does not even represent one-tenth of what would be received if every merchant paid up the amount due by him to the Congress on his account.
 It will be recollected that tickets were issued in order to enable the workers to collect small donations without the necessity of writing out receipts. The plan has proved almost a failure except that Mr. Madanjit brought from the Stanger district about £10.
 INDIAN HOSPITAL
 The Congress members raised a subscription in aid of the Indian hospital established in the year 1898 by the exertions of Dr. Lilian Robinson under the advice, help and control of Dr. Booth, and guaranteed to pay £160 or £6-13-4 per month for two years in lieu of rent. The hospital was formally opened on the 14th day of Sept. 1898.
 The outlook at present is gloomy so far as the internal work of the Congress is concerned. Members do not possess half the enthusiasm that was displayed in 1895 and 1896. Subscriptions in all the outlying districts have become considerably overdue. It would, however, be hardly fair to attribute this apparent neglect of the Congress work to wilful apathy on the part of the members. The Indian community have passed and have been passing not only through serious political troubles but have also, with the other communities, severely suffered  from  those  of  the  war.libtech_374_footnotelibtech_375_footnoteThese  two combined have naturally given rise to despair but it is hoped that the despair is only temporary and that, after a calm survey of the situation, which is not without its bright spots, as will have appeared from the foregoing, the old enthusiasm will revive with redoubled force.
 The Congress rules need to be recast and it appears necessary now to be strict in observing them. So far, those that have not paid up their subscriptions have been allowed to be considered as members and to have a say in Congress matters. This practice  is  very undesirable.
 The Test Case as to the interpretation of the Transvaal Law with reference to the Asiatics has been tried.libtech_376_footnoteOur fellow brothers in the
 
 
 South African Republic engaged the services of the best counsel and spared no pains, but the judges, with Justice Jorrisen dissenting, have decided against us. It is too soon yet to forecast the result of the decision. Messrs. Jeremiah Lyon & Co., of London have taken up the cause of the Indians in Rhodesia. They are doing the work zealously and hope to be successful. They have distributed circular letters and papers amongst the leading merchants in Durban.

101,"October 	14, 1899",RELIEF TO INDIAN REFUGEESlibtech_377_footnote,"
           DURBAN, 
   SIR,  October 	14, 1899   About a 	month ago, in forwarding a copy of the communication 
  	to His Honour the British Agent at Pretoria, on behalf of British 	Indians   in   the   Transvaal,   it   was   my   painful   duty   	to   commentlibtech_378_footnotesomewhat 	bitterly on the refusal of the Natal Government to afford relief to 	the Indian refugees from Johannesburg. The Immigration Restriction 	Act prohibits the entry of those that have not been formerly 	domiciled in Natal and do not know any of the European languages. 	The Government have passed certain rules under the Act whereby 	temporary permission to Indian visitors may be given on a deposit by 	the applicants of Ten Pounds each. The Government were asked to 	suspend the deposit during the tension. Yielding to—there is 	reason to believe— pressure from the British Agent, they 	graciously suspended the deposit. Another difficulty cropped up in 	the mean- time. Most of the refugees from Johannesburg availed 	themselves of the railway between that place and Durban, but during 	the past few days that communication has been cut off, and the 	refugees have to go to Delagoa Bay and thence to Durban. Europeans 	have been coming from Delagoa Bay in thousands but as the shipping 	companies, in response to circulars from the Government, have not 	been taking any Indian passengers, they would not in this instance 	also. The Government were, therefore, approached for relief in the     
 matter and they have been pleased to notify to  the  shipping companies that they may bring the Indian refugees from Delagoa Bay, on condition that they should take out temporary passes on their landing. It was considered that it was due to the Natal Government that this fact also should be as prominently brought to your notice as their refusal. We once again feel that, though in Natal, yet we are British subjects, and that in time of danger the enchanting phrase has not after all lost any of its charm. The attitude the Natal Government have now taken up during the crisis is the silver lining to the dark cloud that is hanging over our heads in Natal as well as other parts of South Africa. We only trust that the fellow-feeling that has guided the Natal Government in its treatment of the Indians during the crisis would be continued, even after it is over, and that British subjects of all nationalities will be allowed to remain, as they ought to  be,  in  harmony and peace.
 Though no native Indian troops have landed in Durban, the Indians attached to the troops from India have not failed to extort the suppressed admiration of the Europeans.
 I remain, yours obediently,
 M. K. GANDHI
The comments referred to were the following:
 “The Transvaal is being cleared of its population as fast as possible, no less than 26,000 persons having left during the last few days. The prominent members of the Uitlander Council, the Editors of  the English newspapers in Johannesburg have also left. The largest houses in Johannesburg have suspended their businesses and sent away their clerks and books beyond the border. If the Indians think of leaving the Transvaal at such a time, it cannot be wondered at. They naturally cannot go to Delagoa Bay, because of its malarial climate, nor could they go to the Cape in any large numbers because  of the  great distance and the consequent heavy charges and the small Indian population there. There are no public homes for them. They have to depend upon the help of private friends whom they can find only in Natal. They have approached the Natal Government with a view to obtain suspension of the Immigration Restriction Act during the crisis. The reply received during the week was that the Government had no power to do so under the Act. This is hardly correct, and in reply to a ther communication they say, “in the enforcement or fur-
 non-enforcement of the Immigration Restriction Act, the Government will be influenced by considerations of humanity, and will not seek in the event of hostilities breaking out to exercise its powers unreasonably or oppressively.” This is good so far as it goes, but it does not give the relief that is required. To leave after the actual hostilities commence may be impossible. The Government have been further approached, and it remains to be seen what they will do. I write this to show how awful our position is in South Africa. To find that British subjects cannot find shelter from danger on a British soil is truly heart-rending. The Natal Government would seem to have done their best, if they could, to shake the faith of the poor Indians in British justice, and in the enchanting power of the phrase “British subjects”. Happily, they do not represent the whole of the British Empire. Strange as it may appear, a cablegram today announces that, in reply to repeated representations from Natal, the imperial Government have ordered the despatch of 10,000 troops from India for the protection of Natal which refuses to give temporary shelter to the Indians from the Transvaal, to guard against which, the above troops are intended. Comment is superfluous.”

TO
 
 
 [DURBAN,]
 October 19, 1899
  THE 	HONOURABLE 	THE COLONIAL 	SECRETARY 	MARITZBURG  SIR,  	About 100 English-speaking Indians of Durban met together at a few 	hours’ notice on the 17th inst. to consider the desirability of 	unreservedly and unconditionally offering their services to the 	Government or the Imperial authorities in connection with the 	hostilities now pending between the Imperial Government and the two 	Republics in South Africa.  	As a result, I have the honour to enclose herewith a list containing 	the names of a portion of those that have offered their services 	unconditionally. These have been subjected by Dr. Prince to a 	rigorous examination.  	He will examine the remaining volunteers tomorrow, when about ten 	are expected to pass the test. But, as time is of consequence, it 	was proposed to forward. the incomplete list.libtech_380_footnote  	The services are offered by the applicants without pay. It is open 	to the authorities to accept the services of all, or so many as they 	may consider fit or necessary.  	We do not know how to handle arms. It is not our fault; it is 	perhaps our misfortune that we cannot, but it may be there are other 	dutiesno less important to be performed on the battlefield and, no 	matter of what description they may be, we would consider it a 	privilege to be called upon to perform them and would be ready to 	respond to the call at any time appointed by the Government. If an 	unflinching devotion to duty and extreme eagerness to serve our 	Sovereign can make us of any use on the field of battle, we trust we 	would not fail. It may be that, if in no other direction, we might 	render some service in connection with the field hospitals  or  the 	commissariat.  	The motive underlying this humble offer is to endeavour to prove 	that, in common with other subjects of the Queen-Empress in South 	Africa, the Indians, too, are ready to do duty for their Sovereign    
 on the battlefield. The offer is meant to be an earnest of the Indian loyalty.
 The number we are able to place at the disposal  of  the Authorities may appear to be small; but it probably represents twenty-five per cent of the adult Indian males in Durban that have received a tolerably good English education.
 The mercantile portion of the Indian community, too, have loyally come forward, and if they cannot offer their services on the battlefield, they have contributed towards the maintenance of the dependants of those volunteers whose circumstances would render support necessary.
 I venture to trust that our prayer would be granted, a favour for which the petitioners will be ever grateful and which would, in my humble opinion; be a link to bind closer still the different parts of the mighty empire of which we are so proud.libtech_381_footnote
 I have the honour to be, Sir,

104,"October 	27, 1899",THE INDIANS IN SOUTH AFRICAlibtech_382_footnote,"
    
 
 
 DURBAN,
  October 	27, [1899]  	I see that my last contribution in connection with the education of 	the Indians in Natallibtech_383_footnotelibtech_384_footnotehas  attracted  some  attention  in  India  and 	England. I said in it that, unless the Home and the  Indian  	Governments gave more attention than hitherto to the Indian question 	in South Africa, the effacement of the community in this country was 	a matter of time. The more I observe, the firmer I become in this 	conviction. It may not be inappropriate when the battle is raging 	fiercely between the British army and the Boers to review shortly 	the position—I was going to say, the most wretched position—the 	Indians in the Transvaal occupied during the exodus that took place 	some time ago from that country. During the first stages of the 	panic, the Uitlanderslibtech_385_footnotelibtech_386_footnoteleft 	  Johannesburg   by   thousands   daily.   The   Indians, however, 	remained unmoved. Later, the prominent members of the Uitlander 	Council left. Mr. Moneypenny, the editor of the Star and 	correspondent of the Times, and Mr. Hull, a well-known 	solicitor and leading member of the Council, had to effect their 	escape in disguise. Mr. Pakeman of the Leader was arrested on 	a charge of high treason, and the atmosphere was thick with the 	rumour that leaders of the movement would be taken in custody as 	hostages by the Transvaal Government. Naturally, with the Europeans 	the poor Indians were also frightened, and they, too, were anxious 	to leave the Rand for a place of safety. Where could they go? Not to 	Cape Colony, which is far, and where there is a very sparse Indian 	population; not to Delagoa Bay, the hot-bed of malaria, devoid of 	sanitation and overcrowded. The only place they could go to was 	Natal. The Immigration Restriction Act of that Colony, which 	prohibits the immigration of lunatics, criminals, prostitutes, 	paupers, or those that do not know any of the European languages, 	unless the last have been formerly domiciled in Natal—whatever 	that phrase may mean—was, however, in the way. Mr. Chamberlain has 	said that the Act applies to all, irrespective of colour or race 	distinctions, and, therefore, it is not such as could be objected 	to. But it does not, therefore, at all follow that the European 	criminals, desperadoes and prostitutes, of whom Johannesburg may be 	said to      
 have a fair number, could not go to Natal. Not only was the Colony open to them, but special arrangements were made for their reception—relief committees were formed, and everything that could be done to make them comfortable in their distress was naturally and justly done by the people of this Colony.
 The Indians alone could not and must not come. They appealed to the Government with a view to obtain some relief. They suggested suspension of a portion of the stringent rules passed under the above Act, and asked that they might be allowed to stop in Natal during the crisis. The Natal Government at first refused point-blank to grant relief. Then they said that, in the event of war breaking out, they would be guided by considerations of humanity. The Indians had approached the British Consul at Johannesburg also, who, it must be said, rose to the occasion, and very forcibly placed the Imperial view of the question before the proper authorities, which brought about the desired relief.
 In order to understand thoroughly the ridiculous and un-British position taken up by Natal, it is necessary to know something of the rules referred to above. At the time of introducing the Immigration Bill, the Natal Ministers said that they did not in any way intend to inconvenience the Indians who had already settled in the Colony. As soon, however, as the Bill became law, the Government went out of their way to send notices to the various  shipping  companies,  informing them of the punishment that awaited them if they brought Indian passengers. This was naturally taken by them to mean that they were not to bring any Indian passengers. In view of this, it was evidently necessary that those Indians who were entitled to enter the Colony under the Act should be given some relief. The Government, therefore, introduced what are called “certificates of domicile”, which were granted to those on whose behalf proof could be produced that they were before domiciled in the Colony. It may be mentioned here that the interpretation of the term “domicile” has been narrowed down as much as possible; so that now, practically, an Indian who wants such a certificate must produce two affidavits to the effect that he was in the Colony doing some permanent business for a term of at least two years—a limitation for which there seems to be absolutely no warrant in the Act itself. These certificates are granted on a fee of half-a-crown to the Treasury; but the reader will easily imagine that the poor Indian, who has got to prove that he is exempt from the operation of the Act, has not only to pay the half-crown, but also the
 lawyers who would draw up the affidavits, etc.
 This facility, if it may be so called, enabled only previously-domiciled Indians to obtain a passage for Natal. What, however, were the friends, relations, or customers of the Indians in Natal to do who wanted to visit the Colony temporarily, and, therefore, not to immigrate? Such temporary permission was  absolutely necessary for the convenience of the Indian settlers. A few  applications were made to the Government on behalf of those who wanted to come to Natal on urgent business from other parts of South Africa, and permission was granted after some difficulty on security to the extent of £50 and upwards being lodged for the due return of the applicants. Complaints were frequent and loud about the harassing delay that took place in obtaining such permission, and the prohibitive security required. Applications were made for some systematic relief, and, over one year after the passing of the Act, rules were framed by the Government which, instead of giving the desired satisfaction, caused intense disappointment. A fee of £l was instituted for the first time, for each permit which was granted, on a deposit by the applicant of £25 if he wanted to pass through Durban, say from Johannesburg, on his way to India, and of £10 if he wanted to make a sojourn of a period not exceeding six weeks in Natal. Thus, a poor Indian from Johannesburg wishing to embark at Durban for India was obliged to find not only £25 for deposit, but to pay £l to the Government;  whereas he would have to pay only at times two guineas, and at the most five guineas, for a deck passage. Petition after petition was made to the Government protesting against the imposition of the fee and the distinction between the deposits for embarkation-passes and visitors’ passes. The Government, however, said that the fee of £l was necessary because the passes were a concession, and threw a lot of work on its hands, and that a higher deposit was insisted upon for embarkation-passes as the Government undertook to buy a passage out of the deposit for the holders—a favour which the holders never asked for, and never appreciated. The petitioners, on the other hand, contended that the granting of such passes was an absolute necessity, caused entirely through the strictness with which the Immigration Restriction Act was administered. They said that the Act prohibited the immigration—that is to say, the entry for permanent settlement, and not the entry for a temporary sojourn; and, therefore, respectfully declined to regard the institution of passes as a concession.
It was not, however, until such pressure was brought to bear on
 
 the Government, and a petition to the Home authorities in the matter was threatened in their memorial with respect to the Dealers’ Licenses Act, that the Government yielded and withdrew the imposition of the
 £1 fee and reduced the deposit of £25 for embarkation-passes to £10. So that, when the Indians in the Transvaal appealed for relief, the system of £10 deposit for each visitor or the embarkation-pass was in vogue. (Thus, a storekeeper who has, say, five assistants, would not only have to leave all his stock behind him, to make arrangements for maintenance during the prolonged struggle—without any prospects of business—and find sufficient money for travelling and sundry expenses, but also to have £60 to deposit before he could leave the Transvaal during the panic—a thing which may be practically impossible to do under the severe stress.) It is worthy of note that these passes—though they are, it must be admitted, granted on application without any difficulty—are issuable at the option of the officers appointed to issue them. The Indians in  question  merely asked for suspension of the £10 deposit, and to be allowed to enter and remain in Natal only during the crisis. The cold reply that the Government first returned came as a shock not only to the Indians but to many fair-minded Englishmen also, in Johannesburg. I know that the British Vice-Consul was very indignant. The Standard and Diggers’ News, the Boer organ, in a scathing article, had a laugh at the expense of Natal in thisconnection and, not without some truth, pointed out the inconsistency of the imperial Government in coercing the Transvaal to do justice to the Uitlanders while allowing Natal to do as it liked to the British Indians. To the Indians, for the time being, “British subjects” became an empty phrase. That British Indians at such a time of peril could not find shelter on British soil passed their comprehension, and they did not know what to do and where to go. Recent events prove that the Indians’ misgivings were perfectly correct, and those of your readers who have followed the stirring events in this Continent are by this time aware of the harrowing difficulties which those who put off to the last moment flying out of the Transvaal had to go through.  The British Vice-Consul at Johannesburg came to the rescue. He sent a strong despatch to the British Agent at Pretoria, who, in turn, telegraphed to the High Commissioner, and a timely “recommendation” from him brought the Natal Government to their senses, and the deposit of £10 was suspended. It is to be hoped that the suspension will become permanent, and if the present war brings about, as seems not unlikely,
 a better feeling on the part of the European British subjects towards their Indian fellow-subjects, it will have served one good purpose.
 It is only due to the Natal Government to mention that they have, since the salutary recommendation from Sir Alfred Milner, been uniformly careful in not discriminating against the Indians. When the passenger traffic between Johannesburg and Durban stopped, the refugees had to come via Delagoa Bay. The Europeans came in without let or hindrance to Durban. These had to be housed, and fed by the Government or the Relief Committees; but the steamship companies, in view of the notice above referred to, would not venture to take Indian refugees, not one of whom has sought  the Government’s, or the Relief Committee’s, aid. The Government were requested to supplement the suspension of the deposit by advising the steamship companies to take Indian passengers, which they did promptly enough. It may not be amiss to give a few instances of the hardships the notice to the companies and the institution of certificates of domicile have caused. As I said in a previous communication, the bubonic plague has come in very useful. The severe Quarantine Act of Natal renders it very risky for any steamer from India to take Indian passengers; consequently, for months past, the steamship companies in Bombay, so it appears, have been absolutely refusing to book passengers for Natal. The loss and inconvenience that have bee
 n. caused, particularly to Indian merchants, owing to the inability of their partners or servants to secure a passage for Natal, are serious. The Government have been often approached to grant relief, but they have sheltered themselves under the statement that they could not give any assurance to the steamship companies, but that they would treat every arrival from the Indian ports on its own merits. The Delagoa Bay authorities have unfortunately caught the bubonic fever craze, and, yielding to the hysterical cry in Natal, have of late returned steamers with Indian passengers back without landing even cargo. They have no prejudice; but because people in the neighbouring Colonies have been shouting that the sanitation there is rotten, and supervision of cases of infectious diseases more so, they have been managing things in a most high-handed manner. The s.s. Kanzler brought a large number of Indian passengers a fortnight ago from Bombay. She was ordered to return. In the meantime, an Indian gentleman, who had his clerk on board, approached Portuguese authorities and induced them to let his clerk land—to bring whom, it is  said,  the   Government  tug   was  specially   sent!  This   is,   indeed,
 
 humorous—only, it is also very distressing. It shows the Portuguese freedom from bias against the Indians, and it also shows that in the presence of weakness they would commit an injustice.
 Such is the unfortunate lot of the poor Indian in South Africa, mainly due to the anti-Indian policy of Natal. But for the Immigration Restriction Act and the Quarantine Act (which, also, in reality is an anti-Indian Act), the wholesale return of steamers bringing Indian passengers, without regard to what that may mean to the Indians, would have been an impossibility. It seems to me, however, that the situation is by no means hopeless. Natal, apart from the Indian  question, has undoubtedly risen to the occasion during the present crisis; so much so that Mr. Chamberlain, in his great speech, lately, paid a well-deserved tribute to the Colony. The Volunteers have been fighting the Imperial cause unflinchingly. The Ministers have given their entire support to the Imperial Government. Newcastle, Charlestown and Dundee, principal towns in the Colony, had to be entirely evacuated on the shortest notice; and the British, including, of course, the British Indians, merchants and others, realised the position and, leaving all their belongings, vacated those places with quiet resignation. All this shows intense attachment to the Throne. If only, therefore, the European Colonists could be induced to see that their attachment would be incomplete unless justice was done  to  the Indians, they would not fail to respond. There is no mistaking the sign of the wave of Imperial unity. The present war is entirely in the interests of the Uitlanders, whose sufferings may be said to fade into insignificance when compared with those of the Indians. The Volunteers who have gone to the front to fight for the Queen’s cause are mostly those who took the most prominent part in the now notorious anti-Indian demonstration of 1897 in Durban. Some local English-speaking Indians met together a few days ago, and decided that because they were British subjects, and as such demanded rights, they ought to forget their domestic differences, and irrespective of their opinion on the justice of the war, render some service, no matter how humble, on the battlefield during the crisis, even if it were to act as bearers of the wounded in the Volunteer camp. Most of these plucky youths are clerks, and well brought up, and by no means inured to a hard life. They have offered their services without pay, unconditionally, to the Government or the Imperial authorities, stating that they do not know how to handle arms, andthat they would consider it a privilege if they could perform some duty, even menial,
 on the battlefield. The Indian merchants have come forward to support the families of those who may need help. The Government have returned a very courteous reply, saying that, should occasion arise, they would avail themselves of the services offered.
 It strikes me that neither the Indian public nor the steamship companies have taken the trouble to study the Immigration Restriction Act; for, notwithstanding the Government notice above referred to, there is no reason for the companies to decline to take Indian passengers altogether. They can safely take such as can read and write English fairly well, and there should be no hesitation in taking any Indian passengers who would give them an undertaking, depositing money, if necessary, to the effect that, if they are not allowed to land in Natal, they would at their own expense return or disembark at the next port of call. . Our great companies should either themselves give such facilities as are in their power to poor Indian passengers, or should be made to do so by our public bodies, such as the Chambers of Commerce, within whose province such matters lie specially. I trust they will give sympathetic consideration to the suggestion offered.

      [DURBAN, 
    DEAR 	MR. PALMER,  post 	November 13, 1899] 
  	I thank you very much for your kind note which is a surprise to me.libtech_387_footnoteI would, if it is possible, like to know the names of 	the ladies who went to collect and of the ‘Arabs’ who declined 	to assist.  	It is just possible the men did not know the ladies or the true aim 	of the fund.  	Before the Indians offered their services to the Imperial 	authorities for active service on the battlefield, I went over to 	Mr. Jameson and asked him whether it was advisable to make the 	offer. He seemed disinclined to advise it owing to the inability of 	the volunteers to handle arms, but suggested a contribution to the 	fund referred to in    
 your note. Ever since, I have been thinking of inducing the leading Indians to make a small collection. But, as you know, the offer has been made, one of the conditions of which is to support the families of the volunteers during active service. The fund started for this purpose and the terrible strain thousands of Indian refugees haveput upon the purse of the Indian merchants have rendered it necessary for the merchants to discriminate in subscribing to various funds.
 However, I am awaiting an opportunity of drawing more generally the attention of the Indians to the fund in question.
 Please assure the self-sacrificing ladies that no Indian could have declined to assist from want of sympathy. We are all fired by one spirit, viz., the imperial, and we all know what sacrifice volunteers and those they have left behind have committed. The existence-it be so— of a few selfish persons need not, in my humble opinion, cause us to think uncharitably of the whole class to which they may belong. And, after all, the Coolies are as much Indians as Arabs.

DURBAN,
  November 	18, [1899]  	Nothing of what I have so far written on the position of the British 	Indians in South Africa deserves that consideration which the matter 	I am about to deal with in this letter ought to do. One of the four 	Acts the Natal Legislature passed in 1897, in indecent hurry and at 	a time when the fury of the Durban mob had hardly subsided, was that 	known as the Dealers’ Licenses Act. The Act gives absolute 	discretion to the Licensing Officers appointed under it to issue or 	refuse a wholesale or a retail license, whether to trade as a 	shopkeeper or as a hawker, his decision being subject to review by 	the Town Council or the Town Board, which have the power to appoint 	him. There is no right of appeal against a decision of these bodies, 	sitting as a Court of Appeal in such license cases. The penalty for 	carrying on a trade without a license is £20, in default of which 	the magistrates have the power to send the defaulter to gaol— not 	under the Act itself, but under the powers reserved to the 	magistrates under another law for cases where imprisonment is not 	specifically mentioned. It was hoped that the depriving the Supreme 	Court of the Colony of jurisdiction over all bodies exercising 	judicial functions would be found by the Privy Council to be 	illegal; but, as the reader may remember, that body has decided 	otherwise. The Supreme Court has also decided that licenses issued 	under the Act are personal only, and, therefore,  although they may 	be held, say by a company, the sale of its goodwill would not carry 	with it the right to trade under the Company’s license during the 	remainder of the license period. Thus, there is no loophole left 	under the Act, and the judicial interpretation has narrowed down the 	rights of the parties affected thereby to the smallest compass. The 	poor Indians have sent petitions—two to the Colonial Secretary and 	one to Lord Curzon, on whom they have built very large hopes. No 	reply has as yet been received from the Viceroy, and none from the 	Colonial Secretary to the last petition, except an intimation by the 	Natal Government to the effect that the Colonial Office was in 	correspondence with them in the matter.  	It would be safe to say that there are over 300 Indian store or 	shopkeeper’s licenses and about 500 Indian hawker’s licenses in 	the    
 Colony of Natal. The holders of these form the respectable portion of the Indian community, and represent the 4,000 free Indians in the Colony, as distinguished from about 50,000 Indians  who  were brought into Natal under indenture as labourers, and their  descendants. In its operation the Act has ruined many Indian storekeepers, and unsettled the minds of all of them. In certain cases the Incensing Officers have taken the greatest liberties with the Act, and it would not at all be an exaggeration to say that they have used their power in an arbitrary and tyrannical manner, and that the Licensing Boards have connived at and, at times, encouraged and even dictated, their actions. Not only have new licenses been refused, transfers of old licenses prohibited and renewals of old licenses not allowed, but insult in some cases has been added to injury, while the injured parties have felt absolutely powerless. An old Indian settler, who had risen from the status of a labourer to that of a respectable trader, removed from an up-country district where he  had  been trading for several years, to Durban, bought a piece of property, and thought he would take out a license in Durban in the Indian portion of the town, where he was to cater principally for Indian customers. He applied for a license, showed he had engaged a European book-keeper to keep his books, and produced certificates as to respectability and honesty from three  well-known  European merchants who had dealt with him; but the Licensing Officer declined to grant the license. The matter was taken in appeal before the Durban Town Council, and the Licensing Officer was asked by the applicant’s attorney to give reasons for his refusal. He declined to do so. The Town Council upheld the decision of the  Licensing  Officer,  and would not even make him his reasons. While the case was being conducted, the Court (i.e., the Town Council), the Licensing Officer (who was the respondent) and the Town Solicitor retired to a private room for consultation, and on return, forgetting that the counsel s address was still to be heard, the Council announced their decision upholding their Officer’s action. The applicant’s counsel drew their attention to the irregularity, and the farce of addressing a Court that had made up its mind was allowed to be gone through— with no better result.
 The persevering applicant took the case before the Supreme Court which, while it declined to interfere with the decision of the Town Council —having no power to do so under the Act—quashed the whole proceedings, and sent the case back for rehearing, with the
 direction that the appellant was entitled to reasons for refusal. To the Acting Chief Justice:
 It seemed . . . that the action of the Town Council in this case had been oppressive. It seemed to him that the refusal of both requests [for a copy of
 the record and reasons] was unjudicial and an improper proceeding. Justice Mason, the first Puisne Judge,
 considered the proceedings under appeal were a disgrace to the Town Council, and he did not hesitate to use this strong language. He considered under the circumstance that it was an abuse of words to say there had been an appeal to the Town Council.
 So the Town Council reheard the appeal, and  made  the Licensing Officer give his reasons, which were that “the applicant had no claim whatever upon Durban, as the class of trade he was engaged in was sufficiently provided for in the town.” The decision was the same as on the previous occasion, and the unfortunate man has to remain without his license. I understand that now he is a poor man, having been obliged to live on his capital. The reason was, in plain words, absolutely false, many licenses to Europeans having since been granted, and the application having been in respect of a place that was vacated by an Indian storekeeper who had left  Durban.  Another Indian who, it was proved, was a Colonist of fifteen years’ standing, lived in a decent style, had large businesses in several parts of the Colony, and had good credit with a number of European firms, also applied for a license —with the same unsuccessful result. The real reason was forced out for the first time during the hearing of his appeal. The Licensing Officer said:
 The Act 18 of 1897 as I understand was passed with a view of placing some check on the issue of trading licenses to certain classes of people generally regarded as undesirables, and as I believe I am right in assuming that the applicant in question is one that would be included in that class, and, moreover, as he has never before had a license in Durban, I have felt it my duty  to refuse his license.
 One of the councillors, in approving of the decision of the Licensing Officer, said:
 The reason was not because the applicant or the premises  were unsuitable, but because the applicant was an Indian. . . . Personally he considered the refusal of the license a grievance to the applicant, who was a most suitable person to appear before the Council to ask for a license.
 Another councillor would not take part in the proceedings because he
 disagreed with the dirty work they (councillors) were called upon to do. If the burgesses wished all such licenses stopped, there was a clean way of going about the
 matter: viz., getting the Legislative Assembly to enact a measure  against  the  granting of licenses to the Indian community. But sitting as a Court of Appeal, unless there were good grounds to the contrary, the license should be granted.
 But, of course, it was not, as the anti-Indian element was too strong in the Council. The Newcastle Town Council took away at one stroke almost all the Indian licenses in 1898. It was then that the matter was taken to the Supreme Court, and thence to the  Privy Council, which decided that there was no appeal from the Town Council’s decisions under the Act. This year it has granted most of the Indian licenses, and it must also be said to its credit that, while the question was pending before the Privy Council, it allowed the Indians concerned to carry on their trade. The Chairman of the Dundee Local Board, in dealing with a similar appeal, said he would not give the applicant even “the chance of a dog”. The same Board, moreover, passed a resolution last year instructing the Licensing  Officer  to cancel as many Indian licenses as possible. This was too much for even the public press of Natal, and a hint was given that the Board was going too far. The result was in a measure satisfactory, and licenses have been granted this year, though with the proviso that they would not be renewed next year in respect of the same building. In another respect, two Indian merchants sold their business to Indians and asked for a transfer of license, which was refused—the decision  being upheld in appeal by the Local Board. In some parts of the Colony, licenses granted last year have been withheld this year. Such, in a brief outline, is the effect of the Act in question. As a result of the correspondence between the Colonial Office and the Natal Government, the latter have told the different local bodies that, unless they exercised their powers with better discretion so as not to affect vested interests, the right of appeal to the Supreme Court would be given to the aggrieved parties. This letter officially admits  the grievance and also approves of the remedy suggested by the Indians. But the three Municipalities of Natal take the letter for what it is worth, and hardly listen to such a threat of the Natal Government. Neither the Licensing Officers nor the Town Councils are much to blame in the matter. They are merely victims. Any body of persons placed under similar circumstances would act in the same manner as the Natal Licensing Officers and Boards. The Officers are either Town Clerks or Town Treasurers and, therefore, as the Chief Justice remarked in the case referred to above, hardly independent of those bodies, the members of which, in their turn, depend for their offices on the
 goodwill of the people that are directly opposed to the Indians. And to these bodies the Natal Legislative Assembly has said:
 We leave the Indian entirely at your mercy. You may, without your action being called in question by any body, either let them earn an honest living in your midst or deprive them of it without any compensation whatever.
 So long, therefore, as the Act, which is admitted by all, including even the Natal politicians, to be opposed to free-trade and  the cherished principles of the British Constitution, is allowed to blot the Statute-book of the Colony, so long will the grievances remain, the Government letters, like the one mentioned above, addressed to the Corporations notwithstanding. The Indians very reasonably say: “Impose what sanitary restrictions you like on us; let our books be kept in English, if you will; introduce, if so minded, other tests which we may reasonably be expected to fulfil; but, after we have complied with all the requirements, allow us to continue to earn our living and, if there be interference on the part of the Officers administering the law, give us the right of appeal to the highest judicial tribunal in the land.” It is difficult, indeed, to find fault with such a position, and more so to understand the distrust of the Natal Legislature in the Supreme Court of the Colony. This licensing question is a festering sore which needs must be healed. It affects the present Indian population, and fairly promises to ruin it unless there is timely intervention. The petty Indian traders are surely, if slowly, being weeded out unnoticed. This tells very materially upon their feeders— the large Indian firms and their dependants. Indian landlords have an anxious time of it, as their premises, however well-constructed they may be, cannot be let, as no one would have them when the licenses cannot be got. The current year is fast approaching its end, and the Indians are all anxiously waiting to know how they will fare next year as to the renewal of their licenses, The war is depopulating Natal, and no one knows when business may be resumed and people may be able to return to their homes. Still, it might be as well for the Indian public to remain on the alert, and by well-sustained efforts to see that this evil, at any rate, is removed before it is too late, and before the Indians in Natal, through sheer suppression, are unable even to let their voice be heard in India.

           MY 	LORD,     [DURBAN,  prior 	to December 	11, 1899] 
  	Revd. Dr. Booth informs that in Your Lordship’s opinion he ought 	not to join the Indian Ambulance Corps unless he feels strongly and 	there is real need for him. He says also that he  will  not  	accompany the Corps for the present but may do so if there is a real 	need for him.  	In my humble opinion, Dr. Booth is indispensable  for  the Corps. 	His knowledge of medicine was of the greatest value to us, and if 	Dr. Booth did not accompany us, we, a Corps of nearly 1000 men, 
 would be without a medical adviser. I do not mention the great confidence he wouldinspire in the Ambulance leaders,  whom  he knows and has trained under him. In the treatment of the wounded that might be entrusted to the care of the leaders, Dr. Booth’s services, Your Lordship will agree, will be inestimable. His place can be filled here, in the ambulance camp there would be a gap without him.
 I understand Dr. Booth is not leaving the mission, at any rate, till June next and, seeing that he is not likely to be required at the front any great length of time, perhaps Your Lordship will be pleased to grant the necessary permission.
 I remain,
 Your L’s obedient servant

 The Hon. Mr. Harry Escombe, Premier of Natal in 1897, invited at his residence in Johannesburg the leaders of the Indian Ambulance Corps proceeding that day to the front. The following is a brief press report of the speech Gandhiji made at Mr. Escombe’s request.
 [JOHANNESBURG,]
 December 13, 1899
 When the ultimatum was presented by the Transvaal, some of them thought it was a time when they should sink all differences, and, as they insisted upon rights and privileges as subjects of the Queen, do something to prove their loyalty. Very few of them could handle arms, although, if the Ghoorkas or the Sikhs had been there, they would have shown what they could do in the way of fighting. They— that is the English-speaking Indians—came to the conclusion that they would offer their services to the Colonial or Imperial Government, unconditionally and absolutely without payment, in any capacity in which they could be useful, in order to show the Colonists that they were worthy subjects of the Queen. They called a meeting, and at that time there was so much enthusiasm shown that almost  everyone present put their names on the list as willing to serve, and from that list they had chosen suitable men. He asked Dr. Prince to examine them to know how many were fit to serve on the battlefield. Dr. Prince passed 25, and they sent the list of names to the Government, but got the reply that at that time their services could not be accepted. Shortly after this, ambulance classes were started by Dr. Booth and they had been attending his lectures almost every night. The Government had intimated that they required 50 to 60 Indians to go to the front, and on the Protector coming to him, he said that they were ready at a moment’s notice to do whatever was needed of them, and that, without remuneration of any kind. The Colonial Secretary, however, did not think the work suitable for them, and on hearing this, Dr. Booth wrote to the Colonial Secretary and gave him an idea of the work they could do; Dr. Booth was then kind enough to go with him to Maritzburg, where they saw Bishop Baynes and, also, Colonel Johnston. The latter thought they would do admirably to act as leaders for the Indians engaged as bearers. Their dream had been realised, and although, unfortunately, they were not to be engaged in the fighting line, he hoped they would be able to discharge their duties well. To Dr. Booth they were very grateful for what he had done, and he also had offered
 his services gratis to the Government, and was going with them that night.

Gandhi, Secretary of the Indian Congress, in supporting 	the resolutionlibtech_411_footnotelibtech_412_footnotesaid that they were deeply grateful for the splendid 	response which had been made to the invitations issued to the 	European community in Durban. They had response also  from Indians 	in Umzinto, Verulam and other centres. There was some talk of a 	special meeting being held by the Indians. He thought that the     
 Indians could not be too joyful in connection with the British victories in South Africa, provided they did not become conceited. The Indians had a special interest in this affair. Lord Roberts, the hero of Kandahar,libtech_413_footnotewho was at the head of the forces, and Sir George White, who had conducted the siege of Ladysmith with much gallantry, had been for some long time Commandersin-Chief in India. The Indians would have failed in their duty to themselves if they had not given expression to their feelings at the successes which had attended the feats of the two Generals. He hoped that they would believe him when he said that the want of the knowledge of English language did not prevent Indians from following the course of events with accuracy and interest. It was the Indians’ proudest boast that they were British subjects. If they were not, they would not have had a footing in South Africa.

125,"March 14, 1900",INDIAN AMBULANCE CORPS IN NATALlibtech_414_footnote,"
  
 [DURBAN,
 post March 14, 1900] General Sir William Olpherts is reported to have said:
 While fully sharing the enthusiasm for the bravery of  our  troops fighting in South Africa, I think that sufficient attention has not been called to the devotion of the Indian dhoolie-bearers who do. their work of mercy on the battlefields. Under the heaviest fire they seek the  wounded,  fearing nothing, although without means of defence. These Indian fellow-subjects of ours are doing in Natal a work which requires even more courage than that of the soldier.
 Since sending my last contribution,libtech_415_footnoteI have been twice to   the front; and though what General Olpherts said of the dhoolie-bearers could not be said of all the Indian Ambulance Corps, I have no doubt that the Corps has done a work that was absolutely necessary, and that would do credit to any Ambulance Corps in the world. I referred in my letter, dated October 27th, to the unconditional offer, without pay,
 
 
 of the English-speaking Indians of Durban to do service on the battlefield. Since then, events have happened which resulted in its acceptance. It was anticipated that the battle of Colenso would claim not a few lives, and that the safe carrying of the seriously wounded would be a grave problem, as the limited number of European ambulance bearers would not be equal to the required strain. General Buller, therefore, wrote to the Natal Government, asking them to raise an Indian Ambulance Corps, which would not be required to work within the range of fire. The managers of the various plantations (which control much Indian labour), as well as the leaders of the Indian community, were approached by the Government, and the response was prompt. A Corps of over 1,000 Indian stretcher-bearers was formed in less than three days, the bearers receiving 20s. per week as against 35s. per week received by the European bearers. It  is  worthy of mention that the sturdy band of leaders began their work under exceptionally happy auspices. the late Mr. Escombe, who was sometime Prime Minister of Natal and represented the Clolony at the Conference of Colonial Premiers at the time of the Diamond Jubilee, gave a reception in his house to the volunteers, where the Mayor of Durban, Mr. Pakeman of the Johannesburg Leader, and other ladies and gentlemen were invited, and in his address—which was his last public utterance— . spoke words of encouragement to them, and generously observed that Natal could not forget the loyal services that the Indian community in its own way was rendering to the Colony and to the Empire. The Mayor also spoke to the effect. Later, in the same evening,  Mr. Rustomjee  of Durban  gave   a   dinner-party   in honour of the leaders going to the front, when all the prominentIndians representing different divisions sat at  the  same table. The Corps reached Chieveley at about 3.30 p. m. on December 15, and as soon as they were detrained, the bearers were given their redcross badges and ordered to march to the field hospital—a distance of over 6 miles. The conditions under which this Corps worked were possibly somewhat more arduous than is usual. Wherever they went, they carried rations for a month or a fortnight, as; the case might be, including firewood, and, at first, without wagons or a water-cart. The Chieveley district is extremely dry, and there is hardly any water to be found within easy distances. The roads all over Natal are rugged and more or less hilly. On reaching the field hospital, we heard of the battle at Colenso. We saw the wounded being brought by the ambulance wagons and the European bearers from the base of
 operations to the field hospital, and the men as well as the leaders fully realised the situation. Before the tents could be pitched (I mean the tents for the leaders and not for the bearers—the latter had to sleep as they could, in the open, in some cases even without blankets), or the men could have anything to eat or drink, the Medical Officer wanted over 50 wounded men carried to Chieveley station. By 11 o’clock at night, all the wounded the Medical Officer could get ready were taken as directed, and it was only after that time that the Corps could get a meal. After this, the Superintendent of the Corps went to the Medical Officer and offered to carry more stretchers, but he was thanked and told to keep the men in readiness at 6 o’clock next morning. Between that time and noon, over 100 stretcher cases were disposed of by the men. While they were returning from their work, orders were received to strike camp and march to Chieveley immediately to entrain there for Estcourt. This was, of course, a retreat. It was wonderful to see how, with clockwork regularity, over 15,000 men with heavy artillery and transports broke camp and marched off, leaving behind nothing but empty tins and broken cases. It was an extremely hot day for marching—this portion of Natal is treeless as well as waterless. The Corps commenced its march at noon under these trying conditions. On reaching the railway station at about 3 o’clock, the station-master informed the Superintendent that he could not say definitely when he could place the carriages—I mean open trucks in which the men were to be packed like sardines—at his disposal. The European Ambulance men and the Indians had to remain about the station yard till 8 p.m. The former were then entrained for Estcourt, and the latter were told to shift for the night as best they could on the veldt. Tired, hungry, and thirsty (there was no water available at the station except for the hospital patients and the station staff), the men had to find means of satisfying both hunger and thirst, and of obtaining some rest. They brought dirty water from a pool about half a mile from the station, cooked rice and by midnight, after partaking of what was, under the circumstances, regarded as an excellent repast, wanted to sleep. Practically the whole of General Buller’s Cavalry passed by during thenight, and the men had very little rest. Next day the men were closely packed in the trucks, and, after five hours’ waiting, the train proceeded to Estcourt where, in a violent storm, exposed to the sun and wind, without shelter, the Corps had to remain for two days, after which orders were received to temporarily disband it. General Wolf-Murray had officially recognised the services rendered by the
 Corps.
 On January 7th, the Corps was reformed and proceeded to Estcourt, this time under somewhat better auspices, in that the nine hundred and odd bearers also were provided with tents. Fully a fortnight elapsed, however, before actual work was commenced. The interval was passed in drilling the men and their leaders under the indefatigable Dr. Booth, who volunteered on the same terms as the leaders (i.e., without any remuneration) to accompany the Corps in the capacity of medical officer. The drill consisted in teaching the bearers how to lift the wounded, and to place and carry them on stretchers. They were taken long distances over extremely rugged ground. All this training was found to be of inestimable value, and none too strict. Thus, fitted as the Corps was more or less for military discipline, it did not find it difficult, when the orders were received at 2 a.m., to entrain for Frere at 6 o’clock in the morning, to break camp, load the two wagons and march to the station within three hours. From Frere a distance of 25 miles had to be covered on foot before the headquarters at Spearman’s Camp could be reached. I shall let the special correspondent of The Natal Witness speak of the experiences and trials of this journey.
 Early in the afternoon, heavy clouds began to bank upon the horizon, and at half past three, a storm seemed imminent. Meanwhile the wagons had arrived and been loaded up. The start was not auspicious. At the first dip between the station and our camping ground, the leading wagon stuck fast and half an hour elapsed before it could be extricated. By that time, a terrific wind had arisen, which appeared to be blowing the threatening thunderstorm away from us to the southward.    In less than three-quarters of an hour, the wind
 suddenly veered, bringing the storm back with tremendous force) and hail along with it.   The hail certainly ceased after a while, but the rain continued
in  a  steady downpour.    At length, it  was decided to halt and wait for the
 wagons, and the rain having now stopped, although the clouds gave evidence of more to follow, ovens were made out of antheaps, at which we endeavoured (for   the   most   part,  unsuccessfully)   to   dry  our  sopping   garments....At 8
 o’clock, just as we were becoming partially dry and recovering our spirits under the influence of the fires, down came the rain again in tropical torrents. All the time, a bitter wind blew, and for discomfort our situation could scarcely have been excelled. The leading wagon had got stuck in a drift from which, owing to the awful state of the road and weather, the combined spans of oxen
 (32) had been quite unable to remove it.    The next morning, fifty stretchers
 went out to the temporary hospital. Here Major Bapty, Secretary of the Principal Medical Officer, sent word to the leaders that it was optional for
 them to take the stretchers or not to the base at Spion Kop, about two miles on the other side of the river, as it was within range of the Boer guns, and he could nor be sure that they would not drop a shell or two on the pontoon bridge. This preliminary was due to the fact that the men were told, as I have said before, that they would have to work without the line of fire. But the leaders and the men were quite ready not to mind the risk and go to the base and undertake the work. By evening almost all the wounded were brought to the stationary hospital, the bearers often having to make three or four journeys from the temporary hospital to the base. Full three weeks were thus passed in almost continuous work, emptying one hospital after another, chiefly the stationary hospital. During the time five journeys were made to Frere, the men three times carrying the wounded the whole distance of 25 miles in a single day, and twice taking them up at or near the little Tugela bridge at Springfield from the European bearers.
 The Corps had the honour of carrying some officers of note— Major-General Woodgate being among them. It was freely remarked each time the “light-footed, elastic-stepped” bearers covered  the whole distance of 25 miles with their charge, under a trying sun and over a difficult road, that they alone could perform the feat. Says the special correspondent of The Natal Witness:
 One hundred miles in five days may be accounted fairly good walking for  a man unburdened with any weight but that of his own carcass and clothes. When the wounded have to be carried on stretchers for nearly  half  that distance, and the greater portion of the remainder is traversed by men Iaden with heavy kit, such marching, I think, will be acknowledged as  very creditable work. Such is the feat lately performed by the Indian Ambulance Corps, and one that any body of men may be proud of.
 Thus honoured and thus satisfied with the thought of having done its duty, the Corps was again temporarily disbanded—but recent events go to show that its services may not be needed again.
 The Indian merchants had supplied the leaders with large quantities of cigarettes, cigars, pipes, and tobacco for the wounded, and these were freely distributed among them. Of course, they were very much appreciated, especially as no cigarettes, etc., could be had in or near the camp. The leaders and the bearers were by no means satisfied with having carried their charge safely and well to their destination; but, at each stopping place during the long marches, even neglecting their own comforts, they left no stone unturned to attend to the wants of the wounded, e.g., helping them to tea and fruit—often doing so with their own money, or from their own rations. Nor is this the only part the Indian community has taken in the war. All the
 leaders who went without pay were not capable of maintaining their dependents during their absence. The Indian merchants, therefore, started a fund which contributed to the support of the families of such leaders as needed it, and at no inconsiderable cost fully equipped the volunteers. In order to still more effectively identify themselves with the patriotic wave, and to show that they are capable of sinking their differences in the face of a common danger, they have subscribed a respectable sum of £65 to the Durban Women’s Patriotic League, a local organisation formed for the purpose of providing medical comforts for the wounded soldiers and volunteers, some of which latter are violent anti Indian Colonists. the Indian ladies have come forward to prepare pillowcases and handkerchiefs for the same purpose, out of cloth furnished by the Indian merchants. Thus speaks The Natal Mercury anent the subscription:
 This gift of money for the Women’s Patriotic Fund, specially for the purpose of assisting in the care of the sick and wounded volunteers at the front, is a very acceptable and eloquent expression of the feeling of the Indian people. It is not enough, in their minds, to succour the large mass of Indian refugees, as they are doing in an open-handed manner, but they must bestow this added contribution, we believe, as a token of their devotion to the Queen-Empress and to the country in which they have come to reside. Nothing can better show the real feeling that animates this portion of our population, who too often have very little said on their behalf, than such a display of loyalty.
 The Indians have entirely taken on their shoulders the maintenance of thousands of Indian refugees not only from the Transvaal but also from the upper districts of Natal which are temporarily in the hands of the enemy. This fact has so much impressed the Colonial mind that the Mayor of Durban made the following public acknowledgement:
 They knew full well that many of the Indian nationality had been compelled to leave their posts and come down here as refugees. They had had a large number arrived, and the Indians had borne the expense themselves. For that he sincerely thanked them.
 It derives, at the present moment, a peculiar importance. The Central Committee in London have cabled withdrawing their support from the able-bodied European refugees, confining it solely  to  women and invalids, and the matter is now taxing to the’ utmost the resources of the Refugee Relief Committee in Durban. It may not be amiss to mention also a few instances of individual sympathy for the
 soldiers. An Indian woman who lives on the daily sale of her fruits is reported, on the soldiers landing at the Durban wharf, to have emptied the whole contents of her basket into Tommy’s truck, saying that was all she could give that day. We are not told where the noble-hearted woman found her food for the day. Similarly, several Indians, in an outburst of enthusiasm are reported to have showered cigarettes and other delicacies on Natal’s fighters from over the waters. When the joyful news of the relief of Kimberley and Ladysmith was flashed across the wire, the Indians vied with the Europeans in their patriotic zeal to celebrate the occasion by decorating their stores, etc. They also held, on the 14th instant, a meeting. The Hon. Sir John Robinson, K.C.M.G., the first Prime Minister of Natal under Responsible Government, was invited to preside on the occasion, and  he  very kindly accepted the invitation. Over a thousand Indians from all parts of the Colony and over sixty leading European citizens attended the meeting.

             DEAR 	. . .     14, MERCURY LANE,  DURBAN,  April 	11, 1900 
  	I enclose herewith a copy of the monthly report of the Indian 	Hospital.  	It was as you know established nearly 18 months ago.libtech_420_footnoteThe need is real, as will appear from the report. All 	sections of the Indian community have received help from the 	hospital. It is a boon to the poor. It 	could not have been opened but for the subscriptions from     
 the Durban Indians, who have subscribed nearly £84, and for the services rendered by Dr. Booth and Dr. Lilian Robinson, now replaced owing to her illness by Dr. Clara Williams.
 As Durban has been bearing the brunt of almost all the subscriptions, it may not be considered out of place to invite the Indians from the other parts of the Colony to enjoy the privilege of succouring the poor in the best possible manner, viz.,  alleviating  bodily sufferings.
 At least £80 are needed to enable the hospital to continue for 2 years and to pay the arrear rent. But a much larger sum is necessary if the hospital is to be continued, as I venture to think it must be, seeing that, during its existence, it has answered a hardfelt need.
 I fully trust that you will give your share and induce others to do likewise.
Receipts will be fully acknowledged and accounts furnished.
 I am, yours truly,

129,"April 	11, 1900",AN APPEAL FOR FUNDSlibtech_421_footnote,"
               SIR,     14, MERCURY LANE,  DURBAN,  April 	11, 1900   You all 	know that a hospital for Indians was opened in Durban 
  	about a year and a half ago. Dr. Booth and another doctor work in it 	in an honorary capacity. Prior to the opening of the hospital, a 	meeting was held in Durban at which it was decided that Indians 	should contribute £85 per annum as rental charges. This arrangement 	was to hold good for a period of two years. A fund was immediately 	raised and a sum of £6l collected. The balance of, £24 is still to 	be collected. But this amount will not suffice to meet the expenses. 	Over nine months’ rent is in arrears. As Durban has contributed to 	many funds, it is not proper to put the responsibility for the 	remaining amount on it alone. Hence this letter.    
 A report of the working of the hospital for the first six months is enclosed from which you will see the usefulness of the institute.
 Madrasi women entering it in a very serious condition have come out cured. The Gujaratis also have benefited from it. No community has been left out. Free medicine is supplied to hundreds of patients who deposit some amount, according to their capacity, in the charity box kept for the purpose; even those who  cannot contribute anything receive medicine. Medicines are bought out of the box collections and the deficit, if any, is met by the missionaries.
 If we are not able to help, the hospital will have to be closed down. As the two doctors serve honorarily, it is being run at a small cost and many poor people benefit from it. A blind, old, infirm Gujarati gentleman received free treatment in the hospital for many days.
 You ought to spare whatever you can for such a cause and also collect contributions from others and forward them. Receipts will be issued for any money received. I hope you will exert yourself to the utmost."

  April 	18 [1900]  	Perhaps, in reading the accounts published from day to day of the 	Boer War, you have Showed the movements of the Indian community in 	connexion with it in so far as they have been chronicled by the 	newspapers But, I am also aware that the Press has not been able to 	give anything like a full account of the doings of the Indians in 	South Africa. I need hardly say that, as soon as war was declared, 	irrespective of their opinions as to the justness or otherwise of 	the war, the Indians to a man made up their minds to give their 	humble support to the British Government during the crisis; and, as 	the immediate result of this sentiment, an extremely will attended 	meeting of the English-speaking Indians of Durban was held, and as    
 many as could signed, there and then, a declaration offering their services to the military authorities, unconditionally and without pay to do any work that they may be Considered fitted for especially mentioning the field hospital and commissariat departments, and recording the fact that they did not know the use of arms.
 The offer was ultimately accepted in connexion with the Indian Ambulance Corps which, at the instance of the military authorities, was formed in Natal. The bearers for the Corps consisted mostly of indentured Indians supplied by the Estates in Natal, through the Protector’s Department, and through the above-mentioned volunteers who were to act as leaders of the parties of  stretcher-bearers,  the Indians being perfectly free either to go to the battlefield or not. Thus about 1,000 Indian bearers, and thirty leaders (no more of the latter being really necessary), carried the wounded after the battle of  Colenso, and by their arduous work commanded the admiration of all concerned and more than satisfied the patients themselves. It  was  freely acknowledged by the European Superintendent of the Corps and other Europeans who came with it that, without the leaders, the carrying could not be done with saticfaction. The Corps, having been formed only for the advance to Ladysmith through Colenso, was disbanded after the reverse, and Was reformed when General Buller tried to force passage through Spion Kop.
 The nature of the work this time was, if possible, more exacting undoubtedly, more risky. The Indians, contrary to the announcement that they were to work without the range of fire, had to fetch the Wounded from within the range, at times shells falling within hardly 100 yards of them, all this, of course, being unavoidably due to the unexpected reverseat Spion Kop and retirement from Vaalkranz. The bearers and the leaders had to march with their charge to a distance of twenty-five miles, from Spearman’s Camp to Frere, over the Natal roads which, as you are aware, are very rough and hilly, at one time doing a distance of over 125 miles in a week. Moreover, our Indian merchants supplied cigarettes, etc., for the wounded, which was quite a feature of the Indian Corps. Many Europeans who ought to know have told me that no European Ambulance Corps could cover the distance of twenty-five miles, carrying the wounded under such difficult circumstances, in a single day, which our Indian bearers and their leaders did in the face of serious difficulties about food and shelter.
 Not being satisfied with this work, and in order that our merchants may be still more effectively identified with the patriotic feeling, and in order to show that we were quite capable of sinking our local differences at a time of common danger, a substantial fund to the amount of £65 was collected by them and handed over to the Durban Women’s Patriotic League, which is a local organisation for supplying medical comforts to the wounded soldiers and volunteers, some of the latter being violently anti-Indian Colonists. Our Indian ladies prepared handkerchiefs and pillow-cases out of cloth supplied by our merchants for the wounded. All the Indian refugees, counting thousands, have been entirely supported by the Indian community—a fact that has elicited from the Mayor of Durban a public acknowledgement of gratefulness, and this fact becomes the more important in view of what is going on at present. The Refugee Relief Committee find it very difficult to adequately maintain even the European refugees. The Central Committee in London has cabled withdrawing the support hitherto given as well to the able-bodied men as to the women and infirm men. When the welcome news of the relief of Kimberley and Ladysmith was received, the Indians, side by side with the Europeans, marked their sense of joy by closing their shops, decorating their stores, etc. They also held a public meeting. Sir John Robinson, who was the first Prime Minister of Natal under responsible government, was invited to preside for the occasion, which invitation the Honourable gentleman very kindly accepted. The meeting was a brilliant success and was attended by about 1,000 Indians representing all parts of the Colony, and over sixty leading Europeans.

 DEAR SIR,
 You have shown your patriotism and brought honour to yourself and your country by joining the Indian Ambulance Corps as a leader and have thereby rendered service both to your own self and your motherland. It will, therefore, behove you to look upon that as a reward in itself.
 But I have a feeling that you enlisted partly out of regard for me and to that extent I am beholden to you. I cannot compensate you for
 it in terms of money as I have no power to do so. But I have not forgotten your act of regard for me and, as a memento for the assistance you gave me in serving the motherland at a critical juncture,  I offer you the gift of my services, which please accept. I hope you will make such use of them as you can. I promise to take up without fee any legal work that I can do in Durban for you or for your friends to the extent of £5 during the course of a year from today, while I remain in South Africa and do not leave for India.

 DURBAN,
 June 29, 1900
 We the undersigned Indian subscribers place on record on the eve of your withdrawal from Indian work in this Colony, the sense of gratitude the Indian community owes you for your many acts of charity and kindness. To the poor among us you have been a friend and benefactor, irrespective of creed or caste. Many of us know from personal experience how we could rely upon your free medical assistance at all times. Your gentleness and kind sympathy have often succeeded  where  medicine  alone  would   fail.   The  Indian  Hospital,
 
 which was the direct result of your 17 years’ labour in alleviating human suffering, is a standing testimony to your work in  that direction.
 Your services in connection with the Indian Ambulance Corps, the training you were good enough to give the ambulance class, also much sacrifice of time, the willingness with which you offered to accompany the corps in spite of pressing duties in Durban, your medical aid to bearers at the front and your counsel to the leaders, can hardly be overvalued by the Indian community.
 We may say without exaggeration that you have presented to us a pattern of an upright Englishman and good, gentle Christian who knows no distinction between Jew and Gentile. The fact that half the number of Indian schools owe their existence to your energy is an indication of your efforts on behalf of the masses.
 It is hard for us to tender you, unmixed with sorrow, our congratulations on your preferment. Umtata’s gain is our loss. You leave behind you a gap; it will be difficult to fill. The congregation of your church may find an equally eloquent preacher and as safe a guide, but where shall your congregation find so faithful, sympathetic and tried a friend whom they have learnt to know and love for close upon two decades? As a slight token of our esteem for you, we beg of you to accept this address and the accompanying purse for the benefit of your Indian Hospital.
 We wish you and Mrs. Booth a happy time in your new sphere and pray that the Almighty may long spare you and your wife to continue your work of love.

138,"July 	30, 1900",THE INDIAN FAMINE,"
           TO  THE 	EDITOR        DURBAN,  July 	30, 1900 
  The 	Natal Advertiser  SIR,  	The Natal Emigration Agent at Calcutta has forwarded to the 	Protector of Indian Immigrants leaflets for distribution among the 	indentured Indians and those that have become free and settled in 	the Colony, appealing for funds in aid of the relief of the terrible 	famine now raging in India. This appeal, in my opinion, has an awful 	meaning. It shows the intensity of the calamity; it shows also that, 	in spite of the resources of a great Empire, it has been found 	necessary to ask even poor Indians to contribute their quota.  	It will be recollected that in 1896, when India was visited by a 	widespread famine, a direct appeal was made to the Mayor in South 	Africa, to which a prompt response was made from all parts of the    
 continent.libtech_430_footnotelibtech_431_footnoteThis time, evidently, there has been no such direct appeal made, owing to the distress which we are undergoing ourselves. The same cause has prevented the Indian community in Natal, which has narrowly kept itself in touch with the situation in India and which has so far contented itself with having forwarded subscriptions to the branch office in India, from placing it before the Colonists generally. But the Viceroy of India has sent a fresh, pathetic appeal to the Lord Mayor of London, which urges every part of the great Empire to come to the rescue. The receipt of copies of the appeal and the simultaneous arrival of the leaflets from Calcutta change the aspect very materially, and, in my humble opinion, makes it incumbent upon the Indian community here, not only to make a fresh effort itself, but also to bring the matter, at any rate, to the notice of the Colonists, so as to enable them to exercise the privilege (shall I call it) of helping millions of their starving fellow-beings, who are, moreover, subjects of the same Queen as themselves. It will be, at the same time, exceedingly improper to ignore the fact that the Colony has suffered, and will yet have to suffer, a great deal owing to the war. But I may be pardoned for saying that our State is very prosperous compared to the miserable conditions of the millions in India, who have to be engaged in a war in which there is no victory to be gained, in which, probably, the only reward is a painful and lingering death. One penny would just feed a man for a day in the disaster area in India. Is there  a  man  in theColony Who cannot, without any inconvenience, spare a shilling, and thus be the means of feeding 12 hungry mouths for a day? Though, therefore, it is quite true that many individual  members cannot give very large sums, hundreds, even thousands, can give at least a few shillings each.libtech_432_footnote
 The Lord Bishop of Natal has dwelt on the good that the War, bad as it is, has done, in that it has brought closer together the various parts of the mighty Empire to Which it is our pride to belong. It may be that the threefold scourge in India—viz., famine, plague and cholera—black as it is, will be the means of forging another link in the chain that ties all together.
 
 Close on 6,000,000 of the famine-stricken in India have to be daily supported through the State, not to mention the flow of private charity, which saves tens of thousands of lives. Mr. Adamji Peerbhoy alone supported, according to The Times of India, during the month of May last, 16,300 men per day. The number of those seeking relief, according to Dr. Klopsch, increases by 10,000 per day.
 The welcome rains that have watered the greater part of the afflicted area, will, for the present, increase the numbers to be relieved and put a heavier strain on the resources of the State, both in men and money. The plague has been doing its work of destruction unremittingly for the last four years, and the cholera fiend, the right hand of famine, has completed the havoc, Besides the various British Colonies and Settlements, America has raised a fund and sent a special representative, Dr. Klopsch, to administer it. Germany has also come to the rescue. India’s misery is such as all friends and strangers alike may assist in alleviating. Why not Natal?
 In conclusion, it is my pleasant duty to announce that His Excellency the Governor of Natal, the Honourable the Attorney- General, and the Honourable Sir John Robinson have showed great sympathy for the starving millions of India, and promised to patronise any fund that may be raised on their behalf.

 The Mahomedans, British Moslems of Natal, are preparing for presentation an address to H. M. the Sultan of Turkey as the Spiritual Head of that community, on the approach of his Silver Jubilee. I have
 
 been asked to advise as to the best way of sending the address, and it strikes me that the more formal and proper way would be to send it through His Excellency the Governor as it is to another sovereign in Europe from the Queen’s subjects.
 I shall be obliged if you will be good enough to guide me as to the etiquette. As the address must leave on Saturday next, I shall esteem it a favour if you will kindly advise me early.
 I have the honour to be, Sir,
 your obedient servant,

 I have the honour to enclose copies of correspondencelibtech_433_footnotethat has passed between the Immigration Restrictions Officer and myself in connection with an application for a certificate of domicile. The rule referred to therein seems to have been passed only lately.
 I venture to think I have but to bring it to the notice of the Government to secure its relief. I have not been fortunate enough to obtain fromthe Immigration Officer the reasons which led to the passing of the rule. But, in my humble opinion, there  could  be  nothing to justify the passing of such a drastic rule which, in practice, would prevent even the bone fide Indian residents of Natal from coming to the Colony.
 I would, therefore, be obliged if the Government would be pleased to instruct the Immigration Restrictions Officer to withdraw

 TO
 THE HONOURABLE THE COLONIAL SECRETARY PIETERMARITZBURG
 SIR,
 I have the honour to acknowledge your letter of the 14th instant regarding the application for a certificate of domicile for one Dosa Desa.
I regret to trouble you in the matter again.
 I tried to obtain from the Immigration Restrictions Officer information as to the causes that led to the introduction of the rule in question, but failed.
 It is quite possible that some people have abused the previous practice and if the abuse, assuming that it exists, was brought to the notice of the Indians generally, in my humble opinion, it could be mitigated, if not altogether stopped. If affidavits have been made falsely, the culprits could be legally punished. But the rule in question, though it may not be a hard and fast one, will, it is submitted, be a great hardship, especially to the poorer. As it is, they are put to considerable expense in getting the certificates, but the new rule would put unnecessary obstacles in their way. In practice, it is hardly possible to expect men to apply from India for certificates. It takes as a rule 30 days and often longer for a letter to reach India and, if there was any flaw in an affidavit, it is difficult to say how long it would not take before a certificate could be issued. Moreover, it is hardly to be expected that the limited number of Indians who may be known to the Immigration Officer as respectable could know the persons for whom
 certificates of domicile may be required.
 Under the circumstances, I submit that the rule should be withdrawn altogether and the ordinary procedure may be adopted to meet the abuse, if any, of the Immigration Restriction Act,libtech_437_footnoteunder the old practice of issuing certificates.
 I may mention that my client, the applicant for the certificate, Dosa Desa, is much inconvenienced owing to the delay in obtaining the certificate.

 your obedient servant,

 TO
 THE HONOURABLE THE COLONIAL SECRETARY PIETERMARITZBURG
 SIR,
 I have the honour to acknowledge your letter of the 29th instant with reference to the application for a certificate of domicile for one Dosa Desa.
 I notice that the Government presume the existence of a rule for departing from which no sufficient reasons appear to them to have been shown. The fact is, the rule complained against is an innovation on the established practice for the introduction of which  the community immediately concerned with it has been furnished with no reasons and the source of which it still does not know.
 May I, then, enquire how the Immigration Act has been evaded under the recently existing practice?
 I venture to think that the innovation is causing an amount of inconvenience the measure of which the Government do not realize.
 
 If it affected only persons who may leave the Colony hereafter, it may not cause any hardship, but hundreds of Indians, who knew nothing of it when they went to India and who  require  such certificates, would find it very difficult to come to the  Colony  although they have a right to enter it.

 NOTES ON THE PRESENT POSITION OF THE BRITISH INDIANS IN
 SOUTH AFRICAlibtech_438_footnote
 [Post September 3, 1900]libtech_439_footnoteA suggestion has been made that the friends in England of the Indian settlers in South Africa should be put in possession of the latest
facts regarding their grievances, so as to enable them to place the
 matter for consideration before the proper authorities, in view of the pending settlement of South African affairs. It has also been suggested that a memorial to the Colonial Secretary, backed up by public meetings, should be promoted in order that it may strengthen the hands of the workers in England. After mature consideration, the latter plan has been dropped. There are sound reasons for the belief that, if adopted, it will be misunderstood here, where the feeling is that until the war is over, and the troubles attendant thereon have entirely disappeared, no questions not arising from the war should  be discussed or considered. Moreover, it is likely that a memorial at the present time would disturb the happy relations which, for the time being, appear to subsist between the European and the Indian communities.
 It is most difficult to say what the future would bring, and whether the old soreness would not be revived as soon as peace is restored. Indeed, there are grounds for the fear that there will be no change in the former attitude. The Natal Witness only a few days ago, in the course of a leading article, said that the services rendered by the local Indians, as ambulance-men and otherwise, should not be allowed to blind the Colonists to the necessity of keeping an ever-vigilant eye en the Indian question, and seeing that the temporary military occupation under Lord Roberts who, owing to his Indian connexion, might entertain pro-Indian views, is not permitted to encroach upon the position Natal has hitherto maintained successfully in restricting Indian immigration and enterprise, and that the services referred to above were rather an acknowledgement by the Indians of the justice of Natal’s position than that they were rendered in spite of their
 
 
 legitimate grievances.
 The Indians formed a Volunteer Stretcher-bearer Corps of over 1,000, each bearer drawing £1 per week, i.e., a little over half the pay drawn by the European stretcher-bearers, assisted by over 30 leaders who served without any remuneration whatsoever, and included the most respectable portion of the community, and who  left  their business or employment to serve their Empress. When they did so, it was clearly stated that it was done in spite of the grievances, because they felt it their duty, at a time like that, to sink the domestic differences. The Indian merchants, if they could not join the Corps, equipped the leaders and maintained the families of such of them as stood in need of help. The Corps served at the fateful battles of Colenso, Spion Kop and Vaalkranz. High praise has been bestowed on the work done by it. Sir John Robinson the first Prime Minister of Natal—has thus spoken of its services:
 With reference to the part played by the Indian community during the crisis, I can only say that it redounds to the credit and patriotism of you all. Reasons which you can well understand forbade the employment of any but British troops in the battle-field. But whatever use could be made of your loyal ardour —what opportunity could be afforded to your eager desire to co-operate in the Empire’s cause—was gladly agreed to by the authorities. Though you were debarred from actual service in the field, you were able to do excellent work in succouring the wounded. I cannot too warmly thank your able countryman, Mr. Gandhi, upon his timely, unselfish and most useful action in voluntarily organising a corps of bearers for ambulance work at the front at a moment when their labours were sorely needed in discharging arduous duties which experience showed to be by no means devoid of peril. All engaged in that service deserve the grateful recognition of the community.
 The Indians contributed what has been called a handsome sum (over £57) to the funds of the Women’s Patriotic League, of which The Natal Marcury says:
 This gift of money for the Women’s Patriotic Fund, especially for the purpose of assisting in the care of sick and wounded volunteers at the front, is  a very acceptable and eloquent expression of the feeling of the Indian people.  It is not enough, in their minds, to succour the large mass of Indian refugees, as they are doing in an open-handed manner, but they must bestow this added contribution, we believe, as a token of their devotion to the Queen-Empress and to the country in which they have come to reside. Nothing can better show the real feeling that animates this portion of our population, who too often have very little said on their behalf, than such a display of loyalty.
The Indian ladies gave their work in the shape of making
 pillowcases, handkerchiefs, etc., for the wounded out of cloth supplied by the Indian merchants over and above the above contribution. The Indians throughout the trying times also maintained  thousands  of their fellow-countrymen, refugees from the Transvaal and the parts of the Colony in Boer occupation, practically without encroaching upon the funds sent from London and raised locally, and administered by the Refugee Relief Committee.
 The Mayor of Durban has acknowledged that service in the following words (spoken in March last):
 The Mayor took the opportunity of thanking the Indian community for their loyalty during the last four months or so. Many of their people had been compelled to leave their abodes in the upper parts of the Colony, and had come down here for refuge. These they had taken amongst themselves; and borne the burden of maintenance at their own expense. For that he thanked them sincerely.
 It may be stated, without any affectation, that these services have been rendered without any intention to secure any reward. If we claimed privileges as British subjects we could not very well shirk the duties of such subjects, which the very humble services undoubtedly were, and, therefore, could carry no reward.
 It might be worthy of note that the local Indians were not behind-hand in materially assisting the Indian Camp Followers’ Fund, initiated by Captain Leumann, I.M.S. They subscribed over £50, and the Colonial-born Indians gave an amateur performance, handing to it the net proceeds thereof to the extent of over £20. As an illustration of the happy relations may be mentioned the great meeting held by the Indians to congratulate the British Generals on the relief of Ladysmith and Kimberley, which was presided over by Sir John Robinson, and attended by over fifty leading European citizens; also, the extremely generous response made by the Europeans in Natal to an appeal for the famine-stricken masses of India, over £2,000 being subscribed by them alone. The Governor is the Patron of the Fund, the Mayor of Durban is the Chairman, the Protector of Indian Immigrants the honorary treasurer, an Indian gentleman the honorary secretary, and leading European planters and merchants on the Committee—a combination that might have been impossible a year ago.
 The above remarks on the feeling regarding the British Indiansin Natal clears the ground for a statement of grievances. It may be as well to read the following summary side by side with the circular
 
 letter dated 27th March, 1897.libtech_440_footnote
 As to the Transvaal and the Orange River Colony, nothing need be said at present, except that it may be confidently expected that none of the grievances which, owing to the past status of the two States, the Colonial Office declared itself powerless to redress however much it sympathised with the Indians, will be allowed to exist in the slightest degree under the new regime where there would not have to be considered even the sentiments of a self-governing Colony as in the case of Natal.
 Zululand, now being part and parcel of Natal, does not require separate mention, though it may be stated that the regulations prohibiting Indian bids at land sales when it was directly under the Crown were withdrawn before it was incorporated with this Colony.
 In Natal, the position remains unchanged. The Immigration Restriction Act is still being enforced as vigorously as it could be under the circumstances. A short statement of its working may not be out of place.
 Under it, no person who is unable to write out, in any of the European languages, an application in the form attached to the Act, can enter the Colony unless he has been previously  domiciled. Notices, for which there is no sanction in the Act itself, have been issued to the shipping companies warning them against taking Indian passengers for Natal unless they are armed with  certificates  of domicile, which were at first issued free of charge on a verbal application either by the person himself or by his friends. A charge of 2s. 6d. was then introduced for its issue. Later on, an affidavit of proof of domicile was required. Then two affidavits were  insisted upon, and proof that the applicant for the certificate had been resident in the Colony at least two years; and the latest innovation is that either the person wishing to enter the Colony must himself apply for a certificate of domicile, or persons of known respectability should tender, under oath, proof of domicile. Thus, it will be seen that the cordon of restriction has grown tighter with the lapse of time. The practical effect of the working of all this is that all but the well-to-do are shut out of the Colony. As to this, it is contended for the Government that it would be no hardship for the persons requiring certificates of domicile to make the application under their own
 
 signatures, as they could always take them out before leaving the Colony. Such an argument would be perfectly sound if the innovation were to affect only those that may hereafter leave the Colony. But it is positively harmful for those that are outside the Colony. A person in India requiring such a certificate may have to wait one year before he could get it. The postal service between India and South Africa is as irregular as it could be; and there is no guarantee that the receipt, by the Immigration Officer, of an application invariably insures the issue of the domicile paper. For, as has often happened before, it is not at all unlikely that it may have to be returned several times to India for some flaw therein—imaginary or real. Theoretically, the shipping companies: may defy the notices which have no legal force; and the Indians claiming admission may not take out domicile certificates which are not required by law. In practice, the shipping companies resolutely decline to issue passages except on production  of certificates above referred to; so much so, that it is very difficult for those who write out the English application to obtain a  passage, because they cannot produce a domicile certificate, and the shipping companies would not look at the provision exempting such persons from the operation of the Act. The reason given for introducing such elaborate restrictions is that they are necessary to prevent evasions of the law; and it may be admitted that some evasions have occurred. It is, however, submitted that they ought not to be used as a handle for making unduly harsh a law which is, in its very nature, severe, and committing what is a breach of the fundamental principles of the British Constitution. The evasions should be publicly denounced and, if necessary, punished, for which there is ample provision made in the Act itself. Unfortunately, the latter course has not been adopted, with the result that the innocent have to suffer for the lapse of the few guilty persons. Everything that could be done locally to induce the authorities to relax the severity has been and is being done; and it would be unfair to omit to mention that the authorities have endeavoured in a measure to meet the wishes of the  Indian community. Much more can, however, be done, if not now, at any rate after the war is over, by pressure of the Colonial Office to which the Government has been found to be amenable in the past.
 Another effect of the Act is that it imposes vexatious restrictions on those who intend to pass through, or sojourn temporarily in the Colony, neither of which acts is prohibited by law. The Government, however, in order to prevent surreptitious settlement of Indians in the
 Colony have, perhaps rightly, introduced what are called Visiting and Embarkation passes. The objection, therefore, is not so much to the introduction of the passes as to the conditions under which they are issued. Formerly, a deposit of £25 for Embarkation passes was required, and a fee of £1 for either a Visiting or Embarkation pass. The Government, however, in answer to Indian representations, were pleased to reduce the £25 to £10, and withdrew the £1 fee. The £10 deposit, however, still stands, much to the inconvenience of intending visitors, not all of whom could afford to deposit the sum, small as it may appear in the estimation of the Government. It was this Act that was instrumental in sending away a shipload of Indian refugees from the Transvaal from Delagoa Bay, who would fain have come to Natal, and thus saved not only the passage-money from India to Delagoa Bay for their return after the war, but not have been also a burden to the already overpressed famine-stricken India.
 The other Act, not by any means the next in importance, but rather the worst of all, is the Dealers’ Licenses Act, only at the present time its effect is not much felt. The country beyond the Tugela is yet under semi-military government. The Newcastle, Ladysmith and Dundee Corporations which gained, in 1898, unenviable notoriety for the harsh and oppressive way in which they enforced the Act, have not been able to shake themselves free from the misery caused by the Boer occupation. In Durban and Maritzburg, the Licensing Officers have not given much trouble. What will happen in January next, at the time of the renewal of licenses, it is difficult to foresee. The poor traders, however,: are already trembling in their shoes because of the great uncertainty in which the Act leaves them from year’s end to year’s end. The friends in London may recollect that Mr. Chamberlain has approached the Natal Government, suggesting that they should introduce legislation repealing the clause depriving the Supreme Court of the ordinary appellate jurisdiction over  the decisions of the Licensing Officers or the Corporation, as the case may be; and that the Natal Government have written to the various municipalities. informing them that, unless they judiciously exercised their powers under the Act, they might have to introduce legislation of the nature above indicated. This may be good so far as it goes, but it is sincerely hoped that it has not satisfied the Colonial Office. The least that is necessary is the removal of the terrible uncertainty that hangs, like the sword of Damocles, over every Indian licensee; and this can only be done by restoring the authority of the Supreme Court. There
 was (and very rightly) a howl of indignation when Mr. Kruger usurped the function of the High Court at Pretoria; but perhaps the very rottenness of the Transvaal Constitution was somewhat  a safeguard from any real danger from such usurpation. But in Natal, where there are all the safeguards of a well-ordered Constitution, the deprivation of the jurisdiction of the highest Court of Justice in the land makes the danger terribly real and tangible, because it receives the solemn sanction of the legislature.
 The truth of these remarks will be fully borne out by recalling to the mind what has been possible in the Transvaal in spite of the vagaries of its laws and what the Town Councils, free from the healthy restrictions Of their Courts which, as British bodies, they are bound to fear and respect, have been able and attempted to do. War has prevented an approach to the Colonial Office in this matter. While correspondence on the subject with the local Government was going on, war broke out; and it was considered prudent to stay further action till the cloud melted away.
 The 9 o’clock rule, and numerous other troubles referred to in the circular letter, need not be recapitulated here. They but serve to show what the Indians have to suffer in the Colony. We would give much to find ourselves in reality at one with the Colonists as we are on paper, being British. subjects; and it will be time enough to trouble our friends in London with the comparatively smaller troubles when the Immigration Restriction and the Dealers’ Licenses Acts have  ceased to worry us.
 One thing is day by day causing much soreness of feeling, and that is the education of the Indian youths. The Government, which is ruled by the majority, perhaps not unnaturally finds itself powerless to assist the Indians. The result is, the Indian children are entirely shut out of the ordinary primary schools as well as the high schools. The Head Master of the Durban High School is said to have written, some time ago, to the Minister of Education, to the effect that parents would withdraw their children if an Indian was admitted. It is, however, submitted that the Colonial Office should make it clear to the local Government that the Indians have an equal right with the Europeans in the Colony to receive education in the Government schools which are supported by taxes paid as well by the Indians as by the  Europeans. For the logical consequence of the threat (it is nothing less) held out by the Head Master would be that the Indians might
 have absolutely no status if it were carried out in every department of life in the Colony. What would prevent a ring of European merchants, under the threat of clearing out from a particular street in a commercial centre in the Colony, from asking the Government to drive out an Indian merchant or two from their neighbourhood?

 TO
 WM. COOLEY, ESQ. TOWN CLERK DURBAN
 SI R,
 As soon as the intention of the Council to introduce a bye-law making it an offence for a riksha hauler to take up a coloured passenger in a riksha labelled for “Europeans only” was known, many Indians asked me to draw up a protest, but I felt at the time that it would not be proper to do so. I thought it would be inconsistent with the self-respect of the Indian community to wish to insist on having the right to use the same riksha used by the Europeans if the latter objected to share it with the Indians, so long as the same kind of vehicle was available to the Indians also. But I have now begun to feel
 
 that I committed a grave error in proffering the above advice.
 The practical working of the bye-law has created and is creating an irritation among the Indians of all classes which it would be folly on my part not to bring to the notice of the Council.
 I freely confess that the problem is not easy of solution. Yet it may not be altogether insoluble. In this communication it is not my intention to raise the legal question though I humbly believe that the bye-law is illegal. I wish, if possible, to obtain partial relief by  appealing to the good sense of the Council.
 I trust that what is objected to is not so much the colour of a fare as his dirty clothes or appearance. If so, might it not be possible to give instructions to the haulers not to take such fares? I am told that the haulers are shrewd enough to understand and carry out such instructions. The suggestion is obviously difficult, and will by no means be free from hard ships and injustice but it is likely to allay the present acute soreness.
 The very rigorous working of the bye-law may defeat its own object, and in my humble opinion, it can only be worked without friction if its application is very largely tempered with discretion. It is,  I submit, no small thing that hundreds of coloured people who have hitherto freely used the rikshas as a mode of conveyance, suddenly find themselves de barred from its use; for I understand that there are very few rikshas without the label above referred to.
 May I ask you to place this before His Worship the Mayor and the Council Committee at the earliest possible opportunity and hope that it will receive the consideration that its subject matter deserves? I trustI also that it will be considered in the spirit in which it is written.
 I remain, yours obediently,

I know that we who know the value of 	your services to your country have to see that we do not unduly 	encroach upon your attention and thereby probably affect your 	health; if, therefore, it is not possible for you to give this 	matter your personal attention, I doubt not that you will be good 	enough to forward this letter or copies thereof to the proper 	quarters. The matter treated as affecting the whole of the 	emigration from India seems to be of the utmost national importance. 	A draft resolution to be submitted to the Congress is enclosed 	herewith.libtech_444_footnotelibtech_445_footnoteA few copies of the notes,libtech_446_footnotelibtech_447_footnotespecially 	prepared for the friends in London at the desire of Sir William 	Wedderburn, are also being sent in a separate packet. They will give 	an idea of the position as it stands at present, and may be of use 	to the gentleman who will take charge of the resolution which, of 	course, may be altered or amended as the subjects committee think 	fit.       RESOLVED: 	That this Congress once 	more draws the attention 	of the Indian 	Government as 	well as 	of the Secretary 	of State 	for India 	to the 	grievances of 	the British 	Indians in 	South Africa, and earnestly 	hopes that, in 	view of the 	re-arrangement of 	the boundaries 	in that 	continent and 	the incorporation of 	the late 	Boer Republics 	into the: British 	Dominions, the 	disabilities under 	which the Indian settlers 	laboured in those 	Republics, and 	as to which 	Her Majesty’s 	Government owing 	to their 	independence in internal 	matters felt powerless to 	obtain redress, will 	now no 	longer exist, and 	that the serious 	inconvenience caused 	to the 	settlers in 	Natal, among others by 	the Immigration 	Restriction and the 	Dealers’ Licenses Acts 	of the 	Colony, which are 	manifestly inconsistent 	with the fundamental 	principles of the 	British Constitution as 	also the Proclamation 	of 1858, 	will be materially 	mitigated. if 	not entirely removed.  
 The matter derives special importance owing to the sudden and unexpected activity of the Cape Legislature the members of which, while, as you are aware, they are divided into two very evenly balanced parties holding diametrically opposite views, seem to be almost unanimous on the Indian question. A cutting from the  Cape Timeslibtech_448_footnotegiving a pretty fullreport of the debate in the Cape Assembly, attached hereto, will give some idea of what is going on in that part of South Africa. The Cape gentlemen are evidently anxious to go further even than Natal, as if the latter had not almost completely shut the door against new-comers from India. They would not tolerate the Indian, whether as a merchant, clerk, or labourer. In Mr. Chamberlain, they have a Colonial Secretary who is anxious to go any length  in respecting the wishes of the self-governing Colonies. The India Office, on the other hand, appears to be terribly inactive. But, seeing that there is unanimity of opinion between the Indians and Anglo-Indians on this question, it may be possible to rouse that office into proper activity, and obtain some relief. An influential deputation to wait upon Lord Curzon may go a great way in the desired direction.
 The attitude of the Cape Colony seems to show that the services rendered by India, in that it was Sir George White with his Indian contingent who was the first to be on the scene to check the effective advance of the enemy, that it was the hundreds of dhuli-bearerslibtech_449_footnotewho rendered admittedly yeoman service during the siege of Ladysmith, and at the initial reverses, not to speak of the volunteers (Lumsden’s Horse) equipped entirely from money subscribed by the Indians, the Bhisti Corpslibtech_450_footnoteand other Indian followers who were sent in shiploads from India, and the locally raised Indian Stretcher-Bearer Corps, will be entirely forgotten, and the Indian treated, if they had it all their own way, as a social leper.
 Natal for the present seems to be not quite ill disposed, but it will not take much to draw it out and, it is to be feared, make it return to its original opposition to the Indian. The gentleman who will speak to the resolution may be asked to gratefully acknowledge Natal’s magnanimous response to the Indian Famine Fund, and a subscription of £100 collected for Prabhu Singh, an indentured Indian who rendered signal service at Ladysmith, and whose bravery was publicly
 
 
 acknowledged by Sir George White. (This is the man for whom Lady Curzon sent a “choga” libtech_451_footnotewhich was publicly presented to him in Durban the other day.) The subscriptions to the Indian Famine Fund amount to over £4500, of which about one-half comes from our own community.
 The Transvaal and the Orange River Colony ought to be absolutely free to the Indian, but we are all very nervous about it.
 As showing to what lengths the people in South Africa would be prepared to go, what happened about a year ago at Umtali in Rhodesialibtech_452_footnote. . . .

 THE HONOURABLE THE COLONIAL SECRETARY PIETERMARITZBURG
 SIR,
 I have the honour to acknowledge your letter of the 7th inst., in reply to my letter of the 26th ulto., enquiring whether there were any restrictions upon the sale of Crown lands to Indians, and I beg to tender my thanks for the very full reply you have favoured me with, as well as the enclosures.
 Mr. Jan Mahomed of Port Shepstone, I understand, bought from Mr. H. E. Barnes of that place Erf No. 45 in the May of 14398 and declarations were prepared and signed; I am also instructed that, on the declarations being taken to the Surveyor-General’s Office, the Surveyor-General declined to register the cession. On enquiring of Mr. Pitcher, who seems to have taken the declaration to the Surveyor-General’s office, I find that the reason that officer gave for his refusal was—the cessionee was an Indian. On enquiring further of the same gentleman whether the Surveyor-General gave any legal grounds for his decision, Mr. Pitcher informs me that officer gave him to understand he was acting in accordance with Government orders.
 The above information seems to be in conflict with  that contained in your letter.
 May I know what actually happened in connection with this particular matter and whether the Government will be pleased to instruct the Surveyor-General to register the cession. My client, I am instructed, has already paid a portion of the purchase price to Mr. Barnes.
 I have the honour to be, Sir,
 your obedient servant,

The following 	is a brief press report of the mid-summer breaking-up function of 	the Higher Grade Indian School, Durban.  December 	21, 1900  	Mr. Gandhi, in speaking of the headmaster’s work, said that the 	best of institutions would suffer if there were not men to give life 	to them. This was well illustrated in the case of the Higher Grade 	Indian School. The Indian parents had to thank the Government  for 	presenting the school with Mr. Connolly, who had made the school his 	own. Even Mrs. Connolly  assisted  him  id   his  great  work,  and  	his    
 brother, who had lately arrived from England, was kind enough to place his voice at the disposal of the school. The Indians had to thank Mr. Connolly and his staff very much for their zeal and devotion. With reference to the gymnasium, he ventured to suggest that a  movable and portable set of single and double bars and sets of dumb-bells could, for very little expense, be procured, and would in a measure compensate for the want of a suitable ground. Credit could not be withheld from Mr. Paul for inducing the parents to avail themselves of the school for their children.

    TO  HIS 	EXCELLENCY 	THE HONOURABLE  SIR 	WALTER 	FRANCIS 	HELY-HUTCHINSON,  prior 	to December 24, 1900 
  KNIGHT 	GRAND 	CROSS 	OF THE MOST 	DISTINGUISHED 	ORDER 	OF SAINT 	MICHAEL 	AND SAINT 	GEORGE, 	GOVERNOR AND  	COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF 	IN AND OVER 	THE COLONY 	OF NATAL, 	VICE-ADMIRAL 	OF THE SAME, AND 	SUPREME 	CHIEF 	OVER THE  NATIVE 	POPULATION  THE 	HUMBLE 	PETITION 	OF THE UNDERSIGNED, 	REPRESENTING THE BRITISH 	INDIANS 	RESIDENT 	IN DURBAN  HUMBLY 	SHEWETH,  	That your petitioners beg to draw Your Excellency’s attention to 	the enclosed Bye-law passed recently by the Durban Town Council and 	approved by Your Excellency.  	At the time the said Bye-law was proposed to be published, the 	Indians who generally use the rickshas were alarmed, but it was then 	hoped that the Bye-law would not be so enforced as to apply to all 	non-Europeans without distinction.  	Your Petitioners thought that, if the European community did not 	wish the Indians to make use of the same rickshas as they, the 	latter consistently with their self-respect could not take exception 	to such attitude so long as there remained a sufficient  number  of  	rickshas not set apart for the exclusive use of any particular 
 community.
 In practice, however, it has been found, during the short time the Bye-law has been in operation, that it is extremely difficult to find a ricksha without the label “For Europeans Only”. For a time, and only for a time, no particular hardship was felt as there were a number of rickshas without the above label and the police did not unduly  interfere with the ricksha “boys” carrying people cleanly dressed. The thing, however, was soon changed as the Town Council gave definite instructions to the police to rigorously enforce the said Bye-law, with the result that a very large number of, your Petitioners venture to call, cleanly dressed Indians suddenly found themselves deprived of the use of the above vehicles to their great inconvenience and annoyance.
 The Town Council was approached with a view, not to obtain a cancellation of the Bye-law, but such enforcement thereof as not to deprive the Indians altogether of use of the rickshas.libtech_454_footnote
 The Town Council has, however, declined to accede to the request.
 Your Petitioners venture to submit that the said Bye-law is illegal in terms of Section 75 of Law No. 19 of 1872, as it is opposed to the general spirit of the British Constitution and the Laws of the Colony.
 By reason of the premises, your Petitioners pray that the said Bye-law may be cancelled or amended so as not to cause the inconvenience complained of.
 And for this act of justice and mercy, your Petitioners shall for ever pray &c. &c.

 SIR,
 CHELLAGADU AND WILKINSONlibtech_455_footnote
 This matter came on before the Supreme Court in review. The Court decided that it had no jurisdiction to review the decision of a Circuit Court Judge in the matter of appeals from a Magistrate’s decision.
 This leaves the question of the interpretation of the law as to the transfer where Mr. Justice Beaumont has left it. You were  good enough to say, when I approached you in the matter, that you would, in the event of the Supreme Court deciding it had no jurisdiction, approach the Governor for remission of the sentence, a fact which by itself would show that Mr. Justice Beaumont’s decision is Wrong.
 I, therefore, now leave the Case in your hands and enclose the papers herewith.

             DEAR 	SIR,        14, 	MERCURY LANE,  DURBAN,  February 	16, 1901 
  	Now that the Famine Fund raised in the Colony is closed, it may be 	as well to give you its genesis. While the Indian community was 	agitating itself whether it would be possible, as in 1897, in spite 	of thepresent distressing circumstances in South Africa, to  make  	an effort, the Viceroy’s letter to the Lord Mayor of London for 	further help was published in the local papers, and, almost 	simultaneously with this, came a request to the Protector of Indian 	Immigrants from the Natal Agent at Calcutta to collect subscriptions 	 from  the indentured Indians. We thereupon bestirred ourselves, 	and, on behalf of the Indian community, H. E. the Governor was 	approached with a view to secure his patronage. He most graciously 	consented to become the Patron of any such fund that might be raised 	in that behalf and promised to head the list with £20. The Hon. Sir 	John Robinson, ex-Premier of Natal, and the Hon. Henry Bale, the 	Attorney-General of Natal, very actively espoused the movement. A 	strong Central Committee was formed with the Mayor of Durban as 	Chairman and    
 the Protector of Immigrants as Honorary Treasurer, and an appeal for funds was made in the papers which, too, rendered great help. A local artist drew up a realistic cartoon which The Natal Mercury consented to issue as a special. The excellent pictorial representations of The Times of India were pressed into service. The result was that nearly
 £5,000 were collected, of which about £3,000 were contributed by the Europeans, £1,700 by the Indians and £300 by the natives. The magistrates in the various divisions, chairmen of Local Boards, the clergy and a band of Indian workers, besides the Committee members, vied with one another in making collections. Lady  Robinson, supported by her friends, also rendered valuable help. Colour prejudice was for the time being forgotten, and the best traits of the character of the community were, in this instance, brought into play. In 1897, the European contribution to the famine fund was over £200 and the Indian was about £1,200—there was no organization formed then for collections among the Europeans.
 The Viceroy has acknowledged the generosity of Natal in very suitable terms.
 I am, yours truly,

    DEAR 	SIR,  March 	19, 1901 
  	As you know, Mr. Russell delivered an address to the Indian children 	in the Town Hall on the reign of our late beloved Kaiser-i-Hind, and 	a memorial souvenirlibtech_460_footnotewas 	presented on behalf of the Indian community to the children. The 	Committee consider that the other Indian children, too, who could 	not possibly attend the function, should receive the souvenir. It is 	worth preserving, and I would suggest that one copy should be framed 	and hung in the schoolroom, and each pupil should be induced either 	to frame it, if he can afford it, or neatly paste it on a nice piece 	of thick cardboard and hang it in his room.  	Will you kindly let me know how many pupils you have in your school 	so that I may post the number of copies?  	If you can induce local storekeepers to decently frame and exhibit 	it in their show window, a few more copies could be sent. At the 	same time, as we have only a limited supply, I would ask you to be 	good enough to restrict yourself to the exact number required.    
 May I also suggest that you should carefully study Mr. Russell’s address and discourse upon it to your pupils, so that they may have a fairly good idea of the ever-memorable reign.
 Yours faithfully,

 TO
 THE COLONIAL SECRETARY PIETERMARITZBURG
 SIR,
 A kind friend has sent me a copy [of an] extract from General Buller’s dispatch wherein among the officers mentioned is included my name, described as “Mr. Gandhi, Asst. Supt. Indian Ambulance Corps.” If the extract is complete, according to my correspondent, no more officers of that Corps are thus mentioned. If that be so, and if the credit given is to the Assistant Superintendent as such, it belongs to Mr. Shire, who was the only Gentleman in the Corps recognised as such. And if the description of the office is of no consequence and if I am entitled to any credit for having done my duty, it is due in a greater measure to Dr. Booth, now Dean of St. John’s, and to Mr. Shire, who spared no pains in making the Corps the success it proved to be. If I may venture to estimate their work, it is due to them to state that Dr. Booth’s services as Medical Officer in particular and adviser and guide in general were simply inestimable, and Mr. Shire’s were equally so in connection especially with the internal administration and discipline.
 May I ask you to bring the contents of this communication to the notice of the Military Authorities.libtech_463_footnote

176,"April 20, 1901",A CIRCULAR LETTERlibtech_466_footnote,"
  
 
 
 DURBAN,
 April 20, 1901
  	The position of the British Indians in the Transvaal and the Orange 	River Colony is sufficiently serious to call for a statement from us 	to enable you to move in the matter. It will be recollected that Mr. 	Chamberlain has lately announced that the legislation of the late 	South African Republic and the Orange Free State would, “so far as 	possible”, be adopted by the Imperial Government. The question at 	once arose in our minds whether the legislation  of the  old 	governments was included in the qualifying clause “so  far as 	possible”. If present regime is any test of the future, then, 	indeed, the question has been solved for us to the horror of every 	Indian in South Africa. The whole of the anti-Indian legislation in 	the Transvaal is being enforced with a rigour unknown before. The 	laxity of the late Government was totally in our favour. Though the 	Location Law was there, and the cab regulations, footpath and 	numerous other bye-laws existed in the Statute book, they were more 	or less a dead letter. The enforcement of the Location Law, although 	often  threatened,  was never carried out as against the respectable 	Indians, the storekeepers and others, and only a few—very 	few—actually suffered the indignity of the footpath and other 	bye-laws. All is now changed. Every anti-Indian ordinance of the 	late Government is being unearthed, and, with strict British 	regularity, applied to the victims. The handful of poor Indians that 	were unable to leave the Transvaal before the war broke out, and who 	are therefore now there, have protested against the enforcement, but 	so far in vain. The following telegram was forwarded to His 	Excellency the High Commissioner on the 25th March last:  	To Private Secretary, His Excellency High Commissioner: Some British 	Indians, who are at present in Pretoria and Johannesburg, write to 	Indian Refugee Committee saying they have received notice to remove 	to Locations, they are not allowed walk on footpaths, and that 	generally anti-Indian laws of the late Republic are being strictly 	enforced. I am requested respectfully to draw His Excellency’s 	attention to the admission of His Majesty’s Government that    
 such laws are objectionable and the statement that they would endeavour to have them repealed. The laws, it appears, were never  it appears, were never under the old regime enforced asstrictly as they now are and, pending general settlement, Committee prays for relief.
 We are anxiously awaiting reply; but the non-receipt of any reply till now forebodes, we are afraid, disappointment. It should be recollected that the protests against such legislation made by the then British Agent, as well as the Secretary of State for the Colonies, had much \ to do with the laxity of the Republican officials above alluded to. Mr. Chamberlain’s reply, from which the following extracts are taken, to the Indian Memorialists as to the Location Law was very sympathetic, and shows clearly that he strongly disapproved of it, and stopped only when he felt helpless:
 I regret extremely that I cannot return a more encouraging answer to the memorial before me, for the petitioners have my sympathy. I believe them to be a peaceable, law-abiding, and meritorious body of persons, and I can only hope that, even as matters stand, their undoubted industry and intelligence, and their indomitable perseverance, will suffice to overcome any obstacles which may now face them in the pursuit of their avocations.
 In conclusion, I would say that, whilst desirous loyally to abide by the award and to allow it to close the legal and international questions in dispute between the two Governments, I reserve to myself the liberty, later on, to make friendly representations to the South African Republic as to these traders, and possibly to invite that Government to consider whether, when once its legal position has been made good, it would not be wise to review the situation from a new point of view, and decide whether it would not be better in the interests of its own burghers to treat the Indians more generously, and to free itself from even the appearance of countenancing a trade jealousy, which I have some reasons to believe does not emanate from the governing class in the Republic.
 Are we, then, when everything is in his power, to groan under all the disabilities which so roused his indignation? Even a few weeks before the war broke out, the British Agent assured the deputation that waited on him at Pretoria, that everything short of a declaration of war was done by him, that negotiations were still going on, and that if, unfortunately, the threatened war broke out, we need not bother thereabout. Lord Lansdowne has declared publicly that the an legislation which was clearly in breach of the Pretoria Convention was one of the principal causes of the war. Is, then, the very evil to remove which, among others, the war has been entered upon, to be continued under the very shadow of the British flag, and when the Colonial Office cannot even put forth the excuse that it has not sufficient
 control over the self-governing Colonies? For, neither the Transvaal nor the Orange River Colony has yet got self-government.
 We notice with much regret and misgiving that the King’s  speech on the opening of Parliament pointedly refers to the equality of all the white races south of Zambezi, and a fair treatment of the native races, as the only objects in view at the time of the coming settlement. Before the war, it used to be “equal rights for all the civilised races in South Africa”. If, therefore, the change to “the whites” is deliberate, it suggests a cause for grave anxiety. We attach
 hereto an abstract of the laws of the late Republican State affecting the Indians. The question is most serious, our position most painful. Labouring under the oppressive yoke, we feel too exhausted to make an effort ourselves. We can only cry out in anguish. It is for you to help us to be free from the grievous burden. We have done, we hope, everything to deserve better treatment. We have taken our share, however humble, side by side with the European Colonists in the war, and have endeavoured to show that, if we are anxious and ready to pray to be allowed to enjoy the rights and privileges of British  subjects, we are not unmindful of our duty as such. We have shown also, incontestably, that there is absolutely nothing in us to justify all the indignities we have to suffer in South Africa.
 A great and combined effort on the part of the public bodies and the public press in India, and the friends in England, cannot fail to secure justice. It is perfectly feasible in that, as there are, there can be no two opinions about the justness of our cause. The time, too, is now or never; for, after the settlement has taken place, it is clear from experience that no amelioration would be possible.
 We remain,
 your obedient servants,
 MAHOMED CASSIM CAMROODEEN & CO AND NINETEEN OTHERS
 ABSTRACT [OF] LAWS
 Of the late South African Republic and the Orange Free State affecting British Indians only
 SOUTH  AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 Every Indian must take out a Registration Ticket for £3.
 When the officials treated the Indians as the natives of the soil, they insisted upon their taking out shilling travelling passes.
 The railway regulations prevent Indians from travelling first or second class.
 No Indian can own native gold, or take out a digging licence. (This law has not operated as a hardship, as the Indians have not gone in for speculation.)
 Law 3 of 1885 gives the Government the right to point out to the Indians, for sanitary purposes, certain Locations for habitation. An attempt was made before the war to sent away all the Indians in Johannesburg to a Location nearly five miles from the centre part of the town, where it was proposed to restrict their trade also.
 Certain bye-laws in Pretoria prevent the use, by the Indians, of footpaths and public vehicles.
 
 N.B.—For fuller information hereon vide letter to the British Agent, 21st July, 1899, and memorial to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, May [16], 1899.
 ORANGE FREE STATE
 Chapter 33 of 1890 prevents any Asiatics from (1) remaining in the State for more than two months without permission from the State President; (2) owning landed property; (3) trading or farming.
 Chapter 71 levies a poll tax of 10s. per annum when permission to reside has been granted, subject to restrictions mentioned above.

Day by 	day, the list of Europeans receiving permits to go to the Transvaal 	is swelling; but upto the time of writing not one permit has been 	granted for the Indian refugees.

Ommanney (retired I.C.S.) who has 	been appointed Permit Secretary to the High Commissioner has been 	endeavouring to secure some for us, and last month even went so far 	as to telegraph for one-representative merchant’s name from 	Durban, the other being from Cape Town. A name was there and  then 	submitted to him under protest that one permit was almost useless, 	but even that has not been granted.  	I venture to hope that action has already been taken by you in the 	matter, and that as a result some relief would be granted ere this 	reaches you.

 TO
 THE HONOURABLE THE COLONIAL SECRETARY PIETERMARITZBURG
 SIR,
 I venture to address you on the Indian Immigration Amendment Act Bill published in this week’s Government Gazette.
 The first section of the Bill provides that the rate of wages payable to any Indian woman under the Act of 1895 shall be one half of the respective rates provided therein, or such other special rate as may be agreed upon by the employer and the woman. I presume the Government intend one half of the rates provided in the Act of 1895 to be the minimum, but I think such intention is not sufficiently clear from the wording of the section. May I suggest the addition of “but in no case less than one half of the respective rates aforesaid”.libtech_475_footnote
 I beg to draw your attention to the fact that the Law 25 of 1891 provides for the wages of Indian women to be half those of men, and I hope the Government do not propose to make alteration in the minimum.
 I have the honour to be, Sir,
 your obedient servant,

  	I am requested specially to forward the enclosedlibtech_476_footnotelibtech_477_footnoteto 	 you  and humbly to suggest that some action might be taken in the 	various Legislative Councils in India, and if that be not possible, 	in the Viceregal Council, though seeing that Bombay, Madras and 	Calcutta send a very large number of immigrants to South Africa, 	there is no reason why the local Governments should not take notice 	of the disabilities which the British Indians are labouring under.  	This question is one of those about which there is a unanimity of 	Indian and Anglo-Indian opinion; and I venture to  think  that 	united action on the part of the non-official members will do much 	for our cause. There is very little doubt that the official sympathy 	would also be with us, and under the strong and sympathetic Viceroy 	we have in Lord Curzon, the great question which underlies our 	disabilities (as put by the London Times)—”May the 	British Indians when they leave India have the same status before 	the law as other British subjects enjoy. May they or may they not go 	freely from one British possession to another and claim the rights 	of British subjects in allied states”—cannot but be decided 	favourably if only it is sufficiently brought to His Excellency’s 	notice.

 We, the undersigned members of the Indian community of Johannesburg, beg respectfully to bring to your knowledge that an important Notice has appeared in the Johannesburg Gazette, wherein [it is stated that] an Indian Immigration Office has been opened to deal solely with all Asiatics, and whereby all such subjects have to get their passes changed, and to deal with all Government matters that they may be interested in.
 We beg to point out that hitherto our dealings direct with His Imperial Majesty’s Authorities have been carried out without any complaint, and we fear that this new departure will lead to dissatisfaction amongst many of our fellow-subjects.
 We have not seen any notice regarding the changing of passes of the subjects of foreign countries, and we thus infer that a distinction is being made; if this be so, we shall be grieved thereat.
 We have ever been loyal and desire to be direct under the Imperial Authorities, as heretofore, whose treatment and kindness we greatly appreciate.

 DEAR SIR,
 I write this particularly to suggest the advisability  of  a deputation waiting on Sir Alfred Milner, if indeed not also on Mr. Chamberlain. There is no doubt that most important matters will be discussed between the two statesmen and, if a strong deputation representing all shades of opinion and consisting of, say—Sir Lepel,libtech_479_footnoteMr. Dadabhai, Sir William Wedderburn, Sir Mancherji, Messrs.

From the conversation I used to have with Lords Northbrook and Reay, I am inclined to think that, if either of them were approached, he would lead the deputation. The facts you would need have all been already supplied.

         SIR,     DURBAN, NATAL,  June 	1, 1901    	The	papers	received   this	week   contain	news	that	Mr. 
  	Chamberlain, in reply to Mr. Caine’s question on the subject of 	the permits for the return of the Indian refugees to the  Transvaal, 	informed him that at the request of Sir Mancherjee he had already 	cabled to Sir Alfred Milner in the matter.  	Reuter’s message received this week says that, in  reply  to 	another question, Mr. Chamberlain said that the anti-Indian laws of 	the late South African Republic would remain in force until 	modified. Mr. Chamberlain does not seem to have added that the laws 	will not be enforced in practice as they were not under the old 	regime. In the absence of any such understanding, the present state 	will be far worse than the old. I confess this news has disappointed 	us.  	Although the workers here have imbibed their zeal and ideas of duty 	from the self-sacrificing devotion of the Congress leaders and are 	content to copy the Congress pattern, they have appealed to all 	parties for help and there seems to be no difference of opinion as 	to the justness of the cause. Holding this view, we feel that it 	suffer for want of concerted action on the part of the different 	friends.  	The East India Association has already suggested joint action and I 	respectfully submit that a large measure of success would be    
 attained if a small committee of persons representing all shades of opinion were formed and a concerted move were always made.
 An unsympathetic reply from the Colonial Secretary produces a bad impression here and encourages further opposition to the Indians. The method, therefore, of obtaining information by letter to Mr. Chamberlain or a personal interview is, in my humble opinion, better adapted to the circumstances of our case. Mr. Chamberlain’s reply, cabled by Reuter as above, is calculated to do some mischief. The interpretation put upon it is that he will yield to popular clamour and give up the Indians entirely.
 I know that we who are on the spot suffer from the nearness of vision and may consequently take merely a narrow and parochial view and may not give due attention to the situation there or the position of the leaders working in our behalf. If, therefore, there is anything presumptuous in my suggestion, I trust you will be good enough to overlook it.
 I am sending a copy of this letter to the Honourable Dadabhai Naoroji.
 I remain, yours truly,

BOX 	182, DURBAN, 	NATAL, 	June 22, 1901  DEAR 	SIR MANCHERJI,  	I acknowledged last week your two letters. Since then I have 	received yours of the 24th ultimo. Your letters have revived our 	spirits, and I beg to thank you on behalf of the poor sufferers in 	South Africa for the great work you are doing. We on this side 	entirely agree with you that so far as possible the thing should be 	managed by friendly interviews, such as you have been having with 	Mr. Chamberlain and others, for an unsympathetic answer to a 	question in the House cannot but do a great deal of damage—where 	justice is entirely on our side, and no difference of opinion exists 	between the 
 several parties. A constant reminder to the authorities and unwearinglibtech_488_footnotevigilance are all that is needed in order to secure the desired result. We have anticipated you in the suggestion as to a combined movement in India, and letterslibtech_489_footnotehave been addressed to the. leaders  on  that  side requesting them to promote memorials and put questions in the Viceregal Council. At the same time, I am not very hopeful of success, owing to the absence there of any organized committee to deal exclusively with the South African Question, or rather with the question of grievances of the Indian emigrants. But a combined powerful representation to the India Office from the East India Association and the Congress Committee may well supplement or take the place of what may be done in India.
 I know that you feel very keenly in this matter  of  our disabilities, and that they are bad enough  to arouse righteous indignation in the coolest head. But may I ask you not to mar the sterling work you are doing there by precipitating a hot debate unless you are sure of success. We fully realise that no man in England is more capable of doing justice to this matter than yourself owing to the warm interest you take in it, your position in the  House,  your influence with the authorities and above all your willingness to work.
 The information supplied to Mr. Chamberlain by the authorities in the Transvaal with reference to the cablegramlibtech_490_footnotelibtech_491_footnotesent to you as to the permits is, I venture to say, misleading. I still affirm that the cablegram  is correct. The information was derived from the report sent to the local newspapers by their special correspondents. I  went  over yesterday myself to see the Secretary of the Uitlander Committee and he told me emphatically that most of the shops are open, and that the requirement that the men shouldjoin the Rand Rifles is more or less a formality, and surely, if they don’t want the Indians to join the Rand Rifles, it should not, to say the least, be used as a bar against their return; and it should be recollected that many European ladies have been allowed to proceed, and that it is a daily occurrence to see a crowd of families entraining for the Transvaal. I regret to have to inform you that up to the time of writing no further permits have been received, though six have been promised—four for Natal and two for Cape Town. But, of course, the question of permits is, after all,
 
 
 insignificant, and only a temporary, though, while it lasts, a very severely felt, difficulty compared to the all-absorbing question—what is to be the position of the Indians under the new regime? There is yet no declaration to the effect that, at the very least, the  existing legislation will be considerably modified. Our hopes are centred in what the friends in London may, taking advantage of Lord Milner’s presence there, accomplish.
 I hope to write more next week; in the meanwhile, with renewed thanks,
 I am, yours very truly,

 The following is a brief press report of Gandhiji’s speech at a prize distribution function of the Government Higher Grade Indian School in Durban. The Governor of Natal, Sir Henry McCallum, presided.
 [DURBAN,
 prior to June 28, 1901]
 Mr. M. K. Gandhi, in moving a vote of thanks to His Excellency, said he thought the Indian community might take just pride and feel very highly gratified in the fact that His Excellency, in the very early stage of his administration) should come in touch with them, and that in such an agreeable manner. He recalled to mind the competition between the Irish Association and the Indian community on the occasion of the visit of Lord Roberts. The Irish Association claimed His Lordship as an Irishman, and the Indians claimed him as an Indian. His Excellency had already been claimed by the Scotchmen, but he thought they had good grounds for claiming Sir Henry to be an Indian by adoption. He expressed the hope that the Government would let them have a gymnasium and singing classes they had promised. He also hoped they would grant a girls’ school on the model of the Indian Higher Grade School.

 We fully realise the blessing of the munificent British rule. It is because we are in the folds of the all-embracing Union Jack that we have a footing outside India.
 We humbly request you to assure His Majesty the King and Emperor, our Maharaja, of our loyal attachment to the throne, and. we wish Your Royal Highnesses a pleasant time in this garden of South Africa and pray to the Almighty that He might guide you safelyhome on the termination of your tour, and may shower His choicest blessings upon you.

  	I enclose copy, as supplied to me, of the resolutions  and covering 	letter addressed to me as Chairman of “the Protest Meeting of 	English-speaking and other Indians”, by the convener. Chairman 	though I was of the meeting, I am not at all in sympathy with the 	resolutions, as they contain many material errors of statement, and 	are misleading. But realizing that ventilation in the Press of 	grievances, fancied or real, is the best safety-valve, I forward 	them, to be used as you may think fit. 
       [Resolutions]  I 	am, &c.,  M. K. GANDHI 
  At 	a protest meeting of 	the English-speaking and 	other Indians which was 	held in the Congress Hall on the 2nd inst., Mr. J. L. Roberts, the convener, proposed, and 
 Mr. D. C. Andrews seconded, the following resolutions, which were carried unanimously. Mr. M. K. Gandhi occupied the chair.
  That 	this meeting strongly 	disapproves of the 	manner in 	which the Indian 	representatives were 	chosen for 	the presentation of 	the address to their 	Royal Highnesses the 	Duke and 	Duchess of 	Cornwall and 	York, inasmuch 	as only the 	Mohammedans were 	apprised of 	the meeting, 	thus depriving 	the other 	Indians from 	participating in it.  That 	this meeting strongly 	disapproves of 	the fact 	that the majority 	of representatives 	elected to attend the 	presentation of 	addresses to their Royal 	Highnesses are 	Mohammedans and 	that the 	other Indians in 	the Colony, being greater 	in number 	than the Mohammedans, 	should have had 	at least 	an equal 	number of representatives 	as the Mohammedans.  That, 	out of 	the eight 	further representatives 	who were 	chosen to receive 	invitations (if 	the Reception Committee 	grant it), 	six are Mohammedans; 	thus, again, the other Indians do not receive a fair share in the representation.  That 	this meeting 	strongly disapproves 	of the practice of the 	Mohammedans, who, 	after choosing men 	to represent 	themselves, should invariably 	choose one 	Mr. H. L. Paul 	to represent 	the English-speaking 	and other 	Indians, thus acting in direct opposition to the wishes of the Indians in question.  That 	copies of 	the foregoing 	resolutions should be 	sent to 	the secretary 	of the 	Duke and 	Duchess of 	York, the 	Indian Reception 	Committee, the Mayor of 	Durban, and the Press of Natal.

 [LADYSMITH,]
 September 11, 1901
 Mr. Gandhi asked to be allowed to appear at that late stage, as the case was important to the Indian community, and the  Police seemed to be labouring under a delusion with regard to their status. They had, a few days ago, arrested a number of Natal-born Indians, who had from very shame forfeited their bail. An attempt had been made to bring defendant, an Indian, who came to Natal of his own will, under the section of the law, by terming him a “coolie”. The section read “after 9 P.M.,” “failing to produce a pass from the employer.” How could he do this, when he was his own employer? He quoted   Mrs.  Vinden   v.   Corporation   of   Ladysmith,   in   which the
 
 Supreme   Court   laid    down    that    the    term could   be	translated “indentured Indian”.
 His Worship said that, in view of the case quoted, he did not feel called upon to say anything further. He could not lay down a hard and fast rule, for such cases had to be treated on their merits. The law was difficult. Though accused was plainly a coloured person, the law did not call him that, so he was discharged.

203,,BALANCE-SHEET OF NATAL INDIAN CONGRESS,"
    
 
 When the balance-sheet of the Natal Indian Congress up to 31st August 1901 was prepared for submission to the Congress, Gandhiji noticed some discrepancy of figures in the list of 723 subscriptions and donations totalling £ 3404, and he recorded the following note
 under his signature and the following addition to the balance-sheet in his own hand.
   NOTE  September 	[?], 1901   The difference 	between the  total   of  the   ledger  accounts  and 
  	the amount shown in the balance-sheet, which is the correct amount, 	is due to some mistake in posting entries from the cash book—a 	task which I had no time to undertake though the book has been 	checked twice.The mistake is likely to have occurred owing to many 	names having been struck out owing to their not having paid 	thesubscriptions for which they obtained receipts. An examination of 	the cash book would have shown this at once.  M. K.

  October 	2, 1901  	Act. 18 of 1897 regulates & controls the issue of licenses to 	wholesale & retail dealers.  	Sec. 1 of said Act includes in the licenses mentioned in sub-section 	(a) sec. 71 of Law. No. 19, 1872, licenses to wholesale dealers, so 	as, it is contended, to give the control over licenses to wholesale 	dealers to the Corporations.  	The expression, retail dealers, is specially made by sec. 3 of the 	said Act to include hawkers, and therefore, by inference, it  is 	contended, to exclude all others.  	Is a baker or a butcher, in the opinion of Counsel, a retail or 	wholesale dealer within the meaning of the Act, & is his license 	governed by that Act? Counsel’s 	attention is drawn to the fact that there is a separate 
 tariff for a baker’s & a butcher’s license from the tariff for a retail shopkeeper’s (dealer’s) license under Law No. 19 of 1872, that a baker’s license does not, at any rate in the popular belief, cover transactions not incidental to a bakery, & that, similarly, a  retail dealer’s license does not cover a baker’s business.

I have been corresponding with my client and I find it is true that 	he has built wood and iron buildings without the previous written 	permission of the Magistrate, but I understand such buildings have 	been erected all over the place. The Magistrate has, moreover, given 	his certificate as to the value of the building, which was produced 	before the Surveyor-General.  	I am further informed that the titles have been granted to others 	similarly situated, that my client, before he put up the wood and 	iron building, applied for permission to make bricks; that on  the  	permission being refused he put up the wood and iron building; that 	the building in question is occupied by very respectable tenants, 	viz., the Standard Bank, and that my client is erecting brick or 	stone 
 buildings also on the land.
 Under the circumstances, I request a reconsideration of my client’s application for registration of his title, and venture to trust that the Governor will be pleased to grant it.

 October 15, 1901
 Mr. Gandhi returned thanks from the bottom of his heart for the splendid and costly address.libtech_493_footnotelibtech_494_footnoteHe thanked   the  donors  of  the  many presents; and also those who had spoken so flatteringly of him. He had not been able to find a satisfactory answer to the question of how he came to deserve all this. Seven or eight years ago,libtech_495_footnotelibtech_496_footnotethey embarked on a certain principle, and he accepted the gifts as an earnest that they would continue on the lines on which they then embarked. The Natal Indian Congress had worked to bring about a better understanding between European and Indian Colonists. They had progressed in that, if only a little way During the recent election speeches they heard much against the Indians What was wanted in South Africa was not a white man’s country; not a white brotherhood, but an Imperial brotherhood. Everyone who was the friend of the Empire should aim at that. England would never part with her possession in the East, and, as Lord Curzon had said, India was the brightest jewel in the British Empire. They wished to show that they were an acceptable section of the community, and, if they continued as they started, they “would know each other better when the mists have rolled away”. Mr. Gandhi
 
 then addressed the Indians in their native language, and the meeting terminated with cheers for their distinguished countryman.

   TO  PARSEE 	RUSTOMJEE, 	ESQ. 	HONORARY SECRETARY 	ADDRESS 	COMMITTEE 	DURBAN  DEAR 	MR. RUSTOMJEE,  October 	18, 1901 
  	I have been thinking what written reply to give to the handsome and 	costly address presented to me by my fellow-countrymen. After deep 	consideration, I have come to the conclusion that, consistently with 	professions made by me from time to time, I must not be satisfied 	with merely saying that what I value is the affection that has 	prompted the gifts, not the gifts as such. I have, therefore, 	decided to hand over the jewellery, as per accompanying schedule, to 	the African Banking Corporation with instructions to deliver the 	articles to the Natal Indian Congress against a receipt signed by 	the President and Honorary Secretary or Secretaries for the time 	being. I 	make them over to the Congress on the following conditions:   The 		jewellery or 		its value 		should form an 		emergency fund 		to be utilized only when the Congress has no other funds to  
 fall back upon without the two landed properties.
  I 	should have 	the right to 	withdraw any or 	such of the jewellery 	that may then not have 	been utilised for 	devoting same 	to any 	beneficial object, 	whether within or 	outside the 	scope of 	the Congress. 
 When the necessity for utilising the jewellery arises, and if it is possible, I would feel it an honour to be consulted by the Congress as to whether the object for which it is sought to utilise same is, in my opinion, an emergency within the scope of this letter. But the Congress is free at any time to withdraw the jewellery  without  reference to me.
 I have taken the above step deliberately and prayerfully. I feel that neither I nor my family can make any personal use of the costly presents. They are too sacred to be sold by me or my heirs, and, seeing that there can be no guarantee against the last contingency, in my opinion, the only way I can return the love of our people is to dedicate them all to a sacred object. And since they are in reality a tribute to the Congress principles, to the Congress I return them.
 Lastly, I repeat the hope that our people would translate into acts their good  intentions (for the institution) of which the recent presentations were an earnest.
 That the Congress may continue to serve the Empire and the Community and that my successors may receive the same support that was extended to me is my fervent prayer.

  	We the undersigned, on behalf of the British Indian settlers in this 	Colony, as well as the British Indian refugees from the Transvaal, 	beg respectfully to welcome Your Excellency to this Borough, and to 	tender our hearty congratulations upon the great honour conferred on 	Your Excellency by His Most Gracious Majesty the King-Emperor.  	We fervently pray to the Almighty that He may bestow on Your 	Excellency health and long life to enable you to continue and to 	bring to a successful issue the Imperial work Your Excellency has 	undertaken of uniting under the British flag the different races in 	South Africa.    
 May we draw Your Excellency’s attention to the question of the position of the British Indians in the new Colonies which awaits solution at Your Excellency’s hand, and trust that in coming to a conclusion thereon, Your Excellency would bear in mind the traditions of the country of our birth, our unswerving and proved loyalty to the Throne, and our acknowledged law-abiding instincts? Knowing Your Excellency’s wide sympathies, generous disposition and intimate knowledge of the different parts of His Majesty’s vast dominions, we feel confident that the cause of the Indian settlers in the new Colonies cannot possibly be in better hands.
 We would respectfully request Your Excellency, on behalf of hundreds of British Indian Refugees, if it be possible, to expedite their return, especially in view of the fact that they have not availed themselves of the general Relief Fund.
 In conclusion, we request Your Excellency to convey to His Gracious Majesty the King-Emperor an expression of our loyal and reverent attachment to the Throne.
 We beg to subscribe ourselves,

 On his way to India, Gandhiji stopped at Port Louis, Mauritius, where the Indian community gave him a reception. The following version of his speech on the occasion is based on the local Press reports.
 November 13, 1901
 Mr. Gandhi thanked the guests at the gathering and especially the host. He said that the sugar industry of the island owed its unprecedented prosperity mainly to Indian immigrants. He stressed that Indians should regard it their duty to acquaint themselves with happenings in their motherland, and should take interest in politics. He also laid much emphasis on the urgent need to pay attention to the education of their children.

 BOMBAY,
 December 19, 1901
 TO
 THE EDITOR
 The Times of India
 BOMBAY SIR,
The Indians in South Africa are eagerly waiting to see in what
 direction the Indian public are going to help them in the struggle which they are carrying on for existence in that sub-continent against awful odds. The East India Association has, as you are aware, sent up a strongly-worded memorial to Lord George Hamilton. Sir Mancherjee Bhownaggree has been rendering a most useful service to the cause of the sufferers. In season and out of season, within the House of Commons and without, by pen and voice, he has been asking for, not without success, a redress of our grievances. You; Sir, have uniformly assisted us, and so the whole of the public, both Indian and Anglo-Indian. The Congresslibtech_498_footnotehas been passing resolutions year after year sympathising with us. But, in my humble opinion, something more is required. I have been asked by the leading Indians in South Africa to suggest a representative deputation to the Viceroy, similar to the one that some years ago waited on Mr. Chamberlain, and which was promoted by the late Sir W. W. Hunter. It is evidently necessary to strengthen the hands of the Viceroy as well as the workers in England. The authorities here and in Downing Street are not—cannot be— unsympathetic.
 The Europeans in South Africa are doing all they can to bring pressure to bear upon the Colonial office. They want absolute power to legislate as they will against the British Indians. A deputation, therefore, backed if possible by public meetings, cannot fail to haveits effect. Let there be no mistake as to the real  situation.  Mr. Chamberlain has, let us hope, once for all laid it down that he would not allow an affront to be placed upon millions of His Majesty’s subjects in the shape of special disabilities on the Indians. Natal has,
 
 therefore, sought to carry out its object by indirect methods; e.g., Immigration Restriction and Dealers’ Licenses Acts, in theory applicable to all, but in practice mostly enforced against the emigrants from India.
 In the Cape Colony, the legislators propose to impose restrictions similar to those in Natal.
 In the Transvaal and the Orange River Colonies, very drastic anti-Indian laws are in force. In the former, the Indian cannot hold land, must live and trade in Locations only, cannot walk on footpaths, etc. The latter he cannot even enter, except under special permission, and then only as a domestic servant or labourer. Unlike the two old Colonies, which enjoy complete self-government, the newly annexed territories are under the direct control of the Colonial Office; and it is there the question is most pressing. Mr. Chamberlain, in answer to a question put by Sir Mancherjee, has given an answer which, though worded in a friendly spirit, is far from satisfactory. He evidently does not wish at once to put the pen through the laws inherited from the late Republics. Lord Milner has been charged with the task of considering what alterations should be made in those laws. This, therefore, is the time for India to assert her position as an integral part of the British Empire, and to claim for her sons in South Africa the full rights of a British citizen. The question is admittedly of Imperial importance. Are the British Indians, in the words of the late Sir W. W. Hunter, as soon as they leave India, to enjoy the full status of British subjects or not? The answer to that question would, to a very great extent, depend upon the action of the public in India. Even the Colonies would not care to disregard, especially at a time when the Imperial wave is passing throughout the length and breadth of the British Empire, a unanimous, emphatic, temperate and continuous expression of the public opinion of India.
 May I, then, on behalf of the Indian settlers in South Africa, appeal to you and your contemporaries to help us in the desired direction? I would venture also to ask your contemporaries, if possible, to copy this letter.

213,"December 27, 1901",SPEECH AT CALCUTTA CONGRESS,"
    
 At the 17th session of the Indian National Congress held in Calcutta, Gandhiji made the following speech while moving a resolution on the status of Indians in South Africa:
 [CALCUTTA,
 December 27, 1901]
MR. President, and Brother Delegates,
 The resolution that I have to commend to your attention is as follows:
 That this Congress sympathises with the British Indian settlers in South Africa in their struggle for existence and respectfully draws the attention of His Excellency the Viceroy to the anti-Indian legislation there, and trusts that while the question of the status of British Indians in the Transvaal and the Orange River Colonies is still under the consideration of the Right Hon’ble the Secretary of State for the Colonies, His Excellency will be graciously pleased to secure for the settlers a just and equitable adjustment thereof.
 Gentlemen, I appear before you not as a delegate, but more as a petitioner on behalf of the hundred thousand British Indians in South Africa, and probably also of the future emigrants, who we wish would go outside of India and carry with them the status of British subjects. Gentlemen, South Africa, as you are aware, is almost as big as India and has a British Indian population of one hundred thousand, fifty thousand of whom are absorbed in the Colony of Natal, the only Colony in South Africa that imports indentured labour, and it is that labour that raises this great question so far as South Africa is concerned. Gentlemen, throughout South Africa, our grievances are twofold. The first class of grievances arises from the  anti-Indian attitude of the European Colonists, and the second class of grievances arises from the reproduction of that anti-Indian feeling in anti-Indian Legislation throughout the four Colonies in South Africa. To give you an instance of the first class of grievances, I may tell you that all the Indians, no matter who they may be, are classed as coolies. If our worthy President1 were to go to South Africa, I am afraid, he too will be classed as a coolie, as a member of the semi-civilised races of Asia. Gentlemen, I will give you two illustrations to show how that term coolie has worked mischief throughout South Africa. A short time ago, last year, I believe, the son of the great Adamji Peerbhai of
 
 Bombay, himself a member of the Corporation, came to Natal. He had no friends there, he  knew  nobody.  He  applied  for  admission  at several hotels. Some proprietors who had better manners told him they had no room, whereas other proprietors replied: “We  do notaccommodate coolies in our hotels.” Gentlemen, the son of the late Mr. Cowasjee Dinshaw of Aden, Mr. Kaikobad, also came to Natal, and then he went to Cape Town. From Cape Town he was returning to Natal. He had to suffer great inconveniences before he could land. That was the time when there were plague restrictions in South Africa. He succeeded in securing a first-class passage to Natal, but what happened when he came to Natal? The Plague Officer simply said, “I cannot land you; you seem to be an Indian. I have got instructions not to land any coloured people at all.” And will you believe me, a telegram had to be sent to the Colonial Secretary of Natal, before he was allowed to land. All this because he had a black skin.
 Now, as to the second class of grievances, so far as Natal is concerned, I am afraid, it is a sealed book. The legislation has been already sanctioned. It prevents any Indian from entering Natal unless he or she can write out in one of the European languages the form attached to the Immigration Act. This Act prevents a very large body of Indians from emigrating to Natal. There is another law also in the Colony of Natal, namely, the “Dealers, Licenses Act.” That Act gives Licensing Officers almost absolute power to refuse or issue trade licences. There is absolutely no appeal against these officers except to the executive body, Local Boards, and Corporations by whom the officers are appointed, in some cases with instructions that they are not to issue any Indian licences. In the Colony of the Cape of Good Hope, there is not much anti-Indian legislation. So far as the Transvaal and Orange River Colonies are concerned, unfortunately for us, the old legislation is still in force. In the Transvaal, Indians must live and trade in Locations, they cannot walk on the footpath, they cannot own landed property except in Locations. The Orange River Colony we can only enter as labourers. Now, with due deference  to  the uncrowned king of the Bombay Presidency,1 I believe that our position is so very bad in the Transvaal and the Orange River Colony, because proper steps were not taken to withstand an attack on our rights as British subjects, and had no steps been taken in Natal, the
 
 
 position would be infinitely worse there today than it is. Such is the position throughout South Africa.
 What, then, is the remedy that the Congress can apply? Mr. Chamberlain has been so far very sympathetic with reference to the Transvaal. During the old regime, he sympathized with our grievances, but could do very little, because he was then helpless. Such is not the position now. He is all-powerful. He has promised to confer with Lord Milner as to how the old legislation should be changed. Now,  therefore, is the time for us in South Africa, or never. After he has conferred, and after changes have taken a practical shape, nothing can be done. Friends in England in their advice to me say, “Move the Indian public; let them hold public meetings; if possible, send deputations to the Viceroy, and do everything that you canto strengthen our hands here. The authorities are sympathetic, and you are likely to get justice.” That is one way in which you can show your sympathy, but we do not want mere lip sympathy, nor do we ask you to put your hands into your pockets. For the matter of that, our countrymen in South Africa have rendered very material help to the famine-stricken in India. You will be surprised to learn from me that the Colonial-born Indians actually shed tears when they saw the pictures we reproduced, for distribution, from The Times of India. The Indians gave 2,000 and, I must admit, the Europeans, too, at the time came forward with handsome contributions. To return, there are delegates who are editors of influential newspapers, there are delegates who are barristers? who are merchants, princes, etc. All these can render very practical aid. The editors can collect accurate information and overhaul in their papers the whole question of foreign emigration and ventilate our grievances systematically. Professional  men  can serve themselves and their countrymen by settling in South Africa. The Congress is, I believe, meant, among other things, to testify to our ability to stand side by side with the other civilised races of the world in foreign enterprises and self-government. Now, if we were to look for a moment at European emigration, we will find the speculator followed by the trader who, in his turn, is followed by the missionary, the doctor, the lawyer, the architect, the engineer, the agriculturist, etc. No wonder if, wherever they settle, they blossom into independent, prosperous, self-governing communities. Our traders have gone in their thousands to different parts of the world, to South Africa, Zanzibar, Mauritius, Fiji, Singapore, etc. Are they followed by Indian missionaries, barristers, doctors, and other professional men? It is,
 unfortunately, the European missionaries who try to teach religion to the poor emigrants, European lawyers who give them legal advice, and European doctors, who cannot understand their language, [who] try to give them medical advice. Is it, then, any wonder if  the  traders, groping in the darkness, not knowing what their rights are, not knowing where to go to for directing their boundless energy into proper channels, and surrounded by strange faces, are much misunderstood and are obliged to settle down to a life of humiliation. and degradation? This evening our proceedings were opened with a song, the last verse of which exhorts us to undertake foreign enterprises with strictest honesty and love for our land as moral equipment, knowledge as our capital, and unity as the source of our national strength. Gentlemen, if some of the distinguished Indians I see before me tonight were to go to South Africa, inspired with that noble spirit, our grievances must be removed.

214,"January 19,1902",SPEECH AT CALCUTTA MEETINGlibtech_499_footnote,"
         CALCUTTA, 
  January 19,1902  	Mr. Gandhi, after describing South Africa generally, explained the 	position of the British Indians in that sub-continent. He said that 	in Natal the Immigration Restriction Act, the law relating to 	licences and the state of education of Indian children were chiefly 	matters of concern. In the Transvaal, the Indians could not own 	landed property nor could they trade anywhere except in Locations. 	They could not even walk on the footpaths. The Orange River Colony 	the Indians could not even enter except as labourers, and then under 	special permission. He had to repeat many things concerning the 	treatment the Indians received in South Africa which had already 	appeared in the papers, but he observed that his mission before them 	was not to give the dark side of the situation, with which they were 	partially familiar, but the bright, the roseate side. He then 	narrated how, since the war, they had been able to enlist the 	sympathy of some of the Colonials, and the cause of the Indians, he 	thought, was a little progressing. He, however, strongly deprecated 	the  latest  anti-Indian    
 measure which sought to exclude every Indian from the Colonies who could not read any of the European languages. The gentlemen  present at the meeting, who all knew at least the English language, might not fully appreciate the gravity of the situation, but its effect would be disastrous upon a people the vast majority of whom were unlettered and those who knew only the vernaculars of India. The hatred of the Colonials against them was no doubt intense, but what Mr. Gandhi proposed was to conquer that hatred by love.
 The speaker asked his audience not to treat the statement as merely a formality. The Indians in South Africa believed  in  this maxim and they tried to follow it. The war, which must have proved disastrous to others, came to them as a blessing, as it furnished the Indians with an opportunity to prove their mettle. Before the war broke out, the Colonials often used to taunt them by saying that, in times of danger, the Indians would scuttle off like so many rabbits, and such were the people: who demanded privileges like them ! But the war showed that the Indians did not scuttle off; they put their shoulders to the wheel and were prepared to take equal responsibility with others. When the war broke out, the Indians, irrespective of their opinion whether the war was right or wrong (for which the Sovereign, and the Sovereign alone, was responsible, they thought), agreed to give their services free to Government and with that view approached it with a petition, but their prayer was not granted Subsequent to this, however, Colonel Gallwey, who apprehended to a certain extent what the affair at Colenso would be, wrote to a leading Indian1 to organise an ambulance corps, and this was done with 36 Indians as leaders and 1,200 Indians as ambulance bearers. What sort of service they  rendered to the country was known to them all, and this had even drawn forth the admiration of the violent Colonials who, for the first time then, saw the good trait in the Indian.
 Mr. Gandhi added that, in one sense, the Indians themselves were to blame for the feeling of hatred raised in the Colonials against them. If the Indian settlers had been followed by better-class Indians who could be the peers of the Colonials in every phase of life, so much bad blood would not have been created. However, the feeling had now been improving. It had improved so much that it enabled some of the Indians to start a national Famine Fund to help India in
 
 1900.
 her last famine and to raise a sum of £5,000, of which £3,300 were paid by the Colonials.
 The speaker concluded his remarks by saying that, at that meeting, he was merely concerned with bringing out the best points of the two communities. There were harshnesses also, but it was better to contemplate the former. The Indian Ambulance Corps was raised in the same spirit. If they claimed the rights of British subjects, they must recognise the responsibilities also of that position. The work of the Corps in which the Indian labourers worked without pay was specially mentioned in General Buller’s dispatches.

 [CALCUTTA,
    MR. 	CHAIRMAN AND GENTLEMEN,  January 	27, 1902] 
  	Last Sunday week I had the honour to address you on my experiences 	in South Africa. In the course of my remarks, you will recollect, I 	said that the policy that was followed by our countrymen in South 	Africa in connection with their legal disabilities could be summed 	up in two maxims which guided it, viz., to stick to the truth at all 	costs and conquer hate by love. This was the ideal to be realized. I 	then implored you, as I implore you now, to believe that these are 	no catch phrases, but that we have all through these years tried to 	live up to the ideal. The local Indian contribution to the present 	war is,  perhaps, the very best illustration of that line of action.  	When in the October of 1899, the Boers issued their ultimatum, the 	British Government, as you are aware, was unready. According to 	their prearranged plan, the Boers crossed the Natal border  	immediately on the receipt of the reply from the British Government. 	Sir W. Penn Symons, at the cost of his life, gave the enemy’s 	forces a temporary   check   at   Talana   Hill,  and   Sir   George 	  Whitelibtech_510_footnoteallowed 	himself and his 10,000 brave men to be surrounded in Ladysmith. 	These events were as unexpected as they were surprising, and 	followed in such quick succession that the people had hardly any 	time to turn in and ponder over them. Mafeking and Kimberley were 	besieged at the same time. Half of Natal was in Boer hands. And 	often did we hear that the Boers were going to take Maritzburg and 	capture Durban. But strange as it may appear, Sir George White and 	his army saved Natal by allowing themselves to be besieged, thus 	occupying the Boer General and the flower of his army. This was the 	contribution of British India to the Colony.  	The calmness and fortitude with which the people of Natal 	contemplated these events reflect the highest credit and  show  the 	secret of British power. There was no stir. Business went on as if 	nothing had happened. The Natal Government never flinched. Although 	the Treasury was nearly empty, the servants were regularly     
 paid. The common courtesies of ordinary English life were performed. And but for the presence of so many  khaki-clad gentlemen and the unusual bustle at the harbour, you would not have noticed that there was any imminent danger of even Durban being
 taken.Volunteers were called out and Durban was emptied of its best sons within twenty-four hours of the call. What was to be the attitude of the 50,000 Indians in the Colony in such a crisis? The answer came in emphatic earnestness. We claimed the privileges of British subjects. Now was the time to discharge the responsibilities of that status; the local differences were to be sunk if the policy referred to at the outset was to be carried out; we had nothing to do with the question whether the war was right or wrong. That was the function of the Sovereign. Thus argued your countrymen at a great meeting convened for the purpose. Here was the opportunity to answer the oft-repeated charge in the Colony, that, if there was a war, the Indians would scuttle away like rabbits. It was resolved at that meeting to offer the services of those assembled there, free of charge, to do any work at the front for which they might be found fit. The Government, while thanking the volunteers, replied that their services were not required. In the meanwhile, there returned from England a gentleman who had devoted 20 years of his life to Indian work as a medical missionary belonging to the Church of England. His name is Canon Booth, now Dean of St. John. He was pleased to find that the Indians were ready to serve the Empire during the war. He offered to train them as ambulance leaders. And for several weeks they had lessons in first-aid to the wounded from Dr. Booth. In the meanwhile, Colonel Gallwey, the principal medical officer attached to General Buller’s Army, in anticipation of a bloody fight at Colenso, issued  instructions  for raising a European Ambulance Corps. We thereupon telegraphed to the Government informing them as to how we were qualifying ourselves. And intimation was received from the Government that we were to help the Protector of Indian Immigrants in forming a volunteer Indian Ambulance Corps. Within four or five days, about 1,000 Indians were collected, a majority from the various estates.  These were, of course, in no way bound to offer their services, nor was the slightest pressure imposed on them. It was entirely a free-will offering on their part. They, in common with the  European volunteers, received one pound per week and rations while on duty. You will understand the force of these remarks when I tell you that some of the stretcher-bearers were traders earning far more than £4
 per mouth. As an officer remarked, however, this war was a war of surprises in many respects. Among the Europeans, too, there were professional men of the highest standing, serving as stretcher-bearers.. It was rightly considered a privilege to be able to  succour  the wounded.
 But the leaders who had undergone the training accepted no remuneration. The good Dr. Booth, too, came with us as a leader, without pay. Colonel Gallwey afterwards installed him as medical officer for the Corps. The leaders included two Indian barristers,libtech_511_footnotea gentleman connected with a well-known London firm of agents, shop-keepers and clerks.
 The Corps thus constituted served just after the  action  at Colenso. Thirsty, hungry and fatigued, we reached  the  Chieveley camp at dusk. The action had just ended after a sanguinary struggle against an unseen enemy. Colonel Gallwey came up and asked the Superintendent of the Corps whether we would be able to carry the wounded to the stationary hospital there and then. The Superintendent turned towards the leaders who at once said they were quite ready. By 12 o’clock midnight, about thirty wounded officers and soldiers were removed. The work was done with such despatch that there were none left ready to be carried. It was at 12 o’clock midnight that the bulk of the men broke their fast—men (some of them) who had never been used, to put it in expressive though not quite elegant English, to roughing it.
 The distance to be covered was about five miles. The European ambulance party attached to the army brought the wounded from the battlefield to the field hospital where the wounds were dressed. We carried them to the stationary hospital—each stretcher having six bearers and three bearer parties having a leader whose duty it was to direct the bearers, and to attend to and feed the wounded.
 Early next morning, before breakfast, orders were received to resume work which continued up to 11 a.m. Hardly, however, had the work of removing the wounded finished, when orders were received to break up camp and march. Colonel Gallwey then personally thanked the Corps for the work done and disbanded it—saying that he relied upon a similar response when he needed it. During the  interval, General Buller was taking his men across the Tugela to force his way
 
 to Ladysmith through Spion Kop. After ten days, recess, the P. M. O. sent orders to reform the Corps, and within three days over 1,000 men were collected.
 Spion Kop is about 28 miles from Frere, which was the railway base, and the station where the wounded had to be brought before they could be taken by rail to the general hospitals. Spion Kop—the hill of Spion— overhangs a bush where tents were pitched to form a field hospital, from which the wounded, after being dressed, had to be removed to Spearman’s Camp—a distance of about three miles. A narrow stream lay between the field hospital and Spearman’s Farm. Across this was erected a temporary pontoon bridge which was within the range of the Boer guns. The route between Spearman’s Camp and Frere was rather rugged and hilly.
 Neither the European Corps nor the Indian were to work within the range of fire. But the European Corps, both at Colenso and Spion Kop, had to work under fire, and the Indian Corps, only at Spion Kop and Vaalkranz. Major Bapty, Secretary to Colonel Gallwey, who has covered himself with glory by facing great perils, and who  has received the V.C., thus addressed us:
 Gentlemen, you have been engaged to work without the range of fire. There are many wounded men to be removed from the field hospital. There is just a chance, though very remote, that the Boers may drop a shell or two on the pontoon. If you are prepared to cross the bridge in spite of the little risk, and you are at liberty to say no, I shall be glad to lead you.
 These words were spoken with such earnestness and so kindly and gently that I have endeavoured to reproduce them, as far as possible, as they were uttered. The leaders and men with one voice offered to follow the gallant Major. The unexpected reverse at Spion Kop kept us incessantly at work for three weeks, though the Corps was on duty for over nine weeks. Thrice or four times did it cover a distance of 25 miles per day with its precious load of wounded. And I may be permitted to say for the Corps, without any self-esteem, that the work was done so much beyond all expectations, that those who were competent to judge thought that the 25-mile marches, with the load, were record marches. Colonel Gallwey had given us the option to do the distance in two days.
 The work of the Corps has been honourably mentioned in General Buller’s dispatches.
Such briefly is the record of work of the Natal Volunteer Indian
 Ambulance Corps.
 The Indian merchants, who could not leave their business to join the Corps, collected a fund for the support of the dependants of those volunteer leaders who needed it and also supplied uniforms for them.
 A handsome donation was sent to the Durban Women’s Patriotic League Fund for the volunteers who had gone to the front. Indian ladies contributed their quota by making pillow slips, vests, etc.
 We were also supplied by the merchants with cigarettes to be offered to the wounded. And all these funds were raised at a time when the Indian community of Natal was feeding at its own expense, without encroaching on the general refugees’ relief fund, thousands of Indian refugees, both from the Transvaal and from the parts of Natal occupied by the enemy.
 I would not be true to myself if I did not give you an idea of the impression that was created in the minds of many of us about the life of the British soldier when at work, and especially under temporary reverses. I ventured last Sunday week to give you a description of the Trappist monastery and the holy stillness that pervaded it. Strange though it may appear to some of us, the same impression was created in those vast camps. Although the energy put forth was the greatest— not a minute was passed idly by anybody in those stirring times— there was perfect order, perfect stillness. Tommy was then altogether lovable. He mixed with us and the men freely. He often shared with us his luxuries whenever there were any to be had. A never-to-be-forgotten scene happened at Chieveley. It was a sultry day. Water was very scarce There was only one well. An officer was doling out tinfuls to the thirsty. Some of the bearers were returning after leaving their charge, The soldiers, who were helping themselves to the water, at once cheerfully shared their portion with our bearers. There was, shall I say, a spirit of brotherhood irrespective of colour or creed. The Red Cross badge or the khaki uniform was a sufficient passport whether the bearer had a white skin or brown.
 As a Hindu, I do not believe in war, but if anything can even partially reconcile me to it, it was the rich experience we gained at the front. It was certainly not the thirst for blood that took thousands of men to the battlefield. If I may use a most holy name without doing any violence to our feelings, like Arjun,libtech_512_footnotethey went to the battlefield,
 
 
 because it was their duty. And how many proud, rude, savage spirits has it not broken into gentle creatures of God?
 I have been talking flatteringly of our countrymen’s work in connection with the war. I would detain you for a moment to look at the other side. The real work, to my mind, has now commenced. Compared with the trials that the soldiers and soldier-volunteers have undergone and are still undergoing, our work was after all very little. It has been well spoken of, because it was never expected. Now that we have raised expectations, shall we in future come up to them? Therein, to my mind, lies the reason for humility instead of self-praise. While, therefore, it was perhaps my duty to bring prominently to your notice the little work of our countrymen, it is equally my duty to remind ourselves of the work that lies ahead of us. I may now, I think, perhaps pardonably, quote what the late Right Honourable Harry Escombe and others thought, almost too generously, of our work. Mr. Escombe, at our request, blessed us on our departure for the front and spoke as follows:
 I thank you for paying the marked personal compliment of asking me to address a few words of farewell before you leave for the front. You carry with you not only the good wishes of those present here, but of all the people in Natal and the Queen’s great Empire. This incident is not the least interesting of the many episodes of this remarkable war. The meeting shows the willingness and the resolve of the Indian subjects in Natal to do what they can to promote the unity and the solidarity of the Empire, and they who claim rights in Natal, we recognise, are now performing their obligations to their country. They are going to occupy as honourable a position as those who are doing the fighting, because if there were none to look after the wounded, war would be much more horrible than it now is. It cannot be forgotten that
 you Indians in Natal—who have been treated with more or less injustice—have sunk your grievances and claim to be part of the Empire and to share its responsibilities. You carry with you the hearty good wishes of those who know what is taking place today. The knowledge of what you are doing will help to bring closer the different classes of Her Majesty’s subjects throughout the whole Empire.
 The Natal Advertiser wrote thus:
 The Indian population of the Colony have to be congratulated on the admirable spirit they have shown. This is more commendable because of the attitude of the Colony towards Indian immigration, and the Indian population generally. The Indian community might easily have wrapped themselve s up in a sullen reserve and said: `We shall not help the enemy, but neither shall we help you, as you have shown yourselves so antagonistic to us.’ But they did
 not; they took occasion to assist where they could. They subscribed liberally to the various war funds; their ladies assisted in supplying comforts for the sick and wounded, and many of them have gone to the front to assist ourtroops in whatever capacity they can. This conduct should be appreciatively remembered in their favour. It is no small matter at a crisis of this character, that we should be able to rely upon the unswerving loyalty of our coloured population. And it should make us the more ready to endure small faults on which perhaps we are prone to expatiate largely in times of peace.
 Such, gentlemen, is the testimony in favour of a community that is trying to live by Truth and Love.

I think it will be very 	difficult for you to go to Natal just at the present moment. Because 	of the war, only those who have Rs. 1,500  in  cash  can proceed 	there. It will be difficult for you to do so unless you have the 	money. This law is not likely to be repealed as long as the war 	lasts. However, if you are keen to go abroad, let me tell you that I 	recently came here via Rangoon. I can say from personal 	experience that you will be able to earn your livelihood there. That 	country is prosperous and interesting, and if one is healthy, is not 	ashamed of manual    
 labour, is not lazy and maintains truthfulness, there should be no difficulty in earning one’s bread there. One Indian has made very good arrangements for board and lodging in Rangoon; so you will experience no difficulty of any kind. You can get there via Madras or Calcutta. The cost of the journey will be from Rs. 30 to Rs. 40.

  	I am in receipt of your three letters, dated 31st December, 7th 	January and 10th February.  	I have also received the cheque for £25 sent by you to be spent on 	feeding the famine-stricken people in Kathiawad or for any other 	charitable object I deem fit.  	All your three letters reached me when I arrived here  from North 	India three days ago. I also received a letter at Rangoon, but it is 	in my luggage, which has not yet been received from Calcutta. I do 	not remember that it contained anything special that called for  a  	reply.  	The famine in Kathiawad is very acute. But I have not yet obtained 	full information regarding the extent of relief being given to the 	famine-stricken. When I obtain it, I shall utilize the cheque sent 	by you. If I find that it is not needed immediately, I intend to 	spend the amount after June, for real scarcity will be experienced 	thereafter. If, unfortunately, we get no rains in June, there is a 	possibility that the conditions of 1897 might recur. Since it will 	be advisable to have as much money as possible for that contingency, 	I do not consider it meet to use this amount just now, except when 	absolutely essential. I shall write to you if there is any change in 	this decision. The cheque was deposited yesterday with a local 	banker at _ per cent interest.libtech_519_footnoteThe money will be spent under my personal 	supervision. You need, therefore, have no anxiety in this matter.     
 I cannot understand why Mr. Khan and Mr. Nazar should not attend to your work properly. You should have patience and take whatever work can be taken from them. People cannot speak or act always in the same manner. I think it is not right to form an adverse opinion on that account. As long as a man carries out with care the work entrusted to him, it is not necessary to pay attention to his ways.
 I have already sent to the secretaries a report of the work done here so far. As you must have seen it, I do not write about it again. The Governor there has declined to receive our address, saying that the Indians constitute a part of Natal’s population. Please let me know in exactly what context he has said so. You must have  seen  the question asked about us in Parliament and Mr. Chamberlain’s reply.
 Let me know immediately what Lord Milner writes. The Bengal Chamber of Commerce is willing to take up our work. Hereafter, please forward also to Prof. Gokhale at Poona copies of whatever literature, newspapers, etc., you may have to send from there to other gentlemen He is a member of the Imperial Council and he does a lot on our behalf.
 I very much regret to note that the Congress work there has become slack. You should do as much as you can. One  should content oneself with doing one’s duty as one understands it, facing insults, obstacles, etc., courageously and behaving politely in every respect. What more can I write from this distance?
 It is, indeed, a matter of profound regret that the ideal of inviting Sir Mancherjee has been abandoned. It will, however, be to our advantage if we can still exert ourselves and invite him.
 When I go to Bombay, I shall call at your house and inquire after your children. But I am not sure when I will go. Everything here is undecided. I intend settling down in Bombay if I can afford it. It is  a little difficult to do public work from here. The future alone will decide it. Dr. Mehta strongly advises that I take complete rest at least for the next two or three months.
 The children are here with me. They are for the  present  attending the local school. Gokaldas and Harilal are studying in standard IV of the secondary school. Manilal studies privately; he has not been admitted into any specific standard at school. I hope you have recovered completely by now. It is necessary to take proper care of your health there. It is essential that one should observe moderation and regularity in the matter of food. Please give my compliments to
 those who may enquire after me.

223,"March 	4, 1902",LETTER TO G. K. GOKHALElibtech_520_footnote,"
          DEAR 	PROFESSOR GOKHALE,     RAJKOT,  March 	4, 1902 
  	Having passed five nights in the train, I reached here on Wednesday 	last, i.e., only a day later than I would have had I not stopped at 	the intermediate stations.  	It was with very great difficulty that I found a seat in one of the 	intermediate carriages and that after I offered to stand the whole 	night if necessary. As it was, it was merely a trick on the part of 	the friends of some of the passengers. The former had occupied all 	the spare room with a view to prevent any more passengers from 	getting in. They got out as soon [as] the guard blew the whistle for 	the train to go. There was absolutely no room in the 3rd class 	carriages. You cannot adopt gentlemen’s time and travel 3rd. From  	Benares, however, I travelled 3rd only. In your words, it was only 	the first plunge that was difficult, the after-effect was all 	pleasure. The other passengers and I talked freely and at times 	became even chummy. Benares is probably the worst station for the 	poor  passengers. Corruption is rampant. Unless you are prepared to 	bribe the police, it is very difficult to get your ticket. They 	approached me as they approached others several times and offered to 	buy our tickets if we would pay them a gratuity (or bribe?). Many 	availed themselves of the offer. Those of us who would not, had to 	wait nearly one hour after the window was opened, before we could 	get our tickets and we would be fortunate at that if we did so 	without being presented with a kick or two from the guardians of 	law. At Moghalsarai, on the other hand, the ticket master was a very 	nice man. He said he knew no distinction between a prince and a 	peasant.  	In the carriages we were packed anyhow. There was no restriction as 	to numbers, though there were notices in the    
 compartments. Night travelling under such circumstances  does become rather inconvenient even for the poor 3rd class passengers.
 There was plague inspection at three different places, but I cannot say it was carried on with any harshness. My experience is yet very little, but the picture that the imagination had drawn of the  terrible lot of these passengers has become somewhat toned down. Five days can hardly afford sufficient data for drawing a fair conclusion. I feel all the richer and stronger in spirit for  the experience which I would resume at the very first opportunity.
 I alighted at Benares, Agra, Jeyporelibtech_521_footnotelibtech_522_footnoteand Palanpur. The Central Hindoo College is not a bad institution though it is difficult to speak with confidence on a hurried visit. “The dream in  marble”  is certainly worth a visit. Jeypore is a wonderful place. The Albert Museum is a far better building than the Calcutta one and the art section is by itself a study. The Jeypore school of arts appeared to be flourishing under its Bengalee Superintendent.
 I now come to the most important part of my letter. To Palanpore I went to see merely the State Karbharylibtech_523_footnotelibtech_524_footnotewho is a personal friend of mine. I casually mentioned to him that I might join you in collecting subscriptions for the Ranade memorial fund in April next. The State Karbhary, Mr. Patwari, who is a sincere man, says that it will be a great mistake to start it in April next, especially if we want to do Gujarat. He thinks that we would lose at least Rs. 10,000 thereby. All the States are more or less groaning under the effects of famine and he is strongly of opinion that the collection should be undertaken in December or January next. I place his views before you for what they may be worth.
 Plague is raging in several parts of Kattywar.libtech_525_footnotePlease remember me to Professor Ray.

           TO  W. S. CAINE, 	ESQ. 	DEAR SIR,          RAJKOT,  March 	26, 1902 
  	I have just received your letter of the 14th instant. At the request 	of the Editor, India, I have already prepared a brief 	statement of the position up to date of the British Indians in South 	Africa. I enclose a copy thereof.libtech_528_footnotelibtech_529_footnoteThough, 	I presume, the request made by the Editor was on your behalf, I feel 	that to force a debate on the whole question on the treatment of the 	British Indians in various Colonies is likely to do more harm than 	good, for the situation in the different Colonies is not the same. 	In Natal, for instance, the Immigration Restriction Act, the 	Dealers’ Licenses Act and such other Acts, of which copies have 	been supplied from time to time to the British Committee, are 	already in force. The Natal model is being followed both in 	Australia and  Canada. Under the circumstances, it would be very 	difficult if not impossible to obtain repeal in Natal or altogether 	to frustrate the     
 attempt of Australia and Canada to copy Natal. The key to this is to be found in Mr. Chamberlain’s address to the Conference of Premiers at the time of the Diamond Jubilee. I enclose acopy of an extract therefrom for your perusal. He has met the Colonies half way, but the half way is probably more dangerous than the whole, for his sanction of indirect legislation has opened up possibilities for mischief which were never dreamt of, as you will see from my statement. Mr. Chamberlain’s latest utterances are hardly reassuring. They  will  simply strengthen the Colonial Governments in their anti-Indian attitude. The remedy, therefore, so far as Natal is concerned, is for the Indian residents in that Colony to induce the Colonial Government to accord fair treatment, which is now more or less a matter of administration of the old laws, and where they may attempt to pass fresh restrictive measures, to appeal to the Home Government and for the friends to help them. Continued pressure from the Colonial Office and a sympathetic discussion of the Natal [question] in the Home newspapers are the chief influences that are calculated to soften the Ministers in Natal. In a measure, I think, by the aid of friends in England and India, we have succeeded there. As to Australia and Canada, the remedy is to take up the proposed measures, the text of which, unfortunately, I have not seen, and to attack the details so as to make them as lenient as possible. On the main points Mr. Chamberlain simply will not help and, if the debate is forced, he will make a speech which would embolden the Colonists  in  their anti-Indian attitude.
 For the new Colonies in South Africa, our position is and ought to be infinitely stronger than elsewhere. The Colonial Office has a much freer hand. The past remonstrances to Mr. Kruger on the very anti-Indian legislation which is now being enforced will, for very shame, make Mr. Chamberlain take up an entirely different attitude. I enclose herewith an extract from his replylibtech_530_footnotelibtech_531_footnoteto  our  memorial  on  the Transvaal legislation. He then did not help because he was powerless. Now that he is all powerful, how can he help granting relief, and yet, unfair as it may appear to draw an inference not creditable to him, we are very much afraid that he has gone back upon his old love and may, if not properly watched, give away our position in the two new Colonies.
In anything that the friends may do in England, I think all the
 
 
 efforts ought, for the present, to be concentrated on getting redress in the Transvaal and the Orange River Colonies. In Natal, relief for the present is unobtainable. In Australia and Canada, there is no resident Indian population which has to suffer. There it is a matter of principle which certainly is a great one. In the Transvaal, the principle is there, the grievance is present, tangible and real because of the very large vested Indian interests, and relief is obtainable if only because Mr. Chamberlain has not yet committed himself one way or the other and, according to Lord Lansdowne, the treatment of British Indians was one of the causes of the war.
 In this matter there is no difference of opinion. The East India Association has worked in our behalf, so has the London Times and soalso Sir Mancherji. I hope, therefore, that in your crusade against the Colonial prejudice you will work in co-operation with them.
 If I may venture to make a suggestion, I would like our friends to seek an interview with the Colonial Premiers who are expected to attend the Coronation ceremony and to discuss the situation  with  them.
 The contributions of the local Indians in Natal to the present war may be taken into account in dealing with the question. I enclose herewith the cuttinglibtech_532_footnotewhich would give you an idea of their work.
 I have taken the liberty to write you fully and frankly for which I trust you will be good enough to excuse me. If you require any further information, I would be glad to place it at your service.
 I remain, Yours faithfully,

226,"March 	27, 1902",NOTES ON THE INDIAN POSITION,"
          [RAJKOT, 
  March 	27, 1902]  CONFIDENTIAL  NOTES 	ON THE PRESENT 	POSITION 	OF THE BRITISH 	INDIANS 	IN SOUTH 	AFRICA  	Anything that appears hereunder only applies to the situation as it 	stood two months prior to the date hereof, seeing that letters from    
 South Africa take a long time reaching here. It is necessary to bear this in mind because, evidently, the Indians in South Africa are still passing through a crisis as would appear from the following.
 Too much stress cannot be laid on the necessity  of distinguishing between the Indian question in Natal and in the two new Colonies. Cape Colony may, just for the present, be kept out of mind. The double question asked in the House of Commons about the new Colonies in Natal was, in my humble opinion, a tactical blunder. Mr. Chamberlain’s reply that he does not, at present, propose to make representations to the Natal Government with reference to its anti-Indian legislation already in force has created, if anything, a bad feeling in the Colony and emboldened the Colonists in  their anti-Indian attitude. The Pass legislation of Natal can, in the light of Mr. Chamberlain’s well-known views, be only a subject of constant correspondence between him and the sympathising friends.
 As to Natal, then, the Immigration Restriction Act and the Dealers’ Licenses Act are the chief measures which are prejudicial to the British Indians. The latter more especially, because it gives unlimited powers to the licensing officer as to the issue of license without recourse to theSupreme Court. The latest advice and development in effect enable them to curtail the right of the Indians. The Natal Civil Service Act gives powers to the Civil Service Board to pass bye-laws under it with reference to the examination of candidates, etc.; now the Constitution Act requires that all class legislation, before becoming law, must be sanctioned by His Majesty. Moreover, it is clear that no bye-laws could be enacted under an Act so as to change its fundamental principles. The Natal Government have escaped going to the Colonial Secretary for sanction for class legislation by simply publishing a bye-law which goes to the very root of the Natal Civil Service Act.
 The bye-law in question prevents any person, among  other things, who is disqualified from acquiring the Parliamentary franchise, from becoming a candidate for admission to the Civil Service. The disfranchising Act is well known and under it the Natal Government would say the British Indians are disqualified and, therefore, also disqualified to exercise the franchise to compete for the Natal Civil Service; of course, there are very few Indians who go in for that examination. Still the principle is there. And the method adopted to carry it out is most dangerous, and opens up a very wide latitude for
 
 the Colonists to further harass the Indian settlers. The matter might be brought to Mr. Chamberlain’s notice by correspondence.
 As to the Transvaal and the Orange River Colony, the situation is most critical in view of Mr. Chamberlain’s reply. All the anti-Indian laws in both the Colonies are in full force; under them, in the  Transvaal, the Indians cannot own land or trade except in Locations, and must, like the Kaffirs, hold travelling and other  passes.  The Orange River Colony they cannot even enter except as domestic servants. It is regarding these laws that, according to  Mr. Chamberlain’s answer, Lord Milner is to advise him, and His Excellency’s attitude, there are grounds to fear, is not quite so friendly as was at one time expected. He has proclaimed a Coloured Pass-law which is supposed to be an improvement on  the  old Transvaal Pass-law which it replaces; copy of the recent Proclamation is enclosed herewith.libtech_533_footnotelibtech_534_footnoteIt will be seen therefrom that the relief afforded by it can mostly be availed of only by the Kaffirs, though the term Coloured person therein, as of old, includes Indians also. Under the old regime, the Pass-law was rarely in force against the Indians; what the position would be under the strict British authority can easily be surmised. If relief to be granted is to be of the above nature, it is evident that it would be no relief at all. In contravention of the 14th article of the London Convention, the Transvaal Government passed laws practically classifying Indians with the natives of the soil. It will be remembered that both the late Lord Loch and Sir Hercules  Robinson protested against any such classification and,  under  the above        article,        claimed        for        the        Indians        the same rights as the other British subjects. (See South African Bluebook—Grievances of British Indians.) Therefore, even if all the anti-Indian legislation in these two Colonies is not to be repealed, the least that could be done is to distinguish between the British Indians and the Zulus. Under the circumstances, all the available energy must, for the present, be devoted to the question in these two Colonies and, if full justice is done there, Natal would soon have to fall in with them.
 In preparing these notes, in order to avoid needless repetition of facts, a previous knowledge of the memorials, etc., on the part of the sympathising friends has been assumed.

            DEAR 	MR. MAURICE,          RAJKOT,  March 	31, 1902 
  	I had your letters, two in Calcutta and a third redirected from 	Calcutta to Rangoon. I was surprised to learn from your last letter 	that even up to the date thereof you had not received my reply to 	your first letter. I hope, however, that before you embarked for 	South Africa, you had received it.  	I do not know that I deserve the thanks you have thought fit to 	express for anything that I may have done in Calcutta to make your 	visit as comfortable as possible. It was nothing but duty done, and 	I wish I could have done more.  	After tremendous difficulty, I was able to move the President of the 	Chamber of Commerce, and as a result, a very sympathetic reply from 	the Viceroy has been secured. But, of course, sympathy alone would 	do very little. In order to call forth action in accordance with it, 	great effort on the part of the Indian public is necessary.  	I wish you were with me during my voyage to Rangoon as well as the 	3rd class travelling in the North West. Your letter had very nearly 	taken all the wish out of me, but I thought I was bound to carry     
 out the programme first sketched, and so I did, I am glad to say, with the result that I feel all the richer for the experience thus gained. I confess, I do not share altogether your views about the dirty habits of the 3rd class passengers. I do not know that you have travelled 3rd class on the Continental railways as I have. I would far rather be in a 3rd class compartment in India than in Europe; for, at times, the company of the 3rd class passengers on the Continental railways I found to be very disagreeable both from a sanitary standpoint and otherwise. So Mr. Rhodes is dead. However much one may dislike his policy, it is impossible, now that the man is gone, to withhold a tear; that he was a true friend of the Empire it would be very difficult to gainsay. I hope you have settled down once more in Cape Town and that you and your family are keeping good health. Please let me hear from you if you have not written already.
 yours truly,

           TO  THE 	EDITOR          RAJKOT,  April 	22, 1902 
  The Times of 	India   
  SIR,   Your issue of the 	10th instant contains a cablegram to the effect 
  	that a Bill, which imposes on the children of indentured Indians in 	Natal the same disabilities as the parents themselves, has been read 	a second time in the Legislative Assembly of the Colony.  	In the absence of the full text, it is rather difficult to comment 	upon the measure; but as the delivery of letters from South Africa 	is so very uncertain, and as I know with what swiftness Bills can 	become the law of the Colony, I venture to offer a few remarks.  	It was, I think, in the year 1893 that delegates appointed by the 	Natal Government came to India to persuade the Indian Government to 	sanction legislation requiring indentured Indians to return to India 	after the completion of their indentures or to pay a poll-tax of £25 	per year. There is a long history behind this delegation which, 	although painfully interesting, I am obliged to omit, in order to be 	brief. The then Viceroy, His Excellency Lord Elgin, while he 	absolutely refused to impose a poll-tax of £25, unfortunately 	accepted the principle by consenting to a reduced tax of £3. Had 	His Lordship known, as I fear 
 he did not do then, that a similar attempt was made some twenty years back without avail, probably he would not have yielded.
 Now the present Bill is, I fear, in a measure intended to accomplish what the delegation failed to do in 1893. For under it all children of indentured parents (even infants in arms!) would be liable to pay the £3 tax, and if an indentured Indian happens to have seven children, by no means an unlikely event, between him and his children he would have to pay £24 per year, a thing that would be absolutely beyond his capacity. I shudder to contemplate the evil effects of such a measure on the moral tone of the community which is called upon to pay such heavy penalties for the mere permission to exist in the country to which they have been actually invited or, shall I  say,  allured.
 The iniquity of the measure sanctioned by Lord Elgin in 1893 was graphically described by you, as well as the late Sir W. W. Hunter, who called the state of indenture one of semi-slavery. I would beg to quote the opinions also of the Natal legislators, given when the  proposal to compel return of the labourers was first made.
 The late Mr. Saunders, a distinguished Colonist, sometime member of the Natal Legislative Council, made the following remarks on the proposal:
 Though the Commission has made no recommendation on the subject of passing a law to force Indians back to India at the expiration of their term of service unless they renew their indentures, I wish to express my strong condemnation of any such idea, and I feel convinced that many, who now advocate the plan, when they realise what it means, will reject it as energetically as I do. Stop Indian immigration and face results, but don’t try to do what I can show is a great wrong.
 What is it but taking the best out of servants (the good as well as the bad), and then refusing them the enjoyment of the reward! Forcing them back (if we could, but we cannot) when their best days have been spent for our benefit. Where to? Why, back to face a prospect of starvation from which they sought to escape when they were young. Shylock-like, taking the pound of flesh, and Shylock-like we may rely on meeting Shylock’s reward.
 The late Mr. Escombe, sometime Prime Minister of the Colony, at the time of giving his evidence before a Commission appointed to inquire into Indian matters, deposed as follows:
 With reference to time-expired Indians, I do not think that it ought to be compulsory on any man to go to any part of the world save for a crime for which he is transported. I hear a great deal of this question; I have been asked
 
 again and again to take a different view, but I have not been able to do it. A man is brought here, in theory with his own consent, in practice very often without his consent. He gives the best five years of his life, he forms new ties, forgets the old ones, perhaps establishes a home here, and he cannot, according to my view of right and wrong, be sent back. Better by far to stop the further introduction of Indians altogether than to take what work you can out of them and order them away. The Colony, or part of the Colony, seems to want Indians but also wishes to avoid the consequences of Indian immigration. The Indian people do no harm as far as I know; in certain respects they do a great deal of good. I have never heard a reason to justify the extradition of a man who has behaved well for five years. I do not think that the Indian, at the expiration of his five years’ service, should be placed under police supervision unless he is a criminal. I know not why Arabs should be placed under police supervision more than Europeans. In cases of some Arabs the thing is simply ridiculous. They are men of large means, large connections, who are always used in trade if they can be dealt with more profitably than others.
 I am aware that the honourable gentleman, after all, under pressure of electioneering circumstances, later on  did  “take  a different view.” The above extracts deal with compulsory return, but seeing that the poll-tax is meant to secure such a return of the indentured Indians they are applicable to it also, and the Bill under discussion would necessarily imply the return of the children, should they choose not to pay the tax.
 You as well as your other contemporaries have laid the Indian settlers under deep obligation by frequently ventilating their grievances. It, however, appears that European Colonists in Natal will not be happy until every Indian is driven out of Natal. It is, therefore, with the Indian a life-and-death struggle. His cause is admittedly absolutely just. There are many other circumstances favourable to justice being done. We have a very strong Viceroy. The Colonial Secretary has often expressed his sympathy. Will you kindly put all these forces in motion? It would not be premature to move now. Probably, by the time papers are received from Natal, the Bill, too, would have been received at the Colonial Office for sanction. There is, therefore, hardly time to wait. I may state  that  the  Colonial constitution requires sanction from the Home Government for all Colour legislation.

 RAJKOT,
 April 22, 1902
 
  	May I trouble you about the Indians in Natal? You may have read the 	cablegram that appeared in the Times of India of 	the 10th inst. I have written to the Editor a letter on it. I have 	also sent him, in order to enable him to study the history of the 	question, a copy of one of the memorials on the subject. It appears 	to me, if I may venture to make a suggestion, that the most 	effective measure in which probably you can help us, is to see the 	Editor and discuss the situation with him. A powerful and 	intelligent agitation in the press is, at present, the only mode of 	action. As soon as the papers are received from Natal, it may be 	necessary to take Mr. Turner at his word and ask him to join in 	sending a representative memorial to the Viceroy. I am very sorry I 	cannot send you also a copy of the memorial referred to above; but 	if the Presidency Association have at all filed the papers sent to 	it from time to time, you will get a copy from there.

           DEAR 	SIR JOHN,          RAJKOT,  April 	27, 1902 
  	I have to thank you for your kind and welcome letter of the 11th 	March, as also for the photograph which I shall prize very much. I 	am very glad to find that you liked Professor Max Muller’s book. 	Nothing to my mind can conduce better to an understanding  	between the Western and the Eastern branches of the Imperial family 	than a fair knowledge, on the part of either, of the best of the 	other.  	I thank you for your inquiry about my health, which appears to be 	steadily improving.  	I fear that there is a great deal of truth in what some speakers 
 and writers say about the growing poverty of the mass of the Indian peoples. Some classes have certainly become more prosperous, but the millions seem to be sinking. I was here in 1896 and the difference between what I saw then and what I see now is very great. The distress is indescribable. This, however, does not necessarily prove what those speakers and writers allege to be the cause of the poverty. All the same, a return to Akbar’s method of administration may to a certain extent alleviate the distress caused by famine and plague. My remarks on this matter are subject to correction, as I have not yet been able to study the question as fully as I should like to.
 I hope you are enjoying good health and pray that God may grant you many years to enable the country to receive the benefit of your great experience in many problems that still await solution in South Africa. With my respects to you and Lady Robinson,"

238,"May 	6, 1902",NOTES ON THE INDIAN QUESTION,"
    
 
 
 RAJKOT,
  May 	6, 1902  	In these notes, the Indian question as affecting Natal and the two 	new Colonies is alone considered.  NATAL  	Natal is a self-governing Colony whose constitution requires that 	all Colour legislation, before coming into force, must receive the 	sanction of His Majesty the King, and it provides generally that any 	laws passed by the Colonial legislature may be disallowed within two 	years of their passing.  	The Colony has a white population of about 60,000 and an equal 	number of British Indian settlers. The indigenous people, that is, 	the Zulus, are a fine body of men, but they are very lazy, and will 	with difficulty work at a stretch for six months. When, therefore, 	the white settlers were at their wit’s end with reference to the 	steady supply of reliable labour and the Colony was becoming 	bankrupt,  the Legislature resorted to Indian labour and, after some 	negotiations, the Indian Government sanctioned the immigration of 	indentured Indians of Natal. This was nearly 40 years ago. The 	demand for Indian labour continued to increase and with it also the 	prosperity of the Colony. These men contracted to serve, for a 	period of 5 years, any master to whom they may be allotted at a 	monthly wage of 10s. for the first year, with an increase of Is. per 	year. The contract also included free lodging, medical attendance 	and a free return passage at the end thereof.  	The relations between the masters and the men are regulated by a 	special code which imposes some very stringent obligations on the 	men, a breach whereof becomes a criminal offence.  	These labourers were naturally followed by free Indian settlers, 	that is to say, those who paid their own passage and went to the  	Colony in pursuit of trade, etc. The indentured Indians, too, after 	becoming free, instead of availing themselves of a free return 	passage, for the best part elected to remain in the Colony and 	developed into mechanics, petty traders, farmers, etc. This aroused  	keen trade jealousy among the white men who found no difficulty in 	picking out weakest points, viz., the habit of overcrowding, 	communal insanitation and some crude customs or superstitions. These 	were terribly 
 magnified and were often, to our great disadvantage, discussed in the papers, and thus arose the popular prejudice against the Indian settlers who, being themselves unlettered and having no friend who would put their side of the question before the people, were unable to correct it. Before 1894, Natal was a Crown Colony, and attempts made to reproduce that prejudice in legislation were frustrated, but the Colony, having secured rights of complete self-government, succeeded in passing anti-Indian measures. The first attempt made was to pass laws. specially applicable to Indians; for instance, a Bill was introduced preventing Indians from exercising the right of franchise. This was objected to by the Indians and, ultimately, the Colonial Secretary disallowed it. At the time of agitating against the measure, the Indians made it absolutely clear that they did not desire to possess in the Colony any political power, but they objected to it on the ground that it was a preliminary step, as it afterwards proved to be, towards the curtailment of the rights of the British Indian settlers. To return, although the Bill was disallowed, it was replaced by another equally bad, if not worse, for the replacing Bill, which is now the law of the land, disqualifies those who have not hitherto exercised the Parliamentary franchise in their own country. Thus was opened the door to indirect legislation, such as the laws affecting immigration and dealers’ licenses. The Immigration Restriction Act prohibits the entry into the Colony of all those who, not having been  previously domiciled there or not being wife or minor children of such persons, are unable to write out in one of the European languages an application in terms of the form attached to it. The Dealers’ Licenses Act gives absolute powers to the Licensing Officers appointed thereunder to refuse or to grant trading licenses. Their decisions are appealable only before the Municipal Corporations which appoint them and which, consisting as they do chiefly of tradespeople, try to do away with as many Indian licenses as possible. As a matter of fact, these bodies even instruct their officers whether to grant particular licenses or not. The inherent jurisdiction of the Supreme Court has been specially taken away. The licensing law is a matter of eternal soreness and, as the licenses must be renewed every year, the Indian trader has to tremble on the approach of every new year. Notwithstanding these vexing disabilities, nothing, I am afraid, can be directly done for the present, seeing that they are all laws of Natal duly accepted by the Home Government, but the Europeans are not satisfied with what they have gained. They are anxious to impose
 further disabilities by indirect means. I see from the papers received from Natal that the Natal Civil Service Board has lately passed a bye-law regulating the admission of candidates for that examination, and it provides that children of parents. affected by the disfranchising law above referred to shall not be admissible as candidates. In my opinion, this bye-law is illegal, going as it does to the root of the Constitution of the Colony. For, if it were an Act of the Colonial Legislature, it would require the sanction of the Home Government. Moreover, on general principles the bye-laws cannot be allowed to widen or restrict the scope of the Act under which they are framed. I have seen the Civil Service Act and in it I read no warrant for such a bye-law. I cite this instance just to show to what length the principle of indirect legislation has been carried. Of course, our people in Natal will have, if necessary, to test its legality. I have also advised them to memorialize the Governor of the Colony.
 The  recently  published  cablegramlibtech_552_footnotelibtech_553_footnotein   the   papers   shows  the activity of the Europeans in another direction. In 1895, the indentured immigration law was amended so as to lengthen the period of indenture to 10 years and to compel the return to India after the completion of the indenture or, in lieu thereof, to an annual poll-tax of £3. Now according to the cablegram, they propose to exact the poll-tax not only from the indentured immigrant but also from his children.
 TRANSVAAL AND THE ORANGE RIVER COLONY
 In the Transvaal, the Indians cannot own land or live except in Locations. They cannot walk on the footpaths, must take out passes like the Kaffirs. Now when the Location law was passed, Mr. Chamberlain, in reply to the Indian memorial protesting against it and the subsequent stages, gave a very sympathetic reply. He even suggested he might have granted tangible relief had his hands not been tied down by the acts of his predecessor. Moreover, Lord Lansdowne has been reported to have given the disabilities of the Indians as one of the causes of the present war.
 Under such circumstances, it was naturally expected that, after the country passed into British occupation, the disabilities of the Indians would be swept away, but it is feared that the expectation may not be realised. Mr. Chamberlain appears to be shuffling. He talks of
 
 conferring with Lord Milner and asking him what  changes  are possible in the old legislation inherited by the British. Such an attitude is very dangerous. Why should there be any such reference at all? Surely, the very first thing to do should be to equalise the status of all British subjects and then consider whether any section merits special treatment. I understand, and to a certain extent, even sympathise with, this position. In 1896, when he penned his dispatch referred to above, he little thought that the war would be coming so soon and that, too, in such an acute form as to throw the whole country into his hands. Now he must find it difficult, on the one hand, to conciliate the very reasonable and absolutely just demands of the Indians as well as to act according to the terms of his despatch, and, on the other hand, to satisfy the anti-Indian prejudice. He also probably seems to be on the verge of seeing, in his own lifetime and during his term of office, the South African Federation completed. The Indian question must stand in his way, and, if he can harmonise anti-Indian legislation in South Africa, that difficulty is removed. It is, if I am not mistaken, for this reason that he is “tacking”. He wants to sound the Cape and Natal on the question and modify the old legislation only so far as it is  acceptable to the two Colonies.
 It is, then, clear what should be the modus operandi on the part of the Indian publicists. All the available energy has to be directed towards the new Colonies, and, if a satisfactory  solution  can  be secured, the Colony of Natal must necessarily yield, and, in my humble opinion, the way theagitation [ 	]libtech_554_footnotelibtech_555_footnotethe Indian papers to
 keep the matter constantly before the public and the Government. Anglo-Indian sympathy in this matter is with us and that must at all hazards be retained. I attach hereto a copy of the letter from the Viceroy addressed to Mr. Turner which shows his views and which shows also that the Bengal Chamber of Commerce is prepared to move. The public associations must combine. And, if one association were to. make the question of foreign emigration its special study, it can direct in proper channels the whole agitation such that the Home Government cannot easily disregard it.
 In South Africa, we are engaged in a struggle for existence with a race that is intensely active and rich, and which does not brook a defeat. A corresponding activity continually is required on our part, and success is ultimately bound to come.
 
 Several leaders in conversation with me have given way to despair. I must confess I do not share any such feeling, though, certainly, the position is very difficult, and any false move may retard success. It is only to justify such sanguine attitude that I mention the fact that in several matters the Europeans in South Africa have been unsuccessful in carrying their point. In Zululand, for instance, which is part of Natal, legislation was actually passed depriving Indians of the right of buying landlibtech_556_footnotelibtech_557_footnoteand  it  was  disallowed.  The  Immigration Restriction Act and the Dealers’ Licenses Act are also a compromise. The original draft Bills went much further than these, and it was due to persistent agitation that Indians have beep able to retain a footing at all in Natal or the Transvaal. In the Colonies, our endeavour has been to conciliate the Colonials by removing misunderstanding, by sympathising with them in their difficulties in howsoever a humble manner and even by taking part in the war.
 In the Orange River Colony, the disabilities are far more serious. The Indians have no rights there at all, but I imagine  that  the legislation will be the same as in the Transvaal.

RAJKOT,
 May 10, 1902
 With 	reference to my letter about the position of the British  	Indians in Natal published in your issue of the 1st instant, I have 	now received from Natal the papers containing the text of the Bill, 	which I beg to give below:  Bill 	to amend the Indian Immigration Amendment Act, providing that every 	Indian child, on attaining the age of majority (males 16, females 	13), shall be obliged (a) 	to go to India, or (b) 	to remain in Natal under indentures similar to and renewable in the 	same manner as the re-indenture referred to in Act No. 17, 1895, as 	amended by subsequent Acts, or (c) 	to take out year by year, in terms of Section 6 of Act No. 17, 1895, 	a pass or license to remain in the Colony.  Provided, 	however, that 	if such child attains 	majority before the 	completion of 	his father’s 	first or any 	subsequent indenture, the 	operation of 	this section 	shall be suspended 	until the completion 	of such 	indenture. In 	the case 	of a 	child whose father is 	dead or 	not in 	Natal, or 	whose mother was 	unmarried at 	the time of 	the child’s 	birth, the above 	reference to the 	father’s indenture 	shall be deemed 	to apply 	to the mother’s 	indenture. A child 	to whom 	this Act applies 	shall be 	entitled to 	a free 	passage to 	India in 	order to 	enable him 	to proceed 	thither at the 	end of the 	first or 	any renewed 	term of indenture 	of his 	father (or 	of his 	mother, as 	the case 	may be). 	The right 	to a free 	passage shall 	however be 	lost (a) 	if the 	father, or, 	as in the 	above case, the 	mother, shall 	have completed a term 	of indenture 	during the child’s 	minority, and shall 	not have 	returned to India 	or entered 	into a fresh 	indenture in terms 	of Act No. 	17, 1895, 	(b) 	if the 	child does not 	go to 	India by the first 	opportunity available 	to him 	after attaining his 	majority or 	after the 	end of a 	term of 	indenture entered into 	under this 	Act. The Act does not apply 	to persons 	who have 	attained the 	age of majority 	previous to the 	date of taking 	effect of the 	Act, but 	it makes no 	difference whether the 	child is 	born before or 	after arrival 	of parents 	in Natal.  	The Bill, then, if it is any satisfaction to know the fact, is not 	to apply to infants in arms. The more, however, one considers it, 	the more unjust it is found to be. It 	is worthy of note that the children who have received an 
 elementary education in the Colony are expected by the Bill to serve at a rate of wages far below the market-rate, like well-built men as field-labourers from “sunrise to sunset”, and that the children born of the so-called unlawful connections, too, are brought under the Bill. Thus, the children of an indentured woman married according to the religious rites of her sect to a free Indian, but whose marriage is not registered and not recognised in the Colony, will be under the same restrictions as indentured Indians. But it is hardly worth while to examine the details of a measure whose principle is repugnant to the ordinary rules of justice as it is known to those brought up under the British Constitution.
 The same mail that has brought the papers containing the text of the Bill also brings the news that Indian children, attending the schools in the Colony, are to be debarred from receiving the Coronation commemoration medals which are to be presented by the Government in June next to all the European children attending the schools. The exclusion is certainly not based on grounds of economy, for the  Indian children are, I think, about 3,000 against 20,000 European children. Evidently, the Coronation celebration day is to be marked out for the Indian children to realise as vividly as possible that the possession of a brown skin is a sure mark of humiliation and degradation in the estimation of the Government of the Colony.

244,"May 	20, 1902",INDIANS IN NATAL,"
           [TO  THE 	EDITOR  The Englishman]  [SIR,]          RAJKOT,  May 	20, 1902 
  	I venture to ask for a short space in your paper to enable me to 	draw the attention of the public to the latest attempt of the Natal 	Legislature to impose further disabilities on the British Indian 	settlers in that Colony.  	The Natal Parliament has passed a Bill which makes the children 	(males 16, and females 13 years old) of indentured Indians liable, 	like    
 their parents,
 to 	return to 	India, or to 	enter into indentured 	service, or to 	pay the annual 	poll-tax of £3. 
 During Lord Elgin’s viceroyalty, a deputationlibtech_565_footnotecame all the way from Natal to induce His Lordship to sanction legislation terminating the indentures in India, thus preventing their permanent settlement in the Colony, or imposing a poll-tax of £25 per  year on  each indentured Indian who may wish to remain in the Colony as a free man. Happily,
 His Lordship would not listen to any such proposal, but unfortunately, and, I believe, because His Lordship was probably un- aware of certain circumstances, reluctantly accepted the principle of taxation as a price for freedom by sanctioning the imposition of the
 £3 annual tax. Now if the Bill in question becomes law, the Natal Government would have very nearly succeeded in attaining what they failed to get 8 years ago.
 Imperialism is on the lips of everybody, more especially in the Colonies.How to weld the different parts of the British Dominions into one beautiful unbreakable whole is a problem which the greatest British politicians of the day are endeavouring to solve, and yet, here is a Colony which is making invidious distinctions between one class of British subjects and another in a most aggravating manner.
 The attitude of the Natal Government towards the indentured Indians is indefensible from every point of view. These men go to Natal at the invitation of the Colony to materially help forward its ad- vancement. Only last month you published a cablegram stating that the Premier of the Colony, in reply to the proposal to stop indentured emigration from India to the Colony, said that such a thing would paralyse its industries. It was,“when”, in the words of a Natal Legislator, “the fate of the Colony hung in the balance,” that “In- dian labourers were introduced, up went the prices, and up again went the revenue, wages and salary.” It hardly accords with justice and fair- ness to tax the people who have thus given the best 5 years of their lives to the Colony at a rate of wages far below the market-rate. Even in the Colony, though it was a voice in the wilderness, there was one
 
 gentleman, an ex-Attorney-General, Mr. Morcom, K.C., who protested against the Bill in the following terms. He said
 that Indian children who happened to be born in the Colony would have to be deported, or indentured for life, or pay the license [fee] of £3 a year. The way in which the Colony was flooded with Indians for labour might induce many undesirable circumstances but it was utterly impossible for the House, without disregard of justice or constitutional propriety, to deport these children who had had the misfortune to be born in the Colony.
 So long as there are men in Natal who, like Mr. Morcom, are not blinded by prejudice, so long will there be hope for justice being ultimately secured, but, until public opinion there has veered round in favour of justice and fairness, it is very essential that the Indian public should remain on the alert, and that the Home Government firmly insist on justice being done to the Indians.
 In the words of Mr. Morcom, “the idea seems to be to get all the advantages out of the system without regard to its drawback.” Would it not then be “better by far”, in the words of another Natal Legislator, “to stop the further introduction of Indians altogether than to take what work you can out of them and then order them away”?
 This is a question on which there is, there can be, no division of opinion. May I ask you to raise your powerful voice against the con- templated injustice? I may state that the Bill has been  specially  reserved for sanction from the Home Government before it can become law of the Colony.

 The Imperial wave is passing rather furiously over the British dominions. There will be hearty rejoicings wherever the Union Jack floats, during the Coronation. At such a time, peace and good-will unto all British subjects should be the desire of everyone owning the sovereignty of King Edward VII. There can be no true imperialism
 
 unless we have oneness, harmony and toleration among all classes of British subjects. Let us see, then, how the Colony of Natal, which prides itself on being the most British Colony in South Africa, pro- poses to help in realizing this imperial brotherhood and in spreading peace and good-will among all. Attention has already been drawn to the piece of injustice sought to be perpetrated by the Natal Gover- nment on the British Indian settlers in that fair land. To understand thoroughly the gravity of the situation, it would be well to know the history of Indian emigration to Natal.
 As early as 1862, the Colony found, after several experiments, that it could not “stand on its legs” unless it imported Indian labour in order to develop its agricultural resources. The natives of the soil, 400,000 in number, were found to be too lazy to work. The climate was too trying for the white men to do much out-door work. When, therefore, the “fate of the Colony hung in the balance,” the Indian Government were approached to help it out of its difficulty. All kinds of inducements were offered to the first Indian settlers, and a con- tinual stream of emigrants flowed into the Colony from India. Later on, when misgivings arose as to the utility of introducing the Indian element into the Colony, a Commission was appointed to examine the whole question, and one of the Commissioners, Mr. Saunders, thus recorded his opinion:
 The Indian immigration brought prosperity, prices rose, people were no longer content to grow or sell produce for a song; they could do better; war, high prices for wool, sugar, etc., kept up prosperity ant prices of local produce In which the Indians dealt. . . .
 Our records prove, as do those of other  Colonies,  that the introduction of coloured labour which develops and draws out the hidden capabilities of the soil and its unoccupied acres, opens out at the same time numerous unforeseen fields  for  the  profitable  employment  of white  settlers.   If we look back to 1859, we shall find that the assured promise  of  Indian labour resulted  in  an  immediate rise of revenue.       But a ‘few years later,
 alarm arose that it will be suspended simultaneously;   down   went   the revenue;
 . . . and yet another change, a fresh promise of renewed Indian immigration created is effect, and up again wentthe revenue.	Records like these ought  to
tell their own tale and silence childish sentimentalities and mean jealousies.
 The present Premier of the Colony has informed us only lately that a stoppage of Indian emigration would paralyze its industries. The Indian labourer, then, is admittedly indispensable to the welfare of the Colony. As in 1862, so in 1899, it was India which came to the
 rescue in its hour of need. Without Indian labour in 1862 the Colony would have become bankrupt, if its own legislators have given us correct information. In 1899, as the whole world knows, without an Indian army, its capital and its port would have been in Boer hands.
 As a reward for all these services, the Natal  Parliament  has  passed a Bill, imposing an annual tax of £3 on the children of indentured Indians (males 16 years, females 13) unless, on attaining the artificial majority, they either deported themselves  from  the Colony or entered into a series of indentures during their stay in the. Colony! It maybe remarked in passing that the indenture wage is 10s. per month the minimum, and £1 per month the maximum—a rate which is far below the market-rate; moreover, breaches of these indentures on the part of the indentured men become  criminal offences which, under ordinary contracts, can only be dealt  with civilly.
 It is painful to recall the fact that it was Lord  Elgin’s Government that paved the way for the imposition of a poll-tax on the children of the immigrants by consenting to a levy of the tax on the parents; but we have no hesitation in saying that the parents’ liability to pay the tax cannot justify a similar imposition upon the children, for, the former, at any rate, are presumed to know the conditions under which they go to Natal, and lawyers may say, that if they choose to accept very onerous conditions, it is their look-out. But are the children presumed to know any such conditions? That they are born of such parents is no doubt a grievous misfortune. Unfortunately, they cannot help themselves. The parents, again, know what indentured labour is, they know what India is; but the same cannot be said of their children born in the Colony. To expect them, after they have, perhaps, received some education, and known its worth in the Colony, either to go to India or to accept a status described by the late Sir W. W. Hunter as that of semi-slavery, is cruel in the extreme.
 Evidently, the Colony wants to get all it can out of the poor Indian, and at the same time to avoid the consequences of the in- troduction of Indian labour. A more straightforward course to adopt would be, if it did not care to have the Indian as he is, to do away with his labour altogether—an attitude which would be at once intelligible and satisfactory. We have no wish to force our countrymen on them, but it is fair to expect a just British treatment for those who are invited to the Colony; and if it is impossible for the Indian Government to
 secure for the settlers a fair treatment, and if the Colony will not, of its own accord, stop the State-regulated importation of Indian labour, it is clearly the duty of our Government to help it to do so. We have fortunately a vigilant andmasterful Viceroy in Lord Curzon, and we hope His Excellency will not allow any serious injustice to be perpetrated. May we not also appeal to sober-minded people in the Colony itself? We see that one member at least of the Natal Parliament, Mr. Morcom, would have nothing to do with the Bill, the un-British character of which he showed up in forcible language. We are sure there must be many who think like Mr. Morcom. Why will they not all speak out like him and break down the barrier of prejudice against the poor British Indian? In the meanwhile, however, we have a right to look up to Mr. Chamberlain to exercise his powerful influence ii the Colonies on the side of justice and fairplay.

     From 	the photostat of the office copy: S.N. 3957.              DEAR 	MESSRS NAZAR AND KHAN,  Yours truly,            RAJKOT,  June 	3, 1902 
  	I now enclose herewith a memo of expenditurelibtech_568_footnotelibtech_569_footnoteon 	account of the Natal work. You will notice that it amounts to Rs. 	378-7-9, a trifle over Rs. 375 realised from the draft. Of late, 	South African work has increased considerably. I returned from 	Calcutta at the end of February, and since that time I have engaged 	a clerk on the usual terms, namely, that he gets copying charges 	which are for the most part paid by the clients. At present I am 	supposed to be taking rest, nor would there be much work for me in 	Kathiawar even if I opened a regular office. The real use I can 	make, therefore, of clerical assistance is with reference to public 	work. Now about 100 sides of type-written matter have been already 	copied, not including carbon copies, besides a lot of Gujarati 	correspondence and other work. As copying fees for this work, I have 	so far paid only Rs. 15. The usual charges here are half a rupee per 	each written side. I think I am understating the work when I say 	that he has had to devote on an average 3 hours per day. Under the 	circumstances, I consider the payment to be very small. I should 	like to be able to pay him at least Rs. 40 for the whole of the work 	up to date. Moreover, the work continues. Had I got funds, I should 	have been able to distribute literature more widely. As it is, I am 	obliged to work as if I had no funds. I should very much like to 	subscribe to one or two papers, for instance India, Englishman, 	etc., which are not to be had in the Rajkot Library; also to 	directories. Soon after reaching Bombay, I invested in a typewriter 	Rs. 200. The machine has been wholly used for public work. I have, 	therefore, to submit the following three propositions to the 	Congress: 1st. 	It should vote the balance of my account and Rs. 25 extra    
 for clerical fees, i.e., Rs. 28-7-9.
 2nd. It should buy over the typewriter, to be taken over by me whenever I am in a position to do so, at the same price, unless, it is sooner taken away by the Congress from me.
 3rd. The Congress should vote a further sum of £25 to cover future expenses.
 If all the three propositions are accepted, you will have to send me £25, and the cost of the typewriter plus Rs. 28-7-9. I am thoroughly aware that any expense beyond £25 is undertaken at my own risk and, at the time of buying the typewriter, I had absolutely no thought of making the proposal I am now making, as I did not then expect my pecuniary position to be so bad as it is. It is, therefore, entirely at the option of theCongress whether to accept or to reject the first two proposals, by which I mean the Congress must not think of sanctioning them, because they are my proposals. If, on their merits, they appear to be reasonable and if it was a matter of buying a new typewriter, the Congress would still invest in it, then alone should the 2 proposals be considered. I may also state that the clerk working with me is my nephew and, but for the volume of work, I should not have thought of paying any clerical charges to him. He is not a volunteer who may be expected to work to any extent without pay. He has no source of income except through me, As to the 3rd proposal, if it is accepted, it will enable me the better to carry on the public work, whenever any expenses are necessary.
 I herewith enclose a copy of the Presidency Association Memo- rial,1 and my letter to the Englishman2 and an article for the Voice of India.3 I am daily expecting at least 100 copies of your Immigration Memorial,4 as also a few photographs and copies of the coronation address, not to say copies of other memorials, South African Blue book, etc. I should very much like to possess Bird’s Annals of Natal and the latest report of the Superintendent of Education. The
 
 Government Gazette and The Natal Mercury weekly I ought to receive without fail.

 BOMBAY PRESIDENCY ASSOCIATION
 APOLLO BUNDER,
 BOMBAY,
 June 5, 1902
 TO
 THE RIGHT HONOURABLE LORD GEORGE HAMILTON
 H.M.’S PRINCIPAL SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA-IN-COUNCIL LONDON
 YOUR LORDSHIP,
 By direction of the Council of the Bombay Presidency Association, we beg to draw Your Lordship’s attention to a Bill which has passed its second reading in the Legislative Assembly of Natal and which is termed “The Bill to Amend the Indian Immigration Amendment Act”.
 The Bill in effect purposes to bring [under it] the major children (males 16 years and females 13) of the British Indians, indentured under the Act No. 17 of 1885 of the Natal Legislature, and would, therefore, like their parents, render them liable:
  to 		return to 		India at 		the Colony’s 		expense or to 		enter into indentured 		service or to 		pay the annual 		poll tax of £3.  
 It is difficult to say whether the Bill will be finally passed by both the Houses and reach the Colonial Office for sanction. But, in view of the uncertainty of postal delivery of letters from South Africa, the Council deems it right, even at this somewhat premature stage, to enter this humble protest against this latest attempt of the Natal Government to impose restrictions of a harsh character on the liberty of the British Indians.
 As Your Lordship is aware, it was with great reluctance that HisExcellency Lord Elgin, the then Viceroy, sanctioned in 1894 the imposition on the indentured Indians of the £3 tax, euphemistically called a pass or licence, to remain in the Colony. That tax is admitted
 
 to be severe enough, though the original proposal of the Natal Government was to secure permission to levy a £25 tax.
 It is now evidently sought to reach the same figure as much as possible by taxing the children of the indentured men after they have attained the artificial majority.
 The object of regulating by law the emigration of the population of India is, the Council understands, to foster foreign settlement and 40 protect such settlers. This object would be obviously frustrated if the labourers, after they had given, in the words of the Natal legislators, the best 5 years of their lives to the Colony, are compelled to return to India.
 And if it is a hardship on the men who have been brought up in India to return to India, how much more so must it be for those who went to the Colony as infants or were born there. The object of the Bill cannot be mistaken. The tax is to be levied not for the purposes of revenue. The intention is to make it sufficiently severe to oblige those coming within the scope of the intended legislation to return to India.
 Indeed, Europeans in Natal are endeavouring to secure such legislation as would make the indentures terminate  in  India.  The Prime Minister of the Colony has, as it appears from recent cablegrams, stated that the stopping of Indian immigration would paralyse the industries of Natal. The Council  asks  respectfully, whether the people, who are so indispensable to the welfare of the Colony, and who have materially helped to make it what it is, are to be singled out for special taxation.
 The Council, moreover, begs to draw Your Lordship’s attention to the fact that these very indentured Indians, at a time when their service was imminently required, voluntarily came forward to help the military authorities as stretcher-bearers. The work of the Natal Volunteer Indian Ambulance Corps is well known to Your Lordship. It has been favourably mentioned in Despatches.
 The Council ventures to think that such men deserve a better treatment than being subjected to an annual tax of the character above described
 The principle of the measure is so manifestly unjust that the Council does not consider it necessary to enter into an examination of its details.
Ever since the Colony has obtained self-government, the Indian
 
 settlers there, whether free or indentured, have not had rest from “pin-prick’, legislation of the character to which Your Lordship’s attention has been drawn by various public bodies, including the Association.
 If it is found difficult to restrain the self-governing Colony from riding rough-shod over imperial considerations and treating British subjects as aliens, the Council of the Association, in common with the East India Association, which has only recently approached Your Lordship, respectfully considers that it is time Your Lordship should adopt measures to suspend State-regulated emigration from India to the Colony, the moreso now, seeing that it is these very people who are touched by the Bill in question.
 We remain, &c.,

Even if you want Oomiashanker to go up for the matric, I am sure he won’t pass. His heart is not in it and I do not think he is industrious enough; he may require a little goading. The Technical School here is not doing much. The telegraphic class is closed. So the only thing he is doing at present is typewriting. The book-keeping class is very indifferently managed.
