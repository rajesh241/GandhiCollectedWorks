Courtesy: Pyarelal       May 	31, 1939  	It is growing upon me every day that we shall have to lower our key, 	our demand for full responsible government will have to remain in 	abeyance for some time. Not that we are not entitled to it, but it 	is clear to me that we have not the will for it, we are not ready to 	pay the price. There is an awakening, but it is not the awakening of 	active non-violence of the brave. Not that I have  suddenly  	realized  this point. The realization was there, the will to face 	the conclusion was not there, and I am reaping the fruit of that 	weakness of the will. I have been weak-willed ever since Bardoli 	onwards, but my co-workers deluded themselves into the belief that 	we had attained the requisite non-violence and I shared their 	delusion.  	I do not repent of this. It is likely that if we had acted otherwise 	there would not have been the awakening we see today. But that seems 	to lead one to a rather dreadful conclusion, viz., that compromise 	with non-violence was necessary for a widespread awakening ! But 	that is not the conclusion. The conclusion is that God chooses as 	his instruments the humblest and weakest of His creatures to fulfil 	Him- self.  	Today with [this] great realization I would not lead another Dandi 	March. The breach of the salt laws was a perfect proposition, but 	violence of the mind had crept in almost from the beginning. All 	that we had learnt then was that it was expedient to refrain from 	the    
 use of physical violence. This was the non-violence of the calculating Bania, not of the brave Kshatriya. This non-violence of the calculating Bania has not, could not have, carried us far. It could not possibly avail to win and retain swaraj, to win over our opponent who believed in the use of arms.
 Today I sense violence everywhere, smell it inside and outside Congress ranks. In 1921 even goonda element outside the Congress was more or less under our control. Perfect non-violence is difficult. It admits no weakness. It made me take the false step of approaching the Viceroy in order to end my fast. It was unpardonable on the part of a general who claims to derive his whole strength from God. But God gave me that courage to retrieve the blunder, and we are all the  stronger and purer for it.
 I am not tired of repeating again and again that we should be non-violent in thought and word and deed. We had been saying so, but there was no emphasis on the first of these. A dissolute character is more dissolute in thought than in deed. And the same is true of vio- lence. Our violence in word and deed is but a feeble echo of the surging violence of thought in us.
 Are you prepared to go with me so far? Does all that I say carry conviction? If so, violence should be eschewed from the innermost of our thoughts. But if you cannot go with me, do go your own way. If you can reach your goal in any other way, do so by all means. You will deserve my congratulations. For I cannot in any case stand cowar- dice. Let no one say when I am gone that I taught the people to be cowards. If you think my ahimsa amounts to that, or leads you to that, you should reject it without hesitation. I would far rather that you died bravely dealing a blow and receiving a blow than died in abject terror. If the ahimsa of my dream is impossible, you can reject the creed rather than carry on the pretence of non-violence.
 Fleeing from battle—palayanam—is cowardice, and unworthy of a warrior. An armed fighter is known to have sought fresh arms as soon as he loses those in his possession or they lose their efficacy. He leaves the battle to get them. A non-violent warrior knows no leaving the battle. He rushes into the mouth of himsa, never even once har- bouring an evil thought. If this ahimsa seems to you to be impossible, let us be honest with ourselves and say so, and give it up.
 For me there is no laying down arms. I cannot do so. I am trying to be the warrior of my description and, if God wills, I may be that during this life. Such a warrior can fight single-handed.
 Let me give a bit of my  own  experience in  South  Africa. When thousands joined the movements, I had not spoken to them, not even seen them. Papers they could not read. My heart was working in unison with them. Living faith is all that is necessary. It is evident that I have not the capacity today to inspire faith in the millions. This needs superior living faith in non-violence and in God. This faith is self-acting, and illumines man’s life more and more every day. In the pursuit of my earnest research I may seem to act strangely. I  should not grumble if everyone left me in the honesty of his conviction. Let no one stick to me in the blind faith that something will happen. Such [faith] will hinder rather than help the cause.

 I have been talking of non-violence these 20 years but I have made unlawful compromises with myself. My mind goes back to the days of Khilafat agitation. I had the friendship of thousands of Mus- lims then. When at a meeting of the Muslim League before 1920 I asked for the supreme sacrifice, two or three names were given by Khwaja Saheb Abdul Majid, but I believed that many would come forward at the right time. And they did. But looking back upon those times I see that I compromised non-violence. I was satisfied with mere abstention from physical violence.libtech_4_footnote
 The fact is I have never placed unadulterated ahimsa before the country. If I had done so, there would have been complete Hindu- Muslim unity. No doubt I kept on saying there would be no swaraj without Hindu-Muslim unity, but I should have seen that there was no Hindu-Muslim unity because there was not that insistence on unadul- terated ahimsa on the part of all, whether Hindu or Muslim.  No wonder my new technique puzzles many. But I must go on. If I am right, the puzzles will be solved.

The path of those who 	worship ahimsa under all circumstances is straight. Such a person 	will not indulge in fighting even in self-defence. But he who does 	not have that strength has but to run away—that is, play the 	coward—if he does not attack the attacker. Cowardice is worse than 	violence because cowards can never be non-violent. So such people 	should learn to     
 defend themselves. Under its constitution members of the Parishadlibtech_7_footnotecan be said to be wedded to non-violence. But here such ahimsa is of no use. A person who has full faith in non-violence should be a thousand times more fearless than an armed man. Such fearlessness is not gained by joining some organization. Hence every member of the Parishad should find an independent way for himself. It is the duty of every believer in ahimsa to see that cowardice is not propagated in the name of non-violence. So we must frankly tell the common people that we are unable to guide them. It is not proper that they should look to us. If they can independently think of non-violent ways they will not ask us and if they do ask us we should give them only one guidance that they should not be weak under any circumstances. They should learn to deal with the attacker. It is possible that if they observe restraint and if a handful of us can manifest true ahimsa, the attacker too may turn to ahimsa.
 Please explain all this to all our workers there. The talk of secret settlement that is going on in Bhavnagar is harmful. Settlement can be with straightforward people. Here there is nothing of the sort.

7,"June 1, 1993",DISCUSSION WITH TRAVANCORE STATE CONGRESS DEPUTATIONlibtech_8_footnote,"
  
 ON THE TRAIN,
 [June 1, 1993]libtech_9_footnote
 QUESTION: What about swaraj that we have been fighting for? How does Gandhiji’s faith in non-violence burning brighter than ever help those who want swaraj here and now? Does not the emphasis on non-violence of his conception make of swaraj a very remote vision hardly to be fulfilled?
 GANDHIJI: For me, it is true, as I have often declared, ahimsa comes before swaraj. I would not care to get power through anarchy and red ruin, among other things, because I want freedom and power even for the least among the people. This can only be when freedom is won
 
 ibid
 through non-violence. In the other case the weak must go to the wall, only the physically strong and fit will remain to seize and enjoy power.
 But you too cannot help putting ahimsa before everything else if you really mean business. Ahimsa must be placed before everything else while it is professed. Then alone it becomes irresistible. Otherwise it will only be an empty hulk, a thing without potency or power. A soldier fights with an irresistible strength when he has blown up his bridges, burnt his boats. Even so it is with a soldier of ahimsa.
 Q. But how will this lowering of the pitch work out in action? How will it help us in attaining our goal of responsible government?
 G. Today when we talk of responsible government, it frightens the States authorities. The Paramount Power too do not like it. They think it will result in red ruin and anarchy. The argument is unsound but let us give them credit for honesty. If you follow my advice, therefore, you will say, ‘We, for the time being, forget swaraj. We shall fight to vindicate the elementary rights of the people, to remove corruption.’ In short, you will concentrate your attention on details of administration. The auth-orities won’t be frightened, and it will give you the substance of responsible government. That has  been the history of all my work in India. If I had only talked of swaraj, I would have come a cropper. By attacking details we have advanced from strength to strength.
 What did I do at the time of the Dandi March? I reduced our demand for complete independence to my eleven points.libtech_10_footnoteMotilalji was at first angry with me.“What do you mean by lowering the flag like this?” he said. But he soon saw that if those points were con- ceded, indepen-dence would stand knocking at our door.
 Let me explain to you the working of my mind. As I have already told you, I had thought that responsible government in the States was within easy reach. We have now found that we can’t at once take the masses with us along non-violent lines. You say that violence is committed by a few hooligans only; but capacity to obtain non- violent swaraj presupposes capacity on our part to control the hooli- gans too as we temporarily did during the non-co-operation days. If you had complete control over the forces of violence and were ready to carry on the fight with your back to the wall in defiance of the Paramount Power, looking neither to me nor to the Congress outside
 
 for guidance or help, your would not need to lower the key tem- porarily even. In fact you will not be here to seek my advice at all.
 But that is not your case, on your own admission. Nor, so far as  I know, is it the case anywhere else in India. Otherwise people would not have suspended civil disobedience in many places even without my asking.

 ASSOCIATIONlibtech_11_footnote
 BOMBAY
 [June 2, 1939]libtech_12_footnote
 Gandhiji congratulated them on the restrained language of their represen- tation. They had every right to go to him, as he was specially attached to the Parsis [He said:]
 What I gather from  your  representation  is  that  far  from being opposed in principle to prohibition, you have pointed out the difficulties and hardships involved. But I am afraid you have come to the wrong man. I never interfere with the work of the Ministries. But on prohibition I am keener even than the Ministers. I confess I have not studied the economic aspect of the question. With me it is a creed and I would, if I could, fulfil it at any cost. If I had the administration in my own hands, I should study all the figures you have given. I am sure the Ministers have studied them, and you should approach them. They would gladly discuss the whole question with you and try to show the way out the difficulties you have pointed out.
 
 They also raised the question of short notice. The Congress Election Mani- festo,libtech_13_footnotethey said, did not contain this programme, and the decision to introduce it in August had come upon them as a bolt from the blue. In reply to this Gandhiji said:
The Congress Election Manifesto is principally a political docu-
 ment and naturally does not contain the prohibition programme. But prohibition has been in the forefront of the Congress programme since 1920. With me it has been a passion ever since my close contact with the Indian immigrants in South Africa and also with the South Africans. I have seen with my own eyes the terrible scourge drink can be. It has ruined people morally, physically, economically and it has destroyed the sanctity and happiness of the home. My heart bleeds as  I think of the disaster that comes in its wake and I have really pined for the immediate introduction of prohibition. When the Congress decided to accept offices, I thought it had a golden opportunity to introduce it at once, but it was the Ministers who pleaded for fixing the time-limit at three years. To my mind, therefore, there is  no question of short notice. It is coming several years too late. Hundreds and thousands of women have in the past picketed liquor shops, suffered insults and assaults. In one case a woman volunteer was so hit on the forehead that the evil effect still persists. There was no com- pulsion. It was all peaceful persuasion, and it had succeeded so remar- kably that in some provinces the excise revenue was almost reduced to zero. As for its effects here in India I would like you to study the condition of workmen in factories, and I would like to tell you also the boon prohibition has been to them in Ahmedabad.
 One of the gentlemen in the deputation said that 12 to 15 thousand tappers would be adversely affected and that fresh toddy had great medicinal value.
It is nira you are referring to. For I agree it is a refreshing drink,
and we make gur out of it.libtech_14_footnote
 If the tappers took to tapping the juice for gur-making, there was no question of their unemployment. In Bengal tons of gur was prepared from nira and in South India arrack was prepared from gur made out of fresh juice.
 But the gentleman maintained that it was impossible to draw fresh nira from a tree more than ten times during a season and that gur was not a feasible proposition. Gandhiji said that the evidence in his possession was to the contrary. He would, however, inquire.

9,"June 2, 1939",INTERVIEW TO PARSI DEPUTATIONlibtech_15_footnote,"
  
 [June 2, 1939]libtech_16_footnote
 The gravamen of their charge was that the prohibition policy was tantamount to coercion as the community had for centuries indulged in drink without being any the worse for it. There was the argument of dislocation of trade and financial and economic structure of the province, of the hardships it would cause to traders and tappers, and the interference with the religious rites of the people. They said they also resented the distinction between Asiatics and non-Asiatics, and even suggested that not only the Parsis but Mussalmans and Hindus were also opposed to the policy!
 Some of the gentlemen have been friends of Gandhiji for years, especially Sir Cowasji. And so he was the most vehement in his attack, but the utmost friendliness prevailed during the discussion.
 COWASJI: Drunkenness is bad, not drink. And for the sake of a few who drink, why penalize the whole community? I take two or three glasses of sherry every day and I know hundreds of others who talk of prohibition but who do drink and will do so   in spite of prohibition.
 There was obvious defiance in his voice, but Gandhiji disarmed  it  by ultimately reminding Sir Cowasji how he had helped him (Gandhiji) in the past at various junctures, and how he expected him to stand by him at this!
 Sir Cowasji had a hearty laugh.
 Mr. Khareghat, the veteran temperance reformer who, said Gandhiji, reminded him of Dadabhai by his silvery beard, entered a curiuos plea :
 I do not drink, nor am I dealer in drinks. But this policy will ruin thousands, and I want you to realize your error and do as you did in Rajkot. I would then honour you with all my heart. According to our religion it is the duty of the host to offer the guest good bread and good wine.
GANDHIJI: But it must be unfermented wine. Whatever it may be,
 one wonders how this can be a religious duty at all! What would a poor man do?
 SAKLATWALA: I do not drink, and thank God I have enough property to enable me to pay the property tax. But why should others regulate my life? I tell you, although, I do not drink, if someone came and told me I might not drink, he would make my blood boil.
 GANDHIJI (smilingly): Even so you do not steal, and yet there is the law against thieving. Would you therefore steal to defy the law?
 
 H. P. MODI: We do not believe in prohibition. Why do you tempt us to break the law? We want to be exempted. Drink has become part of our social habit, our daily life, and we want to drink.
 GANDHIJI:  As I toldlibtech_17_footnotelibtech_18_footnotethe deputation that preceded you, you have come to the wrong man. There is a wide gulf between you and me. It was Dadabhai Naoroji who taught me prohibition and the distinction between prohibition and temperance. Individual liberty is allowed to man only to a certain extent. He cannot forget that he is a social being, and his individual liberty has to be curtailed at every step. I would appeal to you to consider one thing. What is your population? One lakh at the most in a population of 35 crores. You have become famous in the world not as residents of Persia but as Indians. I want you to consider not in terms of your one lakh but in terms of India, not the narrow interest of your whole community but of the large interests of the whole country. How can you interrupt and ruin a noble experiment? You say you cannot get rid of this, so very much you are wedded to it! You are not fair to yourselves there. You have given up so many things. You gave up your language and adopted Gujarati, you changed your dress, you changed many of your manners and customs. Why must you then stick to this one infirmity? You may plead your weakness, but for Heaven’s sake don’t advance the plea of individual liberty. There you have given away the whole case. You have sacrificed much for India, sacrifice this bad habit too. I have seen men and women wallowing in gutters in South Africa and families ruined.
 H. P . MODI: Where do you see the ruin in India?
 [GANDHIJI:] I tell you I have seen it with my own eyes. There is the tragic case of my own son. 60,000 men in Ahmedabad are blessing the prohibitionist. I claim that the moral conscience of the public is with me. The issue between us is the narrowest possible. Do you want to press the question of a few individual consciences to the extent of ruining a whole country?
 But are there not other evils? There is gambling, for instance.
 None so disastrous as this, and this breeds the rest. But I am for the abolition of gambling too. This evil, however, ruins the victim body and soul.
 The same thing would happen if you were to overeat ! You are talking of the 60,000 mill-hands in Ahmedabad. Why not listen to the appeal of 50,000 Parsis of Bombay? Drunkenness is unknown amongst us.
 
 
 Let us assume that for a moment. It proves that you are tem- perate. Well, then why will you not carry temperateness a little further and co-operate in this the greatest of all moral reforms in India? And remember there is ample provision for those who need drink for their health or religious rites. I suggest your working along these lines but not seeking to ruin the reform.
 But why draw the line between Europeans and Indians?
 Call it my weakness, and agitate for including the Europeans too in the prohibition. They will, like us, profit by being included in the general law. Their health will not suffer for they will have all the drink they may need for their health.

  AM	CONSTANT	TOUCH	OUR	COUNTRYMEN	SOUTH	AFRICA.  GANDHI  From 	a copy: Pyarelal Papers. Courtesy: National Archives of India       BOMBAY  June 4, 1939 I 	have had prolonged conversationslibtech_21_footnotewith Shri Pattom Thanu Pillai, Shri Verghese and Shri 	J. Philipose over the situation in Travan- core. My rich experiences 	in Rajkot show me that civil disobedience in Travancore was 	suspended at the right time. The Rajkot recantation teaches   me   	that   it  is  not  enough  to   have  with-drawn  the charges      
 against Sir C. P. Ramaswami Iyer. But it is necessary to recognize that Travancoreans have not only to reckon with the Maharaja, but also with his Dewan. I also observe that several Travan-corean critics have asserted that suspension has led to greater repression. These critics do not know that suspension was not advised in  order  to  avoid repression, nor even in expectation of its being stopped. It was advised in order to avoid popular violence, no matter how caused or by whom instigated, if it was instigated. It was also advised in order to avoid brutalization of human nature. These two objects may be said to have been attained in a fair measure. It was also advised in order to pave the way for an honourable understanding with the authorities and to educate the people in the true way of ahimsa. These objects have still to be worked for. Here my new light, which I seem to see dimly, enables me to tender advice which, but for the light, I would perhaps not have been able to give with as much confidence as now.
 I am convinced that direct negotiations should be opened with the authorities. Hitherto the State Congress people have talked at the authorities and the latter at them. The result has been a widening of the gulf between the two. It would not do for a satyagrahi to argue that the approach must be mutual. That assumes the existence of the spirit of satyagraha in the authorities, whereas satyagrahia is offered in respect of those who make no claim to be satyagrahis. Hence the first and the last work of a satyagrahi is ever to seek an opportunity for an honourable approach. Now this is impossible so long as the heart is steeled against a belief even in the possibility, let alone advisability, of such approach. And hitherto the impossibility has been unquestion- ably assumed. I have been a tacit party to it. I now know better. If the leaders have active ahimsa in them, they must cultivate a belief in the perfect possibility and necessity of such approach. And if they have that belief, the way will surely be open to them. In my own person, it is well known, I have always acted on that principle. In making such an approach it would be necessary to lower the key of our note. Our aim must remain what it is, but we must be prepared to negotiate for less than the whole so long as it is unmistakably of the same kind and has in it inherent possibility of expansion. I have found that nowhere, with the only exception of Aundh libtech_22_footnotelibtech_23_footnote, are the Princes ready to part with
 
 all the power in favour of the people. Nor is the Paramount Power anxious for the people in the States to receive full responsible govern- ment. If I interpret its mind correctly, assuming that an institution can have a mind, it would be sorry if any State of importance copied the example of Aundh. But, what is most important of all, the States people themselves, as a mass, are nowhere prepared to pay the price. There is no mistaking the awakening that has taken place in the States. But it is not enough for the great purpose to be attained. It will be well to recognize this fact. In aiming beyond our capacity we are likely to lose all. I would give much to have in all the States a reign of law instead of the reign of a person or persons, however well-meaning they may be. I can then see my way to build up responsible govern- ment on the solid foundation. But responsible government, which is only a gift without the will and the power of the people behind it, will be a mere paper responsibility, hardly worth the paper on which it may be printed.
 The second object of suspension is closely related to the foregoing. If it is a fact that the atmosphere for immediate responsible government among the States is not propitious and that the people are not ready to pay the price, it follows that they should have the proper training for it. I am not likely, lightly and in the near future, to advise mass satyagraha anywhere. There is neither adequate training nor discipline among the people. I have not the shadow of a doubt that the people at large should pass one or more positive tests. Mere abstention from physical violence will not answer our purpose. In the centre of this programme of positive tests I unhesitatingly put the spinning- wheel and all it means. If there is quick response, this can be a short course. But it may well be a long course if the people do not make an enthusiastic response. I know no other programme than the fourfold constructive programme of 1920. If the people do not take it up whole-heartedly, it is proof enough for me that they have no ahimsa in them, or not the ahimsa of my conception, or, say, they have no confidence in the present leadership. For me there is no other test but what I have ever put before the nation since 1920. The new light tells me that I must not weaken as I have done before in exacting the disci- pline I have mentioned. I can quite clearly see my way to advise civil disobedience wherever the conditions mentioned are amply ful-filled. That civil disobedience will be individual but in terms of ahimsa far more effective than any mass civil disobedience of the past. I must own that the past movements have been more or less tainted. I have no
 regret for them. For I knew no better then. I had the sense and humi- lity to retrace my steps whenever I discovered blunders. Hence the nation has gone forward from step to step. But the time has come for a radical change in the direction indicated.
 Thus my opinion on Travancore has resolved itself in the enun- ciation of my present mental condition and its reaction on the Travancore situation.
 To sum up: (1) suspension of mass civil disobedience should be indefinite; (2) there should be the will among the State Congress people to open a way to honourable negotiation with the authorities;
 (3) there should be no anxiety about those satyagrahis who are in prison or new ones. If the spirit of satyagraha is rightly assimilated, these imprisonments and disabilities should hearten the people; (4) the pitch of the immediate demands should be lowered if necessary, in order to quicken the progress towards the final goal; (5) the condition precedent to any civil disobedience is the fulfilment by the general mass of the constructive programme as a test, if nothing more, of their coming under the discipline of the State Congress.
 It is hardly necessary for me to say that it is open to the workers to reject my advice. They should adopt it only if it appeals to their heads and their hearts and tallies with their own reading of the local situation of which I own they must be better judges.libtech_24_footnote

       BOMBAY,  June 	6, 1939  That 	he would not object to any State, which is really ready for it, 	resorting to the direct step of civil resistance towards achieving 	responsible government and that he always recommended it to such 	States but that he would not be willing to allow any State to launch 	satyagraha unless he was satisfied that the State was fully prepared 	for it, was the view expressed by Gandhiji. The deputation asked 	Gandhiji several questions to which he gave answers. The following 	are some of the questions and answers :  Q. 	Even in 	spite of 	the fact that at 	present the 	Kolhapur State 	authorities are 	not in 	a mood to negotiate 	with the Parishad 	workers, in 	view of your  latest  	statementlibtech_30_footnoteon the 	Travancore State 	should negotiations be 	started with 	the State authorities?  A . My 	statement is meant only for the Travancore State. I know more than 	anyone that the State authorities in any state are never willing to 	have negotiations with their people. This I have realized from the 	talks I had with Mr. Virawala in Rajkot. Negotiations should always 	be started in an honourable way and for such negotiations there 	should be a suitable and proper atmosphere. If that is not possi- 	ble in your State, it is far better for you not to start 	negotiations at an immature time. I found that opportunity and I 	have issued that statement concerning Travancore only.     the 	preceding item.  
 Q. What should the workers do on whom notices have been served by the Durbar to be present before the court failing which their properties will be confiscated?
 A . There is no objection in being present before a court. But it would be noble to lose the properties remaining outside the State and to work for ideals, like Garibaldi, Mazzini, etc. It is a sin even to hold properties in a State where no law prevails. Here you may think that the people will think in a different way about your staying outside the State and they will get demoralized. But if you really lose your property and if the people are convinced that you work sincerely for them, you need not fear demoralization of any kind in them. You should always be sure that self-sacrifice carries public support.

23,"June 7, 1939",NOTES,"
  
 LEADERS MUST LEAD
A Cutch worker came in yesterday and said  :
 Some leaders in Cutch are telling the people there that but for your stopping civil disobedience they would today be enjoying responsible government or something near it.
 I must deny having stopped civil disobedience in Cutch or for the matter elsewhere. All I gave was my opinion. I had told Shri Mulraj who had come to consult me that the workers should weigh my opinion in the light of their own personal experience of things and adopt it only if it coincided with their own experience. I should be noted that my opinion was not given publicly. If it was not acceptable to the local leaders, it need never have been published. Even now in Cutch as elsewhere responsible leaders are free to act according to their own judgment. We should never develop the requisite qualities of leadership, unless leaders shoulder responsibility and even dare to commit mistakes in acting contrary to the advice of persons like me. Here there would be no question of indiscipline, for I am not in active command anywhere. I give advice as an expert when reference is made to me. Those who seek my advice will wrong themselves and those whom they lead, if they will suppress their own judgment when it seems contrary to mine, especially when mine is not based on direct local knowledge.
 JAIPUR AGAIN
 Things are moving much too slow in Jaipur. The papers repor- ted that a settlement between the Durbar and the people was imminent
 and that Seth Jamnalalji and his co-workers would  be  free.  The matters in dispute seem to be incredibly simple. Civil disobe-dience was decided upon only to vindicate civil liberty. It was resorted to when even the right of the Praja Mandal to function for the purpose of educating the people in a constitutional manner to agitate for local responsible government in the State was questioned. Some time ago a communique was issued by the Durbar setting forth the conditions for the recognition of the Praja Mandal. Surely the Durbar could easily have adjusted the conditions to suit the civil disobedience leaders. Thus, for instance, the condition that “no office-holder of the local association shall be also an office-holder of any political association outside the State” seems to be vexatious. Why should Seth Jamnalalji be disqualified from being President of the Praja Mandal by reason of his being a member of the Working Committee of the National Con- gress? Or is the condition specially aimed at him? An explana-tion is necessary. There are other conditions which too require eluci-dation. The last two are :
  That 	the Association shall 	undertake to represent 	aspirations and 	grievances of 	the people of 	the Jaipur State through 	the proper 	channel as they 	develop from time to time 	under the constitution 	established by His 	Highness the 	Maharaja Saheb Bahadur, and  That 	membership shall 	be restricted 	to persons 	domiciled in 	Jaipur State. 
 Both are vague. Why should the people not be free to advocate reforms in advance of what the State is prepared to grant? But the meaning of the penultimate condition seems to restrict this natural right. And the term ‘domicile’ is a risky legal term of little political use. Why should not the homely word ‘resident’ be used instead?

      MY 	DEAR SATYANANDlibtech_31_footnote,  SEGAON, WARDHA,  June 	8, 1939 
  	Pyarelal has preserved many letters for me to read when I can. I can 	just now find yours of 31st March in this bundle. I have devoured 	its contents with avidity simply because it is your letter.     F. 	Andrews; an American naturalized as a British subject, married an 	Indian Christian and lived in Kotgarh near Simla; a Congress worker; 	was arrested in 1921. 
 I never knew that you had gone to Vienna. What was the opera- tion for? Was it not successful? I have never appreciated the homage paid to the Vienna surgeons. However this is all by the way. I do hope your incapacity is not permanent.
 As to the great question raised by you, my reading of Gita and interpretation of ahimsa is different from yours. I do not believe that killing in war can never be done without anger or zest. As I believe in unadulterated ahimsa I am groping as to India’s duty. I am shirking the national solution. I discuss without coming to a decision. My own indi-vidual conduct is determined. But I quite agree with you that national can be exactly the opposite. My present mood is to ask the Working Committee to decide for itself. It was not without cause that God prom-pted me to cease even to remain a four-anna member of the Congress. Hence there is no moral obligation on me to give an opinion. At the same time if I felt the call, I should not hesitate to announce my opinion. As it is I am praying for light.
 How is Mrs. Stokes? What are the children doing? How long were you away?
 Mahadev was ailing as you might have known. He is fully restored now. He is with me. Pyarelal has stayed in Bombay for his teeth.
 We all go back to Bombay on 21st. Love.

Distribution of a few 	thousand rupees among the people would be a false salve for 	conscience. The work you may provide would be a fraud for they will 	eat only Rangoon rice. The case presented by Hemprabha is one not 	for finding temporary work for a few but it is for an agitation for 	banishing rice mills and Rangoon rice. To this end you should see 	Subhas Babu, Dr. Ray, and the Premier. You will not hesitate to see 	the other Ministers if found necessary. You should put before them a 	faithful picture of the condition of the villagers and trace the 	cause of the misery. You will equally strongly present your remedy. 	You will    
 find perhaps that all the parties will take up the cause and you will have solved a ticklish problem without much difficulty. Should it prove otherwise you will still have done the only possible thing. Your diagnosis must be faultless and your remedy perfect. Could you give the villagers any of the processes in match-making, road-making, tank-digging or any other work of public utility?
 Who are the villagers? If they are Muslims your work will be easier. If my idea does not commend itself to you and you need funds for starting relief, you should go to the Marwari Relief Society and Ghanshyamdasji.
 Tell Hemprabha that I read up the papers she sent me regarding Annada. Annada has a reply for everything she has to say.

30,"June 11, 1939",MEANING OF PROHIBITION,"
         	His Grace the Archbishop of Bombay has been kind enough to send me 	letterlibtech_36_footnotelibtech_37_footnoteand a copy of his address to the Rotary Club against 	prohibition. I have read both with the respect and  attention  their 	author deserves.  	My study of His Grace’s letter and address at once revealed a 	serious flaw for which I must be held primarily responsible. The 	word prohibition is a misnomer for what the Bombay Government and 	the other Provincial Governments where the Congress controls the 	Minis- tries are doing regarding the liquor trade. What the 	Governments are in reality doing is not prohibiting drink but they 	are closing liquor shops which are absolutely under Government 	control. The shop- owners have no statutory protection save what 	they get from year to year. Every owner of a liquor shop knows that 	his licence may not be renewed next year. He may be even outbidden 	if he possesses  a country liquor or toddy licence as these are 	auctioned every year. Therefore the licensees have no vested 	interest  in  their  licences beyond the year for which they are 	held and then too subject to the observance of the stringent 	conditions laid down for them. Therefore I claim that the law for 	the abolition of liquor licences “is an ordi- nance of reason for 	the common good made and promulgated for the community by the 	competent authority.” All that the State is doing is to remove 	from the drinker the temptation or the facility which the State 	considers is harmful to him except for medicinal purposes. The 	Archbishop says: “To win the allegiance of body, of mind    
 and of heart needed by any law . . . that law must be just”, that is to say,“the conscience of millions must say this is just.” I have no difficulty in endorsing the proposition. Viewed in the  manner indicated by me the State does not need to carry with it the conscience of millions. But I hold that India is the one place in the world where the conscience of the millions would justify the law of abolition of the State trade in intoxicating liquors and drugs. There is no need to take any referendum. It consists in the overwhelming number of legislators approving of the law. Let me remind His Grace of the past history of this great reform movement. It began with the grand old man, Dada- bhai Naoroji. In 1920 it became an integral part of the Congress cons- tructive programme. In the absence of political power the Con-gress arranged an elaborate programme of picketing liquor and opium shops. In this programme thousands of men and women took part all over India. All communities including Parsis took part in the picke- ting programme. Attempts were made even in the days of Non-co- operation to induce the authorities to undertake the abolition legis- lation. Without exception they pleaded financial inability, never the impropriety of so-called interference with the right of the people to be supplied with liquor by the State. Indeed one Minister told me that If I would help him to raise the revenue needed to make up for the loss caused by the drop in the drink revenue, he would introduce prohi- bition at once. It is an open secret that the reform has been delayed simply for the sake of the revenue. In other words, the people have been tempted to drink for the sake of raising the revenue. The black history of the opium trade bears out the truth of this statement.
 Those who speak in the name of individual freedom do not know their India. There is as much right of a person to demand drink- ing facilities from the State as there is to demand facilities for the supply of public women for the satisfaction of his animal passion. I hope that those who pride themselves on their moderation in drinking will not feel hurt by the illustration I have taken. In this country we are not used to legislation for the regulation of vice. But in countries like Germany the houses of women who sell their virtue are licensed. I do not know what will be more resented in those countries, the  stopping of the licences for the houses of ill fame or the houses of drink. When woman realizes her dignity she will refuse to sell her virtue and those members of the sex who are jealous of its honour will move heaven and earth to have legalized prostitution abolished. Will it be then contended that such abolition will go hard with the prostitutes
 and their dependants whose only means of livelihood depended upon this calling?
 I plead that social workers cannot work effectively so long as licensed liquor dens continue to lure the drinkers to enter them. It is curious that in all India any opposition to prohibiton comes from the Parsis. They pride themselves on their temperance and resent what they call encroachment upon their personal liberty. They also make it a grievance that the Europeans have been given facilities, thus cons- tituting a bar sinister against Asiatics. I have already pleadedlibtech_38_footnotelibtech_39_footnotewith the Parsis that they should rise superior to their habit and allow the great reform to proceed with their active co-operation. As to the alleged bar sinister let me point out that a bar sinister is imposed from without. In the case in point we the Asiatics voluntarily recognize the limitations of the Euro-peans. But even they have to secure  exemption  and submit to regulations. The proper course for the Parsi friends would be to agitate, if they wish, for the removal of the discrimination, not use it for securing similar exemption for themselves.
 His Grace has further argued that if the price to be paid for removing the temptation of drink from the drunkard “is out of all proportion to the good attempted”, the reform is harmful.The pro- position is well stated, but it is a matter of opinion whether the price to be paid is out of all proportion to the good attempted. I have endea- voured to show that the whole of the excise policy has been not to supply any felt want but to increase the revenue. I would invite the Archbishop to study the history of the excise administrtion. He will find that all the advanced legislators have condemned the policy in unmeasured terms. The price that is being paid for the attempted reform is insignificant if the history is borne in mind. And even the insignificant price will not have to be paid, if the Archbishop and the influential Parsi friends will lead an agitation for the reduction in the wholly indefensible army expenditure and free the money thus saved for the purpose of bringing about all-India abolition of the liquor traffic. It is an overdue reform. They should congratulate the Bombay Ministers on their courage in levying a tax which was the easiest to be borne. But I have no doubt that the Ministry will gladly remit the tax, if they are helped by the Central Government. Only they could not delay the reform whilst they were fighting the Central Government single-handed. Let all the parties recognize the necessity of the reform
 
 and demand justice from the Central Government and the hardship referred to by the Archbishop will be reduced almost to a nullity.
 There is a curious question asked of  Dr.  Gilderlibtech_40_footnote.  To  do  the Archbishop justice I must copy the question in his own words:
 Does he admit that there are several kinds of intoxication which have nothing at all to do with drink? Drunkenness paralyses the reason and wrecks homes. But the intoxication of false ideals is now wrecking whole nations and the world itself. Moreover, does Dr. Gilder admit that such intoxication is highly infectious? He will hardly deny it, knowing as he does the recent history of the nations. Then will he tell us, ‘Is India necessarily immune from the infection of false ideals which intoxicate?’
This suggests that the exercise by the State of the undoubted
 discretion to stop the issue of drink-shop licences is a false ideal which intoxicates and which has infected Dr. Glider. Of course everything is possible in this world. But I venture to suggest that this abolition being a half-century-old national cry is not likely to be a false, intoxicating and infectious ideal. An ideal that is false and intoxicating and highly infectious must in its nature be temporary.
 The last paragraph of the address is a question addressed to me. The half dozen lines are packed with suggestions which hardly answer known facts. Thus His Grace suggests, among other things :
 Prohibition tends to be regarded by its advocates not as one possible course but as the only possible religion.
Nobody has called it a religion. After having stated the pro-
position His Grace ends:
 The author of the creed of truth and non-violence will not resent this last question: ‘Is he still quite certain that all religions are true?’
 In any other mouth I would consider the question to be unpar- donable. But I do not expect a busy administrator like the Archbi- shop of Bombay to study all a man like me may say or to verify his quotations. His question to tally with what I have said should have been: ‘Is he still quite certain that all the known great religions of the earth are equally true?’ My answer to this revised question would be, ‘Emph-atically yes.’ Only the revised question is obviously irrelevant to the Archbishop’s thesis.
 His Grace has propounded a conundrum in his letter which now hardly needs a separate answer. So far as I know the Ministers have no qualms of conscience. They are robbing no one. All trade is pre-
 
 carious. Liquor trade is doubly so everywhere. The Bombay Govern- ment are straining every nerve to see that poor traders do not suffer avoidable hardships.
There is one sentence in the letter which makes me pause:
 The last few-months have convinced me that the cause of charity in Bombay is threatened with a shattering blow.
All the Archbishop’s beliefs have been based, as I think I have
 shown, on unproved assumptions. I should want proof for this un- qualified assertion. If the cause of charity is threatened as stated, I would request him to produce the proof before the Ministers and I doubt not that they will soon set the thing right.
 The Archbishop’s last paragraph in his letter is worthy of his high office. Only his offer appears to be conditional.libtech_41_footnotelibtech_42_footnoteLet him and his assistants and disciples unconditionally become total abstainers and help the noble cause of temperance. They will lighten the task of the law-giver and help to make of the abolition of liquor  traffic  the success that it deserves to be in this land where the public conscience, i.e., the conscience of the dumb millions, is undoubtedly in favour of the abolition.

  June 	13, 1939  	If the proposed reforms are unacceptable as your fear they are 	likely to be, you may take no part in working them. But regarding 	offering any opposition to them you must be the best judges. What I 	have said in my statementlibtech_50_footnoteon Travancore does not apply wholly to any single 	State. You must study the general principles laid down in it and do 	what you think fit. Do not ask me to judge whether Mysore is well 	organized or ill-organized. You are the best judges. Facts them- 	selves are opinions. If you are ready, you are ready, irrespective 	of what I may say.     
 The readiness may be of two kinds. You may be able to em- barrass Government sufficiently by making a big enough demons- tration which invites shooting or compels them to yield. But the demonstration may not be non-violent as I am defining it. Not that my definition has changed. There is only a difference of emphasis. I formerly compromised non-violence in the belief that thereby India would progress further on the path of non-violence, but that belief was not fulfilled. So the non-violence that you display may appear to be effective but it may not be unadulterated non-violence in thought, word and deed. If it is not, I should rule it out. What I would not rule out today I cannot say. I have come up to the point of saying, in the language of  the  Vedic seer,  ‘neti’,  ‘neti’ (‘not this’, ‘not this’), but I have not yet been able to say, ‘it is this’, ‘it is this’. That is because I have not seen the full light yet.libtech_51_footnote
 That school says, ‘We believe both in violence and non-violence, for sometimes non-violence answers, and we resort to non-violence because it appears to be best under the circumstances.’ But for me means and ends are convertible terms, and non-violence and truth are therefore the end, so long as the end conceived has not been attained. But in Rajkot I compromised the means; I was weighed in my own scales and found wanting. But no harm has been done because I retrieved my error immediately I saw it. My surrender was not due to weakness, it was a surrender out of the fullness of strength. It came out of non-violence which for me is the weapon of the bravest and not of the weak. I will not be guilty of encouraging cowards amongst us, or of allowing people to hide their weakness under cover of non- violence.
 You will say that you will not make a declaration about non- violence or satyagraha or civil disobedience. It need not on  that account be the reverse of any of these. But you will say, ‘After having read all that Gandhiji has written, or has been written about in Harijan, we have come to the conclusion that we must not bandy about these technical expressions. Whether you call it violent or non-violent, we offer what resistance we can and what we feel our people are ready to

 offer.’ If you want further guidance, you should approach Vallabh- bhai who has been handling this movement and Pandit Jawaharlal who is the Chairman of the States Committee. I come in as author of satya- graha, but for the moment I am bankrupt. My faith is brighter than ever but I have not seen the full light. I am advising Travancore, Rajkot, and to a certain extent Talcher, as I have been constantly guid- ing them. But even with regard to them I have been tendering my advice which it is for them to accept or reject.
 But I would ask you to see the Sardar who has a marvellous capacity of separating wheat from chaff. He is no visionary like Jawa- harlal and me. For bravery he is not to be surpassed. If he had any sentiment in him, he has suppressed it. Once he makes up  his  mind  he steels it against all argument. He has all the making of a soldier. Even I do not argue with him, but of course he allows me to lay down the law. He will always be the people’s man. He cannot hit it off with the people in power. See him. He has studied the situation, and he may be able to make concrete suggestions. Have the setting from Jawaharlal and the concrete suggestions from the Sardar.
 I love Mysore and Mysoreans. I like spending days together at Belur and Halebidu but I cannot go there for sightseeing. I can go there only if duty calls.libtech_52_footnote

 DEAR PRITHVI SINGH,
 Your letter of 27th May is very good. It shows that you have no difficulty in understanding the working of ahimsa. There are many who swear by ahimsa [but] have not understood my step.
 I have not given up the attempt to secure possession of your book.
 Attempts continue to be made about the release of the political prisoners. There are difficulties [in] the way. But for those who only know the non-violent way, success is contained in the effort itself. And
 
 prisoners who believe in non-violence regard prison-life and the out- side with indifference. They serve whether in prison or outside.
 I hope to go to the Frontier Province early July when both Mahadev and Pyarelal will be with me. One of them will surely see you.

  	It is a pity that Shri Sarat Chandra Bose and Lalit Chandra Das had 	to resign from the Prisoners’ Release Advisory Committeelibtech_54_footnotewhen they found that they could not make further 	headway and that their views differed from those of their colleagues 	and of the Government.      1938. 
 They had no option. I had hoped, when the Committee was formed, that they would evolve a joint scheme whereby the question of poli- tical prisoners would be solved on an all-India basis and on non-party lines. Provincial autonomy should have meant at least the release of all political prisoners throughout India especially when they declared their faith in non-violence as the vast majority, if not all, have done. The releases already effected have shown that there is no dan-ger of revival of terrorism such as the country has known. Therefore I would suggest that Shri Sarat Chandra Bose and Lalit Chandra Das be reinvited to serve on the Committee and a formula be found so as to satisfy their viewpoint. It would be unfortunate if a hurricane agitation were to be restarted on an issue which does not warrant any such agitation and which is capable of being decided by mutual accommo- dation. I hope that my appeallibtech_55_footnotelibtech_56_footnoteto the Government of Bengal not to abandon the policy of conciliation they had adopted on this very important question of the release of political prisoners will not go in vain. It ought to be enough for them that the prisoners have declared their faith in non-violence. I hope that the prisoners will not be restless but will allow friendly effort to take its course without the interruption of a hunger-strike or the like. I would ask them to continue the dignified restraint they have so wisely observed.

55,"June 19, 1939",HOW FAR ?,"
  From 	the manuscript of Mahadev Desai’s Diary. Courtesy: Narayan Desai           	With reference to my advicelibtech_77_footnoteto the States people to lower their demands if 	necessary, a correspondent asks :  How 	far are the people to 	go and what 	reduction if 	any is 	suggested or 	contemplated, for instance, in the Jaipur demand which has been practically     published 	from Ahmedabad   
 framed by you?
 This question would never have arisen if my language had been properly attended to. In the first place, I have added the proviso ‘if necessary’. This must be clearly proved and each committee should judge the necessity and the extent of the reduction. In the second, there can be no question of reduction where the people are ready for the sacrifice involved in the development and the consolidation of the strength to enforce the demand. Take the case of Rajkot itself. Award or no award, if the people in general had the capacity for the required measure of sacrifice and if they had been ready for swaraj, nothing would have kept them from their prize.
 It would be wrong to say or believe that but for my mistake the people of Rajkot would have got what they wanted. My mistake has been admitted. But it must not be held responsible for the failure of the famous Notification. The talk of demoralization resulting from my ‘bad handling’ of the situation is nonsensical. In satyagraha there is no such thing as demoralization. Those who are truthful, non-vio- lent and brave do not cease to be so because of the stupidity of their leader. Of course there would be demoralization or rather ex-posure, if the three virtues were put on for the occasion and were to fail on the real test being applied. People who are strong by nature displace weak leaders and go about their business as if they never needed a leader. If they needed one, they would soon elect a better one. Workers in the States should try to understand the Rajkot case, if they will profit by it. If it is too compli-cated for them, they should leave it alone and go forward as if it had not happened. Nothing will be more misleading than to think that before my so-called mishandling of the Rajkot case the Princes were so trembling in their shoes that they were about to abdicate their powers in favour of their people. What they were doing before I even went to Rajkot was to confer among themselves as to the ways and means of meeting the menace, as they thought it to be, to their very existence. We know what Limbdi did.libtech_78_footnotelibtech_79_footnoteThe  talk  of  com- bining with the Muslims, the Garasias and even the Depressed Classes against the Congress workers was in the air. My action has resulted in the discovery of the unholy combination. A true diagnosis is three- fourths the remedy. The workers are today in a position to devise remedies to combat the combination. It simply resolves itself into the
 
 necessity of Congressmen or satyagrahis gaining control over  the forces arrayed against them. They are as much out to gain liberty for the Muslims, Garasias, Depressed Classes and even the Princes as for themselves. The satyagrahis have to show by cold reasoning and their conduct that the Princes cannot remain autocrats for all times, and that it is to their interest to become trustees of their people instead of remaining their masters. In other words, what I have done by correcting myself in Rajkot is to show the true way to the satyagrahis. In following it, they may find it necessary to lower their immediate demands but only so as to really hasten their progress to their goal. Therefore there can be no lowering out of weakness. Every lowering must be out of due appreciation of the local situation and the capacity of the workers to cope with it. Here there is no room for demoralization and rout. In cases like Jaipur of course there can [be] no question of lowering. The demand itself is in the lowest pitch. There is no room in it for lowering anything. In essence it is one for civil liberty. Civil liberty consistent with the observance of non- violence is the first step towards swaraj. It is the breath of political and social life. It is the foundation of freedom. There is no room there for dilution or compromise. It is the water of life. I have never heard of water being diluted.
Another question has been raised by another correspondent. He
 says 	:    You 	expect us to work by negotiation. But if there is no wish on the 	other side and the only wish is to humiliate the party of freedom, 	what is to be done? Of 	course nothing is to be done except waiting and preparing 
  	for suffering and promotion of constructive work. Absence of wish 	for negotiation by authority may mean despise or distrust of the 	party of freedom. In either case silent work is the remedy. 	Negotiation has been mentioned as a substitute for the ignoring of, 	i.e. the despise of, the  	constituted authority whether it is the Dewan or any other. And what 	 I have pleaded for is desire and readiness for negotiation. It is 	not inconceivable that the stage of negotiation may never be 	reached. If it is not, it must not be for the fault of the 	satyagrahis.  SEGAON, 	June 19, 1939  Harijan, 	24-6-1939 "
56,"June 19, 1939",WILL KHADI KILL KHADI ?,"
    
 When the increase in the spinners’ wages was decided upon by the A. I. S. A., the Maharashtra Branch was the foremost in giving enthusiastic support to the proposal. It has the direct guidance of Shri Vinoba. It has worked out the increase programme with a precision not approached by the other provinces. The result is that the other provinces not having increased the wages to the same extent as the Maharashtra Branch are able to undersell the latter’s khadi and do not hesitate to send their stock to the areas covered by the Maharashtra Branch. Unscrupulous merchants are not slow to take advantage of the situation. Thus uncertified stores have sprung up in Nagpur, Wardha and elsewhere. The unwary public, not knowing the new arrangements and eager to buy cheap khadi, prefer to patronize uncertified stores, thus doing great damage to the Maharashtra Branch stores. The result is that the Maharashtra Branch has either to reduce wages or to close down its business. This would amount to khadi killing khadi. Khadi- lovers should know that the economics of khadi are different from and often contrary to the ordinary economics of the  competitive system which is not governed by the principle of the greatest good of all, i. e., of the least among the downtrodden. Thus I have endea- voured to show in these columns that if khadi is to fulfil its mission,
  There 	must be progressive 	increase in the 	rise of 	the wages 	of the spinners till the minimum of one anna per hour is reached.  The 	ideal is 	that each village 	should produce and use 	its own khadi. 	From this it is clear 	that the least 	that should be done 	at present 	is that 	each province should 	produce enough and no 	more for its own 	requirements, permission 	being given for the sale 	outside its 	limits of 	such khadi 	as can 	only be produced 	by that 	province. For 	instance, Andhra 	can export, 	say, 80 	counts khadi outside its 	limits but 	not coarse 	khadi no matter 	how cheap 	it is.  No 	profits can 	be made 	for the sake 	of profits. 	The wage- 	earners are 	the shareholders and 	the proprietors in 	this the 	greatest co- 	operative organization 	in the 	world. If, 	therefore, there 	happen to be 	profits made 	in any 	single year, the 	proper use 	to make 	of them 	is to 	devote them to 	increase the 	number of 	spinners so 	long as 	there are 	any to 	be provided for, 	otherwise to increase 	the wages 	of the 	existing spinners.  Any 	province that 	makes an 	attempt to 	increase the 	wages of 	spinners to 	the desired level 	should be 	encouraged by 	the other 	branches and khadi-lovers.  The 	general public should 	restrict their use of 	khadi to 	the khadi 	produced in their 	own provinces 	although it 	is dearer than 	in the 	other provinces. 	They must trust the 	A. I. S.

 The immediate thing to be wished for is that all uncertified stores should be closed. Congressmen and others should warn the public against buying from such stores, and provincial branches  should resolutely refuse to sell their stock outside except at the ins- tance of the provincial agencies concerned of the A.

  	I have read the titbits in your letter to Mahadev Desai. What is to 	be done with the Princes? Gods confound those whom they want to 	destroy. It may be that their days are numbered. Only as believers 	in ahimsa we have to so act that we do not become directly or 	indirectly instruments of their destruction.  	You have asked me to pray for you not in the letter before me but in 	the previous ones. I am doing it daily. I do not want to find fault 	with your logic or, which is the same thing, your reason. But we 	shall talk to our hearts’ content when we meet, not even fearing 	explo- sions and storms. They clear the air. You must therefore 	reserve all your tears. Do not spend up all behind closed doors. I 	smiled to myself to read your reference to Hansa. You successfully 	hid your grief even from her as from everybody else.

 Now that I write to you quite regularly, you can’t complain. What was all the fight there about? Who were the persons involved? I suppose you have written and given me this information. You would certainly get help from here if the [Indian] community there had strength of its own.
 My health is good. Ba’s indifferent. We are leaving for Bombay tomorrow. From there we shall perhaps go to the Frontier Province. Ba may go to Sabarmati and stay there during that period.

59,"June 20, 1939",ITS IMPLICATIONS,"
    
 I am sorry that my recent statements about States have per- plexed even those who have hitherto had no difficulty in under-stan- ding my writings or my actions. But the Rajkot statements, my actions in Rajkot, and the statement on Travancore have made ‘con-fusion worse con-founded’. Pyarelal and latterly Mahadev have been man- fully trying to interpret for the readers of Harijan, both my writings and doings. I know that they have somewhat helped to clear misun- derstandings. But I observe that something is required from me directly. I must therefore try to give the implications as I understand them of my recent writings and actions.
 I had better first say what they do not imply. Thus my ideas on civil disobedience—individual, group or mass—have not changed, nor have my views about the relations between the Congress and  the Princes and the people changed. Nor has my view undergone any change that it is essential for the Paramount Power to do its duty towards the people of the States—a duty which it has woefully neglected all these years. My recantation had reference only to my distrust in God, in whose name the fast was undertaken, and  my seeking to supplement His work by Viceregal intervention. For me to rely upon the Viceroy, instead of God or in addition to God, to act upon the Thakore Saheb, was an act of pure violence which the fast was never conceived to imply or use in the remotest degree.
 The positive implication of the Rajkot chapter in my life is the discovery that the non-violence claimed for the movement since 1920, marvellous though it was, was not unadulterated. The results though brilliant would have been far richer if our non-violence had been complete. A non-violent action accompanied by non-violence in thought and word should never produce enduring violent reaction upon the opponent. But I have observed that the movement in the States has produced violent reaction on the Princes and their advisers. They are filled with distrust of the Congress. They do not want what they call interference from it. In some cases the very name ‘Congress’ is anathema. This should not have been the case.
 The value of the discovery lies in its reaction upon me. I have definitely stiffened in my demands upon would-be satyagrahis. If my stiffness reduces the number to an insignificant figure, I should not mind. If satyagraha is a universal principle of universal application, I must find an effective method of action even through a handful. And when I say I see the new light only dimly, I mean that I have not yet found with certainty how a handful can act effectively. It may be, as has happened throughout my life, that I shall know the next step only after the first has been taken. I have faith that when the time for action has arrived, the plan will be found ready.
 But the impatient critic will say, ‘The time has always been there for action; only you have been found unready!’ I cannot plead guilty.  I know to the contrary. I have been for some years saying that there is no warrant for resumption of satyagraha.
The reasons are plain.
 The Congress has ceased to be an effective vehicle for launching nation-wide satyagraha. It has become unwieldy, it has corruption in it, there is indiscipline among Congressmen, and rival groups have come into being which would radically change the Congress pro- gramme if they could secure a majority. That they have failed hitherto to secure it is no comfort to me. The majority has no living faith in its own programme. In any case satyagraha through a majority is not a feasible proposition. The whole weight of the Congress should be behind any nation-wide satyagraha.
 Then there is the ever-growing communal tension. Final satya- graha is inconceivable without an honourable peace between the seve- ral communities composing the Indian nation.
Lastly, there is the provincial autonomy. I adhere to my belief
 that we have not done anything like justice to the task undertaken by the Congress in connection with it. It must be confessed that the Governors have on the whole played the game. There has been very little interference on their part with the ministerial actions. But the interference, sometimes irritating, has come from Congressmen and Congress organizations. Popular violence there should not have been whilst the Congressmen were in office. Much of the ministerial energy has been devoted to dealing with the demands and opposition of Con- gressmen. If the Ministers are unpopular, they can and should be dis- missed. Instead they have been allowed to function without the active co-operation of many Congressmen.
It will be contrary to every canon of satyagraha to launch upon
 the extreme step till every other is exhausted. Such haste will itself constitute violence.
 It may be said in reply with some justification that if all the conditions I have mentioned are insisted upon, civil disobedience may be well-nigh impossible. Is that a valid objection? Every measure carries with it conditions for its adoption. Satyagraha is no exception. But I feel within me that some active form of satyagraha, not nece- ssarily civil disobedience, must be available in order to end an im- possible situation. There must be either effective non-violent action or violence and anarchy within a measurable distance of time. I must examine this position on a future occasion.libtech_81_footnote

 BIRLA HOUSE,  MALABAR HILL,
 BOMBAY,
 June 22, 1939
 DEAR LORD LINLITHGOW,
I thank you for your letter of 16th instant.
 Though it is a pity that prisoner Prithvi Singh cannot be dis- charged, I have no difficulty in understanding your decision. I must await another opportunity.
 The case of Jaipur is hanging fire. I wonder if a solution may be expected. As far as I know the Maharaja himself was quite willing to set free Sheth Jamnalalji and the other prisoners, to recognize the People’s Association and to respect full civil liberty so long as it did not cross the bounds of non-violence.
 There is one other matter which I had better mention in this letter. I understand there are Princes who are desirous of seeing me but they have hesitation in doing so for fear of the disapproval of the Political Department. As I had said during our talkslibtech_82_footnotelibtech_83_footnotein New Delhi, I am of opinion that they should be free to meet any person so long as they do so openly. It would be a good thing if a declaration of your policy on this subject were made either openly or privately as may be thought advisable. I feel that it would not be enough if the permission is given in individual cases like mine. Seeing that the people of the States have intimate connection—political and social—with Congress- men and others all over India, is it not wise and proper to encourage the practice of Princes establishing friendly relation with those who have influence over their people? To treat Congressmen and others as outsiders seems to be so unnatural that the barrier cannot last long. It would be a pity if it is broken after a clash and creation of bad blood.
 
 I wonder if you have noticed that some States have invited or wel- comed visits of anti-Congress personalities. I do not complain of this but it is in striking contrast to the opposition fostered often by the Political Department to the visits of Congressmen.libtech_84_footnote

 It is understood that Gandhiji suggested that any amendment to the Cons- titution which was being given effect to should find favour with the general body of Congressmen in the country.

  The 	All-India Congress 	Committee views with grave concern 	the measures 	proposed by the 	Ceylon Government 	with reference 	to their 	Indian employees and 	hopes that 	it may 	be possible 	to find 	a way 	to avoid 	the most undesirable and 	grave conflict that, 	as a 	result of these 	measures, is threatened 	between such near and 	ancient neigh- 	bours as 	India and Ceylon. 
 
 made by the Constitution Sub-committee was the addition of some words to Article V(c) of the Constitution so that the rule applying to communal organization might also be applied to other anti-national organizations. The Working Committee agreed with this recommendation.        It appeared to the Working Committee that there was a
 fear in the minds of some Congressmen that the proposed change in Article V(c) was intended to be used to penalize opinion or to suppress organizations. This fear was entirely unjustified. . . . When, however, any organization is continually being attacked and run down by another organization, it is improper for the same person to be a member of the executives of both organizations. This produces not only conflict between the organizations but continuous internal conflict within them. It was with a view to avoid this and thus to have greater harmony even between the organizations that the amendment to Article V(c) was suggested. But in view of the suspicions some members have, the Working Committee have decided not to press for the change      ”
 (The Indian Annual Register, 1939, Vol. I, pp. 355-6).
 The Committee cannot contemplate without much concern a quarrel between the two countries which are separated only by a strip of water but which have a common culture and which have been inti- mately connected from times immemorial. The Committee desires to explore every means of avoiding conflict and, therefore, appoints Pan- dit Jawaharlal Nehru to go to Ceylon and confer with the autho-rities and representative associations and individuals on behalf of the Working Committee and do all that may be possible to effect a just and honourable settlement.
  The 	A. I. C. C. regrets 	the attitude 	of the 	Union Government 	towards Indian settlers. 	It betrays 	utter disregard of 	the obligations 	undertaken by 	the predecessors 	of the 	present Government. 	The policylibtech_88_footnotelibtech_89_footnotejust initiated by them is in direct breach of the Smuts-Gandhi Agreement  of 	  1914,libtech_90_footnotethe  Cape  Town 	  Agreement  of 	  1927,libtech_91_footnotelibtech_92_footnotethe 	Feetham Commission of 1932libtech_93_footnoteand the subsequent undertakings on behalf 	of the 	Union Government. The 	A. I. C. C. notes 	with pride 	and satisfaction 	the firm stand 	taken up by the 	Indians of 	South Africa. They 	will have the sympathy 	of the 	whole Indian nation 	behind them in their fight for self-respect and honourable existence. The A. I. C. 
 C. trusts that there will be no dissensions among them and that they will present a united front. The A. I. C. C. appeals to the Union Government to retrace their steps and carry out the promises of their predecessors to adopt a policy of progressive amelioration  in  the status of the Indian nationals in South Africa, 80 percent of whom are born and bred in that sub-continent and to whom South Africa is their only home.
 This 	meeting of the 	A. I. C. C. resolves 	that no Congressman 	may offer or organize any form of satyagraha in the Administrative 
 
 Chairmanship of justice Feetham, appointed by the Union Government of South Africa, “to enquire into the occupation by Coloured persons of proclaimed land in the Transvaal.” As the Commission “was unable to finish its work before April 30, 1935, as had been hoped, the Union Government of South Africa took steps early in the year to amend the Transvaal Asiatic Land Tenure Act of 1932, so as to extend the protection provided by it to April 30, 1937” (India in 1931-32, p. 85 and India in 1934-35, pp. 92-3).
 Provinces of India without the previous sanction of the Provincial Congress Committee concerned.
  The 	Working Committee has 	repeatedly laid 	stress on 	the desirability 	of co-operation 	between the Congress 	Ministry, the Con- 	gress party and the 	Provincial Congress 	Committee. Without such co- 	operation 	misunderstandings are 	likely to 	arise with the 	result that the 	influence of 	the Congress 	will suffer. 	In administrative 	matters the Provincial Congress Committee should 	not interfere with 	the dis- cretion of 	the Congress Ministry, 	but it is always 	open to the executive 	of the 	Provincial Congress 	Committee to draw 	the attention 	of the 	Government privately to 	any particular 	abuse or difficulty. 	In matters 	of policy 	if there 	is a 	difference between 	the Ministry 	and the pro- 	vincial Congress 	Committee, reference should be 	made to 	the Parlia- 	mentary Sub-committee. 	Public discussion in 	such matters 	should be avoided.  This 	Committee views 	with grave concern 	the prolonged 	strike at 	Digboi and 	expresses its 	sympathy with 	the strikers 	in their 	distress.libtech_94_footnotelibtech_95_footnoteThe Committee regrets that the Assam Oil Company has not seen 	its way to 	accept the 	modest suggestion of 	referring the 	question of 	the method 	and time 	of re-employment 	of the 	strikers to 	a Con- 	ciliation Board to 	be appointed by 	the Government 	of Assam. 
 In the opinion of this Committee no Corporation, however big and influential it may be, can be above public criticism or Govern- ment supervision and legitimate control. Moreover as was declared at the Karachi session the Congress policy is that there should be State ownership or control of key industries. The oil industry is undou- btedly a vital key industry. This Committee therefore hopes that better counsels will prevail with the Company and that its directors will  accept the modest suggestion made on behalf of the Committee by the President of the Congress. If, however, the directors do not see their way to do so, the Committee advises the Assam Government forthwith to undertake legislation for making the acceptance of the decisions of Conciliation Boards obligatory and further give notice  to  the Company that the Committee may reluctantly be obliged to take such steps as may be necessary to stop renewal of the lease to the Company on its termination. At the same time that this Committee urges the Company to fall in with the just suggestion made by the Committee, it
 
 hopes that the Labour Union will be ready to listen  to  the Committee’s advice and if they were to retain Congress and public sympathy they will be ready and willing to abide by the advice that may be tendered to them by the Committee.
  The 	All-India Congress 	Committee is strongly 	of opinion 	that immediate 	steps should be 	taken for 	the formation of 	a separate 	Andhra Province.

 INDIA’S  AMBASSADOR OF PEACE TO CEYLON
 The A. I. C. C. has done well in choosing its best manlibtech_102_footnotelibtech_103_footnoteto pro- ceed to Ceylon as the nation’s Ambassador of peace. It is, at least it should be, impossible for India and Ceylon to quarrel. We are the nearest neighbours. We are inheritors of a common culture. There is daily contact between the two countries. From Rameshwar one almost steps on to Ceylon and finds that one is on no foreign land. But even as blood brothers sometimes differ, so do next-door neighbours. And like brothers, they usually adjust their differences and are often more closely knit together after the clearance. So may it be between Ceylon and India through the efforts of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru.
 No better man could have been chosen for the task. The Indian side is clear. Several thousand men who have been in Government service for years, whether as day workers or other it does not matter, are being dismissed for no fault save that they are Indians. Private firms have been, it is said, told to copy the Government. Now this pro- cedure seems to be extraordinary, arbitrary and unjust. But we do not clearly know the other side. It will be for the Pandit to study the Ceylon Government case and make due allowance for everything that might be justly pleaded on their behalf. Let us hope that both the Ceylon Government and the Indians in Ceylon will make the way smooth for an honourable settlement.
 
 I must confess that these acute differences come upon me as a revelation. I have a vivid recollection of my visitlibtech_104_footnoteto Ceylon. There seemed to be most cordial relations between the Indians and the Cey- lonese. The monks and the laymen of Ceylon vied with the Indians in lavishing their affection on me. I do not remember anybody having complained to me about acute differences between the two. Why has the partial responsible government that Ceylon enjoys made all the difference that we witness today? It will be for the Pandit to unravel the mystery.
 RAJKOT—WAS IT A BETRAYAL?
 I have always felt that whatever Gandhiji done at any time from his spiritual standpoint, has been proved to be correct from the practical point. He is not great for his enunciation of spiritual theories which are to be found in the scriptures of all countries. His contribution to the world is his showing the way to put into practice, in the ordinary day-to-day life, those great spiritual theories. For me, if any of Gandhiji’s actions done from a spiritual point of view failed to prove that it was the correct thing to be done from a practical standpoint, then he would be considered to have failed to that extent. Let me apply that test to what he did in Rajkot.
 When he discovered that his fast became vitiated by his having requested H. E. the Viceroy to intervene, he renounced the Gwyer Award. The practical effect was to free him from Rajkot. But did his renunciation free the Viceroy from the obligation of seeing that the Rajkot Notification was acted upon according to the Chief Justice’s interpretation? In  my  opinion  Gandhiji’s renunciation casts a double duty on the Viceroy. And if the Viceroy does not perform his duty, the people of Rajkot are free to act as they choose, and the Congress will have a powerful case against the Viceroy if the Notification proved abortive.
This   is  an   abridgement  of  an   article   sent  by  a   noted Con-
 gressman for publication in Harijan. He has built up an elaborate case in defence of my action regarding Rajkot, in reply to the criticism that  I had betrayed the cause of the Rajkot people. The heading of this note is the correspondent’s. I need not weary the reader with the whole of his argument. After all, time alone is the true test. It will finally show whether my action was right or wrong. But the abridge- ment is given for the novelty of the thought about the Viceroy’s duty. I had no thought of the consequence of the renunciation. As soon as I
 
 
 saw that my  fast had become tainted for my seeking Viceregal intervention, I renounced the Award. But now that my correspondent mentions it, I must admit the force of his reasoning. My renunciation should act as a double spur to the Viceregal duty of seeing that the Rajkot Notification No. 50 is carried out according to the inter- pretation put upon it by the Chief Justice. So far as I am concerned my renunciation debars me, in this instance, from invoking Viceregal intervention. I also endorse the correspondent’s statement that if any action of mine claimed to be spiritual is proved to be unpractical it must be pronounced to be a failure. I do believe the most spiritual act is the most practical in the true sense of the term.

 "
81,"June 26, 1939",SOUTH AFRICA RESOLUTION,"
    
 It is a matter of congratulation that the South Africa Resolutionlibtech_105_footnoteof the A. I. C. C. escaped complete disfigurement which the learned Dr. Lohia’s amendment would have caused. I tender him my thanks for having listened to Pandit Jawaharlal’s advice to respect the opinion of an expert like me who had passed the best part of his life in South Africa and who had not lost touch with that great country  after retiring from it. This incident is an illustration showing that mere learning, mere humanitarianism divorced from actual experience may spell disaster to the cause sought to be espoused. Dr. Lohia’s amend- ment had as much place in the resolution as mine would have in a resolution framed by him as an authority on socialism to meet a socialist difficulty. If I made any such attempt, he would very pro- perly say, ‘Don’t pass the resolution if you don’t like it, but don’t disfigure it. It would defeat the purpose for which it is framed.’ What I have said about the South Africa resolution applies more or less to the Working Committee’s resolutions. That Committee is the expert body on matters relating to the Congress. It is dangerous to tamper with its resolutions unless reason convinces the Cabinet of the sound- ness of alterations suggested by members of the A. I. C. C. Accep- tance of this practical advice, which I tendered more than once when I was a member of the Working Committee, would facilitate the despatch of national business.
 
 
 Having said this let me say for the information of Dr. Lohia and his fellow humanitarians that I yield to no one in my regard for the Zulus, the Bantus and the other races of South Africa. I used to enjoy intimate relations with many of them. I had the privilege of often advising them. It used to be my constant advice to our countrymen in South Africa, never to exploit or deceive these simple folk. But it was not possible to amalgamate the two causes. The rights and privileges (if any could be so called) of the indigenous inhabitants are different from those of the Indians. So are their disabilities and their causes. But if I discovered that our rights conflicted with their vital interests, I would advise the forgoing of those rights. They are the inhabitants of South Africa as we are of India. The Europeans are undoubtedly usurpers, exploiters or conquerors or all these rolled into one. And so the Africans have a whole code of laws specially governing them. The Indian segregation policy of the Union Government has nothing in common with the policy governing the African races.  It  is unnecessary for me to go into details. Suffice it to say that ours is a tiny problem compared to the vast problem that faces the African races and that affects their progress. Hence it is not possible to speak of the two in the same breath. The A. I. C. C. resolution concerns itself with the civil resistance struggle of our countrymen on a specific issue applicable solely to them. It is now easy to see that Dr. Lohia’s amendment, if it had remained, would have been fatal to the resolution which would have become perfectly meaningless. The appeal to the Union Government would have lost all its point.
But good often comes out of evil. The amendment, wisely
 withdrawn, shows to the Africans and to the world in general that India has great regard and sympathy for all the exploited races of the earth and that she would not have a single benefit at the expense of the vital interest of any of them. Indeed the war against imperialism cannot wholly succeed unless all exploitation ceases. The only way it can cease is for every exploited race or nation to secure freedom without injuring any other.
 My examination of the South Africa resolution would be incomplete if I did not warn the Indians in South Africa against build- ing much on the resolution itself. It is a potent resolution only if the Indians take the contemplated action. The motherland will not be able to protect their self-respect, if they are not prepared to protect it them- selves. They must therefore be ready to suffer for it. The struggle may be prolonged, suffering great. But they will have the moral backing of
 the whole nation. In this Hindus, Muslims, and all political parties including Europeans are united. The Government of India may feel powerless. I fancy they are not so powerless as they imagine. I am reminded of the ‘Thought for the Day’ in The Times of India of the 24th instant. It begins, ‘We have more power than will.’ I know their sympathy is with the Indians. If they have the strength of will, they have the power. Our countrymen in South Africa know the conditions of satyagraha. The foremost condition is unity among themselves.
 To the Union Government I would say, “You have never proved your case. Your best men have admitted that there is no difficulty in your absorbing the two hundred thousand Indians in your continent. They are but a drop in the ocean. Remember that 80 percent of them are born in South Africa. They have adopted your manners, customs and costume. They are intelligent. They have the same feelings and emotions that you have. They deserve better treatment than to be regarded untouchables fit only to be relegated to ghettos. This is not playing the game. And you should not wonder if, at last, Indians say, ‘We shall rather die in your jails than live in your segregation camps.’ I am sure you do not want to go to all that length. Let it not be said of you that you had no respect for your promises.”

 "
84,"June 27, 1939",THE NATIONAL FLAG,"
    
 The question of the use of the national flag still continues to agitate the public mind. It was designed when non-co-operation was at its height.libtech_106_footnotelibtech_107_footnoteIt was accepted without reserve, without opposition, by all communities. The Muslims and others vied with the Hindus in hoist- ing, carrying and honouring it. I recall having listened to the Ali Brothers enthusing over its praises from many a platform. It was conceived as a symbol of the peaceful revolt against imperialistic exploitation of a nation pledged to non-violence through a mighty, constructive and united effort through the spinning-wheel and khadi signifying out-and-out swadeshi and identity with the poorest in the land. It also symbolized unbreakable communal unity, the colours being specially and deliberately designed and chosen. That flag can admit of no competition as national flag. At national gatherings it should command unquestioned and universal respect. But it has to be admitted that it does not command that respect today. Instead of being a symbol of simplicity, purity, unity, and through these a determined revolt against exploitation, moral, material and political, it nowadays often becomes a signal for communal  quarrels.  Even among Congressmen attempt is sometimes made to prefer the red flag
 
 to the tricolour. Some Congressmen do not even hesitate to run it down.
 In these circumstances I personally would like to remove it from public gatherings and not unfurl it till the public feel the want and impatiently demand to see it restored to its original and unique place. But the vast majority of Congressmen who have suffered under this well-tried banner and drawn inspiration and strength from it will not go the length I would like them to. I therefore suggest that where there is any opposition in a mixed gathering, the flag should not be hoisted. This can happen in schools, colleges, local boards, municipal councils and the like. The flag should not be insisted on when there is opposition even from one member. Let it not be called the tyranny of one person. When one person among many offers opposition and if he is allowed to have his way, it is proof of magnanimity or farsightedness on the part of the overwhelming majority. I have no doubt that this is the most effective non-violent way of dealing with the question. My advice applies even to those places where the flag is already flying. It was triumphantly flown in many places when the nation was offering non-co-operation on a scale perhaps hitherto un- known in history. Times are changed. Opposition wherever it  is offered is fomenting communal dissensions. Surely it is wisdom on the part of those who treasure the flag and unity to submit to the opposition of a minority be it ever so small.
 What I have said about the flag applies mutatis mutandis to the singing of the Vandemataramlibtech_108_footnotelibtech_109_footnote. No matter what its source was and how and when it was composed, it had become a most powerful battle-cry among Hindus and Mussalmans of Bengal during the partition days. it was an anti-imperialist cry. As a lad, when I knew nothing of Anand- math or even Bankim, its immortal author, Vandemataram  had gripped me, and when I first heard it sung, it had enthralled me. I associated the purest national spirit with it. It never occurred to me that it was a Hindu song or meant only for Hindus. Unfortunately now we have fallen on evil days. All that was pure gold before has become base metal today. In such times it is wisdom not to market pure gold
 
 and let it be sold as base metal. I would not risk a single quarrel over singing Vandemataram at a mixed gathering. It will never suffer from disuse. It is enthroned in the hearts of millions. It stirs to its depth the patriotism of millions in and outside Bengal. Its chosen stanzas are Bengal’s gift among many others to the whole nation. The flag and the song will live as long as the nation lives.

From 	a copy: Pyarelal Papers. Courtesy: Pyarelal         	The case of our countrymen in Belgian Congo does not admit of easy 	treatment. It consists in the prosecution, alleged to be political, 	though technically under the Gold Law of Belgian Congo, of certain 	Indian settlers for being in possession of illicit gold. In the case 	as stated in the circulated pamphlet it is suggested that the 	accused were arrested without just cause. Witnesses for the Crown 	are said to have been perjured. Every obstacle is being placed in 	the way of the accused being properly defended. The expectation of 	our country-     
 men in Congo is that we should send eminent counsel from here to defend them. Representations have been made to the Government of India on their behalf. This is essentially a case, however hard in itself, in which effective public action is hardly possible. But it is undoub- tedly a case in which the Government of India can do much. It can through the Foreign Office in England ascertain the exact position. The British Consul can be instructed to watch the case and see that the accused get a fair trial. Indeed British Consuls have been known to have been instructed to engage counsel to watch cases on behalf of their proteges. I hope that the Government of India are giving atten- tion to this hard case of the Indians of Belgian Congo.

It is the 	assertion of a principle against principle. But I hope they have 	taken up no such uncompromising     
 attitude. The deputation of licensees and tappers took up no such attitude.
 But apart from the question of principle there are objections raised against the working out of the policy. They are chiefly about :
 the 	right to 	use wines for 	religious purposes. the right to have liquor on medical, i. e., health grounds, racial discrimination,  compensation 	to those 	who will 	be thrown 	out of 	employ- ment, 	i. e., tappers, contractors and liquor-dealers, etc., the 	effect of 	the property 	tax on charities. 
 All these are pertinent questions demanding clear answers. Ministers are bound to remove every valid objection that can be advanced against the working out of the policy.
 The right to use wines on religious or health grounds has always been recognized by Dr. Gilder.
 I understand that in law there will be no racial discrimination. It may appear to be in the administration of the law. No one will be entitled to have the permit for the asking, not even the Europeans, if only so that the law might not be evaded. Every case will be examined on merits. Even Europeans will be expected to respect the liquor policy of the
 country and, wherever they can, to refrain from asking for permits. The Archbishop of Bombay, in spite of his unconvincing oppositionlibtech_124_footnoteto the closing of liquor shops, has gracefully announced that he and many under him are not going to ask for permits for their personal use. Many Protestant divines, I understand, have already announced similar self-denial. I should not be surprised if many  European  laymen copy the estimable example of the European divines. Never- theless there is no doubt that in the administration of the law there will be more indulgence to Europeans than to those like Parsis for whom India has been their home for centuries. But I have not the shadow of  a doubt that every genuine case will be considered with sympathy. May not the Parsis be expected to fall in with the general sentiment, especially when it conduces to the conservation of the social and economic welfare of the labouring classes? Enlightened Parsis must surely recognize the necessity of checking the drink evil while there is still time.
 
 The points (d) and (e) cannot be dealt with at all satisfactorily without the hearty co-operation of the parties concerned. Thus, so far as the charities are concerned, it is surely up to the trustees of these charities to support their case with facts and figures. Some hardship no doubt there will be. Every tax is a hardship. But I should be surprised if any single charity is seriously affected. After all, the tax calculated to bring in from the city of Bombay about Rs. one crore is so widely distributed that no individual or corporation will be hit beyond endurance. But it is for those who contend otherwise to prove their case.
 Liquor-dealers have to present their case with full detail so as to enable the Government to deal with it. I understand that most owners of stocks of wine have not even furnished the information asked for by the Government. How is the Government to deal with them, if they will sullenly refuse to help the Government to help them? I know that the Government are taxing themselves to meet every case of proved and avoidable hardship. I use the word ‘avoidable’ purposely. The ‘Taj’ will certainly be affected, but that is as much as saying that the liquor shopkeepers will be affected. The ‘Taj’ is a mighty liquor- dealer. The house of Tata is resourceful enough to devise other and better ways of supporting the many charities for which it is so justly famed. I dare say that the charities themselves will bear richer fruit for their being purged of the questionable income from the drink traffic. Let it not be said of the Parsis, known the world over as the greatest philanthropists as a class, that they lagged behind, nay actually obstru- cted a reform which was urgently needed for the sake of saving the helpless labouring population from social and economic ruin.

97,"July 4, 1939","NON-VIOLENCE v.
VIOLENCE","
    
 I must resume the argument about the implications of the Rajkot step, where I left it the week before.libtech_125_footnote
 In theory, if there is sufficient non-violence developed in any single person, he should be able to discover the means of combating violence, no matter how widespread or severe, within his jurisdiction. I have repeatedly admitted my imperfections. I am no example of per-
 
 fect ahimsa. I am evolving. Such ahimsa as has been developed in me has been found enough to cope with situations that have hitherto arisen. But today I feel helpless in the face of the surrounding vio- lence. There was a penetrating article in The statesman on my Rajkot statement. The editor had therein contended that the English  had never taken our movement to be true satyagraha, but being practical people they had allowed the myth to continue though they had known it to be a violent revolt. It was none the less so because the rebels had no arms. I have quoted the substance from memory. When I read the article, I felt the force of the argument. Though I had intended the movement to be pure non-violent resistance, as I look back upon the happenings of those days, there was undoubtedly violence among the resisters. I must own that had I been perfectly tuned to the music of ahimsa, I would have sensed the slightest departure from it and my sensitiveness would have rebelled against any discord in it.
 It seems to me that the united action of the Hindus and the Muslims blinded me to the violence that was lurking in the breasts of many. The English who are trained diplomats and administrators are accustomed to the line of least resistance, and when they found that it was more profitable to conciliate a big organization than to crush it by extensive frightfulness, they yielded to the extent that they thought was necessary. It is, however, my conviction that our resistance was predominantly non-violent in action and will be accepted as such by the
 future historian. As a seeker of truth and non-violence, however, I must not be satisfied with mere action if it is not from the heart. I must declare from the house-tops that the non-violence of those days fell far short of the non-violence as I have so often defined.
 Non-violent action without the co-operation of the heart and the head cannot produce the intended result. The failure of our imperfect ahimsa is visible to the naked eye. Look at the feud that is going on between Hindus and Muslims. Each is arming for the fight with the other. The violence that we had harboured in our breasts during the non-co-operation days is now recoiling upon ourselves. The violent energy that was generated among the masses, but was kept under check in the pursuit of a common objective, has now been let loose and is being used among and against ourselves.
 The same phenomenon is discernible, though in a less crude manner, in the dissension among Congressmen themselves and the use of forcible methods that the Congress Ministers are obliged to adopt
 in running the administrations under their charge.
 This narrative clearly shows that the atmosphere is surcharged with violence. I hope it also shows that non-violent mass movement is an impossibility unless the atmosphere is radically changed. To blind one’s eyes to the events happening around us is to court disaster. It has been suggested to me that I should declare mass civil disobedience and all internal strife will cease, Hindus and Muslims will compose their differences, Congressmen will forget mutual jealousies and fights for power. My reading of the situation is wholly different. If any mass movement is undertaken at the present moment in the name of non- violence, it will resolve itself into violence largely unorganized and organized in some cases. It will bring discredit on the Congress, spell disaster for the Congress struggle for independence and bring ruin to many a home. This may be a wholly untrue picture born of my weakness. If so, unless I shed that weakness, I cannot lead a movement which requires great strength and resolution.
 But if I cannot find an effective, purely non-violent method, outbreak of violence seems to be a certainty. The people demand self- expression. They are not satisfied with the constructive programme prescribed by me and accepted almost unanimously by the Congress. As I have said before, the imperfect response to the constructive programme is itself proof positive of the skin-deep nature of the non- violence of Congressmen.
 But if there is an outbreak of violence, it would not be without cause. We are yet far from the independence of our dream. The irresponsibility of the Centre, which eats up 80 percent of the revenue, grinds down the people and thwarts their aspirations, is daily proving more and more intolerable.
 There is a growing consciousness of the terrible autocracy of the majority of the States. I admit my responsibility for the suspension of civil resistance in several States. This has resulted in demoralization both among the people and the Princes. The people have lost nerve and feel that all is lost. The demoralization among the Princes consists in their thinking that now they have nothing to fear from their people, nothing substantial to grant. Both are wrong. The result does not dismay me. In fact I had foretold the possibility of these results when  I was discussing with the Jaipur workers the advisability of suspending the movement, even though it was well circumscribed with rules and restrictions. The demoralization among the people shows that there was not non-violence in thought and word, and therefore when the
 intoxication and excitement of jail-going and the accompanying demonstrations ceased they thought that the struggle was over. The Princes came to the hasty conclusion that they could safely consoli- date their autocracy by adopting summary measures against the resis- ters and placating the docile element by granting eye-wash reforms.
 Both the people and the Princes might have reacted in the right manner—the people by recognizing the correctness of my advice and calmly generating strength and energy by quiet and determined cons- tructive effort, and the Princes by seizing the opportunity afforded by suspension, of doing justice for the sake of justice and  granting reforms that would satisfy the reasonable but advanced section among their people. This could only happen, if they recognized the time- spirit. It is neither too late for the people nor the Princes.
 In this connection I may not omit the Paramount Power. There are signs of the Paramount Power repenting of the recent declarations about the freedom to the Princes to grant such reforms to their people as they chose. There are audible whispers that the Princes may not take those declarations literally. It is an open secret that the Princes dare not do anything that they guess is likely to displease the Para- mount Power. They may not even meet persons whom the Paramount Power may not like them to meet. When there is this tremendous influence exercised over the Princes, it is but natural to hold the Para- mount Power responsible for the unadulterated autocracy that reigns supreme in many States.
 So if violence breaks out in this unfortunate land, the respon- sibility will have to be shared by the Paramount Power, the Princes, and above all by Congressmen. The first two have never claimed to be non-violent. Their power is frankly derived from and based on the use of violence. But the Congress has since 1920 adopted non-violence as its settled policy and has undoubtedly striven to act up to it. But as Congressmen never had non-violence in their hearts, they must reap the fruit of the defect, however unintentional it was. At the crucial moment the defect has come to the surface and the defective method does not seem to meet the situation. Non-violence is never a method of coercion, it is one of conversion. We have failed to convert the Princes, we have failed to convert the English administrators. It is no use saying that it is impossible to persuade persons willingly to part with their power. I have claimed that satyagraha is a new experiment. It will be time to pronounce it a failure when Congressmen have given it a genuine trial. Even a policy, if it is honestly pursued, has to be
 pursued with all one’s heart. We have not done so. Hence Con- gressmen have to convert themselves before the Paramount Power and the Princes can be expected to act justly.
 But if the Congressmen can or will go no further than they have done in the direction of non-violence, and if the Paramount Power and the Princes do not voluntarily and selfishly do the right thing, the country must be prepared for violence, unless the new  technique  yields a new mode of non-violent action which will become an  effective substitute for violence as a way of securing redress of wrongs. The fact that violence must fail will not prevent its outbreak. Mere constitutional agitation will not do.

110,"July 7, 1939",BHANDARIS AND PROHIBITION,"
    
 As the train taking me to the Frontier Province was steaming out of the station, Rao Bahadur Bole handed me a copy of the petition of the Bhandaris of Bombay addressed to the Prime Minister. He pressed me to read it and send him my reply. I read the petition after resting my tired limbs and sent him my reply.libtech_140_footnote
 The petition is an interesting document and deserves public notice. According to it the Bhandaris got the concession to tap trees as early as 1672 as a mark of favour for military services rendered to the then British Power. Then they lost the concession. But they were able to continue their occupation, and to the present that is the occupation of about 8,000 people.
 The petitioners say they are not against prohibition but they plead for gradualness extending to a few years.
 
 Then comes the sting at the very tail end. It runs :
 If the Government fail to pay heed to all these entreaties and leave the Bhandaris to their fate as it falls upon them, we do not know what course these poorly educated and uneducated people may follow in their sheer disappointment.  We are afraid they may even go to the length of adopting  not only Congress methods of seeking relief but adopting more drastic measures in their frenzy.
The threat, in my opinion, vitiates a good case and raises grave
 doubts about the bona fides of the signatories. Are the Government to yield to cold reason or to the cold steel?
 If the Bhandaris have a good case, why do they not rely upon its commanding public sympathy? Let me inform the public that the Ministers are trying their best, in spite of threats, to remove every kind of injustice. In these days of the growing violence of the mind, threats must be regarded as the ordinary lot of Ministers elected under the extensive democratic franchise. They may not be deterred even at the cost of their offices or lives from doing what they hold to be their duty, nor can they afford to be angry and refuse to do justice because as in the case under consideration, the petition for justice ends by issuing an ugly threat. I have, therefore, pleasure in informing the public that the Ministers are applying themselves to the  task  of  keeping every tapper employed at the very work to which he has been used. Only the tappers have got to help the Ministers to apply the remedy. It consists in the tappers tapping nira during the nira season and turning it into gur. This requires honest care and attention. The pots have to be treated as has been pointed out in these columns. The nira need not be drunk. Pure nira cannot take the place of toddy which contains a certain percentage of alcohol and which therefore changes in quality. Pure nira is food even as sugar is. Toddy, even sweet, is not in the same sense and to the same extent as nira. Hence nira will be turned into gur which can compete with the ordinary gur which is often dirty, adulterated, full of grit. Palm gur is any day more tasty than sugarcane gur. It can be eaten raw whereas sugarcane gur being much sweeter does not admit of being eaten raw. And palm gur, when it is manufactured under State supervision, will always carry with it the guarantee of being pure. Many sweets can be manufactured out of palm gur. But in order to accomplish this great task wholehearted co-operation of the Bhandaris is necessary. If they are in earnest, they will help the Government and help themselves. What to do during the
 off-season will be a question. I have not been able to study the condition under which toddy is drawn. But this is a matter of detail and adjustment.

112,,WAR SPURS INVENTION OF NEW MACHINE,"
    
 The invention of a revolutionary type of spinning machine that will raise the daily output of the individual Chinese spinner from its present standard of one pound of yarn a day to an average of between twenty and thirty pounds, by Mr. Kanya Nieh, of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and a graduate of Cornell University and the Massachussetts Institute of Techno- logy, was announced in Chingkiang on May 26. The invention, stimulated and hastened by the demands of China’s war-time economy, represents the fruit of six years of research and experimentation, during the last twenty-two months of which the inventor was constantly moving about the country as he followed the National Government in its transfer to the interior  of  the province. . . .
 Mr. Nieh’s new frames are based somewhat remotely on the old native spinning methods of China. He studied and analysed according to modern principles all the motions that go into the process of spinning until he had reduced each one to its essential scientific function—then he constructed a machine which utilized and intensified all the useful motions in the  old process of spinning, and which discarded the useless motions which serve
 
 only to waste the individual’s energy and time. The machines that Mr. Nieh has built according to these principles of scientific analysis are strong, sturdy machines that are at the same time extremely cheap. They are built basically of wood, with copper used as the chief metal. Iron and steel are used only at a few key parts, while the cogs are made of hard wood. The new machine is so made that it works almost automatically with a minimum of exertion on the part of the operator. The energy to operate the machine is supplied by a foot treadle which the operator keeps in motion. . . .
 The actual introduction of the new machine to the people will fall to the lot of the Chinese Industrial Co-operatives and several private concerns. The Chinese Industrial Co-operatives plan to establish in the coming year over 10,000 co-operatives, of which at least thirty percent will be textile co- operatives. It is the belief of the Co-operatives that of the normal consuming capacity of Free China of 10,000,000 bolts of cloth a year,  at  least, 3,000,000 will be produced by its co-operatives within the next twelve months. In the production of these textiles, the new spinning frames will play an important part. It is planned to introduce the new machine to its users at the rate of two machines per family. Cotton yarn, now selling in the interior at
 2.30 dollars per pound, will be reduced to a fraction of its former cost.
 The  foregoinglibtech_144_footnotewas  received  by  Shri  Aryanayakamlibtech_145_footnotefrom   a friend in China. I wish I could give more details about this invention. For me its merit lies in China finding it necessary to introduce village, in the place of town, production.

 Those who are interested in Jaipur affairs have been living in suspense for they had learnt that some talks were taking place between the Prime Ministerlibtech_146_footnotelibtech_147_footnoteof the State and Sheth Jamnalalji. I regret to have to inform them that nothing worth has come out of the talks. Therefore the struggle continues. Even civil disobedience continues in a way though it is suspended in regard to further formation of  jathaslibtech_148_footnotefor courting arrest. Those who courted arrests remain in the State prisons. They have not sought release. They will come out in due
 
 course on the termination of their sentences. Shethji’s detentionlibtech_149_footnotelibtech_150_footnoteis indefinite. And he will not come out by undertaking to leave the State on release, and the authorities will not permit him to remain in Jaipur as a free man in spite of the fact that further courting of arrests has stopped. Thus they will not allow Shethji even to do constructive work among the people. They know that they have no fear of any secret propaganda or his part on his saying one thing and  doing  the contrary. His reputation for [the] strictest honesty is too well established to admit of any doubt.
 Some complication has arisen because Shethji is suffering from pains in the knees. The State Medical Officer advises Shethji to go to Europe or at least to the seaside for treatment. He is himself doing all he can, but he is of opinion that change of place is indicated. Shethji whilst he is under detention would not go out of Jaipur even for the sake of getting well. He thinks that self-respect requires unconditional release. He will not think of a change so long as he is under a ban for which he feels there is no justification. Since civil disobedience is suspended there is no warrant whatsoever for detain-ing Jamnalalji in custody. Why won’t the authorities release him and arrest him when he commits an offence against the laws of the State? To say the least there is something uncanny about the treatment of Sheth Jamnalalji. It is the duty of the Jaipur authorities either to justify the indefinite detention or to release him unconditionally.
 The Jaipurians have been asking me how long the embargo on their civil resistance will last. I can only answer, as long as the atm- osphere demands suspension. Meanwhile let them carry out the constructive programme. I retain the opinion that no one is fit for offering civil disobedience who has not satisfied the conditions I have laid down. And there is always a saving clause about all my advice. No one need follow it unless it appeals to his head and heart. No one who has honestly the inner call need be deterred from obeying it because of my advice. In other words, it applies only to those who are not conscious of any inner call and who have faith in my riper experience and soundness of my judgment.
 Though the talks have broken down, the authorities are not absolved from the duty of finding a solution for the impasse. Absence of civil disobedience does not mean cessation of agitation in some
 
 form or other for securing the rudiments of freedom for which the fight was undertaken. Public opinion will give the authorities no rest. Let the Jaipurians, therefore, know that so long as they have the will they have the power. And it increases with every effort to keep it under check. Every power is not meant to be immediately used. Garnering it often makes it far more effective than if it is used the moment it is generated.

114,"July 8, 1939",TO THE PRINCES,"
    
 Several persons interested in the States have asked me what in my opinion is the minimum that all States should guarantee in order to come in line with the enlightened opinion in what is called British India. I cannot vouch for what the Congress would say if it had to give any such opinion. Perhaps it would be wrong for the Congress to have or to give such opinion. A democratic body can only pronounce opinion on events as they happen. Be that as it may, the opinion I am about to give is only my own and binds no one but me.
The minimum then that all States great and small can give is :
  Full 	civil liberty, so long 	as it is not 	used to 	promote violence 	directly or indirectly. 	This includes 	freedom of the 	Press and 	freedom to receive 	newspapers which do not 	promote violence.  Freedom 	to the 	people of 	the States 	to form 	associations and 	educate public 	opinion in 	favour of establishing 	responsible government 	in their 	own States.  Freedom 	for Indians 	outside particular 	States to 	enter them 	without let 	or hindrance 	so long 	as their 	activities are 	not directed towards 	the destruction 	of the States 	in question.  The 	privy purse should be 	limited so 	as not to 	exceed one- 	tenth of 	the income 	where it ranges 	between Rs. 10 	to 15 lakhs per 	year, and 	in no case 	should the 	purse exceed Rs. 	3 lakhs 	per year, 	and should 	include all the private 	expenses of 	the Ruler (e. g., palace 	expenses, cars, 	stables, the 	Ruler’s guests) except 	those which have 	reference to 	performance of 	public duty which 	should be 	clearly defined.  Judiciary 	to be independent 	and permanent 	and free 	of all 	interference. In 	order to 	ensure uniformity 	of practice 	and strict 	im- partiality, 	there should 	be an appeal 	to the 	High Court of 	the Pro- 	vince within 	which the State in 	question is 	situated. This 	may not be possible without a 	change in 	the law governing 	the High Courts. 	It can, 	I imagine, be easily altered if the States agree. 
 I have purposely avoided reference to constitutional  reform. This will depend upon the situation as it exists in every State. I should assume that where local public opinion demands it, the Ruler is bound to respond.
 The most contentious part of my minimum is perhaps the right of appeal to the High Courts. And yet unless some such arrangement is made, pure justice cannot be guaranteed in the States whatever may be said to the contrary. This is one institution which the British have built up with patient care. No doubt the High Court procedure is expensive and far from expeditious. The poor of the land cannot reach it. The processes are cumbersome. Often the unscrupulous win. With all their faults, however, and except where high politics have come in, the decisions of High Courts have been just and fearless. I can think of no easy and ready-made check save that of the High Courts on the vagaries, and sometimes subservience to the executive, of the judiciary in the States. But I am not wedded to my solution. If something else equally effective can be devised, I should have no objection.
 One thing seems to me to be clear. If the transfer of power from the Princes to the people is to take place without violence, and if the Princes are to live as such, they will have to adapt themselves to the changed circumstances. Very few people have faith in my plan, viz., the plan of Princes voluntarily parting with power and becoming real trustees.The critics say it is Utopian and against human nature. I must advocate it so long as I believe in its practical possibility. The world is inevitably moving to self-destruction or to a non-violent solution of all its ailments, moral, social, economic and political. The threatened world war will bring us nearer the desirable solution if a respectable part of it survives the impending catastrophe. Whoever recognizes that the only escape from the impending fate is a non-violent solution will, therefore, apply it to his own problems, whether they are domestic, communal or any other. Non-violence is a universal law acting under
 all circumstances. Disregard of it is the surest way to des-truction. It is only a question of time.
The Princes would not solve the riddle by the proposed combi-
 nation with Garasias, Muslims, Scheduled Classes, and their own sub- jects who are too cowed down to resist. It is a combination that is bound to break under its own weight. It is itself an inflammable mix- ture. And a combination against whom? The Congress which seeks to represent all these not excluding the Princes themselves? The Con- gress will die a natural death when it ceases to be national in every sense of the term. It has that unbroken tradi-tion for the past fifty years. Whatever transformation it under-goes, it is the only institutionlibtech_151_footnotethat will succeed British Imperialism whose days as imperialism are numbered. British politicians realize this. They would not resist, do not want to resist, its transformation or destruction. The imperialism is increasingly becoming a dead weight if only because it is based on highly organized violence. The Princes may ignore the Congress for a time. But they cannot for all time. Some are reported to have said that after all it was composed of Banias who would show the white feather on a few knock-out blows on the head by the strong combination pictured above. I would like respectfully to point out that the Con- gress is not composed of Banias who can be counted on one’s finger- tips. The millions who took part in the civil disobedience fights were not Banias. I do not thereby mean to imply that they were desirous of giving blow for a blow. Many could. But they had forsworn violence. Many Congress heads were broken by something severer than knock- out blows. All I wish to imply is that the Congress is not composed of mere cowards. Non-violence and cowardice go ill together. I can imagine a fully armed man to be at heart a coward. Possession of arms implies an element of fear, if not cowardice. But true non-violence is an impossibility without the possession of unadulterated fearlessness.
 I beseech the Princes not to underrate the Congress as a force in the country. Its policy still remains non-violent. I admit it is fast tending towards violence. I and a few of my companions are putting forth every effort in favour of non-violence. I ask the Princes,for their own sakes and for the sake of the country that has given them birth, to throw in their weight in favour of non-violence. It seems to be touch- and-go with the Congress. It will either become growingly non-violent or will presently become a violent organization, not necessarily doing
 
 immediate deeds of violence but preparing itself for ultimate violence. It would not harbour cowards. If it does, it will cease to be the power it has become. Every Indian, high or low, (there is no high and no low for the Congress) has to make his choice.

 century. I have no doubt about the soundness of my advice. However much one may sympathize with the Bantus, Indians cannot make common cause with them. I doubt if the Bantus themselves will as a class countenance any such move. They can only damage and com- plicate their cause by mixing it up with the Indian, as Indians would damage theirs by such mixture. But neither the A. I. C. C. resolution nor my advice need deter the Indians from forming a non-European front if they are sure thereby of winning their freedom. Indeed, had they thought it beneficial or possible, they would have formed it long ago.

 DEAR SIR SIKANDARlibtech_167_footnote ,
 Parsi friends told me with glee that you had described the prohi- bition programme of the Bombay Ministry as a ‘madcap scheme’. Can this be true? If so, why do you consider it to be such?
 I have been receiving letters telling me that you contemplate introducing separate electorates for Harijans at Municipal elections! I wonder if there is truth in this information.
 I observe that your schemelibtech_168_footnotelibtech_169_footnoteis already before the public. I have not had a moment to give to its study. I hope early next week to take it up and the papers you were good enough to leave with me.
 I hope your backache has subsided. I would strongly recom- mend nature cure as a permanent remedy. It consists in strict diet, vapour baths and cold hip-baths. Abdominal mud bandages help con- siderably. Rajkumari Amrit Kaur has some experience of this treat- ment. She has tried it herself off and on. She is your neighbour. Do discuss it with her.

 I read here today your letter of the 4th. Your complaint is justified. It is strange that there is no letter from Sushila. Shakaribehn is bound to feel hurt. If I were in your place I also would feel hurt. A calamity like this is an example of my mismanagement. I hold myself responsible for the mismanagement among those around me. Shan- karan had a narrow escape. He is better. He will perhaps take a month to get well. If Sushila did not write about the old man’s dressing, it was a serious lapse on her part. I think she would not commit a mis- take like that. I hope you will continue to hear from her. Lilavati’s address is: New Era High School, Bombay. She is staying in Vanita Vishram but she is not happy there. Let us see what happens. Amtul Salaam is at Sabarmati Harijan Ashram. She seems likely to prove a good worker.
 As an incision has been made under Pyarelal’s tongue, Ba, Pya- relal and Sushila are expected to come after about four or five days. The weather here is better than at Segaon. It is neither too cold nor too hot.

JARDINElibtech_171_footnote","
           ABBOTTABAD, 
  [July 9, 1939]libtech_172_footnote  GANDHIJI: That is the 	only correct position, and no other is possi- ble. If you have 	followed my writings, you know that I have declared that no one is 	competent to offer satyagraha unless he has a living faith in God. I 	had formerly not the courage to say so bluntly to my co-workers. I 	knew it was difficult to get a heart-response to this thing. For 	there are many who say they have living faith and yet are not 	godfearing, and others who scoff at the idea of believing in God and 	yet are at heart godfearing. But I said it did not matter how 	difficult it was, I must put it forward as I know it.  [JARDINE: 	] You came only recently to the conclusion that you must insist on 	the condition? G. 	Yes. I felt I must make it an indispensable condition. I knew 	it,  	I practised it, but had not declared it for acceptance by all. I 	knew some resented this and even imputed to me motives of excluding 	them from the chosen circle. But I said I must take even the risk of 	being misunderstood, but must declare the truth at all cost. How to 	reduce the whole thing to practice I do not know.  J. 	That is 	simply terrific. To 	hear you 	say that it 	is difficult is 	tremendous, for 	 it is an encouragement 	to me. 	There is a 	kind of 	hero-worship that 	attributes to 	you superhuman 	powers. It is something 	to hear 	that you have 	difficulties and are 	human, and 	thus to 	feel kinship with you.  Then 	there is another thing that has come home to me. You must not think 	of taking but always of giving something. G. 	That is right in a sense, but you can’t give without 	taking, and to 	go on saying that you will always give would be humbug.     
 Honesty, purity, unselfishness and love are their fourfold principles, and the friend said that whilst the first two would come under the heading ‘truth’, the other two would come under the heading ‘non-violence or bravery’. Gandhiji asked:
How is a civilian who is trained not to establish any human con-
 tact with the ruled to fare under this rule? Perhaps you will not admit that they are so trained ?
 J. No
 G. Well, you will by and by. I do not make a charge of it. It was worldly wisdom that dictated the course to those who organized the Service. How could they allow them to live on terms of familiarity with those over whom they had to rule, especially when the rulers were only a handful?And yet if you accept the creed of the Oxford Group, you have to establish human contact with me. And if you do it with me, you must do it with others. You will have to contact the whole of India through me, and I with all Englishmen through you. That at any rate is what the Oxford Group must stand for, otherwise it would be like many other similar movements.
 J. You are right, and that is why I kept out of freemasonry. We have to meet under God, and we shall not make demands from another which are inconsistent with the guidance of God.
G. Anyway, I have expressed my difficulty.
 J. A programme of moral rearmament for the world cannot fail to lessen the dangers of armed conflict. Such moral rearmament must receive support on a world- wide basis.
 Gandhiji was invited to put his signature to a “response” to President Roosevelt’s message.libtech_173_footnote
 
 
 thousand persons assembled in Constitution Hall in America, moral rearmament as a means of maintaining world peace.	Two of the paragraphs in it read thus:
 ‘MRA means first of all a change of heart. It means admission of our responsibility for the past, a frank acceptance by nations as by individuals of the standards of honesty, purity, unselfishness and love daily listening and daily obedience to God’s direction.
 ‘At this fateful hour we pledge ourselves to give the last full measure of our
 devotion—the service of heart, mind, will—to the Moral and Spiritual Rearmament of our nation—to building the world of tomorrow, the world of new men, new nations, where every resource of human genius is liberated under God’s leadership to enrich the heritage of all mankind.’ ”
 With all deference to those in India who had signed this “response” Gandhiji said he could not in all conscience sign this. He could not endorse a falsehood. How can India accept responsibility for the past?
All this has no application to me. The whole paragraph applies
 to exploiting nations, whereas India is an exploited nation. The second paragraph too applies to nations of the West and not to us. The whole appeal is so unreal. I can think of moral rearmament, but that would be in a different setting. I can think of communal unity  through moral rearmament. As a member of an exploited nation I can have a different moral rearmament programme, and I may invite China to it, but how can I invite the West or Japan? And just as it would be unreal for me to invite the West, it would to that extent be unreal for the West to invite India. Let them shed their exploitation policy and their immoral gains first.libtech_174_footnote

  	I am only today able to deal with your letter of 18th May. You say 	there should be no self-torture, self-compulsion, self-violence in 	the practice of non-violence. This is a profound error. There is no 	salvation without the cross. Self-torture is only so called. The 	right word is self-purification. The flesh must be subdued. The 	flesh has gained such mastery over us that it has to be dislodged. 	We are born slaves of the flesh. Freedom from that bondage is 	mastery over the flesh, the self. All tapasya is 	self-torture. All restraint is self-tourture. It is a surgical 	operation which has got to be performed. The fleshly mantle divides 	you from me. I must destroy it if I love you, i. e., if I want to be 	one with you. Its destruction in this life means its complete 	subjection. Is this not quite clear? Love to you and Appu.

I told him about the climate and  the altitude.libtech_176_footnoteI told him too that if you were needed you would 	return in October. Badshah Khan was present during the conversation. 	So far as I can fathom him, he does not want to lose you.  	Kisenchand Bhatia came in today (Monday). The talks begin to- 	morrow. Badshah Khan is away keeping an appointment. He remains as 	lovable as before to me. But that is nothing. What you feel is the 	only right [thing] for you.    
 Mahadev  Desai  has  gone  to  inspect  Nathiagali.  The  hostesslibtech_177_footnotehere is anxious for me to go there. I am not anxious to change. This place is good enough and cool enough for me.
There is no news from Pyarelal as to when they are coming.
 I am still keeping well. You can easily imagine from my having to use the left hand how much writing the right must have done. Jayaprakash came in today.
Love.

 BHAI VALLABHRAM,
 I got your letter when I was very busy. I could not, therefore, call for Ambashankar Vaidya. I do not know if he had come of his own accord.
 Ba was to have gone to Sabarmati, but the plan was changed at the last minute. She is not with me, either, but she will soon join me. I will not trouble you at present on her account.
 I am very happy that Chandanbehn is improving, because it was  I who had insisted on putting her under your treatment. You may now keep her as long as necessary and send her back after she is  completely cured.
 Vijaya doesn’t seem to have completely recovered. That responsibility, therefore, still remains with you.

 I hope Chandan is improving. I have had a letter from her. Shankar was improving rapidly. Aren’t they both, Shankar and Chandan, fortunate? Shankar should be arriving there soon now.
 You had asked for Kaka’s opinion, but he has left the decision to me. If Chandan does not require your presence now and you also feel the same, please return to Wardha.
 Ba has fully recovered. But, as a small incision was made under Pyarelal’s tongue, Sushila and Ba had to stay back. They will be leaving in a day or two."

139,"July 12, 1939",NOTES,"
    
 A REPUDIATION
 Janab Yusuf Meherally, President, Cutch Prajakiya Parishad, writes:
 In a recent issue of the Harijan, under the caption “Leaders Must Lead”libtech_181_footnote, you have made reference to Cutch which raises one or two points that need to be cleared up. The note has it that a Cutch worker informed you that “some leaders in Cutch are telling the people there that but for your stopping civil disobedience they would today be enjoying responsible government or something near it.”
 We were not a little surprised to read this, for to the best of my knowledge none of our responsible workers in Cutch has said this. Since the suspension of the satyagraha by us under your advice on April 1, I alone must have addressed over 200 meetings all over Cutch. My other colleagues in Cutch have similarly done a great deal of touring. But nowhere have our leading workers given expression to such sentiments. In fact, at a public meeting in the capital town of Bhuj, which is our headquarters, I asked the large gathering present if any among them had heard these or similar words. The unanimous reply was in the negative. I asked again if there were any person in the audience who had recollection of hearing anything that even resembled this. Not one such person was there. I do not wish to labour the point any further. But we could not help feeling hurt that you should have lent the weight of your name to a statement which on further enquiry you would have found to be incorrect.
I gladly publish this repudiation. But I must say that there was
 no occasion for the President to feel hurt. Had I mentioned names, I would certainly have referred to him before writing the note. But when a responsible worker asked me if I had stopped civil disobe- dience in Cutch and wanted a public declaration from me, I could not wait for confirmation before giving my answer. Nor does the present repudiation take the matter any further than where it was left by my note except that Janab Meherally and those whom he asked did not make the statement alluded to. The proper procedure is to challenge my informant to produce the names of those whom he knew had made the statement imputed to them or unreservedly to withdraw his
 
 
 allegation. I may inform the reader that I have adopted the procedure myself and asked my informant to produce the names or to withdraw his allegation. Meanwhile my note has served a very useful purpose in the other States if not in Cutch. The leaders have a greater sense of responsibility and realize that my opinion should have no weight with them except to the extent that it appeals to their heads and hearts. They are solely responsible for any action they take. And naturally. They alone know the situation at first hand within their own spheres of action.
 THE WAY TO DO IT
 Narandas Gandhi is khadi-mad. He is a good teacher after my style and an able accountant, but has been for years a staunch believer in the gospel of khadi. He devotes about four hours daily to spinning. His output gives him khadi enough for his house-hold. Five years ago he conceived the idea of popularizing khadi and raising funds for public services by dedicating as many days as my years at the time of my birthday. He began with my 66th year. I attach the greatest impor- tance to my service of the poor through khadi. I do not regard it as a mad man’s mad idea. It cannot be so mad when it is remembered that it has put into the pockets of Hindu and Muslim spinners and weavers nearly five crores of rupees. Though, therefore, Narandas Gandhi’s enterprise is connected with my name, I do not hesitate to advertise it year after year. His ambition rises as years roll by. And it has been always hitherto more than fulfilled. He began by asking co-workers to contribute in all 66,000 yards of yarn and collecting 66 coins from those who would care to give them. Collection of yarn was made from all over India. Collection of coin was naturally confined to Rajkot for it was matter of door-to-door begging. This time Narandas Gandhi hopes to receive, instead of seventy thousand, 70 lakhs of yards of yarn. Is there anything which the determination of the good cannot achieve?libtech_182_footnotelibtech_183_footnoteIt should not be difficult of fulfilment if 100libtech_184_footnotelibtech_185_footnotevolunteers spin 1,000 yards of yarn daily from 2nd August for seventy days. The programme commences on 2nd August and finishes on 10th October. A fast spinner would do 1,000 yards in three hours. But an average spinner would easily do it in four hours. If Narandas secures the co-
 
 operation of 1,000libtech_186_footnotevolunteers, the output need not be more than 100 yards per day. That means giving less than thirty minutes daily. And of course merit lies in an increasing number of volunteers responding every year. The virtue of khadi lies in bringing the distribution of the work of spinning as near the individual use of khadi as possible. The spinning provides the best and the easiest method of voluntary and useful co-operation. India has man-power in crores and that is why it does not require giant soul-less machines.libtech_187_footnoteGiven the co-operation of crores of people, it would be child’s play for them to produce cloth for their own use. That would save the drain of crores of rupees to foreign countries and the wealth would automatically be distributed among crores of people. Let me hope Narandas Gandhi will secure the association of many volunteers in his enterprise. They should send their names and addresses to him as early as possible. The money contributions and the proceeds from the sale of yarn or khadi as the case may be, though they will be nominally presented to me, will be returned by me to be equally divided in three parts for Harijan and khadi work in Kathiawar and the Rajkot Rashtriyashala.
 ABBOTTABAD, July 12, 1939.
 Harijan, 22-7-1939
 "
140,"July 12, 1939",MEENAKSHI TEMPLE OPEN,"
    
 I have before me Rameshwari Devi’s address to the Tamilnad Provincial Harijan Temple-entry Conference held at Madura on 13th June last. I had a letter from her describing how successful her tour seemed to have been from the numbers who attended her meetings and the enthusiasm they showed. She had also expressed the hope that the famous Meenakshi temple was likely soon to be opened to Harijans. Little did I then know that the temple was to be opened so soon. But the wonderful event happened on the 8th instant.
 It is a great event in the campaign against untouchability and the movement for the opening of temples to Harijan. The Proclamation opening the State temples of Travancore was no doubt a very big step. But it was the prerogative of the Maharaja. He had in his Dewan a wise adviser. The Maharaja, the Maharani and the Dewan brought about
 
 
 the transformation. But the opening of the celebrated temple  of Madura is a greater event in that it is the popular will that has brought about the happy consummation. It reflects a decided conversion of the temple-goers of the Meenakshi temple. Shri Vaidyanatha Aiyar and his co-workers deserve all the praise for the ceaseless effort that they have put forth in educating public opinion.
 Let us hope that this opening will be followed  up  by  the opening of the other great temples of the South. There should be no hurry, no hustling of the public. The opinion of the temple-goers is of the greatest value. Theirs should be the deciding voice. The workers will consolidate every gain so as to prevent any set-back. Every open- ing of a temple to Harijans should mark greater purification inside and outside the temple opened. The sanctity of such temples should on no account be marred. No political capital should be made out of what is, and is intended to be, a purely religious act.
 Harijans too should be taught to understand the religious signi- ficance of the opening of temples for them.
There were fifteen useful resolutions taken at the Conference.
Of these the following three attract special attention:
  This 	Conference notes 	with deep regret the 	recent action of 	the Mysore 	Government in having 	withdrawn their 	order permitting Harijans 	into the 	Sravana Belagola temple even up to the limits where non-Hindus are allowed.  This 	Conference resolves that the 	Provincial Boards of 	the Harijan 	Sevak Sangh should take up the organization of a Provincial Sevak Service with the 
following objects:
  There 	should be a 	whole-time worker in 	charge of 	every institution run 	by the 	Harijan Sevak Sangh, as 	schools, hostels, etc. The sevaks should undertake to serve for at least five years.  They 	should be 	paid an 	allowance ranging 	from Rs. 15 	to Rs. 30 according to the needs of the individual and the circumstances of the locality.  The 	sevak shall be 	attached to 	any one of 	the centres 	allotted to him 	by the 	Provincial Board.  The 	qualifications of 	the sevak and 	the pledge to 	be given by 	him shall be 	the same 	as that 	of the Central 	Board sevaks, with this additional qualification 	that he should have passed at least the third form and must have been for at 
 least three years in Harijan work, and should possess full faith and confidence
 in th ideals set forth by Mahatmaji and the Harijan Sevak Sangh.
  The 	Provincial Board, though 	solely responsible for 	the salary of 	the sevaks, the 	institution to 	which he 	is attached will 	also undertake to 	pay at 	least half his allowance.  The 	Provincial Board 	in consulation with 	the district or 	local committees shall 	select the sevaks 	under the scheme 	who will 	abide by the 	conditions laid down by 	the Provincial Board from 	time to time.  The 	sevaks attached to 	each Provincial 	Board shall meet at 	least once 	a year. 
  Resolved 	that a short 	workers’ training camp extending about a 	month be 	organized by 	the respective 	Provincial Boards in any 	of the 	following centres, 	viz., the Ramakrishna 	Vidyalaya of Coimbatore, 	the Vinayashram 	in Guntur 	and the Kengeri 	Gurukul in 	Mysore. Shri 	Avinasilingam, 	Ramachandran, Bapineedu 	and Gopalaswamy 	be requested 	to draft 	a scheme 	for their 	training and 	circulate the 	same to 	all the Provincial 	Boards. 
The first is surprising and demands an answer from the Mysore
 authorities. I hope that there is some misunderstanding somewhere. A concession once given is not withdrawn lightly.
 The second resolution is very important. The Conference has thereby taken a big step. The third is also a substantial resolution. Let us hope that whatever has been undertaken by the Conference will be duly carried out. Our resolutions often begin and end with being printed and advertised in the Press. They have value only if they are reduced to practice.

150,"July 13, 1939",A GOOD SAMARITAN,"
         	As will appear from the following letter received by me from Shri 	A.S. Wadia of Poona, he has been truly a good samaritan to the poor 	people who eke out a bare living by heaving up to the Maha- 	baleshwar Hill loads of wood from the plains below for the use of 	the summer visitors. Here is the extract from Shri Wadia’s letter: 	libtech_194_footnote  I 	went to 	Mahabaleshwar to 	get that isolation and 	quiet I 	wanted to 	write my 	new book 	on Southern Rhodesia. 	But while there my mind 	and energies were 	unexpectedly diverted to 	looking into a 	grievance of 	the village 	people who came 	up to 	Mahabaleshwar from the 	valleys below with heavy 	loads of hay 	and firewood and 	sold them for a mere pittance in  our bazaar.       Whenever I happened to talk to them,  they 	invariably complained of 	the awful 	condition of the 	tracks by 	which they 	came up, as the pointed stones cut their toes and blistered their feet.	On 	inquiry I found  that 	the tracks came to be made by constant use and were never touched by 	the hand of man ever since Mahabaleshwar was discovered by General 	Lodnick a hundred years ago.  Realizing 	that the grievance of the village people was just and needed 	immediate attention, I put away the writing of my Rhodesia and 	engaged a gang of coolies and systematically took to the smoothening 	and broadening of the tracks, breaking up obstructive stones and 	lopping off branches which came in the way of their long loads of 	firewood. Off and on the work was continued for eight weeks, during 	the course of which I must have employed altogether about a thousand 	coolies. Counting small and big, a dozen tracks must have been made, 	re-made and in some cases re-aligned. . . .    
 Now I come to the main purpose of my writing you these notes. It is to ask you if Government is not bound to keep in good condition these tracks that I have made for the use of the villagers just as much as they are bound to maintain in good condition the roads for vehicular traffic. . . .
 While conversing with the villagers I gathered a few more facts which might interest you:
  They 	all complained 	that the soil 	of their 	cultivated fields was 	deteriorating year 	after year so that 	their crops came to about 	half of what 	they used to have 	ten years ago.  The 	Congress Government, they 	said, had 	again imposed on 	them a 	tax of 	four annas 	on each 	head of cattle 	after exempting them from 	the tax for the last two 	years.  The 	waste lands round the 	villages should be 	given them for 	cultivation and 	small areas of forest reserve should be opened for grazing their cattle. 
 I wish you, Mahatmaji, would do something to help the ‘Adijans’, as I call these poor villagers of the valleys round Mahabaleshwar, in whose welfare and well- being I am personally interested.
I forwarded the letter to the Bombay Ministers, and I am happy
 to be able to inform the reader that the matter has been taken up by them. The Bombay Government will keep in good repair the foot- paths so considerately smoothed down and made safer than they were before by Shri Wadia. They will also attend to the other matters referred to by my correspondent. I wrote to him asking for further particulars of his enterprise. It appears that he laboured with the labourers himself and constituted himself their road engineer. He paid from his own pocket over Rs. 200 which were supplemented by two friends to the extent of Rs. 125. I am quite sure that Shri Wadia has lost nothing by suspending the writing of his book which it is highly probable will now bear the impress of his very practical philanthropy. It is fashionable to give something to charities out of one’s super- fluous cash. But not many give their labour as well as money. Those who do, ensure the best use possible of their donations. It is to be hoped that the other hill-goers will copy Shri Wadia’s good example by studying and ameliorating the condition of the poor who uncom- plainingly labour for them often on starvation wages.

 ABBOTTABAD,
 July 13, 1939
 I have read Subhas Babu’s statementlibtech_196_footnotelibtech_197_footnoteon the Bombay   prohi- bition with pain and sorrow. He had discussed the question with me when I was in Bombay. I had told him to confer with the Bombay Ministers. I do not know whether he did so. But I was unprepared for his public statement. He has used the arguments of the opponents of prohibition. He was President of the Congress last year, and having been duly elected for the second year he chose to resignlibtech_198_footnotelibtech_199_footnoteowing to differences with his colleagues. He is still head of the Bengal Congress Executive. He is identified with the prohibition policy of the Con- gress. His responsibility has not ceased because he is no longer in the Working Committee. Had he been a member, he could  not have spoken as he has done. His statement because of his position is calcu- lated to discredit the Bombay Ministry in a manner the avowed oppo- nents of prohibition could never hope to do. I can only hope that in this matter Subhas Babu does not reflect the opinion of any other responsible Congressman, and that the general public will con-tinue to support the Bombay ministerial policy with as much enthusiasm as hitherto.
 The Ministers’ duty is plain. They have to pursue their pro- gramme undeterred by any opposition, if they have faith in it. Prohi- bition is the greatest moral reform in the Congress programme. Pre- vious Governments too had given their lip assent to it, but having been irresponsible they had neither the courage nor the will to carry it out. They were not willing to forgo revenue which they could get without effort. They did not stay to examine its tainted source. The Congress Governments have the backing of public opinion. The Working Com- mittee after very careful deliberation issued its mandate on prohi- bition. The Ministers have all over taken it up to the best of their abil- ity. The manner of execution was naturally left to the respective
 
 Ministries. The Bombay Ministers have been courageously pursuing their programme with every prospect of success. Theirs is a difficult position. They were bound to tackle Bombay some day or other. They would be faced with the same opposition as today from the inte- rests directly affected by the prohibition policy. It is not open to any Congressman to embarrass the Ministers as Subhas Babu has done.
 The communal question does not arise at all. Subhas Babu has rendered a great disservice to the Congress by raising the communal cry and the cry of minorities. Independence of India is impossible if causes great or small are to be discredited and ruined on the altar of the minority cry. Subhas Babu has played a most dangerous game by mixing up the communal question with such a purely moral reform as prohibition. It is as much the concern of a Muslim or a Parsi or a Christian as of a Hindu to look after his less fortunate countryman who happens to be a labourer and falls a victim to drink. The Bom- bay property-owners will pay one crore rupees as additional tax not because they are Parsis or Muslims but because they are property- owners. It is altogether misleading to suggest that the tax-payer, him- self a non-drinker, will pay the tax for saving the drunkard. He will pay the tax for the education of his children whereas hitherto the drinker has been made by him to pay for that education. The addi- tional tax will be a tardy but very small reparation for the wrong done by monied men to the poor. And the poor have no class. They irrespective of their caste and creed make by themselves a down- trodden class. Their enforced creed is wretched poverty.
 Parsis are philanthropists of the world. Why should they be behindh and in this the greatest philanthropy? And if theirs is the greatest contribution, it is but in accordance with their best tradition. And they will be thrice blessed. Many of them will be weaned from a trade which corrupts the morals of their countrymen less fortunately placed than they. They will themselves be weaned from the drink habit. However mild it may be for them, I know, from having lived in intimate contact with them, that the drink does leave an indelible mark on them. Thirdly, monied men amongst them will have paid for the long-delayed reform. The cry of minorities is a calumny. It is a Parsi Minister to whose lot has fallen the privilege of introducing prohi- bition. Dr. Gilder’s is a job which brings him no money and it brings him drudgery and loss of a princely medical practice. Another
 
 equally disinterested physicianlibtech_200_footnoteis  the  Sheriff  of  Bombay.  A  third learned  Parsi  is  Vice-Chancellorlibtech_201_footnoteof   the   University,  and   a   fourth businesman is the Mayorlibtech_202_footnoteof Bombay. I do not know that there has been such a happy conjunction before in the history of Bombay. If the Congressmen and the Congress Ministry of Bombay were commu- nally minded and were indifferent to the minorities, this unique event would not have taken place.
 And I suggest that without the willing co-operation of the Mus- lim population of Bombay the movement in Bombay could not have been introduced. I am quite sure that the best Muslim mind in all India is with the Congress in this Bombay project.
 The piecemeal solution flung by Subhas Babu would not work. For one thing it would lack the psychological background. I therefore invite Subhas Babu to retrace his steps and join me in making an appeal to the great Parsi community and those others  who  may oppose the reform to help it to become the success which it deserves to be. It is his duty as Rajen Babu’s immediate predecessor to help the Bombay Ministry which is bravely pursuing the policy laid down for it by the Congress.

  	If your letter had not been received today, I would have wired. I 	was impatient to know the cause of the long silence—long for you. 	I am glad Dalip is on the mend. You will have to come to Segaon to 	get strong. I hope from here my way will be to Segaon without a 	break.  	I do wish you will firmly cancel Sanglilibtech_203_footnoteno matter how insistent Tai is. You must tell her you 	are under treatment which must not be interrupted. You must give the 	doctor a chance.  	Yes, you may go to Jaipur on your way to Segaon. That may be 	considered when my movement is fixed. Except Talcher there is 	nothing on the horizon to keep me from Segaon.  	We wish systems to die, not their authors or victims. We must hope 	whilst there is life. If I suddenly lost my head, you won’t wish 	for me to die but you will pray that I may regain my sanity and 	live. Does this answer your question? Recall what I said about Dyer.  	The information you give me about the States and Travancore is 	interesting and instructive.  	I sent you yesterday Balvantsinha’s letter.libtech_204_footnoteI have heard again from the Sardar Bahadur in reply 	to my own letter.

And Ba could not be brought along without Sushila. I 	could not attend to her personally and she does need medical adjust- 	ment every now and then and she has taken to Sushila. Ba is not 	bringing Kanam this time. He will be left with his maternal uncle. 	Nirmala is likely to go to Wardha soon. In that case of course Kanam 	will join here. Now comes an interruption. Love.

 VANDEMATARAM
 Some students in Hyderabad complain that my notelibtech_208_footnoteon  Vande- mataram has created confusion in their minds. They read an extract from it in some local papers from which the words “at a mixed gathering” were omitted so as to leave the impression that it was not to be sung even in gatherings of their own, though such an inter- pretation was absurd. I was being quoted in support of the con-tention that the students should not be allowed to sing Vandemataram in their own rooms or the prayer hall set apart for their section who had not only no objection but who regarded it as part of their prayer to sing it. My note is quite plain. If at any mixed gathering any person objected to the singing of Vandemataram even with the Congress expurgations, the singing should be dropped. But it was never intended to apply to gatherings in which there was no objection raised. Such an objection would amount to interference, unlawful and intolerant. If objections could be carried to such lengths, even the performance of religious worship would become impossible. And I know that for many patriots the singing of Vandemataram amounts to a religious duty.
 
THAT OBSTINATE DISEASE
 Thus writes Shri Tatachar  who  is  an  ardent  lover  of  Harijans:
 Some time ago there was a riot at Nallathur Cheri. Caste men attacked the Adi-dravida bhajanai and inflicted injuries on several members of the party. In this riot caste men received a few injuries. Adi-dravidas complained of the riot to the police. The police took no notice of their complaint. Caste men filed private complaints in court against five Adi-dravidas. These five Adi-dravidas
 
 were convicted and fined Rs. 25 each and one month’s rigorous imprisonment in default. Appeals were filed and heard on May 26, 1939. Judgment was reserved and was pronounced today in favour of the appellant accused. In accordance with the directions of the appellate court, the appellants asked the trying court on May 27, 1939, to postpone the recovery of the fines, until judgments were pronounced in the appeals. The lower court refused to grant them time and sent them to jail. This grave act of injustice must satisfy
 you that the problem of the removal of untouchability is not going to solve itself.
He has sent me also copious notes which I have read with pain-
 ful interest. The letter from which I have quoted bare facts is filled with biting strictures of the police and the first court which is reported to have refused to stay execution although appeal was admitted and the appellate court is said to have recommended stay of execution.
 I have asked Shri Tatachar for further particulars. Allegations that the police refused to register the complaints of the Harijans while private complaints against them were readily entertained and that the trying magistrate refused to suspend execution of sentences, are serious enough to warrant a departmental enquiry. There is no doubt that if the virus of untouchability is to be eradicated, ceaseless vigi- lance by the central authority is necessary.

157,"July 14, 1939",PROVINCIAL AUTONOMY OR PROVINCIAL,"
    
 JEALOUSY
 Shri Jamshedji Mehta writes:
 After the introduction of provincial autonomy one is pained to observe the growth of provincial exclusiveness and jealousies in matters big or trivial. I often wonder if provincial autonomy has not come upon us as a curse rather than a bless- ing. Instead of the nationalistic spirit having increased, provin- cial exclusiveness seems to have flourished. Before autonomy ‘my country’ used to mean India. Now it means ‘my province’. Will you not warn the country against the danger before it becomes too deep-rooted to be dealt with?
 The letter is naturally in Gujarati. I have given a very free ren- dering of the thought and the grief running through the original.
 Shri Jamshedji’s complaint has justification for it. Provincialism of a healthy type there is, and always will be. There is no meaning in having separate provinces, if there were no  differences,  though healthy, between them. But our provincialism must never be narrow or exclusive. It should be conducive to the interest of the whole country of which the provinces are but parts. They may be likened to tribu- taries of a mighty river. The tributaries promote its mightiness. Their strength and purity will be reflected in the majestic stream. It must be thus with the provinces. Everything that the provinces do must be for the glory of the whole. If the great contribution of Rabindranath glorifies Bengal, it glorifies also India. Does not his influence pervade the whole of India? Dadabhai lived not merely for the Parsis, not merely for Bombay, but for the whole of India. There is no room for exclusiveness or jealousy between province and province, unless India is to be dismembered into warring countries each living for itself and if possible at the expense of the rest. The Congress will have lived in vain if such a calamity descends upon the country. Every attempt at dividing India into watertight compartments must be resisted. India’s destiny is to become a strong, independent nation making her unique contribution to the world’s progress. Our patriotism is at no stage exclusive. We do not desire prosperity at the expense of the other nations of the earth. A time must come when we will be able to say, ‘We are no less citizens of the world than we are citizens of India’. But the time will never come unless we know the art of being citizens of an independent India. We cannot learn the art if we develop poisonous provincialisms. The right national life has to begin with the individual. I wish to be strong and free so that not only I but my neighbour also may benefit by my strength and freedom. We as individuals or provinces must bring our best fruit to the altar of the motherland.

 ABBOTTABAD,

 Some women are inundating me with wires and letters about the hunger-striking prisoners in Bengal. One telegram peremptorily asks me to discharge my responsibility by myself joining the hunger- strike. Another lays the whole burden on my shoulders of leading the agitation on the ground that the prisoners had suspended their hun- ger-strike on my assurance. I have returned suitable replies where necessary, but the matter is too important to be disposed of by per- sonal replies. I fear my fair correspondents are damaging the cause they represent by expecting me to do what I cannot do. They are damaging it also by encouraging hunger-strikers. I have no doubt that the hunger-strike is wrong. No person should free himself from prison by refusing to take food. The women who are corresponding with me, and others who are agitating for their release, should per- suade the hunger-strikers to give up their fast. The  exercise  of pressure of public opinion is a legitimate method and if it is wisely applied, it will become quite effective. No government nowadays can afford to be indifferent to popular opinion. Therefore, I implore those who are organizing public opinion to persuade the hunger-strikers to give up the hunger-strike, and not to mislead the public by expecting me to do the impossible.
 At the same time I would urge the Bengal Government to put an end to this particular agitation by releasing the prisoners although, as I have admitted, the prisoners have put themselves in the wrong by resorting to hunger-strike. The release is long overdue. Rightly or wrongly, and I think rightly, the public had expected their release on the transfer of power to a responsible legislature. That expectation should have been fulfilled long ago. The Government will lose
 
 nothing and will certainly gain much by yielding to popular pressure in this matter of release of political prisoners.libtech_217_footnote

You have forgotten to 	answer my question about separate electorateslibtech_239_footnotefor Harijans.  	I have now carefully gone through your scheme and your remarks upon 	my draftlibtech_240_footnoteabout 	Hindu-Muslim unity.  	The scheme is too complicated for me to form an opinion. I must own 	to you that I never studied the Government of India Act in the 	manner required for a proper evaluation of your scheme which I see 	is designed, so far as the Federal structure is concerned, to 	replace the Act.  	I see that you contemplate zonal legislatures in between the 	provincial ones and the Federal legislature. The Government of India 	scheme itself is much too expensive and complicated for me. Yours 	seems to add to the expense and the complication.  	Then you suggest that the composition of the army should not be 	disturbed except under the contingency mentioned therein. For an      
 out and out believer in non-violence like me, I would disband the army altogether. An army and non-violence go ill together. But I am painfully conscious that in this extreme view of non-violence I have no partner. How far those who believe in the necessity of the country having an army even after it has come to its own will accept your proposition is more than I can say.
Then you have enunciated Dominion Status as an accepted fact.
It is a bitter pill for Congressmen to swallow.
 But I see that your solution of the communal tangle is your scheme including the proposal about the army. Yours is the only proposal of a constructive character on behalf of the league. I con- gratulate you on the great pains you have bestowed upon it. I am glad that you have decided to publish it in full.libtech_241_footnoteI must thank   you for having taken me into your confidence and asked me to give you my opinion upon it.
 As to my draft solution, as I have already told you, it is in no sense adopted by the Working Committee. But it does still represent my views. I prize your criticism upon it. And if it ever formed a basis for the solution of our difficulties, I should adopt many of your suggestions.
 Your solution for representation of minorities on services causes difficulty. What are the minorities? Is there a final list? I am therefore very uneasy about communal representation in the services. If we make much of the minorities question in the services, we shall not only endanger efficiency but we shall endanger purity and impar- tiality in the administration of affairs of the country. But I heartily en- dorse your suggestion that all the backward members of the nation should be levelled up to the forward ones.
 I do not want to burden this letter with the other points arising out of your criticism. They are easy of adjustment, If we all make up our minds to meet with the determination not to part without reaching  a settlement.
 Yours sincerely,
 SIR SIKANDAR HYAT KHAN PRIME MINISTER

         	Dr. Lohia has sent me a long, well-reasoned letter on the current 	controversy on the Congress resolutionlibtech_257_footnoteon  Satyagraha.  There  is  a portion in it which 	demands public discussion. Here it is:  You 	will not permit 	the slightest 	separation of 	the principle of 	Satyagraha from 	your own specific 	programme. Is it not 	possible  to 	universalize the 	principles of 	Satyagraha, to 	make it the bed-rock of programmes 	other than your own? Perhaps, it 	is not; but 	I have 	this argument against 	you that 	you have 	not permitted 	and encouraged 	any such 	experiment. The 	people today do 	not regard your own 	programme of 	ministerial action and 	constructive activities 	as wholly 	adequate; they are 	experimenting with 	such programmes 	as those 	of peasant 	action. These newer 	programmes entail 	an amount 	of local 	and isolated action even 	during such 	times when there is no 	general satyagraha. Will 	you stop these little 	satyagrahas till you have 	found the 	formula for 	a general 	satyagraha? In such 	a course 	of action 	there is 	the danger 	of anarchy 	that arises 	out of suppression. 	Non-violent collective 	 action is 	among the 	rarest and 	most precious gifts 	received by mankind 	in all 	history; we may not, however, know how to treasure it and continue it.  	Not only have I not prohibited separation of the principle of 	Satyagraha from my own specific programme, I have often invited new 	programmes. But hitherto I have not known a single case of any new 	programme. I have never suggested that there can never be any 	departure from or addition to my programme. What, however, I have       
 said and would like to repeat here is that I cannot bless or encourage a new programme that makes no appeal to me. My programme, I claim, is a deduction from the satyagraha of my conception. It is, therefore, likely that if there was any such vital activity favouring the growth of satyagraha, it would not escape me.
 I am painfully conscious of the fact that my programme has not made a general appeal to the Congress intelligentsia. I have already pointed out that the reason for the apathy of Congressmen is not to be sought in any inherent defect in the programme, but that it is due to the want of a living faith in ahimsa. What can be more patent than that we should have complete communal harmony, eradication of untou- chability, sacrifice of the drink revenue by the closing of liquor-shops and the replacement of mill-cloth by khadi? I suggest that non-vio- lent Swaraj is impossible if Hindus, Muslims and others do not shed their mutual distrust and do not live as blood brothers, if Hindus do not purify themselves by removing the curse of untouchability and thus establish intimate contact with those whom they have for ages put beyond the pale of society, if the wealthy men and women of India will not tax themselves so that the poor who are helpless victims of the drink and drug habit may have the temptation removed from them by the closing of drink and drug shops, and, lastly, if we all will not identify ourselves with the semi-starved millions by giving up the taste for mill-cloth and revert to khadi produced by the many million  hands in the cottages of India. In all that has been written against the constructive programme, I have not come across a single convincing argument against either its intrinsic merit or its merit in terms of non- violent Swaraj. I make bold to say that if all Congressmen concentrate themselves on this constructive programme, we shall soon have the requisite non-violent atmosphere throughout the length and breadth of the land for cent-per-cent satyagraha.
 Take the peasant action suggested by Dr. Lohia as a possible new programme. I regret to have to say that in most cases the pea- sants are not being educated for non-violent action. They are being kept in a state of perpetual excitement and made to entertain hopes which can never be fulfilled without a violent conflict. The same may safely be said about labour. My own experience tells me that both the peasantry and labour can be organized for effective  non-violent action, if Congressmen honestly work for it. But they cannot, if they have no faith in the ultimate success of non-violent action. All that is required is the proper education of the peasantry and labour. They
 need to be informed that if they are properly organized they have more wealth and resources through their labour than the capitalists through their money. Only capitalists have control over the money market, labour has not over its labour market, although if labour had been well served by its chosen leaders it would have become conscious of the irresistible power that comes from proper instruction in non- violence. Instead, labour in many cases is being taught to rely on coercive methods to compel compliance with its demands. The kind of training that labour generally receives today leaves it in ignorance, and relies upon violence as the ultimate sanction. Thus it is not possible for me to regard the present peasant or labour activity as a new programme for the preparation of Satyagraha.
 Indeed what I see around me is not preparation for a non-vio- lent campaign but for an outbreak of violence, however unconscious or unintended it may be. If I was invited to hold myself responsible for this ending to the past twenty years’ effort, I should have no hesitation in pleading guilty. Have I not said as much already in these columns? But my admission will not take us anywhere, unless it results in the retracing of our steps, the undoing of the wrong already done. This means having a reasoned faith in the non-violent method as the only means of gaining complete independence. When we have that faith, all bickerings within the Congress will cease, there will be no longer an ungainly scramble for power, and there will be mutual help instead of mutual mud-flinging. But it may be that Congressmen have come to believe that non-violence of my definition is played out or is not possible of attainment. In that case there should be a conference, formal or informal between all Congress groups or a special meeting of the A. I. C. C. to consider the question whether time has not come to revise the policy of non-violence and the consequent constructive programme, and to find out and frame a programme in consonance with and answering the present temper of Congressmen. It is up to every Congressman to carry on a fierce search inward and deal with this central problem. It is not safe or dignified for the Congress to follow the policy of drift. I would like such a meeting to forget that the members belong to different groups and to remember that they are first and last servants of the nation pledged to fight the nation’s battle of freedom with one mind. The Congress today is a house divided against itself. It must not be.

193,"July 20, 1939",MINORITY ADMINISTRATION,"
    
 The Chief of Chamba is a minor. The State is therefore under direct British administration. And the administrator acts virtually as the Chief and exercises all his powers. A correspondent from Chamba writes :
 Ours is a minority-administered State being directly under the control of
 the
 Paramount Power. We have been pressing for the repeal of the liberty- penalizing laws which have been enforced during the minority administration, and we do wish that popular element be introduced in the temporary administrative council at least during the minority of the Raja libtech_265_footnoteIn a case
 like ours the Paramount Power cannot say that it can’t intervene. If it has to safeguard the rights of the Ruler, has it not any liability towards the people ?.
 . . libtech_266_footnoteWill you throw some light on the question?
 The question is pertinent. There is no reason whatsoever why the people of administered States should not enjoy all the liberty that those  in   British   India  enjoy.  Indeed   a   wise  and   liberal-minded
administrator of a State has within his jurisdiction greater opportunity
 for doing good than one in British India proper. A State administrator has much greater latitude than an official working under the routine of a Province. The latter is subject to a series of superiors and has only limited powers. An administrator of a State is much more than a Governor in his own little State. He is subject only to general super- vision of the Resident of the Agency to which his State belongs. Therefore there is no excuse whatsoever for any misrule or failure of justice in administered States, if the Paramount Power’s policy is declared in unambiguous terms and followed in its entirety. But if the administration is not all it should be, it shows that there is no well- defined policy of the Paramount Power so far as the people of the States are concerned. There is no insistence on the right being done by the States towards their people. There should be no such thing as policy of non-interference by the Paramount Power in so far as the elementary rights of the people are concerned. The policy of non- interference can remain unchallenged only so long as  the  States people are ignorant of their strength. But there is nowadays too much consciousness among the people of the States to permit of the policy
 
 
 of non-interference being successful any longer. Denial of justice in administered States should be unthinkable. Let the people of Chamba publish unvarnished facts about the state of things there. I have little doubt that if there is any unjustice done there, force of public opinion will secure the needed redress.
 Absence of declared policy by the Paramount Power about the rights of the people of the States is perhaps glaringly demonstrated by the happenings in the little hill State of Dhami. The shooting that took place there would have been impossible if the policy of the Paramount Power was known. The communique issued by the Political Agent should not be the last word on the tragedy. He had no material before him to enable him to form a correct judgment. Every such firing should be followed up by an open, quick, judicial inquiry. The Chiefs who get easily frightened and resort to firing ought not to possess the power they have today over the lives of their subjects. But the public who have to form an opinion do not have a fair chance of doing so. They cannot set up an authoritative inquiry. And a Political Agent’s communique is no true guide. Take the Dhami communique. I need not challenge the statements made in it. For aught I know every word in it may be true. But it cannot command implicit confidence. In its very nature, it is a one-sided document. The Political Agent can produce no legal proof in support of his statements. He does not give the sources of his information. To inspire confidence there should be a judicial enquiry carrying necessary consequences for the wrongdoer or doers whether the wrong done is on the part of the State or the people. Thus, if the people sought to overwhelm the Rana, it was undoubtedly wrong as it was if there was defiance of the order against Shri Bhagmal. It was wrong too if outsiders joined the alleged demonstration. The lightning ultimatum, if it was that, was a prepost- erous thing deserving severe condemnation. Responsible  government is made of sterner stuff. If the principality consists of only 5,000 persons and the revenue is Rs. 30,000, responsible government is a meaningless term. If people in every principality will take the law into their own hands, they will do irreparable damage to the cause. The All-India States Conference is there to guide them. Every  Praja Mandal should put itself under its guidance in order to enable it to frame its case for freedom. There seems to be little doubt that there has been undue haste on the people’s side.
 But what about the Rana? Has he been dealing justly by his people? Was he really in danger of his life to warrant firing in self-
 defence? Every crowd is not necessarily a hostile crowd. Firing ought not to be treated lightly. Human life should have the same value in a State as in British India. Every firing should be followed by the closest scrutiny and by suitable action both of a punitive and of a preventive character. It is the duty of the Paramount Power to deprive Chiefs of powers of which they do not know judicious use. The whole question regarding the place of the States in Greater India requires over- hauling.
 A new epoch has come replacing the old. With the change of the times there must be a change in the manners of all parties—the Paramount Power, the Princes, their people, and last but not least the Congress if it survives the internal crisis that has overtaken it. It will be  a mistake for the Paramount Power or the Princes to ignore the Congress, a body under whose shadow the people of the States from the commencement have been accustomed to grow and flourish. The Congress must guide them. Any resenting by the Princes or the Paramount Power of guidance of the people by the Congress must result in an inevitable but wholly unnecessary clash. How can people who are one in blood and bound together by the closest social and economic ties be artificially kept apart for any length of time? Instead of suspecting or fearing the Congress, surely the proper thing for all concerned is to welcome the Congress aid whenever it is available for the common good of both the Princes and the people.
 No doubt the Congress will have to recognize its own limita- tions. It can hope to work with effect only if its work is of a friendly and peaceful nature. It has to hold the scales evenly between parties. It must avoid all show of force or coercion. Thus the reported participation by non-Dhami-ites in the demonstration should have been impossible under the Congress aegis. The Congress influence can be effectively exercised only if it retains its non-violence. Its only capital is its moral authority. Any other position must lead to inter- necine feud and bloodshed. Dhami has a lesson which Congressmen have to take to heart. This I say quite apart from the admitted fact that we do not yet know exactly what happened and where the blame actually lay. In the absence of a proper judicial inquiry, right action becomes impossible.

 HOW TO ATTAIN TRUTH
 Lab Bibando, Chashma Bando, Gosh Band Gar Nabini Sirre Haq, Bar Ma Bikhand
 Keep your lips, eyes and ears closed and laugh at me then if you do not reach the heart of Truth.
 This is a couplet by Maulana Rumi. Off and on Chaman Kavi of Kutch sends me such valuable verses. When I was at Rajkot, he sent me the above verse along with its meaning. I liked it so much that I wanted to place it before the readers of Harijanbandhu. At times when we talk nonsense, listen to falsehood or filth and look at objec- tionable things, this couplet ought to pierce our heart like a pointed arrow. The quest for Truth demands a heavy price. We may not actually close our lips, ears and eyes although we would lose nothing by closing them. We can, however, certainly do this much. Instead of uttering false or bitter words or hearing defamatory or useless things or watching lustful scenes, we may speak the truth at all costs, chant the name of God, hear His songs, observe the magic of His creation, have darshan of the saints and hear only such things as will help our progress. It is only he who does this that will attain the Truth. He alone can be a true satyagrahi and through his tapascharya we can get  a glimpse of peaceful Swaraj. The rest is all in vain.

  	Friends have been urging me to write to you for the sake of 	humanity. But I have resisted their request, because of the feeling 	that any letter from me would be an impertinence. Something tells me 	that  I must not calculate and that I must make my appeal for 	whatever it may be worth.  	It is quite clear that you are today the one person in the world who 	can prevent a war which may reduce humanity to the savage state.      the 	Congress and 	the country generally and 	particularly owing to 	non-achievement of 	Hindu-Muslim unity, you 	do not 	feel justified in 	advising the 	Congress to 	start mass 	civil disobedience for 	exercising pressure on 	the Government 	to modify 	the present 	Federation according to your wishes         and yet the Congress is not prepared to  accept 	this Federation. 	The Government 	on the 	other hand 	not being pressed 	or coerced to 	modify the 	Federation according to 	your wishes will remain 	indifferent in the 	matter, though it 	may be 	tempted to 	modify it 	to suit the 	conveniences of 	the Muslim 	League. The result 	will be that 	the Muslim 	communalism will be still 	further strengthened and the hope for Hindu-Muslim unity will disappear for ever        Will it  not 	be wise to accept the present Federation in spite of all its defects 	and use it as a jumping-ground for further quarrels and gains ?. ”  
 Must you pay that price for an object however worthy it may appear to you to be? Will you listen to the appeal of one who has deliberately shunned the method of war not without considerable success? Anyway I anticipate your forgiveness, if I have erred in writing to you.libtech_275_footnote

I had thought I had sufficiently identified myself 	with your province to be entitled to be regarded as one of you and 	therefore above the need of such formalities as the presentation of 	an address. Should I suppose that I have still to win my spurs? Last 	time you gave me an address and a purse. But this time you 	have given me only an address and no purse. May I 	inquire how I have merited this ‘fall  from  grace’?  	I have more than once heard the complaint that the establish- ment 	of Hindu-Muslim unity is being delayed owing to lack of sufficient 	effort in its behalf on my part, that if only I would concentrate 	myself on it exclusively it could be realized today. May I assure 	you that if I do not seem to be doing that today, it is not 	because my passion for Hindu-Muslim unity has grown less. But I have 	realized, as I had never done before, my own imperfection as an 	instrument for this high mission and the inadequacy of mere external 	means for the attainment of big objects. I have learnt more and more 	to resign myself utterly to His grace.     
 If you could dissect my heart, you would find that the prayer and spiritual striving for the attainment of Hindu-Muslim unity goes on there unceasingly all the twenty-four hours without even a moment’s interruption, whether I am awake or asleep. I want Hindu- Muslim unity if only because I know that without it there can be no Swaraj. Let no one imagine that because the Hindus constitute the majority community they can win Swaraj for India or even for them- selves by organizing civil disobedience without the backing or support of the other communities. Civil disobedience of the purest type, as I have often repeated, can be effective even if it is confined to a few. But then these few must represent in their persons the united will and strength of the whole nation. Is it not the same in armed warfare? The fighting forces need the backing and co-operation of the entire civil population. Without it they would be crippled. I must be impatient for Hindu-Muslim unity because I am impatient for Swaraj. And I have full faith that true and lasting heart-unity between the Hindus and Mussalmans, not a merely patched-up political compromise, will come sooner or later, sooner perhaps than later. That dream has filled my being since my earliest childhood. I have the vividest recollection of my father’s days, how the Hindus and Mussalmans of Rajkot used to mix together and participate in one another’s domestic functions and ceremonies like blood brothers. I believe that those days will dawn once again over this country. The present bickerings and petty recriminations between the communities are an unnatural aberration. They cannot last for ever.
 The greatest of things in this world are accomplished not through unaided human effort. They come in their own good time. God has his own way of choosing his instruments. Who knows, in spite of my incessant heart-prayer I may not be found worthy for this great work. We must all keep our loins girt and our lamps well trimmed; we do not know when or on whom his choice may fall. You may not shirk your responsibility by shoving it all on me. Pray for me that my dream may be fulfilled in my lifetime. We must never give way to despair or pessimism. God’s ways are more than man’s arithmetic.
 It has grieved me to find that internal squabbles have begun to fill the Congress ranks in this province too. Yesterday I was closeted for over an hour with the members of your Provincial Congress Committee. They asked me to show them a way out. I suggest to you that the solution lies in your own hands. You have adopted Khan Saheb Abdul Ghaffar Khan as your uncrowned chieftain. You have
 given him the proud titles of ‘Badshah Khan’ and ‘Fakhr-e-Afghan’. Let his word be law to you as it was before. He does not believe in argument. He speaks from his heart. You must learn to sink your individual differences and work together like a team under him if the titles that you have bestowed upon him are to be vindicated, and not remain as mere lip compliments.
 Then there is the question of poverty among the Frontier masses. I am told that many of them hardly get enough to eat. It is a humiliating reflection that a sturdy race like the Pathans should be in that plight. But here again the remedy lies largely with you. You must teach the people to work with their hands and realize the dignity of labour. The Ministry can and will, of course, provide facilities. But the spade-work will have to be done by volunteers.
 May God show you the right way. I know that even when we quarrel amongst ourselves it is only to hasten the advent of indepen- dence in the fond hope that independence will prove a solvent of all our ills. May our passion for independence prove a uniting bond stronger than all the differences that divide us.

In the presence of God, there can be 	no sin, no sorrow, no anger, no malice, no falsehood. In His 	presence there is no fear, no external affliction can put us out.

213,"July 26, 1939",DISCUSSION WITH CHARLES FABRI libtech_286_footnote,"
    
 ABBOTTABAD,
 [On or before July 26, 1939]libtech_287_footnote
 GANDHIJI: It is a difficult thing to explain fully what I do when  I pray. But I must try to answer your question. The Divine Mind is un-changeable, but that Divinity is in everyone and everything— animate and inanimate. The meaning of prayer is that I want to evoke that Divinity within me. Now I may have that intellectual conviction, but not a living touch. And so when I pray for Swaraj or indepen- dence for India I pray or wish for adequate power to gain that Swaraj or to make the largest contribution I can towards winning it, and I maintain that I can get that power in answer to prayer.
 FABRI: Then you are not justified in calling it prayer. To pray means to beg or demand.
Yes, indeed. You may say I beg it of myself, of my Higher Self,
 the Real Self with which I have not yet achieved complete identifi- cation. You may therefore describe it as a continual longing to lose oneself in the Divinity which comprises all.
 And you use an old form to evoke this?
 I do. The habit of a lifetime persists, and I would allow it to be said that I pray to an outside Power. I am part of that Infinite, and yet such an infinitesimal part that I feel outside it. Though I give you the intellectual explanation, I feel, without identification with the Divinity, so small that I am nothing. Immediately I begin to say I do this thing and that thing, I begin to feel my unworthiness and nothingness, and feel that someone else, some Higher Power, has to help me.
 Tolstoy says the same thing. Prayer really is complete meditation and melting into the Higher Self, though one occasionally does lapse in imploration like that of a child to his father.
 
 form and content of prayer and would very much like to know what kind of prayer Gandhiji said. Could the Divine Mind be changed by prayer? Could one find it out by prayer?”
 Pardon me, I would not call it a lapse. It is more in the fitness of things to say that I pray to God who exists somewhere up in the clouds, and the more distant He is, the greater is my longing for Him and [I] find myself in His presence in thought. And thought as you know has a greater velocity than light. Therefore the distance between me and Him, though so incalculably great, is obliterated. He is so far and yet so near.
 It becomes a matter of belief, but some people like me are cursed with an acute critical faculty. For me there is nothing higher than what Buddha taught, and no great master. For Buddha alone among the teachers of the world said: ‘Don’t believe implicitly what I say. Don’t accept any dogma or any book as infallible.’ There is for me no infallible book in the world, inasmuch as all were made by men, however inspired they may have been. I cannot hence believe in a personal idea of God, a Maharaja sitting on the Great White Throne listening to our prayers. I am glad that your prayer is on different level.
Let me remind you that you are again only partially true when
 you say my prayer is on a different level. I told you that the intellec- tual conviction that I gave you is not eternally present with me. What is present is the intensity of faith whereby I lose myself in an Invisible Power. And so it is far truer to say that God has done a thing for me than that I did it. So many things have happened in my life for which   I had intense longing, but which I could never have achieved myself. And I have always said to my co-workers it was in answer to my prayer. I did not say to them it was in answer to my intellectual effort to lose myself in the Divinity in me! The easiest and the correct thing for me was to say, ‘God has seen me through my difficulty.’
 But that you deserved by your karma. God is Justice and not Mercy. You are a good man and good things happen to you.
No fear. I am not good enough for things to happen like that. If
 I went about with that philosophical conception of karma, I should often come a cropper. My karma would not come to my help. Although I believe in the inexorable law of karma I am striving to do so many things; every moment of my life is a strenuous endeavour which is an attempt to build up more karma, to undo the past and add to the present. It is therefore wrong to say that because my past is good, good is happening at present. The past would be soon ex- hausted, and I have to build up the future with prayer. I tell you karma alone is powerless. ‘Ignite this match,’ I say to myself, and yet I cannot if there is no co-operation from without. Before I strike the
 match my hand is paralysed or I have only one match and the wind blows it off. Is it an accident or God or Higher Power? Well, I prefer to use the language of my ancestors or of children. I am no better than a child. We may try to talk learnedly and of books, but when it comes to brass tacks—when we are face to face with a calamity—we behave like children and begin to cry and pray and our intellectual belief gives no satisfaction!
 I know, very highly developed men to whom belief in God gives incredible comfort and help in the building of character. But there, are some great spirits that can do without it. That is what Buddhism has taught me.
But Buddhism is one long prayer.
 Buddha asked everyone to find salvation from himself. He never prayed, he meditated.
Call it by whatever name you like, it is the same thing. Look at
his statues.
 But they are not true to life. They are 400 years later than his death.   Well,   give me your own history of Buddha as you may have discovered it. I will prove that he was a praying Buddha. The intellectual conception does not satisfy me. I have not given you a perfect and full definition as you cannot describe your own thought. The very effort to describe is a limitation. It defies analysis and you have nothing but scepticism as the residue.
 What about the people who cannot pray?
 ‘Be humble,’ I would say to them,‘and do not limit even the real Buddha by your own conception of Buddha.’ He could not have ruled the lives of millions of men that he did and does today if he was not humble enough to pray. There is something infinitely higher than intellect that rules us and even the sceptics. Their scepticism and philosophy does not help them in critical periods of their lives. They need something better, something outside them that can sustain them. And so if someone puts a conundrum before me, I say to him,‘You are not going to know the meaning of God or prayer unless you reduce yourself to a cipher. You must be humble enough to see that in spite of your greatness and gigantic intellect you are but a speck in the universe. A merely intellectual conception of the things of life is not enough. It is the spiritual conception which eludes the intellect, and which alone can give one satisfaction. Even monied men have critical periods in their lives; though they are surrounded by every- thing that money can buy and affection can give, they find at certain
 moments in their lives utterly distracted. It is in these moments that we have a glimpse of God, a vision of Him who is guiding every one of our steps in life. It is prayer.’
 You mean what we might call a true religious experience which is stronger than intellectual conception. Twice in life I had that experience, but I have since lost it. But I now find great comfort in one or two sayings of Buddha: ‘Selfishness is the cause of sorrow.’ ‘Remember, monks, everything is fleeting.’ To think of these takes almost the place of belief.
That is prayer.
 What would you say to the right of man to dispose of his life? Life as life I hold of very little importance.
I think that man has a perfect right to dispose of his life under
 certain circumstances. A co-workerlibtech_288_footnote, suffering from leprosy, knowing that his life was as much an agony for those who had to serve him as it was for him, recently decided to end his life abstaining from food and water. I blessed the idea. I said to him: ‘If you really think you can stand the trial you may do so.’ I said this to him for I knew how different it is to die by inches from, say, suddenly killing oneself by drowning or poisoning. And my warning was fully justified, for some- one tempted him with the hope that there was one who could cure leprosy, and I now hear that he has resumed eating and put himself under his treatment!
 The criticism seems to me to be that if one’s mind is completely obscured by pain, the best thing for him would be to seek nirvana. A man may not be ill but he may be tired of the struggle.
No, no. My mind rejects this suicide. The criterion is not that
 one is tired of life, but that one feels that one has become a burden on others and therefore wants to leave the world. One does not want to fly from pain but from having to become an utter burden on others. Otherwise one suffers greater pain in a violent effort to end one’s agony. But supposing I have a cancer, and it is only a question of time for me to pass away, I would even ask my doctor to give me a sleeping draught and thereby have the sleep that knows no waking libtech_289_footnote
 Now according to you I should have no business to stay if I feel  I have finished my task. And I do think I have finished mine!
 
 No. I am convinced that you can serve humanity for many years. Millions are praying for your life. And though I can neither pray nor desire anything—
Yes, the English language is so elastic that you can find another
 word to say the same thing.
 Yes, I can unselfishly opine that you have many years before you.
 Well, that’s it. You have found the word! Here too let me tell you there is the purely intellectual conception of a man being unable to live. If he has not the desire to live, the body will perish for the mere absence of the desire to live.

But the fact that they have won the 	certificates throws a good deal of responsibility on their as well 	as my shoulders—mine because my blessings, which are being given 	from the depth of my heart, must bear fruit. That only time can 	show. Shri Viyogi Hari will have to maintain contact with the boys 	who are going out today. It will have to be a contact as close as 	that between parents and  children.  The parents’ interest in the 	children is all the more when the children go away from them for 	work in distant places. He will keep me informed of your progress.    
 The responsibility will be no less yours to be worthy of the training you have received, of the clean life you have lived, and of the uplifting contacts you have formed here. My blessings will be no use if you will not fulfil your trust. Your responsibility is enhanced by the fact that you will go out as representatives of Harijans and you will have to reflect in your life there the life you have lived here. Your contribution to the destruction of untouchability will be in proportion to the cleanness and purity of the life you live and the service you will render to your community. Hinduism, you will remember, cannot live if untouchability remains, and you will have to make yourselves volunteer workers in the sacred cause.
 Shri Viyogi Hari said that it was difficult to make the tailoring department self-supporting. There must then be  something  wrong with the training given. Every craft is being taught, or ought to be taught, on a self-supporting basis. You students ought to ascertain from time to time from Viyogiji whether the work you turn out is paying enough and if not where in lies the defect. Only then will you be able to make your school an ideal industrial school. If you pay for your training through your work, you will never have difficulty in after life in earning your bread.
 Those who leave the institution ought to get work wherever they go; and if those who are fully qualified fail to get work, it is the duty of the industrial school to find work for them. Let no one think that they get here an inferior kind of training fit only for the poorest people. The training they receive is in my opinion superior to what the most well-to-do boys receive elsewhere. It will depend on you to show by the work you do that it is in no way inferior to similar training imparted by any other institution. It is my firm opinion that useful as the other activities of the Harijan Sevak Sangh are, its educational activity in a home like this is the most useful. For if this institution throws up even a few boys of sterling worth who would give themselves to the service of the Harijans, they will solve the pro- blem of untouchability in a most substantial manner.
 May you live straight and clean lives, and thus be the representa- tives not only of the Harijans but of the millions of non-Harijans who want to serve the Harijans.

220,,SUMMARY OF INDUSTRIAL SURVEY COMMITTEE REPORTlibtech_297_footnote,"
    
 An Industrial Survey Committee was appointed by the Central Provinces Government on 15th December last on the following terms :
    To 			review the work done in the province by the Department of 			Industries since its establishment.  To 			supervise the 			collection of 			data relating to 			large, small and 			especially cottage 			industries from 			previous publications 			and reports 			by an 			officer appointed for 			the purpose.  To 			advise the 			officer-in-charge as 			regards the 			lines on 			which the 			industrial survey 			of the 			province should 			be undertaken 			and to 			review its progress 			from time to time.  To 			visit typical villages, 			study their economic condition and 			examine the 			possibility of 			reviving cottage 			industries, and 			in doing 			so to take 			the advice 			and guidance 			of the 			All-India Spinners’ 			Association and the 			All-India Village 			Industries Association.  To 			report on 			the industrial 			possibilities of the 			raw materials available 			in the province, with special reference to the forest and mineral resources.  To 			report on 			the measures 			which Government 			can undertake 			to pro- 			mote industrial 			development within the 			province, especially of 			cottage indus- 			tries in the 			villages, and 			to suggest 			methods for financing 			the same or 			other- wise promoting them.   
 The Committee consists of the following ten members : Chairman: Shri J. C. Kumarappa, Wardha.
 Members: Shri Chaturbhujbhai Jasani, M. L. A, Gondia; Shri V. V. Subhedar,
 M. L. A., Saugar; Shri K. P. Ghaira, General Manager, Central Provinces Syndicate, Limited, Nagpur; Shri R. N. Jha, Secretary, Berar Chamber of Commerce, Akola; Shri K. P. Sagreiya, I. F. S., Sylviculturist, Central Provinces and Berar; Dr. A. N. Kapanna, Demonstrator of Chemistry, College of Science, Nagpur; Shri Walter Dutt, Bar-at-Law, Nagpur; the Director of Industries, Central Provinces and Berar; Dr. R. S. Thakur, Officer on Special Duty in connectio with Laxminarayan Institute of Technology, Nagpur University, Nagpur. He will also act as Secretary to the Committee.
 The Committee is empowered to appoint sub-committees and to co-opt
 
 members for specific purposes.
 To this number the following two more were added under the Gazette Notification of Resolution No. 175-89-A-VII, dated the 12th January, 1939:
 Shrimati Sarahamma Ittyerah, M. A . Wardha (late Professor of Economics, Lahore); Shri E. R. Mahajani, Managing Director, Shri Laxmi Oil Mills Company, Limited, Akola.
The Proceedings of the Committee were inaugurated on 15th
 January last. The survey began on 21st January and was finished on 6th February. 207 students including eight women volunteered their services. 14 persons were co-opted to lead the survey party. The party was divided into groups of 10 students each. It surveyed 606 villages covering a population of 15 lakhs paying an annual revenue of over 11 lakhs. The survey cost was Rs. 3,000 in round numbers, i.e., Rs. 5 per village. The whole expense amounted to one tenth of the esti- mates.
 The report covers 46 pages of hand-made paper, foolscap size. The party travelled third class, but when some members saw dur-
ing their survey that old women were picking grass seeds for food
 they declined to draw even the third-class fare. The party satisfied it- self with such lodgings and food as the villagers had. Nothing was specially prepared for them.
Prof. Kumarappa says to me in a covering note :
  Ours 	is not 	an academic 	survey where mathematical 	accuracy is the 	one goal.  Neither 	is it a 	propagandic survey to 	gather ‘evidence’ to 	prove pre- 	conceived theories.  Nor 	is it a 	clinical survey to 	further the 	knowledge of 	the science 	of economics.  It 	is a diagnostic 	survey done in 	a short 	time with the set purpose 	of saving the 	patient’s life 	by a 	suitable prescription, 	and this is 	national plan- 	ning—not planning for 	a whole 	country as 	such, but planning 	the economic 	activity of 	each individual 	in relation 	to the 	raw material available 	within the field 	of our operations. 
 One member of the staff, an M. A. in economics, argued that without detailed statistics it would be impossible to prove whether the villagers are poor and are getting poorer. I took him with me into the villages, showed him the houses in disrepair and one three-storeyed house, half fallen down, and the goldsmiths sitting idle.
 This is no doubt a rough and ready argument. But if most of our villages contain ruins of well-built houses and artisans without occupation, surely the evidence of poverty is more complete and con- vincing than cold statistics which may prove everything or nothing.
 The report which is Part I of Vol. 1 (Vol. 2 and Part II are to follow) contains six chapters and three short dissenting notes by Drs. Thakur and Kapanna and Shri Sagreiya. The dissenters chiefly emphasize the necessity of industrialization though they acknowledge that village industries need the help recommended by the main report.
 Chapter two dealing with “General Considerations” stamps the report as an original document and shows that it is not to be pigeon- holed as most such reports are but should be given effect to without delay. The only way to do so is, as pointed out in the report, to invite the A. I. S. A. and the A. I. V. I. A. to help the Government to carry out the recommendations.
 I  give  below  a  full   summarylibtech_298_footnoteof   the   chapter   on   “General Considerations”. . . .
 The reader might have thought that my examination of the Kumarappa Committee’s report on the Industrial Survey of the Cen- tral provinces was concluded. The fact is that constant travelling and preoccupations disabled me from pursuing the examination with the regularity I had intended. The long journey to the Frontier Province has provided the opportunity to continue and finish the examination.
 The last instalment brought up the examination to the chap-ter two. The third is no less important. The survey of 606 villages revealed to the Committee the painful fact that the average income of the villager per head was no more than Rs. 12. This need not startle the arm-chair scientist who relies for his figures on books, and who has been taught to believe that it is anything between Rs. 60 to Rs. 80. Both are right from their own standpoints and data. The figure of 65 to 80 is an all-India average which includes the income of million- aires, middlemen and zamindars. The figure has a purpose of its own. But for the Kumarappa Committee the figure 65 would be wholly
 
 false. The figure 12 is accurate and truly scientific. That Committee was concerned with the average income of the villagers only. The Committee says :
 Our survey showed that most of the industries are tottering. There are hardly any which can be said to be even in a normal state. The taxable capacity of the people is rapidly going down and if the matter is not taken in hand immediately, the time is fast approaching when the Government will get nothing from the people . . . .
The meagreness of the income shows itself in the diet of the
people. Thus the report says.
 . . . Their food is largely rice or some other grain, sometimes taken as gruel to fill themselves up with water, but the tragedy of the situation is that even this little amount of rice that is available to them is polished rice making their diet even worse. They hardly get the chaff. This makes its incumbent on the Government to see that at least the rice is given to the poor people has all its nutritive elements left in it. . .
There are other valuable hints on the subject of diet for which I
must refer the reader to the original.
 There is a brief reference to agriculture. Here is an excerpt from it :
 . . . We have, in a way, already touched upon the question of payment of revenues. In addition to this, the land tenure appears to us to require careful examination.	A great deal of harm has been done and is being done
 because of the unscientific dues taken without careful planning. During our survey we found that very little attention is being paid to renew the fertility of the soil. . . . . It is time that the Agricultural Department took this function of re-fertilizing the soil on its own shoulders and supplied to the farmers manure from various depots in the villages at the proper season, getting back their return at the time of their harvest. Manufacture of artificial fertilizers should form a key industry. Seeds also may be given out . . . .
 On the methods of production the Committee says:
 . . . large-scale organized industries are rendered various services and are granted concessions by the Government which enable them  to  produce cheaply, while village and cottage units hardly get even the recognition of their existence, not  to  mention services   and  concessions.   Cottage and
 village industries, as long as their natural tendency is to distribute wealth, have a definite unchallengeable place in the economy of a nation and more especially in that of our country. A careful examination will reveal that any cheapness in production in large-scale industries or any economies that may  be  effected are not necessarily inherent in  the method of  production. It is
 largely due to expenditure which should be debited to  this  method  of production being spread over the whole country.
Chapter four deals with the Department of Industries. The
report has some trenchant remarks on it. Here is a summary :
 . . . As it is organized today, the department is not equipped to direct industries, it is nothing but a  glorified inspectorate.	The organization of a
 department of this kind should be such that every villager will turn to it naturally for help and advice.	This department should be the pivot  round
 which the production of the masses should revolve. It should provide direct help in every way—scientific, financial and technical . . . .
 The suggestion that has been made here is on the lines on which the All-India Village Industries Association and the All-India Spinners’ Asso- ciation are already working successfully. At the headquarters of the All-India Village Industries Association at Maganwadi, Wardha, various types of village industries are being carried on. Students are trained in the industries and for village work. A certain amount of scientific research is made. The goods produced are marketed in a shop organized by the Association. There is attached to it the Magan Sangrahalaya which is a museum of the type that is described herein after. The Spinners’ Association has emphasized all these points and, in addition, has organized the village producers, and built up a network of shops all over the country to find outlets for the products of the organization in the villages . . . .
 It is worthy of note that the Director of Industries who is a mem- ber of the Committee, has endorsed these remarks about his depart- ment. He deserves congratulation for his detached and impartial out- look.
 The following instructive analysis of the distribution of expen- diture deserves more than a passing attention :

pies there is
  	surely something rotten in the State of Denmark. And, as the 	Committee has truly observed, this money is spent largely on mere 	administrative work. If this department was run as it should be, the 	villages will be prosperous, and to that extent they would add to 	the prosperity of the State. It is wrong for the State to absorb 	three annas out of 16 for general administration and police and 	jails respectively.  	The fifth chapter which deals with the survey is really intro- 	ductory to the sixth and last which describes the village industries 	in detail. The condition of the villages is thus described :  . 	. . The primary 	needs of the 	people suggest that 	sanitary surroundings and 	fresh and wholesome water-supply must form a first charge on the 	revenues of the 	villages as 	it affects the 	health of 	the people. 	Unfortunately, water- 	supply has 	been neglected, 	especially the supply 	of water 	to the Harijan families. 	Whatever may be 	said against 	social customs, we cannot 	wait until 	these have been reformed 	to enable 	these downtrodden 	communities to get 	water. . 	. .  	The report has the following remarks on the condition of the 	industries in the villages :  . 	. . In our survey we 	noticed everywhere all manner of industries interposed without any 	policy or plan. The result of it all is that today we find the 	villages disintegrating . . . . This 	shows that the villages have been criminally neglected in  	the past. If the Congress Governments will carry out the professed 	intention of the Congress, they will reconstruct the lives of the 	villagers and make them utilize their time so as to supply most of 	their own wants. As the report points out, the Governments have to 	do two things: (1) to prevent interference with the village economy 	by preventing foreign goods from entering the villages, and  by 	preventing our own merchants from introducing milled flour, rice, 	oil, etc. These impose idleness on the villagers, and the polished, 	devita- lized food products undermine their health. Secondly and 	side by side with these preventive measures must go improvement in 	the methods of conducting the existing industries so as to make them 	more paying, and introduction of new industries in accordance with 	the condition of particular villages in regard to raw material. And 	if the venture is to succeed, the planning will have to include the 	taking up by the State of the goods produced by the villagers not 	for self-consumption but for sale outside the villages of 	production. 
 Among the village industries noted by the Committee are paddy-husking, flour-grinding, oil-pressing, gur-making, sugar manu- facture, bee-keeping, pottery, glass-work, soap-making, cotton pro- cesses (i.e., picking, ginning, carding, spinning, weaving), washing, dyeing, wool-spinning, weaving, sheep-breeding, carpentry, smithy, sericulture, mat-weaving, rope-making, tanning, disposal of carcasses, pisciculture, poultry-breeding, dairy-farming, shoe-making, brass and metal wares, toy-making, goldsmithy, paper-making, transport, lac industry, bamboo, match manufacture, etc. Among the industries is bidi-making. This is what the Committee has to say on this industry :
 Bidi manufacture is a very lucrative but a harmful industry in this province . . .
 . Naturally, as other industries are not available to those who are willing to work this industry attracts labour at very low rates considering the subsistence level of wages. At all events they are able to make two and a half annas to three annas a day which, as wages go in the villages today, is high. . . .
The Committee has made practical suggestions on all the indus-
 tries. No summary can do justice to the hints given under each head- ing. The curious must procure the report and study it. The Govern- ment should issue a cheap and handy edition, and have a translation in Hindustani at least. The report is useful for other pro-vinces also. The Government in the other provinces should therefore procure copies and instruct their Directors to study and act in the spirit of the report.  I hope that the Central Provinces Government will carry out in full the recommendations made by the Committee.

 MORE TEMPLES THROWN OPEN
 Raja Shri Rajaram Raja Saheb is the senior Prince and hereditary trustee of Tanjore Palace Devasthanams. He has 90 temples under his charge including the famous temple called Shri Brihadishwara. He has thrown open all these temples to Harijans as a purely voluntary act of reparation to Harijans and thus hastened the process of purification that Hinduism is going through. It is a great and good thing that the Raja Saheb has done. He deserves the congratulations of all those who believe that untouchability is a blot on Hinduism. The accounts I have received from Shrimati Rameshwari Nehru of the enthusiasm she has
 witnessed in the South in favour of opening temples to Harijans, show that the reform is genuine and is going to be lasting. She is a very careful observer. She says her meetings are attended by thousands of persons who follow every word of what she has to say. This is done through able interpretation. And she says that her listeners gladly endorse her sentiments. All this is a distinct improvement upon the past. Thus, though much has been done, much more remains to be done before Hindu reformers can rest on their oars. Temple reform has to go side by side with temple-entry. If the reform is not super- ficial but is an index of the desire for purification of Hinduism and Hindus, it must be accompanied by purification of the temples in every respect. Their sanctity and popularity should increase. The admission of Harijans to the temples should mean an automatic uplift in their lives. These things will not happen unless Harijan sevaks in- crease their vigilance, redouble their zeal and feel themselves uplifted by the reform they have helped to bring about. Reforms like the throwing open of temples to Harijans should bring with  them  a general levelling up in the lives of those who are engaged in and affected by them.libtech_303_footnote

 MY DEAR JAWAHARLAL,
 Instead of guiding the Dhami people I have passed them on to you.libtech_305_footnoteI   feel   that   you   should   discharge   this   burden   without   any interference from me. The idea in the States seems to be to isolate and ignore the Congress and hence the States Conference. I have already suggestedlibtech_306_footnotein Harijan that no State Association or Mandal should act on its own without reference to your committeelibtech_307_footnote.  I should act, if at all, through you; i.e., when you refer to me, I should give my opinion as I do in respect of the Working Committee. I told the Gwalior people also likewise yesterday. You will have to reorganize your committee a bit, if it is to function properly.
 After all I  could  not  go  to  Kashmir.  Sheikh Abdullah  and his friends won’t tolerate the idea of my being State guest. Banking on my past experience, I had accepted State offer in anticipation of Sheikh Abdullah’s approval. But I saw that I was mistaken. I there- fore cancelled the acceptance of the State hospitality and accepted the Sheikh’s. This embarrassed the State. So I cancelled the visit alto- gether. I was guilty of double stupidity—in daring to think of going there without you and in not getting Sheikh’s permission before accepting the State offer. I had thought that I would serve the people by accepting the State offer. I must confess that I was not pleased with my contact [with] the Sheikh and his friends. They seemed to all of us to be most unreasonable. Khan Saheb reasoned with them. But it was to no purpose.
 Your visit to Ceylon was glorious. I don’t mind what the imme- diate outcome is. Saleh Tyabji asks me to send you to Burma and Andrews thinks of you in connection with South Africa. For Ceylon the idea of a Congress deputation came to me spontaneously, not so
 
 these two even after the promptings. But of these when we meet. I hope you are fresh and that Krishnalibtech_308_footnoteis enjoying herself.
Love.

  	I have been in telegraphic correspondence with Dr.  Dadoo, leader of 	the Passive Resistance Committee in South Africa. I have no 	hesitation in asking the Passive Resistance Committee to postpone, 	for a time, the proposed launching of the strugglelibtech_312_footnotelibtech_313_footnoteon 	1st August. I do so because I have some hope of an honourable 	settlement. I know that the Government of India as well as the 	British Government are trying to obtain relief. I have put myself in 	touch with the Ministers. In the circumstances I think a brief 	postponement of the struggle to be necessary. I am fully aware of 	the enthusiasm of the resisters. They have proved their mettle 	before, and they will do so again  if  it becomes necessary. But it 	is a code with passive resisters to seize every opportunity of 	avoiding resistance, if it can be done honourably. Every cessation 	in search of peace adds strength to real fighters. Let them remember 	that the Cape Town Settlement of 1914 was the outcome of a cessation 	of struggle for the sake of peace. I hope that the proposed 	cessation will lead to a similar result. Should it unfor- tunately 	prove otherwise and should the struggle begin, let Dr. Dadoo and his 	fellow-resisters know that the whole of India will be at their back.  Harijan, 	5-8-1939     "
227,"July 30, 1939",LESSON OF DHAMI,"
    
 We have not heard the last of Dhami. The truth is not yet out. The necessarily one-sided version of the Political Agent has been challenged by the Himalayan States Praja Mandal. Their statement shows how absolutely necessary it is to have an open judicial inquiry into the events that led to firing by the Rana of Dhami.
 Some members of the Himalayan Mandal came to  see  me during my brief stay in Delhi. Dhami had made me think furiously. Was nothing possible to prevent such tragedy? I had much to say about it to the deputation, but I felt it would be wrong on my part to shoulder the burden of guiding the Himalayan States Praja Mandal. The responsibility was great. The issues at stake were equally great. I therefore felt that the matter should be handled not by me but by the Standing Committee of the All-India States People’s Conference. The question of the States is daily assuming bigger and bigger propor- tions. The ruling Chiefs are becoming free with their rifles. They feel that they are safe so far as the Paramount Power is concerned. The Congress has not much prestige with them. Many of them are now evolving measures to crush the growing spirit of their people and make it impossible, if they can, for the Congress to give effective guidance to them, let alone to interfere. Nevertheless the Congress has a duty to perform. I do not exactly know the constitution of the Con- ference, but I presume that in some shape or other it is connected with the Congress. Anyway it is the only body which is specially designed for guiding the States people. It would be wrong for the States to resent such guidance. They should also realize that any resentment would be futile. The Congress cannot give up its duty of guiding the States people in the hour of their need. Time was when the Congress was guiding and protecting the rights of the States as against the Para- mount Power. If the Congress friendship was desired and welcomed by the States in need, it hardly becomes them to demur at their people seeking Congress advice, guidance and protection. That the Congress may not always be able to give the people effective assistance is unfortunately too true. The Congress has to forge the necessary sanc- tion by putting the organization on a firmer footing and by wise restraint to acquire credit for impartiality and strictest justice. If the Congress is to discharge its function in a becoming manner, it will
 have to insist upon the workers learning to be more accurate than they have been hitherto in preparing their cases. In order to ensure accu- racy, the Standing Committee will have to subject to strict scrutiny everything coming to it. If unchallengeable accounts of the doings in the States where even simple justice is denied are published, they will afford a foundation for action.
 I have merely indicated a line of approach. The Standing Committee will no doubt lay down its own policy and method of dealing with problems as they arise from time to time. My object in writing these lines is to warn workers in the States against coming to me and expecting me to advise them. They should approach the Standing Committee. Even as I do not guide Congressmen on general matters falling within the function of the Working Committee but hold myself at the disposal of that body, so shall I henceforth act in respect of new State problems. I may not give up guiding those with whom I am already directly concerned. I need hardly add that I shall continue to do what my special aptitude in matters affecting States may enable me to do without being involved in the general direction of popular movements in them. I would ask workers in the States not to take up any forward movement without previous reference to any sanction of the Standing Committee. It must be the duty of the Congress acting through the States People’s Conference to avoid, if at all possible, a quarrel with the States.

 ONE SCRIPT FOR DAUGHTERS OF SANSKRIT
 The question of having one script for the Indian languages which are daughters of Sanskrit by birth or adoption has been before the public for a number of years. Yet in these days of aggressive provincialism, perhaps, any plea for one script will be regarded as an impertinence. But the literacy campaigns raging all over the country should compel a hearing for the advocates of one script. I have been one such for years. I remember having even adopted in South Africa Devanagari script for my Indian correspondence with Gujaratis in select cases. Inter-provincial intercourse will be much facilitated by such adoption, and the learning of the various provincial languages
 will be made infinitely easier than it is today. If the educated people of the land were to put their heads together and decide upon one script, its universal adoption should be an easy thing. To the millions who are illiterate it is a matter of indifference what script is prescribed to them. If the happy consummation comes to pass, there will be only two scripts in India—Devanagari and Urdu, and every nationalist will deem it his duty to master the two scripts. I am a lover of all Indian languages. I have tried to learn as many scripts as possible. And if only I had the time, even at the age of seventy I have energy enough to learn more Indian languages. That would be a recreation for me. But in spite of all my love for the languages I must confess that I have not learnt all the scripts. But if the sister languages were written in one script, I should pick up a workable knowledge of the principal languages of the provinces in very little time. And Devanagari has nothing to be ashamed of in point of symmetry or beauty. I hope that those who are engaged in the literacy campaigns will give a passing thought to my suggestion. If they will adopt Devanagari script, they will save for the future generations tons of labour and time and earn their blessings.

229,"July 30, 1939",A HARIJAN SEVAKS’ CONFERENCE,"
    
 There was held on 4th to 7th June last at Poona a conference of Western and Central India Harijan sevaks. Shrimati  Rameshwari Nehru, the Vice-President of the All-India Sangh, presided at the Con- ference. I am sorry that it was not possible to notice before now some of the important resolutions of the Conference. But they bear publication even though they were passed nearly two months ago. Here are the most important of themlibtech_314_footnotelibtech_315_footnote:
 It is to be hoped that the resolutions addressed to the Indore and Gwalior States  will  bear  fruit.  I  have  omitted similar  ones about Devas and Kathiawar States in  order  to  avoid  repetition. Indeed if the Princes will do their duty by the despised portion of India’s humanity, they should not need any reminder  from  the  Sangh. They do not, like the sanatanists, defend untouchability. With
 
 them the neglect to make provision for Harijans can only be ascribed to indifference. Let us hope that the appeal made by the Conference will not fall on deaf ears.

Shri 	Chhaganlal Joshi writes.libtech_331_footnote  	This news is  alarming. We  do  hope  that  Kathiawar  will escape 	this calamity; but if it does not, my second hope is that those who 	have foodgrains and fodder, or can manage them, will not take 	advantage of the situation and make profit, and will sell them at 	cost      
 price. My third hope is that the Rulers will fulfil their duty by  rendering the people as much help as possible, and the fourth hope is that the volunteers will rush out to offer help at various places. The spinning yajna will be observed for seventy days with effect from 2nd August, under the auspices of the Rajkot Rashtriyashala. It has been suggested that during the yajna workers should increase their speed of spinning and from the produce 70 percent should be used for helping the famine-stricken people. In the meanwhile, if it rains and Kathiawar escapes the danger, the yarn may be utilized for its original objec- tivelibtech_332_footnotelibtech_333_footnote. The main idea at this moment is to raise production. It can be raised by collecting funds and spinning more cotton. It is expected that those who did not normally participate in the spinning  yajna would do so this time. If the atmosphere for spinning is created it will be easier to give the work to the famine-stricken. Thereby proper help will be given to them and their self-respect will also be preserved. In order to procure adequate help, the spinning work will have to be taken up on a large scale and for that the formation of a committee of right persons is essential.
 My fifth and the last desire is that the khadi produced through the spinning yajna performed by the famine-stricken people will be disposed of easily. If the khadi is not sold immediately, the calamity cannot be met and overcome by the spinning-wheel.

In so far as it was intended to 	rouse public atten- tion it has served its purpose. Any prolongation 	of the fast will now defeat that purpose. There are many who would 	work actively for their release if the strike is given up. I do feel 	very strongly that this fast is not justified. The strikers are 	giving a bad lead to those who are similarly situated. Such 	hunger-strikers, if they are largely copied, will break all 	discipline to pieces and make orderly government impossi- ble. The 	prisoners’ cause is essentially just, but they are weake-ning it 	by their persistence. I would ask them to live and listen to the 	advice of one who claims to be an expert in fasting and who claims 	also to know the science of political prisonership. Let them not 	hamper one whom they consider to be their best advocate. I make bold 	to say that had the fates not been against them and me, they would 	certainly have been discharged before 13th April last. But I do not 	propose to go into the past.

 I have sufficient papers in front of me to enable me to formulate a tentative opinion upon the Shia and Sunni controversy. I have a long letter from Pantjilibtech_345_footnotelibtech_346_footnoteand printed papers giving me what purports to be an unbiased version.
 This much seems to stand out clearly. Whereas the Madhe Saheba is to praise the elected Caliphs, the Tabarra is a curse pronounced upon the first three Caliphs. Whilst one can understand the right of publicly praising people, is there such a thing as right of pronouncing a curse on dead men? The right of Tabarra cannot be derived from the holy Koran for the simple reason that the Caliphate came into being only after the death of the holy Prophet. I would like you, therefore, to enlighten me on the religious duty  of  saying  the Tabarra.
 I would also readily grant that there can be no religious duty in praising the Caliphs specially in public places and in the presence of those whom the recital is known to offend. Therefore, subject to what you might say to the contrary, I would advise you, for the sake of peace, to withdraw the civil resistancelibtech_347_footnoteand stop the public recital of Tabarra unconditionally, leaving it to the good sense of the Sunnis so to act as not to wound the susceptibilities of their Shia brethren.
 I have not written this letter for publication. You have  been good enough to ask me to give my candid opinion and I have given it tentatively. If it helps you in announcing your decision in accor- dance with my advice, you are at liberty to publish this letter.I am not sending a copy of this opinion to anyone. It is simply meant for you and friends who accompanied you and on whose behalf you had come.

 [On or before August 4, 1939]libtech_348_footnote
 Gandhiji told Mr. Shuklalibtech_349_footnotethat he was not treating the question of the release  of political prisoners, both of the Punjab and Bengal, lightly. He pointed out that the hunger-strike by the political prisoners in Bengal jails had been causing difficulties in finding a solution.
 Gandhiji declared that the problem of the political prisoners was coming up before the Congress Working Committee.
 Gandhiji pointed out that, with a solution found for the problem of political prisoners in Bengal, the question relating to the Punjab prisoners would be solved immediately and automatically.
 Gandhiji, it is stated, then asked Mr. Shukla to furnish him with particulars about the prisoners belonging to the Punjab, and the attempts made for their release, on receipt of which he would do what lay in his power.

255,"August 4, 1939",WELL DONE BOMBAY!,"
    
 From all the accounts I have received it seems that Bombay surpassed itself on the 1st of August, the day of the inauguration of prohibition. An eye-witness of the demonstration tells me that the procession that took the mortal remains of the immortal Lokamanya to the Chowpaty sands, huge as it was, was far outdone by the crowds that gathered together on the Azad Maidan. He tells me that all  Bombay was present there. The labourers, who were the chief persons to benefit by the measure and who were at the same time the most affected by prohibition, attended in their thousands with their wives. They rejoiced in the deliverance from the devil from whose grip they could not disengage themselves without external assistance. Had they gone to express their gratefulness to the Ministers for their courage in persisting in their benevolent measure in the teeth of the opposition of vested interests?
 It was not a mere labour demonstration. All classes took part in it. At that huge meeting there was not a jarring note. Men and women had turned up in their thousands to take part in thanks-giving to God for the successful inauguration of prohibition.
The great Parsi community deserves congratulations for the
 
 restraint it observed in spite of its bitter opposition to the measure. Evidently wiser counsel prevailed and no hostile demonstration appe- ars to have been staged by them. My hope that Parsi philanthropy will get the better of the opposition, appears to have been justified. Is it too much to expect whole-hearted support from the Parsis in making the measure a complete success? Let them remember, the glory of the effort in Bombay will be reflected not only throughout the province but it will be reflected all over India. I make bold to say that although they feel that they have been unjustly dealt with, the future generation of Parsis will bless Dr. Gilder as their true represent-ative and benefactor. Surely Parsis should be proud, as India is proud, that they have produced in Dr. Gilder a man who has stood firm as a rock in the midst of fiercest opposition including threats of boycott  and worse.
 Indeed the whole of the Ministry deserves hearty congratula- tions on the steadfastness with which they have pursued this great moral reform. The demonstration of 1st August shows that they had and have practically the whole of Bombay behind them. No construc- tive measure promoted by the Congress has had such enthusiastic support as this great moral reform.
 It is a matter of regret that a Muslim procession of protest, not against the measure but against the property tax, was organized the same day and resulted in a clash with the police. But it only enhanced the value of the public meeting, for the procession had no effect whatsoever on the great and irresistible demonstration. Bombay had one mind at the Azad Maidan.
 Let us hope the brilliant beginning has momentum enough in it to lead to a brilliant end. Much constructive effort will be required in order to consolidate the advantage gained by the closing of liquor- shops. It removes the temptation from the drinker but not the craving for drink. His mind has to be directed into the right channel. He must have healthy refreshment at a place where he can rest his tired mind and limbs. Workers among the labourers should deem it their duty to study their lives and help them to conquer the craving for drink. The Government alone won’t be able to cope with this consolidation work. They could close the liquor-shops with a measure of popular good- will. But they will need the active co-operation of a band of volunteer workers to supplement the official effort to help the drinker to lose his craving for drink.

You had vowed that you would return when Mridula and Lakshmidasbhai let you go. Now Shankerbhai is there. Meet him and do what appears proper. I have, of course, written to Lakshmidasbhai about Akbar. I don’t have the courage to keep him here. A Muslim lady doctor arrived here yesterday. She belongs to Central Provinces.

SEGAON,
  August 	5, 1939  GANDHIJI : If you are a 	satyagrahi, I too am a satyagrahi, and as I have been told by many 	friends that you are a reasonable man and a man of restraint, I 	shall show you that you are wrong.  	Well then, you ought to have exhausted all the constitutional means. 	You must remember that the Bombay Congress Ministry is under four 	Congress Committees—Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Bombay. 	You should have lodged your complaint before them. Failing 	satisfaction you should have gone to the Working Committee, failing 	there to the A.I.C.C., and then to the open session of the Congress. 	And if you accept my authority as an expert in satyagraha, then you 	should have come to me, but not with a decision to fast.  SATHE: 	I do not accept you as the final authority, but I would certainly 	take your advice. But let me ask you one question. Whether all these 	Congress Committees give an opinion in my favour or not, what if the 	Ministers say they have violated the Congress principles? Do 	they say so?  Yes. 	But they will not resign, they say, unless they are asked to resign. 	But they have broken the promises given in election manifestos. There 	is no rigidity about the manifestos. You may say many things 	but you may not be able to carry them all out.  My 	own Sadashiv Peth, which is one of the constituencies, did resolve 	that the Ministry had not fulfilled the promises. Well 	then, let that committee approach the A.I.C.C. But why this  	fast? You must exhaust all the natural steps.  The 	natural steps take years. It is a cumbersome machinery. Not 	years, but it may take a year. That should not matter.       . 	He feels that the Bombay Ministry grievously erred in certain 	things, e.g., orders about processions, security demanded from 	Presses, and firing. He had come determined to fast in Gandhiji’s 	presence because he said, Gandhiji was ‘the God of the Congress’ 	and had the resignations of the Congress Ministries in his pocket. . 	. 
 I do propose to go to the open Congress, for the Congress is an authority above you.
I am no authority. I have a certain amount of moral influence.
 But you do not exercise it.
 How do you know? You must place all the facts before me and convince me that I have not done all in my power.libtech_351_footnote
But you do not expect me to express my judgment on these matters?
 I do.
 How can I? Your reading out the texts of orders to me and placing all the facts in your possession before me does not take me further. I must hear the Ministers also.
 But that you can easily do. You are the High Command.
How am I the High Command?
 You have said that the Ministers’ resignations are in your pocket.
When did I say so? Produce my statements.libtech_352_footnote
 No, seriously, if I made any such preposterous statement,  it would be bravado. You do not find my name mentioned anywhere in the constitution. I can exercise my moral authority certainly, but that only when I see that there is something which ought to be done (morally) by the Working Committee or the Ministry.
 Then you will study the case while I go on with my fast.
 How can you, when you have yet to convince me of the justi- fiability of your fast?
 I am fasting only to arrest your attention.
 You will if you do not fast. The moment you begin your fast you distract my attention, you paralyse my capacity for unbiased judgment. I could not enjoy my meals if I knew that someone was fasting without cause. And then you must know that this is a colony of fasters. There is Bhansali, the greatest faster I have known, Vinoba had fasted, and so has Kakasaheb. You had better see them, talk to them, and see if they approve of your going on fast.libtech_353_footnote
 
 I do not take your view. If we  have  a  national  government, and we have papers that simply thrive on prosecutions, what are we to do? But that only means that there are fundamental  differences between us. We have got to examine everything. If you want me to use my moral authority, I must have certain conviction that the Ministers have gravely erred in all the three matters you have mentioned. And if the conviction goes home, I would certainly like to speak to the Ministers and the Working Committee. But to do all this I must exa- mine your allegation at leisure. And you may be sure that though I have very little time I would study the papers you send me, just for your sake.
 But in the mean while I may fast.
 No. You can place the whole case before the Working  Committee if you like.
 What right have I?
 Everyone has a right. The Working Committee is there to listen to every Congressman and non-Congressman with a grievance. But now that you have asked me to study the case perhaps you may not want to put it before the Working Committee. After I have given my decision, you may reason with me, plead with me, and then if you find me obstinate, you can fast against me.
You are a student of the Gita?
 I am.
 Well then, I tell you your fast would be the third kind of tapas described in the seventeenth chapterlibtech_354_footnote—tamasa tapas   born of ignorance and perverseness.
 So I may fast a month hence, if I am not satisfied?
Yes, but if I want more time, you will give me.
 Certainly.libtech_355_footnote

       said :      Two 	Congressmen came to me during the week. One of them    We 	in the Central Provinces think that you can do everything you want. 	You can remove the Ministry at will and you can make them do what 	you like. The 	other said :  You 	are the Working 	Committee. Every Congressman therefore blames you 	for the present 	corruption. You 	showed us that moral 	authority was 	the supreme 	authority. You taught 	us to think 	that the 	existing system 	was Satanic. 	You taught 	us that 	when the Congress reigned 	there would be no 	devilry, there would be 	purity in every walk of life. But we find today quite the 	reverse. The Congress 	reigns in many provinces 	and yet  corruption is rampant. 	Congressmen quarrel among 	themselves. There 	is marked deterioration. 	Devilry is not 	gone. You do not 	rely upon numbers. You 	have often said that even 	a few 	true and 	good Congressman 	can, by 	their moral 	worth, represent 	the whole 	nation and real 	democracy can 	be evolved. 	But instead 	of quality 	the cry everywhere 	is for quantity. 	The amendments 	recently made 	are of no use. 	They won’t remove the 	growing corruption nor 	reduce the 	unmanageable size of the 	Congress. If 	you say that 	you cannot 	have your way with 	the Working 	Committee, let us 	know it. 	As it is we believe 	you to 	be all- powerful 	and are therefore 	filled with wonder that you 	allow things to 	go from bad 	to worse. 	Look at 	your Khadi 	Clause. It is responsible 	for extensive 	hypocrisy in 	the Congress. Very few 	believe in 	Khadi and 	therefore use 	it only for show. Khadi therefore stands for falsehood and worse. You who brought the 
 country to a moral height are now bringing it down. Presently the Congress will become the laughing-stock of the country, if things go as they are doing. If you cannot mend the Congress, why don’t you leave it alone?
This second critic is a well-known Congressman and organizer.
 He spoke feelingly. I promised to reproduce in these columns the substance of the answer I gave him.
 I am not all-powerful whether with the Central Provinces Ministers or with the Working Committee. I know very little of the doings of the Ministers. I never interfere with their work. I have never regarded that as my function. Occasionally I have to correspond with them on matters such as the village industries, basic education or the like precisely as any citizen would do. I have invariably refused to interfere with their work. I would not have the time for it even if I had the wish. It would mean usurpation of the function of the Parliamen- tary Sub-committee of the Working Committee.
 So far as the Working Committee is concerned, I do attend its meetings whenever I am required to do so. I do influence its decisions in the matters that may be referred to me and never in any others. Many sittings of the Committee I do not attend at all. Of many of its resolutions I have no knowledge except after they are passed and that through the Press. This was the arrangement when I first severedlibtech_356_footnotelibtech_357_footnotemy legal connection with the Congress. What hold I have on the Committee is purely moral. My opinion prevails only to the extent that I carry conviction. Let me give out the secret that often my advice makes no appeal to the members. For instance, if I had my way, the Congress would be reduced to the smallest compass possible. It would consist of a few chosen servants removable at the will of the nation but getting the willing co-operation of the millions in the programme they may put before the nation. But this is too drastic and too undemo- cratic for Congressmen.
 I  admit  that  the  Khadi  Clause  has  led  to  much  falsehood and hypocrisy. If I had my way, it would have gone long ago. I sought to have the clause removedlibtech_358_footnotelibtech_359_footnoteeven when I seceded from   the Congress. I have repeated the attempt more than once but with no success. The argument has been that the Congressmen in general will not listen to the removal of the clause.
 
 Similarly I have endeavouredlibtech_360_footnotelibtech_361_footnoteto have the words ‘peaceful and legitimate’ removed from the Constitution but again without success. I can multiply instances in which I have failed to carry the Working Committee with me. I do not mention these failures by way of complaint against the Working Committee. The members had weighty reasons for not listening to me. I have not felt called upon to sever the moral tie with the old colleagues. I do not arrogate to myself any superiority over them. It has been a privilege to work with them. They are as good and faithful servants of the nation as I claim to be myself.   I cling to them because I have the hope that one day they will be converted to my point of view or that I shall be converted to theirs.
 Nor do I subscribe to the charge that the old regime was purer than the present. Whilst I admit that much corruption has crept into the Congress organization, that there are many self-seekers in it, it is my conviction that the Congress administration is comparatively purer than the old one. It is also my conviction that the Congress adminis- tration is responsible for several measures for the amelioration of the condition of the masses. I regard prohibition as the greatest of them all. But there is no doubt that a vast deal still remains to be done. I hug the hope that some day the Augean stables of the Congress will be swept clean and that the fears of the second critic of the Congress will be dispelled. It is not to be denied that he has grounds for his fears. Being an irrepressible optimist, things do not dismay me to the extent that they dismay him. They are serious enough to rouse every Congressman to a sense of his duty. The Congress will surely be undone if it does not stand exclusively on the solid rock of its moral worth.

261,"August 6, 1939",NOTES,"
    
 SHETH JAMNALALJI
 Sheth Jamnalalji is an extraordinary prisoner. He believes that as a prisoner he has not to care about his body beyond what the doctors provided for him do. And so I have only now come to know the true state of his health. Shri Shankerlal Banker, who happened to go to Jaipur to see Jamnalalji, got concerned about his health and told me how bad it was.
 
 For the moment I refrain from publishing the correspondence which has come into my hands. According to the Jaipur Civil Surgeon his is a case for special treatment. If it is, the onus is on the State to release him unconditionally, leaving it to Jamnalalji whether he will take special treatment within the State or without. It is futile to suggest to Jamnalalji that he should undertake to leave Jaipur if he is discharged. He will rather die in prison than be free under the very condition for the breach of which he has courted imprisonment. As I have already pointed out,libtech_362_footnotethere is no fear of Jamnalalji promoting civil disobedience in the State. For it stands indefinitely suspended. The authorities know that Jamnalalji is essentially a non-violent man. They also know him to be a man of his word. To me his detention is a mystery and, in the present state of his health, a crime.
 The public generally do not know that though the place where he is detained is good and accessible, it is a haunt of  ferocious animals. Under what appear to me to be barbarous shikar laws of Jaipur State, these animals are protected under pain of heavy fines being inflicted on the persons killing them. Tigers and their brood, it is said, eat men and animals with impunity. My purpose here, however, is not to deal with these shikar laws, inhuman as they appear to me to be. My purpose is to protest against Jamnalalji being kept in a tiger- infested place. I understand that even his keepers are not very happy over their job. There is no fear of Jamnalalji running away. If he must be kept in prison, why should he not be kept in an unobjectionable place where medical and other assistance is easily available?
 There is also another point which calls for notice. Though repeated requests have been  made,  he  has  not  yet  been  permitted to keep a companion. He has been given no nurse. Instances are on record when he was badly in need of night attendance. That he him- self has made no complaint is no reason for the authorities’ negli- gence in not providing necessary attendance. Their attention has been drawn to the matter more than once by Shethji’s secretary.libtech_363_footnote
 IN IMITATION OF KATHIAWAR
 Shri Sitaram Sastri, having read about the spinning programmelibtech_364_footnoteof seventy days set up by Shri Narandas Gandhi of Rajkot Rash- triyashala, has decided to imitate him and he has begun his pro-
 
 gramme of having from co-workers twenty-five lacs yards of yarn by the 2nd of October next. I wish him every success. Its secret lies in having previously the names of spinners and the quantity they would spin and having weekly reports of the work done. Naturally the spinners, being volunteers, will be expected to spin as strong, even and fine a yarn as they can with minimum waste. The idea behind all such effort should be that they will prove experts in their own localities and be an example to their neighbours.
 A CORRECTION
 Shri Sitaram Sastri points out an error that crept into my notelibtech_365_footnotelibtech_366_footnoteon the Kathiawar spinning programme. In it I mentioned that 700 spinners spinning 1,000 yards per day would be required to spin 70 lacs of yards in 70 days, and 7,000 spinners if they spun 100 yards per day. ‘700’ should read 100, and ‘7,000’ should read 1,000. Whilst I gladly correct the error, I may say that no harm will be done if 700 or 7,000 spinners take part in the sacrificial spinning. The more the better.

 I congratulate Shri Subhas Babu on having succeeded in per- suading the hunger-strikers to suspend their fast even for two months and on having undertaken to move the B.P.C.C. to take the necessary action for the release of the prisoners. I have also a wire from the prisoners in Alipore Jail informing me of the suspension and asking me to resume my effort. I need hardly assure them that what little I can do will be done to secure their release. I can say that the sus- pension gives me some hope that my effort will produce some effect.  I hope too that the Bengal Government will use the occasion for a generous gesture and end the agony.

 I gladly publish the foregoing letterlibtech_378_footnoteand  accept  the  explan- ation. Without it the concluding paragraph of the petition could only be interpreted as a threat. Better than the explanation, however, will be the help the Bhandaris could render in the prosecution of the prohibition programme. Let them be true soldiers of the Congress Government and the nation as they were of the East India Company, who were foreigners come to exploit the country. If they will heartily assist the Government in their arduous task, they will find that they will also assist themselves in a manner they never otherwise could have done.

272,"August 7, 1939",MILLS V. CHARKHA,"
    
 The A.I.V.I.A. has been issuing for some time a monthly bulle- tin called Gram Udyog Patrika at Maganwadi, Wardha, for the annual subscription of 12 annas. The July number contains an interesting article on national planning. I must refer the curious to the Patrika. I wish here only to draw attention to the followinglibtech_379_footnotestriking figures:
 . . . we would need Rs. 300 crores of capital employing 33 lakhs of people if we supplied all our requirements by mill production, while we would require about Rs. 72 crores of investment employing 800 lakhs of people if our supply were to come from cottage units. The two methods have their undoubted advantages. We are poor but we have an ocean of labour wealth.
 Therefore an intelligent plan will find the cottage method fit into the scheme for our country.	Any planning in our country that ignores the absorption
 of labour wealth will be misplaced. Our analysis has shown that centralized method of production, whatever may be its capacity to produce, is incapable of

 finding employment for as large a number of persons as we have to provide for. Therefore it stands condemned in this country.
The figures need no comment. If they cannot be challenged,
 they make an overwhelming case for the charkha and, by parity of reasoning, perhaps, for village production as against factory produc- tion. But I invite experts to examine the figures and challenge them if they can seriously do so.

 [August 11, 1939]libtech_415_footnoteThe Working Committee has given the most anxious conside- ration  to  the  action  of   Shri   Subhas   Chandra   Boselibtech_416_footnotethe   erstwhile
President of the National Congress, in connection with two resolutionslibtech_417_footnote
 of the last meeting of the A. I. C. C. known as “Satyagraha in Pro- vinces” and “Congress Ministries and the P. C. C.s”. The Working Committee has also considered the long letterlibtech_418_footnotelibtech_419_footnoteof Shri Subhas Babu, appended hereto. The Working Committee with great sorrow and reluctance has come to the conclusion that Subhas Babu has wholly missed the main point raised by the President of the even though he differed from the ruling of the President. It was open to him, if he felt aggrieved by the ruling, to appeal to the Working Committee or the
 A. I. C. C. But he was bound, so long as the Presi-dent’s instructions stood, to carry them out faithfully. This is the first condition of the proper functioning of any organization, much more so of a vast organization like the National Congress which is engaged in a life and death struggle with the world. If, what seems to be Subhas Babu’s contention in his letter, that every member is free to interpret the Con- gress Constitution as he likes, prevails, there will be perfect anarchy in the Congress and it must break to pieces in no time.
 
 The Working Committee has come to the painful conclusion that it will fail in its duty if it condones the deliberate and flagrant breach of discipline by Subhas Babu. The Working Committee there- fore resolves that for his grave act of indiscipline Shri Subhas Babu is declared disqualified as President of the Bengal Provincial Congress Committee for three years as from August 1939. The Working Committee trusts that Shri Subhas Babu will see the error of his ways and loyally submit to this disciplinary action.
 The Working Committee has taken note of the indiscipline of many other Congressmen including responsible officials. But it has refrained from taking any action as the members acted under the inspiration of Shri Subhas Babu. The Working Committee, however, leaves it open to Provincial Organizations to take action if they think it necessary for the proper observance of discipline and especially if the offending members do not express regret for their indiscipline.
 The Committee further empowers the President to take discipli- nary action against such members who, instead of expressing regret by their speech or conduct for the indiscipline, persist in it.

297,"August 14, 1939",HUNGER-STRIKE,"
  From 	the Hindi original: Pyarelal Papers. Nehru Memorial Museum and 	Library. Courtesy: Dr. Sushila Nayyar         	Hunger-strike has positively become a plague. On the slightest 	pretext some people want to resort to hunger-strikes. It is well, 	therefore, that the Working Committeelibtech_426_footnotelibtech_427_footnotehas 	condemned the practice in unequivocal terms, so far at least as 	hunger-strike for discharge from imprisonment is concerned. The 	Committee should have gone further and condemned also the practice 	of forcible feeding. I regard forcible feeding as an undue liberty 	with the human body which is too sacred to be trifled with, even 	though it belongs to a prisoner. No doubt the State has control over 	the bodies of its prisoners but never to the extent of killing their 	soul. That control has well-defined limits. If a prisoner decides to 	starve himself to death, he should, in my opinion, be allowed to do 	so. A hunger-strike loses its force and dignity, when it has any, if 	the striker is forcibly fed. It becomes a mockery if      
 somehow or other sufficient nourishment is poured down the throat, whether through the mouth or the nose. Of course, the mind instinc- tively revolts against feeding through the nose. But I under-stand that after a few day’s practice the process ceases to offend the subject himself. Where a prisoner offers violent resistance, the matter becomes difficult. But cases of such resistance are rare. It is not possible to keep up effective resistance for any length of time. A determined resister will of course die at the very first attempt and thus frustrate it. But such resistance requires great daring and reckless defiance of death. In any case it is my firm conviction that the method of forcible feeding should be abandoned as a relic of barbarism. I know that some prisoners welcome forcible feeding for the  empty  glory  of being regarded as hunger-strikers. Jailors have often told me that such prisoners would deplore stoppage of forcible feeding. I am told that under the existing law jail authorities are bound to resort to forcible feeding if reasoning fails. I would recommend amendment of such legislation if any.
 It is also worthy of consideration whether a rule should not be passed by the Working Committee making a public and political hunger-strike without permission a breach of discipline. I do not like restraint on the liberty of the individual except for his own good and that of the society of which he is a member. Hunger-strike has, how- ever, become such a nuisance that it will be as well for the Work-ing Committee to adopt measures to check it before it assumes dangerous proportions. A Working Committee resolution in such matters means expression of considered public opinion and is likely to prove a deter- rent against an abuse of the practice. It may never need to be en- forced.

 May I take the liberty of writing to you with a view to draw your attention to the problem of Kathiawar States? A close study of the States comprising the Western India Agency will convince anyone that the real problem of Kathiawar is not that of responsible government in individual States. That, in fact, is a demand very much beyond the ken of economic possibility. None of these States, with the exception of five or six, can afford to be genuine, separate, self-government units. Economic considerations  apart, their geographical contiguity, and cultural and linguistic unity posi- tively point towards the desirability of grouping them all adminis-tratively. A
 
 confederation of these States alone can bring their people on a par with the people of Bombay Province or, for that matter, any other province in British India.
 As to the fear that the Princes might strongly dislike such a move, it might be said that one cannot hope to go through any scheme of reform em- boding real transference of power to the people without being confronted by the most dogged opposition from those quarters. And when at all events a fight (of course a non-violent one) has got to be waged against that oppos- ition, it is only prudent and politic on our part to fight on an issue which should be our main and ultimate demand. Whatever our  immediate  and minimum demands, the final objective must not be lost sight of. And may I suggest in the case of Kathiawar, as also some three-fourths of the States in India, the final goal of all political reformers must be a confederation on the lines roughly foreshadowed in the appended printed articles?
 I hope you will see that this idea, though by no means new or original,
 deserves to be popularized. For, collective agitation by a group or cluster of States in favour of confederation has certain obvious advantages which agitation for reform in a single State cannot have. How much I wish you had worked for the propagation of this idea while you were actively engaged in the Rajkot struggle. Even now one word of support from you—of course, only if you generally agree with this view—will place this idea on a sound footing.
This important letterlibtech_428_footnotewas received by me in Abbottabad. The
 articleslibtech_429_footnoteappended are cuttings from The Tribune   of Lahore specially dealing with the problem. The articles contain an interesting analysis of the Kathiawar States and corroborative quotations from the Butler Committee’s Reportlibtech_430_footnoteand a recent pronouncementlibtech_431_footnoteby the Viceroy. For the moment I must content myself with heartily supporting the proposal. I do not share the fear of my correspondent about much opposition from the smaller States if they are sympathetically appro- ached. They will soon realize that their safety lies in some kind of confederation and sharing of power with the people. The chief thing is a dispassionate representation of the problem and creation of public opinion that cannot be answered or opposed.

 THE ARYA SAMAJ
 It was a happy endinglibtech_432_footnotelibtech_433_footnoteto the Arya Satyagraha. I have hitherto not written a word about this struggle. The matter seemed too delicate for public treatment by me. The country knows that I have a special way of dealing with things public or private. Some even call it qui- xotic. Thus my public silence over the Arya Satyagraha did not mean that I was not deeply interested in the struggle. I was keeping myself in touchlibtech_434_footnotelibtech_435_footnotewith both the Arya Samaj leaders and the Muslim friends who could have any thing to do with Hyderabad affairs. Of course I was acting in concert with Maulana Abul Kalam Azad. My sympathies were with the Aryas so far as their demands were con-cerned. They seemed to me to be so simple and so elementary. But I was averse to their Satyagraha from my own standpoint which I had explained to them. I was, however, nonplussed when they suggested that it was no worse if it was no better than the satyagraha I had led. They must not be expected, they added, to appreciate and follow my new method or requirements. I saw that I had no right to put any pressure upon them beyond that of reason. Then I was anxious not to embarrass H. E. H. the Nizam’s Government as long as I could help it. It is, therefore, a matter of great joy to me personally that the Arya struggle has ended in a friendly manner. Both the Nizam Government and the Arya Samajlibtech_436_footnotedeserve   congratulations.   Let   me   hope   that   the   dignified statement issued by Shri Ghanshyamsingh Gupta will receive from the Aryas the response it deserves. There is no doubt that much bitterness has been engendered during the struggle. If the Aryas act in the spirit of Shri Gupta’s appeal and the Nizam’s Government in the spirit of their own communiquelibtech_437_footnotelibtech_438_footnote, the bitterness will    die out and there never will be any occasion for resumption of the struggle so far as simple religious and cultural freedom is concerned.

 THE PUNJAB CONGRESS
 Dr. Satyapallibtech_439_footnotelibtech_440_footnotehas needlessly quoted me in order to go out of public life. If it is an inner urge, the decision is sound. If it is due to my innocent postcardlibtech_441_footnotelibtech_442_footnoteto Lala Dunichand, the doctor is  hopelessly wrong. In the first place the postcard has to do with  the  whole Congress atmosphere in the Punjab which has resulted in a distrust not of this or that individual but of myself. A critic may call it cowardice if he likes. But whether it is cowardice or want of self-confidence, I am useless as a mediator so long as my malady persists. So, when Sardar Mangal Singh and other friends from Ludhiana came to  Wardha armed with authority from Dr. Satyapal, I told them that I was useless, but that Rajendra Babu as the head of the Congress organization was the proper person to go to the Punjab. He has consented to go as soon as his health and other engagements permit. But I have suggested to these friends that there is no help equal to self-help. They must, by their own exertion, put their house in order. If Dr. Satyapal has not gone out in obedience to the inner urge, he will not be able to keep himself out for any length of time. His nature will revolt against the artificial self-suppression. I therefore suggest a better course. Let him cease to be a party man. Let him forget old quarrels and let him be intent on producing real solidarity in the Punjab. I cannot say how this can be done. I have not even the data for laying down a plan of action. He must devise it himself. All I can say is that if he really wills it, he can do the thing. Everybody knows that he has a following in the Punjab, that he is an indefatigable worker and has sacrifice to his credit. If, therefore, anybody can bring about peace among Congress- men in the Punjab, it is certainly Dr. Satyapal. But whether it is he or anybody else, that one will have to efface himself and put the people’s cause, which is the Congress cause, before his own or his party’s. Behind my diffidence must be read an intense wish that the Congress- men in the Punjab should unite without mental reservations and act as one man.
 INDIAN STRUGGLE IN SOUTH AFRICA
 Whether our countrymen in South Africa have to  take  up passive resistance or not, there is no doubt that they will not be able to vindicate their position if they cannot close their ranks and act as one man and act unselfishly. Their corporate existence cannot be main-
 
 tained with honour, if individuals in order to serve their selfish ends compromise the community’s interest and honour. There is, at the time of writing these lines, a cleavage between the local Congress and the passive resisters. The resisters seem to have the bulk of the Indian population with them. But the name and prestige of the South African Congress is with the non-resisters. Now there is a prospect of a lawsuit over the possession of the Congress books, funds and offices. I would warn the resisters against falling into the legal trap. Let them follow my example. The equivalent to the Congress in my days was the British Indian Association. From the very commencement of passive resistance, I recognized that all Indians would not and could not join the struggle although all might be, as they actually were, in sympathy with it. Although it was open to me, being secretary, to utilize the name and prestige of the Association, I founded a separate organi- zationlibtech_443_footnotelibtech_444_footnoteleaving the British Indian Association free to act as it might within constitutional limits. It was possible by this arrangement to protect the non-resisters from harm, retain their sympathy and save the resisters from the embarrassment that would undoubtedly  be caused by non-resisters if they were members of the same body. Let the present passive resisters work along their own lines and rely upon getting more than prestige by their strength, sacrifice and capacity for suffering. A passive resister should have a generous heart and  represent not only his own companions but even his opponents. Whatever rights he secures, he will secure for all. He is a friend of all and enemy of none. That is the first condition of successful passive or civil resistance.
 KHADI AS FAMINE INSURANCE AND MEDIUM OF INSTRUCTION
 There has been a full discussion among the khadi workers at the meeting of the A. I. S. A. held at Wardha on the 12th instant and thereafter. It has been claimed for khadi that it has at least three definite functions. It provides a supplementary occupation to the semi-starved and semi-employed millions of India on a scale un- equalled by any other occupation. It provides, with the least possible loss, work in famine areas; and it is the best medium of instruction for the boys and girls of India in the primary stage.
 But there is one definite condition for the success of khadi as famine insurance or medium of instruction in the primary stage.
 
 What is to be done with the khadi produced in famine areas and in the schools? If khadi cannot be sold, it is as useless as the stones broken in many parts of India during famine time. I have suggested often enough in these columns that all the khadi produced under the last two heads must be taken up by the State. This can be most easily done through the A. I. S. A., if the State guarantees the losses as it  guarantees today railway dividends and many other things. Consi- dering price, khadi is undoubtedly dearer than mill-cloth. Therefore it commands a market only among patriots and philanth-ropists. But those who have no spare cash will not be easily actuated by philanthropy or patriotism. They will go to the cheapest market. It is therefore the business of the State to shut out or tax heavily enough such goods as compete with those which, for the general good, should command a market. I think it can be taken as proved that khadi comes under such goods. The administration of eight provinces is virtually in Congress hands to an extent enough to protect khadi and the like. There is no reason why the other provinces should not follow the Congress provinces in matters like protection of khadi on which there is no difference of opinion. Hindu-Muslim unity may not come as early as many of us wish. But even as we breathe common air and drink the common water supplied by the rivers, wells or waterworks, surely we might agree on a common policy regarding other necessaries of life, without in any way interfering with our differences, if we must unfortunately hug these and use them for warring against one another. But whether the other provinces fall in line or not, it is necessary for the Congress provinces to confer with the A. I. S. A. and the A. I. V. I. A. and evolve a line of action whereby the difficulty I have pointed out can be solved without delay.

  	I have already given you the blessing that your operation may be 	successful. I satisfy myself by seeking news of you from anyone who 	comes and knows you. You know how much I respect you. But this 	letter is to convey my good wishes to Ambalalbhai. Your ope- ration 	will certainly go off without any trouble. I am even praying that 	both of you should always be happy and go on doing public service. 	There is no need to answer this letter.  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	the Gujarati original: C.W. 11148. Courtesy: Sarabhai Foundation        The 	following is the translation of the resolution adopted by the A. 	I. S. A. at its meeting on the 15th instant at Wardha:  The 	A. I. S. A. has 	for the past four years 	recognized the 	duty of 	making a 	progressive rise 	in the 	wages payable to 	the spinners. 	In the 	performance of 	this duty, 	the Maharashtra 	Branch of 	the Sangh 	has paid the highest 	rate of all the 	branches. But 	the result of 	this experiment 	of the 	Branch has 	been that khadi has 	proved unable to 	bear the 	burden and 	the sales have 	considerably gone down. The 	rise in 	wages should not 	result in 	a diminution in 	the capacity of 	khadi to 	provide work for 	the unemployed. 	It seems 	that in view 	of the 	existing circumstances it 	is necessary to 	postpone the 	insistence on 	giving the 	spinners more 	than three annas for 	eight hours’ spinning. 	There is 	much unemployment. 	There is a sufficient 	number of spinners 	eager to work 	for less 	than one anna 	for eight 	hours’ spinning. Other people 	are ready 	to give 	them work at such 	low wages to 	the detriment 	of the 	principle laid 	down by 	the Sangh. 	Apart from the Sangh 	providing them 	also with work, there 	seems to 	be no other way 	of combating 	the evil. 	Thus there are two duties 	before the Sangh: 	one that of 	raising the 	spinners’ wages 	to eight 	annas for an eight-hour 	day, and 	the other of 	finding work 	for the unemployed 	sisters. There comes an 	interim period before reaching the simultaneous performance of the two duties.  Moreover 	there is a danger of famine overtaking some parts of the country. 	The spinning-wheel is being proved to be of the greatest help at 	such times. But 
 question arises whether it is necessary to make the scale of wages lower than even three annas. A third problem arises from the fact of the production of yarn in the schools conducted according to the Wardha scheme of education.
 Taking all these things into consideration the Sangh has come to the following conclusion :
 Generally the scale of three annas for eight hours’ work of the fixed standard be not touched for the time being. But it should be open to any branch to rise higher than the scale, provided that it takes over the responsibility of sustaining its sales under the higher scale. In the event of the necessity being felt of lowering the wages of artisans in the famine areas, the decrease may be made with the previous permission of the Secretary. The Sangh should take over from the respective Governments the sales of khadi prepared in famine areas and in schools conducted under the Wardha scheme of education, provided that these Governments bear the losses sustained in the disposal of such khadi.
 This is an important resolution. It marks a slowing down of the speed with which I was goading the Sangh to rise to eight annas wages for an eight-hour day for the spinners. I knew that the goal was not to be reached in one jump. I had, however, nursed the hope that every few months would show a progressive increase in the wages. But reports from the different branches and the partial failure of the ex-periment carried on under my nose by Shri Jajujilibtech_473_footnotelibtech_474_footnoteunder the guidance of Shri Vinoba with high hopes of going forward with the rise, have opened my eyes to the stern and grim reality that this country is so terribly poor that it cannot afford to pay a wage of eight annas per day of eight hours to millions of women. Generally nowhere in rural areas do village labourers or artisans earn eight annas for eight hours’ work. Spinners could not earn eight annas without all the other classes doing likewise. And the purchasing classes simply have not the money to pay an all- round wage of eight annas per day unless conditions are  radically altered. The crushing and unproductive military burden drains the country dry. Add to this the inordinately high salaries and correspondingly high pensions paid, and spent abroad. There are other internal causes also for this gnawing poverty. But I must not stray from the purpose of this article.
 Be the cause or causes what they may, the painful fact has been brought home by khadi workers that in spite of all the will in the world the middle-class khadi buyer simply has not the money to buy    khadi at the increased price necessitated by the rise in wages beyond the point
 
 of three annas. They report that for the time being at any rate that is the saturation point. The resolution is a recognition of this painful fact.
 But even the scale of three annas cannot be sustained if the Pro- vincial Governments do not come to the rescue. They can do so both through legislative and administrative effort. This they will only do if they will use the A.I.S.A., the A.I.V.I.A. and the Hindustani Talimi Sangh as their own expert, voluntary and honorary agencies. I present them with the prospect of putting several lakhs of rupees into the pockets of the famishing villagers by providing them with employ-ment during leisure hours. But no progress can be made if the manu-factures of the villagers do not become current coin.

 AMONG ‘ CRIMINAL TRIBES’
 Shri H. S. Kaujalgi of the Karnataka Branch of the A.I.S.A. sends me beautiful slivers and equally good yarn prepared and spun by the women in the‘criminal tribes’ settlement near Bijapur and writes :
 The women are not criminals themselves, but they are the immediate dependants of the habitual criminals that are placed under certain restrictions in the settlement. The manager of the settlement asked the A.I.S.A. Karnataka Branch to try to introduce spinning in the settlement. As spinning was unknown to these women, they had no prejudices for any particular kind of spinning- wheels or carding process. So we thought it in the best interest of the spinners to introduce Andhra methods of spinning and carding. We began on the 19th of July. Five women are attending the class. They belong to the Bhat, Corvi and Waders communities. They are paid one anna and six pies per day as stipend during the course of spinning. They can now spin 500 yards in three hours. The cotton used is Jayawant and the yarn spun is between 30 and 40 counts. We are continuing the class till the end of August, after which time we shall  be providing them with cotton and purchasing yarn from them. If the experiment succeeds, we are introducing spinning in other criminal settlements also. Shri Dhruva, the Backward Class Officer, Poona, is enthusiastic about it.
 Towards the end of August we are holding a competition in spinning. We are giving a sari as a present to all those who spin more than three hundred yards of 30 counts yarn in one hour. As the women are quick and intelligent it is possible that every one of the five spinners will get a sari.
 This is a good beginning. If the Provincial Governments will take the fullest advantage of the three expert constructive bodies, viz., A.I.S.A., A.I.V.I.A. and Hindustani Talimi Sangh, they will find the maximum amount of productive work with the minimum expen-diture of money and energy. But of course they have to face the problem of the sale of goods manufactured through the activities of these three bodies. Such a question arises only in this unfortunate land. In other countries the State sees to it that the people use the goods that are manufactured by or under State supervision. The Pro-vincial Governments have the opportunity, though to a  limited  extent,  of putting things right.

  	It is very unkind of you not to write to me these days. I hope you 	received the letter sent yesterday.  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	a photostat of the Gujarati: G.N. 7112. Also C.W. 4604. Courtesy: 	Vijayabehn M. Pancholi         	The following is taken from a letter from the Gandhi Ashram, Meerut 	:  The 	A.I.S.A. is 	giving work 	today to 	more than three 	lakhs of people. 	Its operations 	extend to 	13,000 villages. 	2,571 workers 	are engaged 	in this 	great nation-building 	activity. The quota 	of the 	United Provinces is 	no mean one. We 	have more than 40,000 	spinners on our 	registers. The 	number of 	other artisans, 	weavers, washermen, carders, etc., 	is 4,780. 	Nearly 3,043 villages 	are covered 	by our activities, 	and 600 workers 	carry the message 	of khadi 	to different 	parts of the 	province. It 	brings all 	the creative forces of 	the nation 	into play. We learn 	to combine, 	plan, co-ordinate and 	build. Pandit Jawaharlal 	Nehru has been 	reported to have said in the Working Committee that the spinning-wheel cannot fulfil all 
 our needs of cloth today. I feel this statement underrates the possibility of the spinning-wheel. I can say from our experience that we have not been able to touch even the fringe of the problem. Production can be multiplied a thousand times within a very short period provided we have a ready market for the khadi we manufacture.
 I have omitted the portion containing an appeal for sales. I hope that their effort will meet with the success it deserves. But what I wish to consider here is the reason for the sales not keeping pace with the production. Propaganda undoubtedly has its place. But more than propaganda is wanted scientific research. There is no doubt that our people use on an average 15 yards of cloth per head per year. There is is no doubt that this cloth costs the country a figure approaching 100 crores of rupees, meaning less than three rupees per head, coun-ting India’s population at 35 crores. It is easy enough to say that the sales can be effected if the State protects khadi. That khadi deserves protection is in my opinion a self-proved proposition.libtech_475_footnoteBut  have  the khadi workers who have the qualifications found out whether we have done all we could to command sales even without protection? There are two obstacles. Mill-made cloth is said to be much cheaper than khadi, and has a variety of colour, design and finish which khadi does not possess. The second has been largely overcome, but more is perhaps required to be done. There must be a limit beyond which probably khadi cannot go. If there is, we must frankly confess it. But my fear is that sufficient research has not been made as to the prices. Professor Kumarappa has put forth a startling claim for the spinning-wheel. He has produced figures in support of it.libtech_476_footnotelibtech_477_footnoteBut the man in the street asks the questions: ‘Then why is khadi dearer than mill-cloth?’ This question has to be satisfactorily answered. The obvious answers I would not consider to be satisfactory. The answers themselves have to be thoroughly examined and the way to overcome the difficulties discovered and pursued till khadi comes to occupy its  natural supremacy.
 It is a shame that we who grow more cotton than we need should have to send it abroad for being turned into cloth for us. It is equally a shame for us that we who have in our villages unlimited unused labour, and can easily supply ourselves with village instru-ments of
 
 manufacture, should send our cotton to the mills of our cities for it to be manufactured into cloth for our use. We know the history of the shame. But we have not yet discovered the sure way to deal with the double shame beyond a patriotic appeal to the public. The latter have returned an encouraging response. But the recent resolution seems to show that we have reached the limit of the patronage. We may not be satisfied until khadi becomes an article of universal wear. It may be that in the prosecution of our search we may find, as some suggest we shall, that khadi can never become an economic pro-position. We should then have no hesitation in making the admission, however it may hurt our pride and demolish the proposition we have hitherto advanced with so much confidence. But the admission cannot be made till we have made every search that is possible for a human being to make so as to yield an unequivocal answer to the questions propounded by me.

 WHY ONLY PROHIBITION?
A correspondent thus twits me:
 It was all very well for you to have insisted on prohibition. Do you suppose that the ‘satta’ in the share market, the ‘ank farak’, the dens of gambling, the races and the cinemas do less damage to the morals and the pockets of the people than the drink evil? I hear you have never gone to the cinema. Do go, if only once, and you will see things on the stage and among  the  spectators that will set you athinking. I assure you that the institutions I have mentioned demand your attention as much as the drink monster.
 This is the substance of a fairly long indictment in Gujarati. There are other things packed into the letter. But I have given in my own words the relevant portions.
 I have no difficulty in agreeing with the correspondent that the evils named by him are serious and should be dealt with. But who will bell the cat? If I could have, I should have dealt with the lady long ago. I have my limitations. I have only recently shownlibtech_478_footnotethat  I  am   not  so
 
 powerful as some people imagine. The drink evil has been recog-nized as such by the people of this land. But the other evils are more or less fashionable. If I led an agitation against the share gambling, I should be in danger of losing some of my willing and regular donors. If I incited people against the races and the infernal gamble that goes on there, all the high personages from the Viceroy downward would be up in arms against me. And those who patronize the race specials? If I led a raging compaign against the cinemas, I should lose caste among educationists and reformers. They have often sought to con-vert me by pleading that cinemas are a fine medium of education and that churches and reformers in the West give them their patronage in an ever-increasing measure. Therefore if I treated these evils as I have treated the drink evil and if I began to organize picketing in respect of them, I should lose caste, lose my mahatmaship, and even lose my head which of course has very little value at this time of my life. But as I do not wish to suffer the triple loss, I must allow my corres-pondent and others like him to think that I am shirking an obvious duty. I know the evils. I hope that greater reformers than I will deal with them. For me one step is enough.
 A FRAUD ON KHADI
The Secretary, A.I.S.A., Punjab Branch, writes:
 I am sending per separate parcel an advertisement of Butala khadi. They were our certified centre till the end of 1937. Some suspicion then  arose regarding the purity of yarn used by them. The matter was investigated and the Ahmedabad Office decided that they must keep an A.I.S.A. inspector for their centre to watch that no mill-yarn was used. They refused to abide by that decision, on which their certificate was cancelled. They are now exploiting our certificate that was given to them while they were working as a certified centre. They do not say that their certificate has been cancelled since, but quote the old certificate giving a false impression to the public that they have still got the patronage of Mahatma Gandhi, Shri Jamnalal Bajaj and other leaders of esteem. I feel something might be done to remove this impression.
I have omitted the advertisement. The action complained of in the
 letter is obviously a fraud on khadi. It is probably an actionable wrong. Though the A.I.S.A. has followed the policy of relying upon public opinion to protect khadi against fraud, the wrong-doers should know that the A.I.S.A. has taken no vow not to seek legal protection if it became necessary. I hope that the party making use of a cancelled certificate will wisely give up the practice, return the certificate to the Association, and refrain from dealing in khadi in contravention of the
 
 rules of the A.I.S.A. The Secretary of the Branch should warn the wrong-doer against the wrongful use of the cancelled certificate and report the result to the Central Office.

I know, too, that nothing brave is to be expected from here. It is therefore doubly necessary not to prolong the agony. If you can, you should tell Rama Raulibtech_481_footnotelibtech_482_footnoteto keep himself in touch with the Passive Resisters. As you know there are two parties there. He should take the P.

What he writes is perfectly true. The only amendment needed is that he has always been like a child and has not become childish through senility. You should write to Vijaya as you have been doing. She had suggested that you should write the full name of Naranbhai. There has been no letter from her. This suggests that she is in a fix. But she will be able to manage. I

Why are you so much afraid 	of Devdas and the people here? Why should you tremble at the thought 	of coming here? What has happened to your knowledge of the Gita 	and all the talks we have had? On the one hand you are 	proclaiming to the world what you plan to do here and on the other 	you have doubts about your continuing to stay here. What stupidity! 	Free your-self of it. Why are you dying before your death?  	Your description of your talk with Devdas is good. your answers were 	also good. This dialogue has certainly done good. I hope you did not 	show any anger during the talk. The misunder-standing will be 	further cleared with more talks. 
 There is an Agrawal Eye Hospital at Daryaganj. Go and see it. I hope you are well and you observe rules in the matter of food.
 There is always trouble from Pyarelal in the shape of fasts and so on. You are mischievous. Young wrote to me only because you gave him the occasion.

I doubt very much if she can restrain herself any more. Of course you must consider well before settling the marriage. You must then leave it to her. In the end she will do as her fate dictates.

337,"August 	23, 1939",STATEMENT TO THE PRESSlibtech_490_footnote,"
           SEGAON, 
  August 	23, 1939  	I continue to receive letters, mostly abusive, about what may be 	called the Subhas Babu resolutionlibtech_491_footnoteof the Working Committee. I also saw a letter addressed 	to Rajendra Babu, which can hardly be sur-passed in the use of 	filthy language. I have seen some criticisms about the war 	resolutionlibtech_492_footnote.  	I owe it to the public to make my position clear about both these 	resolutions. I must confess that the Subhas Babu resolution was 	drafted by me. I can say that the members of the Working Committee 	would have shirked the duty of taking action if they could have. 	They knew that there would be a storm of opposition against their 	action. It was easier for them to have a colourless resolution than 	to have one which was no respecter of persons. Not to take some 	action would have amounted to abdication of their primary function 	of preserving discipline among Congressmen. Subhas Babu had invited 	action. He had gallantly suggested that if any action was to be 	taken it should be taken against him as the prime mover. In my 	opinion the action taken by the Working Committee was the mildest 	possible. There  was  no desire to be vindictive. Surely the word 	vindictiveness loses all force and meaning when the position of 	Subhas Babu is considered. He knew that he could not be hurt by the 	Working Committee. His popularity had put him above being affected 	by any action that the Working Committee might take. He had pitted 	himself against the Working Committee, if not the Congress 	organization. The members of the Working Committee, therefore, had 	to perform their duty and leave the Congressmen and the public to 	judge between themselves and Subhas Babu. It has been suggested that 	Subhas Babu has done what I would have done under similar 	circumstances. I cannot recall a single instance in my life of 	having done what Subhas Babu has done, i.e., defied an organization 	to which I owed allegiance. I could understand rebellion after 	secession from such an organization. That was the meaning and secret 	of the non-      
 violent non-co-operation of 1920.
 But I am not penning these lines so much to justify the action of the Working Committee as to appeal to Subhas Babu and his suppor-ters to take the decision of the Working Committee in the right spirit and submit to it while it lasts. He has every right to appeal to the A.I.C.C. against the decision. If he fails there, he can take the matter before the annual session of the Congress. All this can be done with-out bitterness and without imputing motives of the worst type to the members of the Working Committee. Why not be satisfied with the belief that the members have committed an error of judgement? I fancy that if a majority of the A.I.C.C. members signify in writing their disapproval of the action of the Working Committee, the latter will gladly resign. By imputing motives whenever there are differences of opinion, Congressmen pull down the structure that has been built up by the patient labour of half a century. Indeed, even if a bad motive is suspected, it is better to refrain from imputing it, unless it can be proved beyond doubt. It is necessary for the sake of healthy public education that leaders of public opinion should judge events and decisions on their merits.
 On the war resolution I had a conclusive defeat. I was invited to draft a resolution, and so was Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. I was proud of my draft, but my pride went before destruction. I saw that I could not carry my resolution unless I argued and pressed for it. But I had no such desire. We then listened to Jawaharlal’s. And I at once admitted that it represented more truly than mine the country’s opinion and even the Working Committee’s as a whole. Mine was based upon out-and-out non-violence. If the Congress heartily believed in non-violence in its fullness even as a policy, this was its testing time. But Congressmen, barring individual exceptions, do not believe in such non-violence. Those who do, believe that it is the right thing only for a fight against the Government for wresting power. But the Congress has no non- violent message for the world. I would fain believe that the Congress had such a message. The conclusion to both the resolutions need not have been radically different. But the motive power being different the same conclusion would bear a different meaning in a different setting. In the face of the violence going on in India itself and in the face of the fact that Congress Governments have been obliged to fall back upon
 military and police assitance, a declaration to the world of non-violence would have seemed a mockery. It would have carried no weight in India or with the world. Yet, to be true to myself, I could not draft any other resolution than I did.
 The fate, to which I was party, of my resolution proved the wisdom of my withdrawal of official connection with the Congress. I attend the Working Committee meetings not to identify myself with its resolutions or even its general policy. I attend in the pursuit of my mission of non-violence. So long as they want my attendance I go there to emphasize non-violence in their acts and through them in those of Congressmen. We pursue the same goal. They all of them would go the whole length with me if they could, but they want to be true to themselves and to the country which they represent for the time being, even as I want to be true to myself. I know that the progress of non- violence is seemingly a terribly slow process.libtech_493_footnotelibtech_494_footnoteBut experience has taught me that it is the surest way to the common goal. There is deliverance neither for India nor for the world through clash of arms. Violence, even for vindication of justice, is almost played out. With that belief I am content to plough a lonely furrow, if it is to be my lot that I have no co-sharer in the out-and-out belief in non-violence.

343,"August 25, 1939",PLEA FOR VOLUNTARY FEDERATION,"
    
 Imposed federation is likely to divide India more than it is today. It would be a great step if the British Government were to declare that they would not impose their federal structure on India. The Viceroy seems to be acting in that fashion if he is not saying so. If my surmise is correct, I suggest that a clear declaration will add grace to his action and will probably pave the way for real federation and therefore real unity. That federation can naturally never be of the Government of India Act brand. Whatever it is, it must be a product of the free choice of all India.
 But before that political and legalized federation of free choice comes, there should be voluntary federation of parts, to begin with, if not of the whole. This reflection arises from famine conditions today in parts of lesser Gujarat and the whole of Kathiawar. I have  received angry protests from correspondents drawing my attention to what they have termed the heartless policy of the Bombay Government in prohibiting the movement of fodder and grain. I could not believe my correspondents. I knew that the Sardar was moving heaven and earth to cope with the distress both in Gujarat and Kathiawar. But in order to make assurance doubly sure, I wired to the Prime Minister. Immediately on the same day came the following answer :
 Removal of fodder from six districts not permitted without the permision of Collector as the necessities of our Province must be first considered. Excess will be permitted to be removed.
The wire was followed by  a  letter enclosing a  copy of  the Bill
 about to be introduced in the Bombay Assembly. It simply controls the movement and prices of grain and fodder during times of famine or scarcity. This is no policy of prohibition but it is one of control over and regulation of the movement of fodder and grain so as to prevent hoarding in speculators’ hands or disposal to the extent of starving the places where it is grown and stored. The Premier’s letter contemplates collection of grain andfodderfrom  available sources outside the Province and its distribution in famine areas including Kathiawar. The Bombay measure I consider not only to be necessary but conducive to the interest as well of the whole of the States part of the Province as of
 the British part. I call it an act of voluntary fede-ration. The reader must not quarrel with the stretch of the mean-ing of the word.
 This little act introduces the reader to what can become a big act of voluntary federation. I reproducedlibtech_498_footnotethe  other  day  a   letter  from  a correspondent suggesting a federation of the Kathiawar States in many matters of common interest. The correspondent’s ultimate aim was political federation. What I contemplate has nothing to do with politics. My present and ultimate aim here is purely humanitarian.
 If the Kathiawar States would voluntarily federate, say, for water, forests and roads, purely for saving life, there would be no danger of a water famine such as threatens the cluster of States. There are States rich enough who can provide water for the whole of Kathiawar. I know it cannot be done in a day. But the dog-in-the manger policy followed in Kathiawar has made impossible any scheme of big waterworks. Kathiwar has fairly good rivers and hills. There is no limit to the possibility of artesian wells. If only all the States will combine and the rich ones will use their riches for the common good, they will be saved the awful prospect of people and cattle having to die of thirst. I have faith that it is possible for Kathiawar to ensure a proper supply of water even in dry years. But no common waterworks will answer the purpose for all time unless there is a long-view scheme of afforestation. There are practically no forests in Kathiawar. The Princes and the people have to combine to plant trees on an extensive scale. This cannot be done unless the States and the people regard the whole of Kathiawar as their joint and common land and have wisdom enough to desire to live on their land without the perpetual dread of having to die of thirst when the god of rain stops supplies.

344,"August 25, 1939","MOTOR V.
CART","
    
 Gram Udyog Patrika for August examines the respective merits of motor-vans and carts for village propaganda. Those who will read the whole argument should send for the Patrika. I give below the most
 
 
 important part of the argument.libtech_499_footnote
 We have been asked whether District Boards and such other local bodies, who wish to set apart a certain amount of money for village work, will do well to invest in motor-vans for propaganda work of various kinds in villages. The
 question is whether speeding up matters by the use of motor-vans which can visit more than one village in a night will suit the purpose.
 In all our expenditure, especially when that expenditure is undertaken expressly for the benefit of the village people, it is necessary to see that the money spent goes back to the villager. District and local Boards obtain their money from the people, and their purchases must be such as will help to circulate money among the people. . . .
 What the villager needs above all is profitable employment. We steadily deprive him of employment by buying imported articles, and by way of compensation give him lectures, magic-lantern shows and tinned music all at his expense, and pat ourselves on the back that we are working for his welfare. Can anything be more absurd?
 Compare with this what happens if in the place of the motor-van the much despised bullock-cart were used. It can reach the most remote villages
 which a motor-lorry cannot do. It costs only a fraction of the money required for  a van, so that many bullock-carts can be bought, if necessary, to serve groups of villages in the district. The money spent on them goes to the village carpenter, blacksmith and cart-driver. Not a pie of it need go out of the district. . . .
 Rural work and motor-vans appear, therefore, to go ill together. What is required is steady, constructive effort, not lightning speed and empty show. We would commend to local Boards and public institutions genuinely interested in village welfare to start by using only village-made goods, to study the conditions which are steadily producing poverty in the villages, and concentrate on removing them one by one. When every side of village life needs intensive, well-considered effort, it seems a waste of public money to throw it away on methods which attempt to bring about village uplift overnight.
 It is to be hoped that those who interest themselves in village welfare will take to heart the obvious argument advanced in favour of the cart. It will be cruel to destroy the village economy through the very agency designed for village welfare.

347,"August 26, 1939",MACHINE OIL AND “GHANI” OIL,"
  From 	a photostat of the Gujarati: G. N. 7113. Also C.W. 4605. Courtesy: 	Vijayabehn M. Pancholi         	The village ghani, the village chakki, the village 	loom and charkha, and the village sugar-cane-crusher were once 	inseparable parts of the village. The A.I.S.A. and the A.I.V.I.A. 	are trying to 
 revive some of them. We know fairly well how the loom and the charkha can be revived. Khadi has become a science to be mastered in all its aspects. Maganlal Gandhi laid the foundation of that  science.  The village chakki and the village sugar-cane-crusher have yet to discover their science men. But the ghani has. Shri Jhaverbhai Patel  of Maganwadi is studying the ghani in all its aspects with the zeal and precision of a scientist. He has made improvements which he claims have lessened the labour of both men and animals who work at the ghani and have at the same time increased the output of oil. He has studied the oil market and the movement of seeds. The result is that he is today able to sell his oil at almost the bazaar rates and therefore commands a ready market. His oil is superior to the machine product which is, as a rule, adulterated and never fresh. But Shri Jhaverbhai is not satisfied merely because he competes successfuly with the local market in Wardha. He has found out why the machine oil is at all cheaper than the ghani oil. He gives three reasons, two of which are unavoidable. They are capital and the ability of the machine to extract the last drop of oil and that too in a shorter time than the ghani. These advantages are neutralized by the commission. The owner of the mill has to pay to the middleman. But Shri Jhaverbhai cannot cope with the third reason, adulteration, unless he also takes to it. This naturally he will not do. He therefore suggests that adulteration should be dealt with by law. This can be done by enforcing the Anti-adulteration Act if there is one or by enacting it and by licensing oil mills.
 Shri Jhaverbhai has also examined the cause of the decline of the village ghani. The most potent cause is the inability of the oilman to command a regular supply of seeds. The villages are practically denuded of seeds after the season. The oilman has no money to store the seeds, much less to buy them in the cities. Therefore he has disappeared or is fast disappearing. Lakhs of ghanis are today lying idle causing a tremendous waste of the country’s resources. Surely it is the function of the State to resuscitate  the  existing  ghanis  by conserving seeds in the places of their origin and making them available to the village oilman at reasonable rates. The Government loses nothing by giving this aid. It can be given,so Shri Jhaverbhai contends, through co-operative societies or panchayats. If this is done, Shri Jhaverbhai is of opinion, based on  research,  that  ghani  oil  can compete with the machine product and the villager can be spared the infliction of the adulterated oil he gets today. It should be borne in
 mind that the only fat the villager gets, when he gets any, is what the oil can give him. To ghee he is generally a stranger.

348,"August 26, 1939",A MAHARJA’S THREAT,"
    
 I received some weeks ago an important letter from Patiala. It contained such grave statements attributed to the Maharaja Saheb of Patiala that I referred them to him for confirmation or otherwise. It is now more than three weeks since I wrote to him. But I have no reply.libtech_500_footnoteI therefore presume that the statements reported by my correspondent are substantially true. Here is the main part of the letter :
 The Patiala State Praja Mandal launched satyagraha against the Hidayat of 1988libtech_501_footnote, a lawless law curtailing the civil liberties of the people. On our advice the satyagraha was suspended unconditionally. The Publicity Officer, Patiala, on behalf of H.H.’s Government, stated in a Press communique dated 15th April that the Government would repeal or withdraw the aforesaid  Hidayat  within three  to
 four weeks, and further stated that the Government had constituted a Committee to go into its provisions and submit an early report. But the announcement has remained up till now a dead letter. And instead, H.H. has by Ijlas khas orders dated 25th May ordered the strict enforcement of the Hidayat for a period of another
 six months. In view of this, no propaganda of any kind can be carried on by the Praja Mandal workers, the provisions of the Hidayat being very wide and sweeping. The workers arrested in connection with this agitation are still in jail and others are being tried. Apart from this there is at present another movement going on within the State, i.e., between landlords and tenants.
 Some of the Praja Mandal workers were allowed an interview with H. H. on the 18th instant. During the interview H. H. addressed them as follows :
 “My ancestors have won the State by the sword and I mean to keep it by the sword. I do not recognize any organization to represent my people or to speak on their behalf. I am their sole and only representative. No such organization such as Praja Mandal can be allowed to exist within the State. If
 
 you want to do Congress work, get out of the State. The Congress can terrify the British Government, but if it ever tries to interfere in my State it will find me a terrible resister. I cannot tolerate any flag other than my own to be flown within my boundaries. You stop your Praja Mandal activities, otherwise I shall resort to such repression that your generations to come will not forget it. When I see some of my dear subjects drifting away into another fold, it touches the very core of my heart. I advise you to get out of the Mandal and stop all kind of agitation; or else remember I am a military man; my talk is blunt and my bullet straight.”
It may be that my letter never reached the Maharaja Saheb, and
 that if it had, he would have disputed the correctness of my corres- pondent’s letter. If any repudiation is received by me, I shall gladly publish it. But I must say that my correspondent is  a  respon-sible person.
 Assuming then that the Maharaja did make the remarks quoted, it is a serious thing for any Prince, no matter how powerful he is, to use the threats the Maharaja is reported to have done. With due respect to him, I suggest that there is too much awakening among the people throughout India to be suppressed by threats and even corresponding action. The days of unadulterated autocracy are gone for ever. It is possible perhaps by intense frightfulness to suppress the rising spirit of the people for some time. But I am quite sure that it cannot  be  suppressed for all time.
 I have no desire to eliminate the Princes. Friends have  com- plained to me that Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru has, however, made such a statement although the Congress has enunciated no such policy. I have not had the opportunity of asking him about the alleged remark. But assuming that he did make the statement, it can only mean that some Princes are so acting as to bring about their own elimination. It is wrong to judge him by newspaper reports. His considered opinion is to be gathered from his statement on behalf of the Standing Committee of the All-India States People’s Conference. Therein he has even warned people against hasty action. He is much too loyal a Congressman to contemplate any action in advance of known Con-gress policy. Therefore the fear and hatred of the Congress on the part of some Princes are misplaced and are calculated to injure rath er than help them. The Congress is not seeking to interfere directly in the affairs of any State. But the Congress does guide the States people. They are part of the Congress organization. They derive strength and
 inspiration from their connection with the Congress. I do not know how this organic relationship can be avoided. To wish its termination is like an attempt to make children disown their parents. For better or for worse it is well to recognize the fact that
 just as the vast mass of people of British India look up more to the Congress than to the Government for the removal of their woes, even so do the people of the States look to the Congress for their delive-rance. It is under the Congress advice and inspiration that the people of the States say that they want to grow to their full height under the aegis of their respective Princes. I hope, therefore, that the Maharaja Saheb of Patiala and those Princes who hold the opinion attributed to him will revise their views and welcome the movement of their people for liberty to grow to their full height and not regard the reformers in their States as their enemies. It will be well if they will seek Congress aid in the settlement of their people’s demands. But they need not do so, if they distrust Congress friendship. It is enough if they will placate  the advanced section of their people by granting substantial reforms.
 What is worse in my opinion, however, than the alleged threat of the Maharaja is the breach of the promise referred to in my corres- pondent’s letter. There is no doubt so far as I can see that the promise of withdrawal of the Hidayat of 1988 was made; there is equally no doubt that the promise has been broken. It is a dangerous thing even for  a rich and powerful Prince to break his plighted word. Breach of a promise is no less an act of insolvency than a refusal to pay one’s debt.  I plead with the Maharaja Saheb to redeem the promise and hope that his counsellors will advise him to do so.

352,"August 27, 1939",NOTES,"
    
 BOMBAY CORPORATION AND HARIJANS
 The following important resolutions were carried by the Bom-bay Municipal Corporation on 17th and 18th August respectively:
 That the attention of the Commissioner be invited to the absence of bathing and washing facilities for the Municipal Labour Staff, particularly the Health Department sweepers and Drainage Department cleaners, after they finish their work on the streets, and he be requested to report as to whether it would not be desirable to construct a number of special bathrooms and washing places near their centre of work so that they can wash and clean themselves after finishing their day’s duties and return home tidy and refreshed.
 That the attention of the Commissioner be invited to the fact that the dress used by the municipal sweepers and similar other menial staff gets extremely dirty as a result of their condition of work, and that the continuous use of such dress by this class of employees even during off-duty hours presents a very shabby appearance and is harmful to their health, and he be requested to report whether it would not be desirable to provide these employees with working suits which they may put on just before starting their work and take out at the end of their duty.
 The resolutions should have been carried long ago. Both  the  points covered by the resolutions are important as well  for  the employees as the citizens. Sanitation of a big city like Bombay is dependent largely upon the efficiency of the those who are employed to attend to it. And yet all over India they are the least looked after. I needed a Congress majority in the Corporation to pass these necessary resolutions. Let us hope that the Commissioner will report favourably without delay. There can be no objection to the reforms in principle. The objection so as I can see can only be on the score of finance. But in matters such as the sanitary welfare of the city, financial objection can have little weight. Assuming that the report is favourable and not  delayed, there will still be another stage to be gone through before the reforms become accomplished facts, for the necessary sanction of the Corporation will be required. I hope the mover and the seconder of the resolutions will, therefore, not rest till they see washing places and working dresses provided for the sweepers, cleaners and the other members of the labour staff.

            CHI. 	NIMU,       SEGAON, WARDHA,  August 	27, 1939 
  	I got your letter after a long wait. I for one like your idea about 	Bhavnagar. It would be proper for you to settle down there only and 	let Ramdas return at his convenience. He will not willingly let you 	come here. He will be thinking of you all the time. And if he does 	let you come here, you will be able to profit by your stay only if 	he lets you remain for a year. If you can manage that, you may 	depend upon me to make the necessary arrangements for your stay. But 	surely you must agree to stay for at least a year, shouldn’t you? 	It is possible Ramdas may not agree to such a long period.  	Krishnadas has returned. He is being examined. He has no trace at 	all of consumption but he feels extremely weak. He is staying at the 	Mahila Ashram.  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	the Gujarati original: Mrs. Sumitra Kulkarni Papers. Courtesy: Nehru 	Memorial Museum and Library

359,"August 28, 1939",KHADI IN TAMIL NADU,"
    
 The extracts from the half-yearly report of khadi work in Tamil Nadu ending 30th June, published elsewhere in this issue, should be read with interest. The report was followed up by a personal letter from Shri Aiyamuthu, the indefatigable secretary of the Tamil Nadu Branch of the A.I.S.A. Relevant extracts from the letter being very instructive are given below:
 Three years have passed since the first attempt was made for determining a minimum living wage for the spinners. The second step has also been taken since the Ist of this month. There has been a definite increase in the earnings of spinners, though it is not exactly the same as we aim at. A lot of spade-work has been done towards improving the spinning and carding efficiency of the spinner. Use of machine-ginned lint has been given up and kapas has been made the basis  of all spinning. Improved implements have been distributed. The age-old village charkha has been rejuvenated by the addition of a transformer. The time has now come to pause and consider all the changes that have resulted from this step.
 You have always visualized khadi only as part of the home economics of the villager. Our ancients gave us the small wheel and the spindle as their heritage for all posterity. In this their idea was that each home should spin enough for its own immediate requirements. They viewed production only from the viewpoint of the natural consumer, that is, the producer and his family or at the most the village. May be the village   weaver took  a few cloths   to   the
 shandylibtech_511_footnotelibtech_512_footnote. But the commercial aspect of utilizing the spinning-wheel for catering
 to the needs of distant consumers never occured to them.
 Till 1935, when the first step towards increasing the wages of spinners was taken, the Association had been looking more to the interest  of  the consumer than to that of the spinner. The Association always aimed at bringing down the price of khadi, thereby enabling more and more people to purchase it. It acted as a check against individuals entering the field and trying to exploit the consumer. Very few persons were willing to take to khadi business and the few who entered the field fell back as soon as they found that khadi did not pay them up to their expectations.
 The spinner till 1935 was able to earn on an average only  four annas  per lb. as spinning wages. Spinners who spun yarn above the average quality
 
 were paid a little more, the maximum being six annas per lb. In those days when a spinner was fined a mere pice she felt the loss so keenly that sometimes she burst into tears. In the same way, the addition of a copper or two to her expectations brought forth a ray of smile on her face. A copper more or less made  all the difference in her outlook. It appeared so big.
 In 1936, without her asking for it, the spinning wage has been increased far beyond her wildest expectations. While in 1935 the average spinning wage per lb. of yarn was only four annas, in 1938 it is Re. 0-12-3, i e., her wage has  been increased by 200 per cent. This should naturally have resulted in inducing her to spin better, to spin more twisted and even yarn. But this has not been the case. The only reaction to our efforts at improving the standard of living of the spinner has been that in a vague way she feels that she is being paid more, vastly more, than is due to her labour. So much so that when she is penalized for spinning yarn of an inferior quality she does not feel it at all. We pay the full wages only for yarn that meets all our rigid tests. The spinner feels it is not a loss to her to be paid ten annas per lb. She is not sorry if she is paid only eight annas. She does not care even if it is only six annas since it is a 50-per-cent increase on her own estimate of her labour and there is always a man who is willing to purchase it at that price. He does not use the rigid tests of the Association. He is always glad to purchase it at that value. It is the uncertified dealer, who pays 50 per cent of the wages paid by us and markets the cloth produced of that yarn at 75 to 80 per cent of our standard rates. Since 1936 we have interested ourselves more in the spinner than in the consumer. We have aimed at getting the maximum out of the consumer and paying it to the spinner. And the uncertified dealer (his number is increasing day by day) is given a free hand to exploit both the spinner and the consumer. The result is that in spite of an increase in wages and that without her asking for it, we are not able to show a corresponding improvement in the quality.
 The increase in spinning wages has resulted also in more women registering themselves as spinners. Till 1935 spinning wages were  not  attractive enough to make the spinner sit at the wheel as a full-time worker. But with the increase of wages she has found spinning a profitble whole-time work. The value of our production has risen from Rs. 6 lakhs in 1936 to Rs. 16 lakhs in 1938. With the capital resources we have, it is not possible to purchase all the yarn that is produced. Nor have the sales increased in corresponding degree. We are forced to reject yarn from many who naturally sell their yarn  to  the uncertified dealer on his own terms, thus enabling him to undersell us.
 Since 1936 we have always held the view that the producer should be the prime consumer, and that what is produced in excess of the producers’ needs should alone be marketed. With this end in view the spinners have been asked to deposit with us a portion of their output for their own use and the balance alone  is being purchased. This deposit has increased from 13 per cent of the total production in 1936 to 31 per cent in 1938. This percentage can be raised to any limit but for the trouble with the uncertified dealer. Perhaps his activities are at its worst in this case. He is not above purchasing the cloth thus distributed by us at a low price and selling the same elsewhere at a profit. In this instance he is doing more harm than even the vendor of mill-cloth.
 The remedy for all this lies perhaps in localizing khadi. Khadi must not be made a commercial product, produced in villages to be sold in distant towns. As at present the spinner thinks she is spinning not so much for her own requirements and that of her family as for selling the yarn for an unknown destination. As such she does not understand, nor does she want to, what quality of yarn she has to spin. We are not able to control the count of the yarn to suit our requirements. If we are to produce khadi only for sale, we are bound to study the requirements of the consumer. We have to study what is required and how much to produce and in what quality. In the case of an organized industry like the mill, it is possible to so regulate the production that only what is wanted is produced. The entire spinning is done in a limited space and the spindles are inanimate things working to a definite motion and spinning what is wanted. In the case of khadi it is not so. The spinner and her spindle are different entities. She lives and thinks independently of us. But if she is induced to spin only for her own immediate wants, she will understand what she needs, what quality of yarn to spin and how much of it to spin. And if there is any surplus, it can be collected by a central organization which will find a market for it. It may be that the village panchayat can be authorized to hold in deposit the surplus yarn produced in the village and to sell it at the price which will ensure the spinner a standard wage for the hours of work she has put in producing the same.
 A workers’ conference was held at Tirupur on 27th June when Shri Shankerlal Banker addressed the workers. The question of a further increase in spinning wages was raised. Of the 93 workers who had assembled only two were for an enhancement. The rest were opposed to it, not  because they were averse to giving the spinner something more but becuase such enhancement  does not bring the desired result. The increased wage does not improve the quality of production. Not only that. That uncertified dealer is given greater
 scope to exploit both the spinner and the consumer. We feel helpless, not being able to control nefarious activities of the uncertified dealer. We were not able to clarify our position well to Shri Shankerlalji. We are not sure that we have fared any better now. We would only request you to view the problem from our point of view and realize our difficulties.
 Perhaps the only remedy for this is for the Government to step in and
 give the spinner the protection that is her due. She must be saved in spite of herself. It may be that the price of hand-spun yarn should be determined by an act  of legislation and it be made an offence against the State to purchase yarn at a lower rate. It may also be made an offence for anybody to purchase yarn from a spinner, when the spinner herself is in need of the same for her clothings. The village panchayat or on its behalf the A.I.S.A. may be authorised to hold in deposit the surplus yarn in the village for sale at the scheduled rates. With the Congress Ministries at the helm of affairs in the different provinces it is not impossible to bring in this piece of protective legislation. We only pray that you give the matter your consideration and advise the different Ministries to bring suitable legislation.
The secretary is an impatient enthusiast. Both enthusiasm and
 impatience are good up to a point in any great venture. Khadi is the greatest I have been able to conceive inasmuch as it conserves the simultaneous good of millions of human beings without regard to status or religion. It can therefore take in as many impatient enthu-siasts as will come to it provided that they are honest, pure, incorrup-tible and unselfish. And impatient enthusiasts will have to remember that in the end only coolness, patience and tireless research will win.
Let me now examine Shri Aiyamuthu’s difficulties.
  Uncertified 	dealers are a 	curse; they are 	enemies of 	their own 	sisters which the 	spinners are; 	they are enemies of 	progress and 	ulti- mately 	of themselves. 	But the royal 	road to neutralize 	their mis-chievous 	activities is 	to buy all the yarn that 	the spinners 	produce. This is a 	matter of 	pure arithmetic. 	Shri Aiyamuthu 	is the 	sole con-troller 	of higher prices. 	He can 	pay even eight annas per 	day to the 	choicest spinners. 	They are useful 	for his laboratory 	work. He 	will regulate 	their number. 	He will 	buy up 	all the other 	yarn at the 	price lower, 	than under the 	increased scale, if 	the spinners are 	willing to 	sell their yarn. He 	will thus 	automatically eliminate 	the uncertified dealer, 	so far as 	yarn  is 	concerned. I 	know that is 	a dangerous experiment, 	if   the 	experimenter  is 	not always, 	in all 	that he is doing, 	thinking solely of the 	spinners and 	the ideal wage he is anxious to pay to each one of them. If he fulfils this 
 
 condition, having got hold of every spinner and eliminated the uncertified dealer, he will educate the former in the art of getting a better wage for her work. In the end she will know with whom she should deal and she will be a willing pupil. Then the secret sale of khadi meant for the spinners’ use will automatically stop.
  I 	wholly endorse the 	proposition that 	khadi should be 	decentralized to 	the extent 	that each village produces its 	own cotton and 	manufactures its 	own cloth. If 	there is 	a surplus, it 	should be 	sold where 	it is wanted, 	e.g., in 	the cities 	or places 	where cotton is not 	grown and 	where it will 	be cheaper 	to take 	khadi from 	the nearest khadi 	centre. This 	deal will only be 	reached when each branch 	selects one village 	and attempts 	to carry 	out the experiment 	which will require the 	best expert. I 	settled in 	Segaon in 	order to 	carry out 	this among 	other ideals, but I 	must confess 	that I 	seem to 	be as far from it 	as when I 	came here three years ago. 	They need not expect 	miracles to take 	place immediately 	they go 	to villages; and 	they should 	take heart 	from the 	fact that if 	I could 	show little or nothing 	after three years of 	stay in 	a village, 	they need 	not despair 	nor be 	ashamed if 	after due 	effort they 	cannot show 	results.  It 	will induce 	lethargy among workers if 	they expect 	Congress Governments 	to work wonders. 
 Unscrupulous men will run a coach and four through any legis- lation. Congress Governments have their limitations. At the same time some help is possible through legislation. I have already pointed out the direction in which legislation can help. Dealing in khadi by uncertified vendors should be penalized. Khadi can have protection through subsidy as was done in the case of the Tatas, and the subsidy can be raised by taxing the sales of mill manufactures. The fines collected from uncertified dealers may also, subject to deduction for expenses, be paid to the A.I.SA.
  The 	question of sales is 	undoubtedly a 	problem. I 	have discussed this question in a previous articlelibtech_513_footnotelibtech_514_footnote. But there is no doubt that Congressmen 	should make 	all their 	purchases of cloth from 	khadi bhandars. 	By properly 	handling the whole 	question, Government— 	Congress and 	non-Congress—can help 	khadi and 	thus themselves in 
 
 the shape of giving employment to the unemployed with the mini-mum of expenditure.

 WILL THEY LEARN ?
 Hirdaynath Baijal was a medical student in Agra. Whenever I pass through big stations after a lapse of time there are as a rule wild demonstrations. For causes I have not been able to divine, there were wilder demonstrations during my recent journey to the Frontier Province and wilder still on return from there. Such a demonstration took place at Agra on the 27th ultimo. My ears cannot cope with the noises however affectionate they may be. Plugging with cotton wool does not answer. I have to plug them with my fingers as hard as I can in order to deaden the noise. The demonstrators are themselves so lost in their frenzy that they do not listen to the piteous appeals I and my companions make to them. It is not their fault. They do not know what is being said to them. And they cannot understand why persons in whose honour demonstrations are made should resent them. They make no distinction between night and day. This Agra demonstration took place at night. Among the demonstration was Hirdaynath. He boarded the train in order to reach me and get my autograph. Before he could come near my compartment he slipped and fell. The train moved and ran over him, and he had to lose his legs.
 A correspondent suggests that the railway authorities could have or should have managed the crowd, that the train should have been stopped in time, and that first aid was not provided as it should have been. Be that as it may, the fact of the injury to Hirdaynath remains. Kind correspondents kept themselves in touch with me after  the  accident. Hirdaynath’s father too wrote to me. I was thus able to write a word of cheer to the young man and give such consolation as I could to his father and his friends. Unfortunately in spite of the best treatment he breathed his last on the 22nd instant. My heart goes out to  the  deceased’s father and his friends. The reason why I pen these lines is to warn the public against these demonstrations in which no order is kept.  If demonstrations there must be, and I suppose there will be, they must
 
 be regulated either by the demonstrators themselves or the police. This is the second accident within the past few months. One took place on my return from Brindabanlibtech_515_footnote. There also the injured party was a student. Fortunately he has lived, though without a leg. Hirdaynath seems to have been a student of exceptional qualities and a great favourite with the students. I suggest to the students that the very best way in which they can treasure the memory of their dear comrade is by organizing a discipline brigade whose mission would be to introduce order in demonstrations, meetings and other crowds. With ever-increasing mass awakening we need to know the laws governing the conduct and movement of crowds so as to enable vast masses to gather together without fuss, noise or disturbance.

 MY DEAR JUGLAL,
 I have a copy of your letter to Kripalani. Three years is the limit. If Ministers can bring about prohibition in a year, they are expected to do so. Conversely, if in spite of great effort they cannot finish the programme within the prescribed period, they will not be blamed. Three years should be counted from the date of the Congress resolution.

I 	thought it my duty to accommodate him as much as I could and do my 	best to win him over. I still think so. Despite my differences with 	Lokamanya, I regard myself as his devotee. I had the highest regard 	for his learning, patriotism and courage.  	There is no truth at all in Swami Satyadev’s statement. I could 	never say such a thing. If I did, my truth and ahimsa would stand 	disgraced. I do believe, of course, that he would resort to untruth 	and violence for the sake of the country. He himself told me so.

 DEAR VAIDYANATHA IYER,
 Under separate cover I send you the papers received from Shri Prasada Rao. I would like you to give me your reply to his allegations. He seems to be a seasoned co-worker. Why is it difficult to win him over if his allegations are untrue? If they are true, there is something wrong about the whole affair.

            DEAR 	FRIEND,       SEGAON, WARDHA,  August 	30, 1939 
  	I have carefully read all the voluminous papers you have sent me. 	You won’t expect me to express an opinion without knowing what 	those have to say against whom you have brought serious charges. I 	am     
 therefore sending the papers in the first instance to Shri Vaidyanatha Iyer.libtech_541_footnoteBut I observe  that  you  have  been  a  co-worker  with  all  those against whom you feel aggrieved. I suggest, therefore, that it is your duty to see their viewpoint and discover a basis for common service. You can still adopt this course.
 As for the Rao Bahadur, I asked the very parties to whom he had referred me and they point-blank repudiated his statements.
I took him at his word and naturally believed his referees.
 Yours sincerely,

  	I read your long letter last night. The scene at Abbottabad rose 	before my eyes when I had scolded you and you had cried. I cannot 	forget your face as it looked then. Now when I think of my heart- 	lessness my heart cries. Your answer to D. was correct.  	You are faced with three questions: coming to me, fear as to what 	would happen if you came and your duty towards Mother. Your fear is 	meaningless. If you can learn to be tolerant, what do you have to 	fear and why? Can you not be content with serving me, and looking 	after the sick and working in the mess?’ The problem concerning 	Mother is very important. It is your duty as well as mine to thin 	about it independently. But I do not have anything on which to base 	a decision. Pyarelal can be of little help in the matter. You alone 	should think calmly over it. You must also assess your own strength. 	My feeling is that Mother will have to come here and be with you. 	Not now. Let your dispensary be ready; let me have a room built for 	you. Then, too, there will be the question whether Mother can leave 	Mohanlal. You have to carry a great burden. You can decide the 	matter even after coming here on the 16th. Do not be afraid. God 	will be your guide. You do not have to get away before the 15th. 	Com-plete what you have undertaken.

       An 	educationist writes :       RURAL 	v. URBAN 
  If 	you do not take care, you will find that basic education in urban 	areas will take a different form from the rural areas. For instance 	English will be introduced to the injury of the mother tongue and a 	kind of superiority complex developed. 
 I must confess that my scheme was conceived in terms of the villages, and when I was developing it I did say that some variation will be necessary in applying the scheme to the cities. This had reference to the industries to be used as media of instruction. I never thought that English could ever find place in the primary stage. And the scheme has so far concerned itself only with the primary stage. No doubt the  primary stage is made equivalent to the matriculation, less English. To inflict English on children is to stunt their natural growth and perhaps to kill originality in them. Learning of a language is primarily a training in developing memory. Learning of English from the beginning is an unnecessary tax on a child. He can only learn it at the expense of the mother tongue. I hold it to be as necessary for the urban child as for the rural to have the foundation of his development laid on the solid rock of the mother tongue. It is only in unfortunate India that such an obvious proposition needs to be proved.

379,"August 31, 1939",LIMBDI,"
    
 Though I have had protracted correspondence with the Limbdi people, I have refrained for a long time from saying anything about their woes. My silence was due to the hope that those who were trying to bring about peace between the Ruler and the people would succeed. But it was a vain hope. Much has happened since the beginning stages of that struggle. Perhaps nowhere has the policy of ruthlessness been pursued with so much precision and persistence as in Limbdi. If the reports received by me are to be believed, and I have no reason to disbelieve them, the peasants have been hunted out of their homes. The heaviest blow has been aimed at the hated Bania who was at one time the State’s friend, favourite and main supporter. But he was to be crushed because he dared to think and talk of responsible govern-ment, dared to go amongst the peasantry and tell them what was due to them and how they could get it. The shops and houses of these merchants who have performed  hijratlibtech_542_footnotelibtech_543_footnoteare practically looted. I cannot use any other term. There has not even been, so far as I know, any legal formality observed. The will of the administrator of the policy of ruthlessness is the supreme law.The idea is to terrorize the people into
 
 subjection. No wonder some have weakened. I would advise those who are in charge of the movement not to try to keep them from surren- dering. Of course they should be told what is in store for them. But there are people who prize possessions before honour. They can only be a burden on a freedom movement. Free-dom is always won by a few brave self-sacrificing souls who will stake everything for the sake of honour. Those who understand the value and the necessity of sacri-fice, whether they are few or many, should feel glad that their posse-ssions in Limbdi have been taken away. They should not live in sus-pense nor entertain any hope of immediate settlement. They should engage in healthy pursuits outside the State, always in the firm faith that a day must come when the people of Limbdi will come into their own. When that day comes, as it must, it will have come because of the sacrifice and the bravery of those who will have refused to bend before repression, however severe. Let them remember Thoreau’s immortal words that possession is a vice and poverty a virtue in a tyrannical State.
 So much on reliable evidence before me. But should Limbdi be a tyrannical State? If there is exaggeration in the statements made to me, let the State authorities send me a contradiction. I would gladly publish it. Better still will be an impartial judicial inquiry into the allegations made, if they are disputed. I wish to make a public appeal to  the  Thakore Saheb of Limbdi. I have the privilege of knowing him. I have enjoyed his hospitality. He has the reputation of being a pious, Godfearing man. It is not right that there should be this estrangement between him and his people, some of whom are well-known people with a reputation to lose and a stake in Limbdi. It would be wrong to regard them all as a discontented lot. They have no axes to grind. They have not earthly gain to make by ranging themselves against the State. They have incurred much material loss by becoming exiles from their own home. A wise ruler will think fifty times before facing the discontent of such people. He will conclude from it that there must be misrule and injustice on the part of his officials. He will summon the discontented people, listen to their complaints and pacify them. The Thakore Saheb has not adopted that course. It is not too late for him to do so even now.

         SEGAON, WARDHA,  August 	31, 1939  MY 	DEAR THANU PILLAI, I 	wish you had given me more time but I suppose you could not.  	I do not like the Dewan’s reply. I think that you should make your 	own position clear. You should see that the State Congress does not 	propose to do anything in secret. Whilst, therefore, its decisions 	will be its own and it will not bring any outsider inside the State, 	it will, whenever necessary, seek the advice and guidance of persons 	outside Travancore. You would also make it clear that whilst any 	scheme that might be hammered into shape by mutual consultation will 	be loyally worked by the Congress, the end in view in working the 	scheme will always be to make an advance, even through the scheme, 	towards responsible government.  	If these two positions are in any way left in doubt negotiations 	should be dropped and you should do such work, constructive and 	other, as is possible to do.  	In all your talks and writings offensive and highflown language 	should be scrupulously eschewed. And in season and out of season     
 you should reiterate the two conditions above made. They should be held good for all time.
 You should cease to think of the prisoners. The fact of their being in jail is their unique contribution, provided that they appreciate the fact that being in jail as model prisoners is part of their struggle.
 I hope the forthcoming meeting will be successful and that those who gather together at Kayankulam will more and more appreciate the efficacy of self-imposed restraint and quiet, silent, persistent constructive work, however small it may appear to be.libtech_548_footnote

389,,THAT UNBECOMING DEMONSTRATION,"
  From 	the Gujarati original: Payarelal Papers. Nehru Memorial Museum and 	Library. Courtesy: Beladevi Nayyar and Dr. Sushila Nayyar         	The first I heard of the black-flag demonstration against Subhas 	Babu on his visit to Patna was through a courteous letter received 	from the Secretary of the Bengali Association of Bankipore.libtech_550_footnoteI then saw a    
 notice of it in the Press. To make myself sure of what had happened I wired to Shri P. R. Das for an authentic and up-to-date account. He replied from Dhanbad saying he was away from the scene and knew nothing. The newspapers reported that there was stone-throwing and hurling of shoes resulting in injuries to Swami Sahajanand and others.
 Allowing for exaggeration, if any, there seems to be little doubt that there was a hostile demonstration of an unseemly nature which brought no credit to the Congress.
 I have read Rajendra Babu’s eloquent statement on the unhappy incident. It is so true and so heart-stirring that it admits of no addition or embellishment. I endorse every word of that noble pronouncement. It is reproduced below this article.libtech_551_footnote
 The demonstrators showed an unworthy intolerance. Subhas Babu has a perfect right to agitate against the actionlibtech_552_footnoteof  the  Working
 Committee and canvass public opinion against it. The disciplinary action frees him from any liability for restraint save what every Con- gressman, pledged to the credal article of the Constitution, is bound to put on himself. That action should save him from any further demonstration of public displeasure. And those who disapprove of the action of the Working Committee are certainly entitled to join any demonstration in favour of Subhas Babu. Unless this simple rule is observed we shall never evolve democracy. In my opinion the black- flag demonstrators have rendered a disservice to the cause of freedom. It is to be hoped that the Patna demonstration will prove to be the last of such acts by Congressmen. The question may be asked, ‘How are those who endorse the action of the Working Committee and dis-approve of Subhas Babu’s propaganda to show their disapproval?’ Certainly not through black flags and disturbing of meetings in honour of Subhas Babu. They can express their dis-approval by holding counter meetings, not at the same time as the others but either before or after them. These meetings, both for and against, should be regarded as a means of educating public opinion. Such education re-quires calm surroundings. Black flags, noisy slo-gans, and hurling of stones and shoes have no place in educative and instructive propa-ganda.
 
 Apropos of the ugly demonstration I must refer to a complaint I have received that some Congress Committees have threatened action against those Congressmen who may take part in receptions to Subhas Babu. I hope that the complaint has no foundation in fact. Such  action will betray intolerance and may even be a sign of vindictive- ness. Congressmen who dislike the Working Committee’s action are bound to take part in receptions to Subhas Babu. It is im-possible to gag them by threats of disciplinary measures. Such action loses its value if it is resorted to on the slightest pretext. If it is true, as it is true, that no organization can do without such powers, it is equally true that no organization that makes free use of such powers has any right to exist. It cannot. It has then obviously lost the public backing.

 TEXT BOOKS
 The craze for ever-changing text books is hardly a healthy sign from the educational standpoint. If text books are treated as a vehicle for education, the living word of the teacher has very little value. A teacher who teaches from text books does not impart originality to his pupils. He himself becomes a slave of text books and has no oppor- tunity or occasion to be original. It, therefore, seems that, the less text books there are the better it is for the teacher and his pupils. Text books seem to have become an article of commerce. Authors and publishers who make writing and publishing a means of  making money are interested in frequent change of text books. In many cases teachers and examiners are themselves authors of text books. It is naturally to their interest to have their books sold. The selection  board is again naturally composed of such people. And so the vicious circle becomes complete. And it becomes very difficult for parents to find money for new books every year. It is a pathetic sight to see boys and girls going to school loaded with books which they are ill able to carry. The whole system requires to be thoroughly examined. The commercial spirit needs to be entirely eliminated and the question approached solely in the interest of the scholars. It will then probably be found that 75 percent of the text books will have to be consigned to the scrap-heap. If I had my way, I would have books largely as aids to teachers rather than for the scholars. Such text books as are found to be absolutely necessary for the scholars should circulate among them for a number of years so that the cost can be easily
 
 borne by middle-class families. The first step in this direction is perhaps for the State to own and organize the printing and publishing of text books. This will act as an automatic check on their unnecessary multiplication.
 DIVIDED LOYALTY?
Shri Appa Patwardhan writes :
 The Bombay Government spend a large sum in helping weavers. They have appointed a marketing officer and salesmen. They give loans. Yet the weavers cannot compete with mills and in my opinion the expenses incurred do not bear fruit. Moreover the weavers use foreign yarn as well. Side by side with this fruitless help the Government render some help to khadi also. I do not know how far this divided loyalty is justified.
I have always held the opinion that help to the weavers who use
 foreign or Indian mill-yarn is a waste of money and effort. Expe- rience has not changed the view. Nor does it change because in certain provinces the Congress rules. I hold this view because the disappea- rance of the weaver of mill-yarn is a question of time only. In the nature of things it cannot be otherwise. The weavers’ only hope lies in a universal revival of hand-spinning. Hand-spinning and hand-weav- ing are interde-pendent, never hand-weaving and  mill-spinning.  I have, therefore, suggested that if hand-spinning cannot immediately supply the weavers’ requirements, they should be induced to intro- duce hand-spinning, carding, etc., in their own families if they will not become spinners themselves. Now that in several provinces the Con- gress rules, the saving of the weaver becomes casier. Thus the Govern- ment can encourage spinning on a wide scale, guarantee the loss in khadi sales as the State guarantees the foreign railway companies. It is the primary duty of the State to guarantee employment of his choice to everyone in need of it. This includes the weavers also. If during the transition stage it is found impossible to guarantee weaving for every weaver, the State has to find him some other employment, profitable alike to the State and the individual. It should be borne in mind that the possibilities of hand-spinning have not yet been explored by any Government. I am of opinion that such investigation will yield star- tlingly encouraging results. My argument undoubtedly assumes the elimination of all mills from conside-ration. No industry, indigenous or foreign, can be allowed to increase un- employment and thus harm the true interest of the community as a whole.
 WAYS OF FAMINE RELIEF
 Though the most terrible distress that was feared has  been averted by the falling of rains, however belated, some distress is bound to continue for a few months, and it will be unwise for relief agencies to go to sleep. What is more, time is now more propitious for devising measures for making permanent provisions for preventing distress caused by scarcity of water. I have already made some cardinal suggestions in this direction. The Secretary of the Saurashtra Seva Samiti sends me a business-like report of the elaborate steps taken by that body for enlisting helpers and providing relief. I need not detain the reader over them. He also suggests preventive methods. As these are still seasonable I give below the substance, the original being in Gujarati:
  The 	States should refrain 	from auctioning 	their stock of grass 	but they 	should store it as a 	precaution against 	dry year. 	The store 	should be replaced 	when fresh 	store becomes avai- 	lable. There is 	nowadays danger 	of the 	stacks being destroyed 	by incendiaries. 	The States 	should have no 	difficulty in 	protec- ting them. They 	may even 	allow private collectors 	to deposit 	their stores in 	such areas.  The 	existing banks should be 	renovated and 	flood water 	should be banked.  In 	the places 	where cattle are moved 	during famine 	times, measures 	should be 	taken to 	ensure proper water 	supply for 	the cattle.  There 	should be control 	over the 	cultivation of 	money crops 	to the 	detriment of 	food crops. 	Thus people 	nowadays sow 	ground-nuts in 	the place of 	most valuable 	fodder and food 	crops, i.e., jawari 	and bajri.  Existing 	forests should 	be preserved, 	indiscriminate cutting 	of trees 	should be made 	punishable, and 	people should 	be encouraged 	to plant 	trees according to plan.  The 	management of 	pinjrapoles should 	be put 	on a 	sound basis and they 	should become efficient 	famine insurance 	agencies for 	cattle. They should 	become castration depots.  The 	State should encourage 	khadi as a famine 	insurance measure. 
 All these suggestions seem to be sound and deserve the collective consideration of the States and the people of Kathiawar. In this
 humantarian project all can and should combine in spite of political differences and struggles.
 SACRIFICIAL SPINNING IN ANDHRA
 Shri Shankerlal Banker sends me a letter he has received from the Andhra Branch of the A.I.S.A. I take the following from it :
 On seeing Mahatmaji’s note in Harijan dated July 22, 1939,libtech_555_footnotewe concieved the idea of performing sacrificial spinning (sutra yajna)  on  the
 lines followed by Sjt. Narandas Gandhi of Rajkot Rashtriyashala. Accor- dingly we sent an appeal on July 29, 1939, to the local Krishna Patrikalibtech_556_footnoteand the Andhra Patrikalibtech_557_footnotefor publication, calling for applications from  khadi lovers who would participate in the  sutra yajna  performed under the auspices
 of the Andhra Branch in connection with the ensuing Gandhi Jayanti. All participants are requested to offer 14,000 (70  200) yards of self-spun yarn or 70 coppers (Rs. 1-1-6) in terms of his present age. We find a ready response to our call. Till now we have received 500 applications. Many applicants offer 14,000 yards of yarn or Rs. 1-1-6 in cash. But some poor spinners offer only 7,000 yards of yarn and we accept their offer in consideration of their poverty, though they fall short of the minimum fixed in our appeal. Now we are going to issue a special appeal to the spinners in the Andhra Desh to contribute 7,000 yards (nearly one warp) as a birthday gift to Mahatmaji on his 71st birthday. In our appeal all A.I.S.A. workers were requested to give yarn contributions only. In our central stores and central office sacrificial spinning has been going on for the last 15 days since August 2, 1939. Some have been spinning on the takli and some others on the improved charkha. The workers
 are asked to improve and note the quality and quantity of their yarn. We have requested the Andhra Povincial Congress Committee to help us in enlisting volunteers for  sutra yajna  and see that all members of Congress committees
 participate in it. In compliance with our request they issued a circular to all Congress members to enrol themselves as volunters for sutra yajna and help the khadi movement to the best of their ability. We hope to enlist at least 1,000 volunteers before Gandhi Jayanti.
 I have letters from other quarters also showing that  Shri Narandas Gandhi’s example has caught on. I hope that the organizers are carrying out strictest economy in organizing sacrificial spinning. They may not, for instance, move the yarn spun from place to place resulting in the cost of postage being incurred. Yarn should be collected by appointed agents so that there can be hand to hand
 
 
 delivery. If an authentic account is kept and published, it should be accepted as completion of the yajna. Those who intend to account to Narandas Gandhi for their spinning need only send him certificates of their spinning. I suggest too that as far as possible yarn should be locally woven. It is against the spirit of the khadi movement to concentrate weaving in fixed places. As spinning has to be universal in every home, weaving should be universal in every village.

 I published some time ago facts relating to Nallathur Harijans.libtech_558_footnoteShri K. Tatachar sent me some time ago the notes from his diary of the no less serious ill-treatment of the Harijans of Tenpatnam Cheri. I publish themlibtech_559_footnotebelow in full.
 This seems to be a case of gross failure of justice and the matter, though comparatively old, requires investigation. There has been no remissness on the part of the people or their friends to secure redress. But if Shri Tatachar’s recital is accurate, justice was denied to the Harijans because they were Harijans. The police belonging to the lowest grade should be taught that they have to serve Harijans equally with the others. Harijans ought to be able to feel that during the Congress regime at least they can get justice.

 THE RICH ARE TRUSTEES
A friend writes :
 You will be glad to know that your view about the trustee- ship of the rich was anticipated 1,300 years ago. The following verse occurs in the sacred Hadis :
 Whatever is possessed by people is my property, the poor are my family, the wealthy are the trustees of the riches they possess. Therefore the wealthy
 
 persons who will not spend on behalf of my poor children, will go to Hadis.
 And I will not worry about them.
 My correspondent’s letter which is in Gujarati gives in Gujarati script the whole verse with its translation in Gujarati contained in a newspaper whose name he has not given. Here is the original text in Devanagari :
 The curious reader will observe that twenty-five per cent of the words are easily understood by a Gujarati reader. In other words, they have become current in the language.

 SIMLA,
  September 	5, 1939 At Delhi, 	as I 	was entraining 	for Kalka, 	a big 	crowd sang in perfect good humour, 	to the 	worn-out refrain of 	“Mahatma 	Gandhiki jai” 	. “We do not want any understanding”. I had then my 	weekly  	silence. Therefore I merely smiled. And those who were standing on 	the footboard returned the smile with their smile, whilst they were 	admonishing me not to have any understanding with the Viceroy. I had 	also a letter from a Congress Committee giving me similar warn- ing. 	Neither of these counsellors knew me. I did not need the warning to 	know my limitations. Apart from the Delhi demonstration and a 	Congress Committee’s warning, it is my duty to tell the public 	what happened at the interviewlibtech_569_footnotewith H. E. the Viceroy.  	I knew that I had no authority to speak for any person except 	myself.libtech_570_footnoteI 	knew that I had no instructions whatsoever from the Work- ing 	Committee in the matter. I had answered a telegraphic invitation and 	taken the first train I could catch. And what is more, with my 	irrepressible and out-and-out non-violence, I knew that I could not 	represent the national mind and I should cut a sorry figure if I 	tried to do so. I told His Excellency as much. Therefore there could 	be no question of any understanding or negotiation with me. Nor, I 	saw, had he sent for me to negotiate. I have returned from the 	Viceregal Lodge empty-handed and without any understanding, open or 	secret. If there is to be any understanding,libtech_571_footnoteit would be between the Congress and the Government.  	Having, therefore, made my position vis-a-vis the Congress quite 	clear, I told His Excellency that my own sympathies were with Eng- 	land and France from the purely humanitarian standpoint. I told him 	that I could not contemplate without being stirred to the very depth 	the destruction of London which had hitherto been regarded as 	impregnable. And as I was picturing before him the Houses of Parlia- 	ment and the Westminster Abbey and their possible destruction, I         
 broke down. I have become disconsolate. In the secret of my heart I am in perpetual quarrel with God that He should allow such things to go on. My non-violence seems almost impotent. But the answer comes at the end of the daily quarrel that neither God nor non-violence is impotent. Impotence is in men. I must try on without losing faith even though I may break in the attempt.
 And so, as though in anticipation of the agony that was awaiting me, I sent on the 23rd July from Abbottabad the following letterlibtech_572_footnoteto Herr Hitler.
 How I wish that even now he would listen to reason and the appeal from almost the whole of thinking mankind, not excluding the German people themselves. I must refuse to believe that Germans contemplate with equanimity the evacuation of big cities like London for fear of destruction to be wrought by man’s inhuman ingenuity. They cannot contemplate with equanimity such destruction of them- selves and their own monuments. I am not therefore just now thinking of India’s deliverance. It will come, but what will it be worth if Eng- land and France fall, or if they come out victorious over Germany ruined and humbled ?
 Yet it almost seems as if Herr Hitler knows no God but brute force and, as Mr. Chamberlain says, he will listen to nothing else. It is in the midst of this catastrophe without parallel that Congressmen and all other responsible Indians individually and collectively have to decide what part India is to play in this terrible drama.libtech_573_footnote

 SURPLUS KHADIlibtech_580_footnote
 Under the impulse of the phenomenal rise in the spinners’ wages, voluntarily made by the A. I. S. A., there has been a great output of yarn. It has been difficult everywhere to cope with the khadi thus produced. In Tamil Nadu alone khadi production shot up to nearly 15 lakhs from about five and a half lakhs and the sales increased to only 11 lakhs from nearly nine lakhs. I have already dealt with the difficulty in the U. P.libtech_581_footnotelibtech_582_footnoteThese are  only typical instances. The difficulty is almost universal. I have suggested that khadi experts should study this aspect of it in a scientific manner and discover the remedy. This research work, like all other research work, will take time. Meanwhile the surplus stock must be cleared. It is up to the patriotic public to come to the assistance. I have no love for the celebration of my birthday. Any other day is as good or as bad as a birthday. My parents, so far as I recollect, never celebrated the birthdays of their children. I remember the date of my birthday only because I had to take the birth certificate for the London exami- nation. But I never thought of the date until after the rebirth of khadi. Khadi-lovers made the date of my birth an occasion  for  pushing khadi sales. I did not mind such exploitation of my birthday but tried with more or less success to give it the name of Rentia Jayanti so far as the Gujarati-speaking public was concerned. For it was they who first set the vogue for celebrating the date. Ever since, the Khadi Week has been celebrated in many parts of India for popularizing khadi and
 
 village products. Khadi-lovers are setting much store by the forthcoming 2nd October according to the Christian calendar and the 10th October according to the Vikram Samvat. U. P., Tamil Nadu and other provinces have issued khadi hundis for which they expect a heavy demand in expectation of the coming celebration. Special fuss is being made because I shall have completed seventy years on those dates, assuming of course that I shall survive till then. But whether I do or not the dates will come unfailingly. And if it is of any value to the public to know it, let them know that my spirit, whether embodied or disembodied, will certainly rejoice to think that there are sufficient men and women in India who will combine always to take up, for the sake of Daridranarayana, all the khadi that can be produced by the semi-starved villagers. Let no one plead the war as an excuse for not buying khadi. War or no war, so long as there is life in us, we shall need to feed and clothe ourselves. What can be better than that we cover ourselves with cloth produced through the labours of the needy sisters and brothers of the villages?
 PLEA FOR S ELF-DENIAL
 Shri Banker writes to say that the prices of foreign dyes have considerably gone up owing to the war. In order to make khadi attractive, the A. I. S. A. have allowed the use of foreign dyes for colouring khadi cloth. Now if the use of foreign dyes is continued, there will have to be an increase in the price of khadi. The best way of avoiding the increase is for khadi depots to drop the use of foreign dyes and restrict themselves to the use of indigenous dyes and be satisfied with such colours as can be produced therefrom. But this can be done only if the public will, by simplifying their taste, encourage the A. I. S. A. in the experiment. If they will, it is just possible that necessity will be the mother once more of many inventions in the matter of producing beautiful colours from indigenous dyes.
 NOT AUTHORITATIVE
 The Secretary of the A. I. S. A. draws my attention to my article “Spinners’ Wages”libtech_583_footnotelibtech_584_footnotein  Harijan  of August 26th regarding the pur- chase of underpriced yarn of quality below standard. He  says  in  effect:
 Many people take your word as authoritative, more so in matters of khadi since you are President of the A. I. S. A. Will
 
 you not therefore state clearly that your opinion, expressed in Harijan, does not in any way affect or alter the resolutions of the A. I. S. A., and that those who have occasion to take up your advice have to do so subject to the previous permisson of the Secretary in accordance with the recent resolution of the A. I. S.
A. on the subject of prices of yarn?
 I need hardly say that I endorse every word of what is said by the Secretary. Whatever I write in Harijan has as much authority as any editorial writing has and no more. It must be treated as an indivi- dual opinion, always subject to the resolutions passed by competent authority on the subject in question.
 INTOXICATING WINES IN JUDAISM
 When I saw that a claim was registered, and accepted by Dr. Gilder,libtech_585_footnotelibtech_586_footnotefor the use of spirituous liquors on behalf of Jews, I was much disturbed. For my experience of Jews among whom I had  many friends in Johannesburg was wholly against the claim made in Bom- bay. I therefore wrote to my friend Herr H. Kallenbach to send me an authoritative opinion from the Chief Rabbi in Johannesburg. Here is Dr. Landau’s opinion :
 I beg to state that the orthodox Jew may use only specially prepared (kasher) wine for the sanctification of the Sabbath or holidays in the Syna-
 gogue after Divine Service and at home before meals, and on the two eves of the Passover Festival.
 The wine need not be fermented.
 I may state that the use of wine is not a law but a tradition which the orthodox Jew cherishes, as it is referred to both in the Talmud and in Jewish Codes of Law.
 If the Jews of Bombay accept this opinion as authoritative, they should withdraw their claim and be satisfied with the juice of fresh grapes which I understand is the original meaning of the word wine. It is worthy of note, too, that even this use has the authority, not of the Jewish scriptures but of tradition only.

411,"September 11, 1939",SOURCE OF MY SYMPATHY,"
         	The statementlibtech_587_footnotemade 	by me just after my interview with H. E. the Viceroy has had a mixed 	reception. It has been described as sentimental twaddle by one 	critic and as a statesman-like pronounce- ment by another. There are 	variations between the two extremes. I suppose all the critics are 	right from their own standpoint and all are wrong from the absolute 	standpoint which in this instance is that of the author. He wrote 	for no-body’s satisfaction but his own. I abide by every word I 	have said in it. It has no political value, except what every 	humanitarian opinion may possess. Interrelation of ideas cannot be 	prevented.  	I have a spirited protest from a correspondent. It calls for a 	reply. I do not reproduce the letter as parts of it I do not 	understand myself. But there is no difficulty in catching its drift. 	The main argument is this :  	If you shed tears over the possible destruction of the English 	Houses of Parliament and Westminster Abbey, have you no tears for 	the possible destruction of the monuments of Germany? And why do you 	sympathize with England and France and not with Germany? Is not 	Hitler an answer to the ravishing of Germany by the Allied Powers 	during the last war? If you were    
 a German, had the resourcefulness of Hitler and were a believer in the doctrine of retaliation as the whole world is, you would have done what Hitler is doing. Nazism may be bad. We do not know what it really is. The literature we get is one-sided. But I suggest to you that there is no difference between Chamberlain and Hitler. In Hitler’s place Chamberlain would not have acted otherwise. You have done an injustice to Hitler by comparing him with Chamberlain, to the former’s disadvantage. Is England’s record in India any better than Hitler’s in another part of the world in similar circumstances? Hitler is but an infant pupil of the old imperialist England and France. I fancy that your emotion at the Viceregal Lodge had the better of your judgment.
 No one perhaps has described English misdeeds more forcibly, subject to truth, than I have. No one has resisted England more effec- tively, perhaps, than I have. And my desire for and power of resistance remain unabated. But there are seasons for speech and action, as there are seasons for silence and inaction.
 In the dictionary of satyagraha there is no enemy. But as I have no desire to prepare a new dictionary for satyagrahis, I use the old words giving them a new meaning. A satyagrahi loves his so-called enemy even as his friend. He owns no enemy. As a satyagrahi, i.e., votary of ahimsa, I must wish well to England. My wishes regarding Germany were, and they still are, irrelevant for the moment. But I have said in a few words in my statement that I would not care to erect the freedom of my country on the remains of despoiled Germany, I  should be as much moved by a contemplation of the possible destruc- tion of Germany’s monuments. Herr Hitler stands in no need of my sympathy. In assessing the present merits, the past misdeeds of England and the good deeds of Germany are irrelevant. Rightly or wrongly, and irrespective of what the other Powers have done before under similar circumstances, I have come to the conclusion that Herr Hitler is responsible for the war. I do not judge his claim. It is highly probable that his right to incorporate Danzig in Germany is beyond question, if the Danzig Germans desire to give up their independent status. It may be that his claim to appropriate the Polish Corridor is a just claim. My complaint is that he will not let the claim be examined by an independent tribunal. It is no answer to the rejection of the appeal for submission to arbitration that it came from interested quar- ters. Even a thief may conceivably make a correct appeal to his
 fellow-thief. I think I am right in saying that the whole world was anxious that Herr Hitler should allow his demand to be examined by an impartial tribunal. If he succeeds in his design, his success will be no proof of the justness of his claim. It will be proof that the Law of the Jungle is still a great force in human affairs. It will be one more proof that though we humans have changed the form we have not changed the manners of the beast.
 I hope it is now clear to my critics that my sympathy for Eng- land and France is not a result of momentary emotion or, in cruder language, of hysteria. It is derived from the never-drying foun-tain of non-violence which my breast has nursed for fifty years. I claim no infallibility for my judgment. All I claim is that my sympathy for England and France is reasoned. I invite those who accept  the premises on which my sympathy is based to join me. What shape it should take is another matter. Alone I can but pray. And so I told His Excellency that my sympathy had no concrete value in the face of the concrete destruction that is facing those who are directly engaged in the war.

 I got your letter. Now our only wish should be that Father  should be released from his suffering. My advice is that he should be given no food. Let him drink as much water as he can. If he likes, he may take mosambi juice, but not milk. This will reduce his suffering to the minimum. See that he sleeps in a properly ventilated room. Encourage him to keep repeating Ramanama. You should sing  bhajans to him. Persuade Mother to be patient. If you do not lose courage, the others will automatically gain courage. Keep up a smiling face till the end. He who has faith in God never cries. Ba and I are all right. I had been waiting for you. But now I give up that hope.

 whether it was received. As the replylibtech_600_footnotelibtech_601_footnotecame saying that the letter was not received, I recalled the foregoing article which had already been sent to the manager of Harijan. Owing to great pressure under which all who are assisting me are working, the article sent for Harijan Sevak (Hindustani) was not recalled. Hence I thought that the ends of truth would be served by publishing both my English article and His Highness’s reply to my letter. The reply speaks for itself. It substan- tially confirms what my correspondent said about the Hidayat  of 1932. It is to be hoped that the Hidayat will be repealed at an early date. When the very war which is going on is claimed to be fought for democracy, it ill becomes any prince to curtail the liberty  of  the people without just cause.

Tell him not to lose courage and to prove himself worthy of the name he bears. Let him return Home with Narayana’s—Rama’s—name on his lips.

419,"September 	15, 1939",STATEMENT TO THE PRESSlibtech_604_footnote,"
           SEGAON, 
  September 	15, 1939  	The Working Committee’s statement on the world crisis took four 	dayslibtech_605_footnotelibtech_606_footnotebefore it received final shape. Every member expressed 	his opinion freely on the draft that was, at the Committee’s 	invitation, prepared by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. I was sorry to find 	myself alone in thinking that whatever support was to be given to 	the British should be given unconditionally. This could only be done 	on a purely non- violent basis. But the Committee had a tremendous 	responsibility to discharge. It could not take the purely 	non-violent attitude. It felt that the nation had not imbibed the 	non-violent spirit requisite for the possession of the strength 	which disdains to take  advantage  of  the     the 	statement was 	ready and 	as Mr. Mahadev Desai 	began reading it out, 	a little 	party gathered 	round the hurricane lantern.

 difficulty of the opponent. But in stating the reasons for its conclusion the Committee desired to show the greatest consideration for the English.
 The author of the statement is an artist. Though he cannot be surpassed in his implacable opposition to imperialism in any shape or form, he is a friend of the English people. Indeed he is more English than Indian in his thoughts and make-up. He is often more at home with Englishmen than with his own countrymen. And he is a humanitarian in the sense that he reacts to every wrong, no matter where perpetrated.libtech_607_footnotelibtech_608_footnoteThough, therefore, he is an ardent nationalist his nationalism is enriched by his fine internationalism. Hence the statement is a manifesto addressed not only to his own countrymen, not only to the British Government and the British people, but it is addressed also to the nations of the world including those that are exploited like India. He has compelled India, through the Working Committee, to think not merely of her own freedom, but of the freedom of all the exploited nations of the world.
 The same time that the Committee passed the statement, it appointed a Boardlibtech_609_footnoteof his choice with himself as Chairman to deal with the situation as it may develop from time to time.
 I hope that the statement will receive the unanimous support of all the parties among Congressmen. The strongest among them will not find any lack of strength in it. And at this supreme hour in the history of the nation the Congress should believe that there will be no lack of strength in action, if action becomes necessary. It will be a pity if Congressmen engage in petty squabbles and party strife. If any- thing big or worthy is to come out of the Committee’s action, the undivided and unquestioned loyalty of every Congressman is absolutely necessary. I hope too that all other political parties and all communities will join the Committee’s demand for a clear declaration of their policy from the British Government with such corresponding action as is possible amidst martial conditions. Recognition of India, and for that matter of all those who are under the British Crown, as free and independent nations seems to me to be the natural corollary of British professions about democracy. If the war means anything less, the co-operation of dependent nations can never be honestly voluntary, unless it were based on non-violence.
 
 All that is required is a mental revolution on the part of British statesmen. To put it still more plainly, all that is required is honest action to implement the declaration of faith in democracy made on the eve of the war, and still being repeated from British platforms. Will Great Britain have an unwilling India dragged into the war or a willing ally co-operating with her in the prosecution of a defence of true democracy? The Congress support will mean the greatest moral asset in favour of England and France. For the Congress has no soldiers to offer. The Congress fights not with violent but with  non-violent means, however imperfect, however crude the non-violence may be.

422,"September 17, 1939",JAIPUR SATYAGRAHA,"
    
 Jaipur satyagraha has ended satisfactorily as announced in Sheth Jamnalalji’s public statement. He had had several interviews with the Maharaja Saheb. The result has been that the regulation regarding public meetings and processions has been withdrawn. So has the ban on newspapers. Amelioration in several other matters has been assured.libtech_610_footnotelibtech_611_footnoteFor this happy result both the Maharaja and Sheth Jamnalalji deserve to be congratulated—the Maharaja for his just-mindedness and Shethji for his wisdom and moderation in conducting the nego- tiations on behalf of the Jaipur Praja Mandal. It is a happy ending to a struggle which was conducted with great restraint and calmness. It is a triumph of non- violence. From the very beginning the demands were restricted to the barest minimum necessary for self-expression and political education. The goal of responsible govern-ment has been always kept in view, but it has never been offensively or aggressively advanced as if the insistence was on an immediate grant of full responsibility. The Praja Mandal has wisely recognized its own limi- tations and the backward state of the people. Practically no political education has been hitherto allowed in many of the Rajputana States. It will be solid gain if civil liberty in its real sense is assured to the people of Jaipur. For this, as much will depend upon the wisdom with which it is used by the people as upon the restraint of the Jaipur authorities.
 
 In this connection Sheth Jamnalalji has raised a most important question. He insists that no European should be appointed Dewan. I have had to perform the painful duty of criticizing the administration of the State by one of its English Dewanslibtech_612_footnotelibtech_613_footnote.  I  have  no  doubt  that  an English Dewan is any day a misfit in an Indian State. He has to serve an Indian Chief. But retired English officials from whom Dewans are chosen are not by habit used to take orders from Indian Chiefs. They cannot understand the caprices of Indian Princes and will not accommodate themselves to them. The Chiefs themselves never feel at home with English Dewans. Moreover no matter how conscientious they are, Englishmen can never understand the people of the States or have patience with them. And the people can never take the same liberty with them that they can and will with men who are drawn from among themselves. Thus an English Dewan is a double handicap in an Indian State and robs it of what little scope there is left in it for indigenous development. Add to this the fact that the appointment of English Dewans in States is a cruel encroachment upon the very narrow field left for the expression of Indian administrative talent. Supposing Dewanships had been a preserve of retired English offi- cials, we would have missed Sir T. Madhao Rao or Sir Salar Jung, to mention only two among the well-known Dewans of Indian States.
 It is to be hoped, therefore, that if H. H. the Maharaja has really  a free choice, he will select an Indian known for his integrity, ability and sympathy for popular aspirations. It is to be hoped further that if the choice has to be made by the British Government, they will not impose a European Dewan on the Maharaja.

 SIROHI
 Sirohi is a Rajputana State with a population of 1,86,639 and revenue of Rs. 9,70,000. It has figured in the Press for its lathi charge said to be wholly unprovoked. I have authentic information of the event from Shri Gokulbhai Bhatt who belongs to Sirohi. He  has gained a reputation as an efficient teacher and a devoted Congress worker. He is saturated with the spirit of non-violence. He has been recently staying in Sirohi attempting to gain elementary rights for the people. He thus writes about the lathi charge to Shri Kishorelal Mashruwala :
 The events of the 8th instant in Sirohi make it a memorable day for its people. The police swooped down upon a meeting all of a sudden, began to pull down the Praja Mandal flag and delivered a lathi charge. This was not the national flag. When the Hon. Resident, Mr. Lothian, was in Sirohi last February he suggested that we could use the Praja Mandal flag in our office, in our processions and at our meetings. And we were acting accordingly.
 On the 3rd instant the Dewan Saheb prohibited its use in our processions. In order to avoid a breach of the order, we discontinued the procession. There was no prohibition against its use at meetings, so we had it at our meeting. Suddenly appeared the police in great style and, without warning, without any order, began to pull down the flag. Some of the workers held on to it. They could not, however, keep their hold for long against the superior police force. They were separated. I had

 somehow retained my hold. So they dragged me with the flag. They caught me by the neck and beat me. Then began an indiscriminate lathi charge on the audience. Some notabilities are said to have been inciting the police not to spare the people who said, “You may beat us as much as you like. We will not leave the meeting.” Women were also bravely taking part in this struggle. The charge must have lasted about seven minutes. The meeting continued to the end. The event has not demoralized the people. It has put heart into them.
 Knowing Shri Gokulbhai as I do, I have no reason to disbelieve his account which is in Gujarati. It reflects no credit upon the Sirohi authorities. I have before me a long list of the grievances of the people. They are trying, in a perfectly constitutional manner, to seek redress. But instead of granting redress the authorities are evidently trying to crush their spirit. If, however, the people have imbibed the right spirit of non-violent resistance, they are bound to gain their end, lathi charges notwithstanding.
 A POLISH SISTER’Slibtech_615_footnoteAGONY
 In spite of all I am going to try to reach Poland, sailing tonight to Basra in Iraq, then through Turkey and Rumania. The inner call is irresistible. It may seem madness from the ordinary human point of view. Now I am not going for my mother’s sake nor for my dearest friends who are now on the battle-fields— ready to die at any moment—it is for Poland itself. I believe countries have also souls. Souls of nations are a reality, not a theory, for me. If I reach the soil of Poland I will feel satisfied, even if I do not find those whom I love. It is the soul (and body) of the nation itself that is in its supreme hour  of  martyrdom. I believe Poland bleeds and struggles not only for her own rights but for the right, the just, the true; for the freedom of all nations, India including. I feel Hindu to the bottom of my heart; Indian as much as Pole, both Motherlands are to be in my soul to the last day of my life. But I could not live if I would not do what is humanly possible to reach the feet of the Mother who is now bleeding in agony of pain. I shall write from the way, but not when I reach the war zone; I shall only think often about you and send mental messages as well as I can. Bapuji, do pray in all fervour of your great loving heart for those thousands of innocent people who suffer incredible pain and misery in Poland. It is these that need most sympathy and blessings and tender thoughts.
 
 
 
 This is the letter a Polish sister wrote from Bombay harbour. I have known her for some years. She has become as much Indian as she is Polish. She had decided to work at Maganwadi in the Magan Museum.libtech_616_footnotelibtech_617_footnoteBut the rumours of war upset her. She has an aged mother in Poland whom she could not bring out owing to passport difficulties. When the war actually broke out, she calmed down so far as her mother was concerned. But her highly strung nature would not let her rest whilst her nearest and dearest were in peril of their lives for no offence of theirs. She is herself a believer through and through in non-violence. But her very non-violence made her restless. Her whole soul has rebelled against the wrong, as she thinks, that is being perpetrated against her motherland. So she has gone to find  the  Poland of her imagination fighting to the last ditch, not for merely preserving her own freedom but for the freedom of all those nations who have lost it. And in this she naturally includes her second love, India. May her dream prove true. If Poland has that measure of uttermost bravery and an equal measure of selflessness, history will forget that she defended herself with violence. Her violence will be counted almost as non-violence.

425,"September 18, 1939",TEMPLE-ENTRY,"
    
 I had a complaint from a sanatanist in Madura regarding the manner in which the celebrated Meenakshi temple was opened. I had forwarded the complaint to Shri Vaidyanatha Aiyar and sent it to another friend too. I got a categorical refutation from the latter.libtech_618_footnoteHe added in his letter that Shri Vaidyanatha Aiyar was so persecuted by the sanatanists that his nerves were shattered. Thereupon I sent him a long wire urging him not to take to heart what his persecutors may say or do, and that as a religious reformer he had to work with perfect detachment keeping himself unruffled in the midst of persecution and worse. To my wire he sent the following consoling reply :
 
 With Shri Meenakshi’s grace and your blessings acquired usual calmness. Continuing work. Expecting other big temples will follow shortly. Your love and blessings my strongest support.
The reply is characteristic of this great reformer. He is one of
 the humblest and the most silent among the workers in the cause of removal of untouchability. He is a godfearing man. This is what Shri Brijkrishna Chandiwala of Delhi, who had gone on a pilgrimage to the South, writes of his experience in Madura :
 I stopped seven days in Pondicherry, five in Ramanashram and went as far as Rameshwar. I had a great desire to visit the temples of the South. But I would not enter those that were closed to Harijans. I did, however, see the temples in Madura and Tanjore. The others I contemplated from without. I tarried awhile in front of many of them—and for the first time I realized what
 the bar sinister must mean to the tens of thousands of Harijans who, though eager for darshanlibtech_619_footnotelibtech_620_footnotecould never cross the precincts of the great temples. We
 who have the right to visit them never think of entering. But this time I was overwhelmed. I felt a longing to visit them and prayed from the depth of my heart that God might move the sanatanists to open the other temples to Harijans so that I too could visit them. I saw, too, at Shri Vaidyanatha Aiyar’s house, what temple-entry costs reformers like him. Had I not seen with my own eyes what has been happening to Shri Vaidyanatha Aiyar, I could never have believed that human nature could descend so low as I discovered in Madura. The conduct of the sanatanists towards him has been most unseemly. One of the ways adopted by them is to spread lies about Shri Vaidyanatha Aiyar. But both he and his wife are bearing this persecution bravely.
Only four days ago I had a letter from some ladies of Kumbak-
 onam complaining of the treatment meted out to them by reformers. They asked for an appointment. In the midst of my work I sent them an early appointment, warning them of my views on untouchability. They repented of their wire and said that since I had taken no notice of their complaint, they did not propose to come. I have since read the report in The Hindu of the happenings in Shrirangam. Dr. Rajan has given a graphic account of the disgraceful behaviour of the so-called sanatanists there. I have no reason to doubt Dr. Rajan’s account. It is a shame that innocent women are being exploited for supporting a wrong. I have a vivid recollection of what used to happen to me  during my Harijan tour. No lie was too bad to be spread about me or
 
 
 my tour. So far as I could see, the opposition was confined to a handful only. I never opened a temple until I was satisfied that there was no opposition worth the name from the temple-goers. But the organizers of the opposition resented the very propaganda I was conducting. No doubt their opposition proved fruitless. My point, however, is that it was unscrupulous and violent. If I survived the year’s tour, it was no fault of theirs; it was God’s grace. Sixty-four charges were recorded against me. Not one of them was true. I am therefore loath to believe the complaints now made about the cam- paign in the South. I have not found any of them substantiated. Un- touchability is itself a lie. Lies are not known to have been supported by truth, even as truth cannot be supported by lies. If it is, it becomes itself a lie. There is no wonder, therefore, that from everywhere evi- dence continues to pour in that the sanatanist opposi--tion is confined to a few and that the few do not hesitate to resort to any method, however unscrupulous it may be.
 Nevertheless the case against untouchability is not to be sus- tained by the weaknesses of opponents. It has to be supported by purity of character, industry and strictest honesty of reformers and a limitless capacity for sacrifice. For I should not wonder if the wrath of the opponents takes a heavy toll of the lives of reformers. No sacrifice, however great, will deter the reformers from pursuing the God-given mission of ridding Hinduism of the curse of untouchability. For I must repeat for the thousandth time that Hinduism dies, as it will deserve to die, if untouchability lives. Only let the reformers know that impatience will be fatal to success. They must not open  a  single temple where a clear majority of temple-goers to a particular temple are demonstrably opposed to its opening. Untouchability will not be removed by the force even of law. It can only be removed when the majority of Hindus realize that it is a crime against God and man and are ashamed of it. In other words, it is a process of conversion, i. e., purification of the Hindu heart. The aid of law has to be invoked when it hinders or interferes with the progress of the reform as when, in spite of the willingness of the trustees and the temple-going public, the law prohibits the opening of a particular temple.

437,"September 20, 1939",DRAFT RESOLUTION FOR PROVINCIAL LEGISLATURES libtech_630_footnote,"
    
 [September 20, 1939]libtech_631_footnote
This   Assembly    regrets   that    the    British    Government have
 
 Committee met on September 9 and continued their deliberations till September 15. .
 . . Gandhiji, at first, was for supporting the British unconditionally, but ultimately he yielded to Jawaharlal Nehru.       The Congress Ministries in the Provinces simply
 could not continue in office for a long period during which they were bound to accept the direction of a Central Government with which they felt no sense of identity. . . .
 During the time.     my relations with Sir Roger Lumley, the Governor, had become
 friendly.     I tried to prevail upon Sir Roger Lumley to convey to Lord Linlithgow
 that there should not be any difficulty in meeting the Congress demands, viz., (1) clarification of war aims, (2) assurance as to India’s future, and (3) the immediate steps to ensure Congress participation at the Centre.       The outlook became gloomy
 when, on September 18, Kher, like other Congress premiers, received a letter from Sardar Patel intimating that the Working Committee’s statement [Appendix X] should be taken as the background for the time being; that the Ministries should do nothing inconsistent with it and, in particular, should not allow their responsibility as Provincial Governments to be overridden.        The more important part of the letter
 was a directive: Provincial legislatures, or, in default of legislatures, Provincial Governments, should as early as possible pass a resolution, a draft of which was appended.       Sir Roger realized the grave implications of the resolution and told me
 that a resolution of this character would create the impression that the Congress had given up the intention to co-operate in the war. He, therefore, strongly urged that I should point out to Sardar the implication of the course advocated in the letter. I gave Sir Roger’s message to Sardar Patel. He, however, told me that the letter had been drawn up by the Congress War Sub-committee and that he could not cancel it without the consent of the other members of the Sub-committee, namely, Nehru and Maulana Azad. He, therefore, advised me to go at once to Wardha and see Gandhiji and Rajendra Prasad who was still there. I left for Wardha the same evening and returned on September 21. Gandhiji gave me a patient hearing, spinning the charkha all the time.   I remember to have argued the case at length. When I finished, he told me: ‘Munshi, you have presented your case well, but the country will not accept the course of action recommended by you’. He was, however, prepared to modify the peremptory attitude reflected in the resolution. He gave me a statement defining his views on the situation.     Gandhiji also gave me a draft of the resolution which be passed by the
 Provincial legislatures if a satisfactory solution on the lines indicated was not acceptable to the British Government.      As a result of my inteview with Gandhiji on
 September 20       instructions were issued to the Congress Ministries postponing
 action on the proposed resolution for a week.”
 
 declared India as a participant in the war between Great Britain and Germany, without the consent of the Indian people and without consulting this Assembly. The Assembly considers this declaration, made in complete disregard of the opposition from Indian opinion, a contravention of the spirit of Provincial autonomy, as also further measures adopted and laws passed in England and India limiting the powers and activities of Provincial Governments.
 The British Government have stated that the war is for the pre- servation of democracy, but their policy in India militates against this profession. While this Assembly has the fullest sympathy for the cause of democracy and freedom, and condemns the aggression of the Nazi Government on Poland, it cannot offer co-operation in the war, unless the principles of democracy are applied to India and her policy is guided by her people. The Assembly invites the British Government to make a clear declaration that they have decided to regard India as an independent nation entitled to frame her own Charter of Freedom, and to accompany this declaration by suitable action, in so far as this is possible, even in the prevailing war condi- tions. The Assembly is further of opinion that no war measure or other activity should be undertaken in this Province except with the consent and through the medium of the Provincial Government.

 [September 20, 1939]libtech_633_footnote
  I 	(Gandhi) know that my 	views in 	regard to 	unconditional 	co-operation are 	not shared by 	the country. 	The resolution 	of the Working 	Committee reflects the 	Congress opinion properly.  Since 	the Congress 	is unable, 	owing to past 	experience, to 	give unconditional 	co-operation, it can 	only co-operate if 	it is able to 	convince the 	country that 	it has 	in substance 	achieved its purpose 	and that 	therefore there 	is a 	complete understanding 	about it 	between the 	British Government and 	the Congress.  If 	there is 	a real 	understanding between 	the British 	Govern- ment and 	the Congress, it 	follows that there must 	be corresponding 	action even during the war. Thus Ministries must not be mere regis- 
 
 tering agencies of the measures coming from the Centre. Hence there must be some method at the Centre of having a Congress represen- tation sufficient to give it a majority.
  The 	only constitutional 	way in which the 	Ministries can declare 	their position is to 	obtain the 	necessary authority of 	their res- 	pective legislatures by getting them to adopt this resolutionlibtech_634_footnotelibtech_635_footnote, unless in the 	mean time they can convince 	their legislatures that 	circumstances in 	terms of 	2 and 	3 have come 	into existence which 	render such 	resolution unnecessary.  If 	the British 	Government are serious 	in their 	profession that they 	are fighting 	for democracy, they 	cannot marshal 	the moral 	opinion of 	the world 	in their 	favour except by 	declaring that India 	will be 	a free 	and democratic country 	at the 	end of the 	war and that in the 	mean time it 	has taken 	steps to implement 	the assurances 	so far 	as it is 	practicable under 	martial conditions.  If 	for some reason, 	the British 	Government takes a 	different view, 	the Ministries will find it impossible to function.  The 	resolution may 	be kept 	back for a 	week if 	the members 	of the 	War Sub-committee agree. 	But it 	must be 	clearly understood 	that before the 	A. I. C. C. meets, the 	Working Committee which 	meets on the 	4th (October) must 	have definite material 	to enable 	it to give 	the lead to the A. I. C. C. and the country.

 CHI. VIJAYA,
 I get your letters regularly. You must be growing calmer day by day. Think and realize that birth and death are one and the same thing. This is the normal thing. Death follows birth—birth follows death. In this manner the two ever keep changing places. Why then should we rejoice at one and grieve over the other? The coming of night is the death of day, but we know that day comes after night and so we are not surprised by the way it goes on. Our grief, therefore, is only on account of the separation. But separation is only one member of a pair. Union and separation—separation and union, go hand in hand. This is only an intellectual statement. But it is worth understanding. It will strengthen your faith. What I want to say, is that your presence there should have this effect, and no one should grieve and Father should leave with a smile on his face. He had better take only water. I hope Manubhailibtech_636_footnotelibtech_637_footnotewill not be permitted to come there.

446,,"DISCUSSION  WITH  MEMBERS
 OF  OXFORD  GROUPlibtech_642_footnote","
    
 SEGAON, WARDHA,
 September 23/24, 1939
 How I wish I had the same enthusiasm that fires you. Of course I have the experience of listeninglibtech_643_footnotenot merely of trying to listen. The more I listen, the more I discover that I am still far away from God. While I can lay down rules, the observance of which is essential for proper listening, the reality still escapes me. When we say we are listening to God and getting answers, though we say it truthfully, there is every possibility there of self-deception. I do not know that I am myself altogether free from self-deception. People sometimes ask me if I may not be mistaken, and I say to them, ‘Yes, very likely, what I say may be just a picture of my elongated self before you.”
 And then see how one may claim to be God-guided in taking a particular course of action, and another may make the same claim in taking an opposite course of action. I will give you a good illustration. Rajaji, whom you know, at any rate whose name you have heard, is I think unsurpassed in godliness or God-mindedness. Now when I took the     21  days’  purificatory  fast  in  the  Yeravda  Jail  in  1933libtech_644_footnoteand proclaimed that it was in answer to a call from God, Rajagopalachari came all the way from Madras to dissuade me. He felt sure that I was deluding myself and that I should probably die and, if I did not, I should certainly be demented. Well, you see that I am still alive and of
 
 listening to God. We feel that the solution of those problems for which you have worked would be reached if all the millions of India would start listening to God. We feel we have a place in this plan and have therefore come to you in joy.’ Some of the members described their experiences of changes having come over the lives of men and women by this  ‘listening in’.	‘Whereas people of old used to use the word
 ‘prayer’, ‘listening in’ is  the modern	word.	There was a discussion and
 Gandhiji spoke out his mind to  them.”
 a sound mind. And yet perhaps Rajaji still thinks I was deluded and it was by an accident that I was saved, and I continue to think that I fasted in answer to the still small voice within.
 I say this in order to warn you how unwise it may be to believe that you are always listening to God. I am not at all against the endeavour, but I warn you against thinking that this is a kind of ‘open sesame’ which has just to be shown to the millions. No one will contradict me when I say I have tried my very best to make India listen to the way of God. I have had some success but I am still far away from the goal. When I listen to the testimonies you have given I become cautious and even suspicious. In South Africa a preacher came who after his sermon got people to sign their names under a pledge, which was published in a book, binding them not to drink. Well, I have been witness to numerous of these promises being broken. It was no fault of these people. They signed the pledge under the temporary influence of the preacher’s moving eloquence.
 This I know that all that glitters is not gold, and also that if a man has really heard the voice of God, there is no sliding back, just as there is no forgetting it by one who has learnt to swim. The listening in must make people’s lives daily richer and richer.
 Let me not appear to damp your enthusiasm; but if it is to be built on solid rock, it is better that listening in is also based on solid rock.
 This listening in presupposes the fitness to listen, and the fitness is acquired after constant and patient striving and waiting on God. Shanka-racharya has likened the process to the attempt to empty the sea by means of a drainer small as the point of a blade of grass. This process thus necessarily is endless being carried through birth after birth.
 And yet the effort has to be as natural as breathing or the winking of the eyes, which processes happen without our knowing them. The effort coincides with the process of living. I commend to you this process of eternal striving which alone can take us face to face with Godlibtech_645_footnote.
 What is India as a nation to do at this juncture? What would you want her to do? How is she to repent? India may say she  has committed many sins for which she is suffering and would pray to be
 
 given the strength to wipe them out. Or is there anything else at the back of your minds?libtech_646_footnote

 "
447,"September 24, 1939",HORIZONTAL v. VERTICAL,"
    
 Prof. J. C. Kumarappa has contributed a thought-provoking article to the Gram Udyog Patrika for September. I take from it the following extractslibtech_647_footnotewith slight unimportant alterations.
 According to the conception of the economic organization on which the
 A. I. V. I. A. is based, the villager is taken as the centre around whom the universe revolves. What contributes to his welfare is primary and everything else is secondary. Whatever the merits of a plan may be, if it fails to give employment and thereby direct a due share of the wealth produced towards the villager, it will stand condemned. The result or end of economic activity is wealth production for consumption by the producers. Wealth is  usually produced by the intelligent use of the means of production and the application or employment of human talent or power. Planning, in the first instance, consists in the rational coordination of these three factors. We may express this mathematically thus: W = E + M.
 Here W stands for wealth, E for employment of human talent and M for means in the shape of tools, equipment or capital. In this equation, keeping W constant, if M is large, E will have to be small, and vice versa, that is, E and M vary inversely. Therefore, in planning, our first step will have to be the ascertaining of the availability of E and M. . . .
 When we look around our country we find E in abundance while M is very scarce and, therefore, if our planning is to be effective, we have to lay our foundation-stone on labour and not on capital. . . .
 Most people seem to think that all will be well as long as we produce large quantities of standardized goods. They cannot see that the method of large-scale production can only be employed as a hand-maiden of the cottage and village industries, the former supplying the basic needs of the latter on a service basis. . . .
 Properly conceived, the State should serve the citizen. The citizen may work for his profit but not so the State. Similarly, the decentralized units may work for profit but not so the centralized units. . . .
 
 
 
 It does not do to plan vertically, i. e., emphasizing the functions and thus making them into separate industries, e. g., banking, insurance, etc., which is the way of capitalism. The other way is to take the industries horizontally and study their processes and apply the functional aid at suitable points. The plan of work of the All-India Spinners’ Association is a good example of a horizontal system of planning, while a spinning mill is an example of vertical planning. There can be no compromise between these two methods.. . . .

453,"September 25, 1939",IS INDIA A MILITARY COUNTRY?,"
    
 In the interesting broadcast delivered by the Commander-in- Chief of the Defence Forces in India on the 5th instant there occurs this passage :
 India is a military country and I am a soldier. It will, therefore, perhaps not be amiss if I give you some personal impressions of what the effect of modernization will be on the personnel of the future army in India. They are not just guess-work but based on what has already been done. With new scientific weapons and with modern vehicles, there will inevitably come new ideas and a new outlook. Modernization is likely to give increased impetus to the already high rate of education in the Indian Army; and when nearly every solider on discharge returns to his home with a knowledge of motor-cars and machinery, there may well be a perceptible effect upon the age-old methods of agriculture and ways of living. Modernization in the army may therefore have  a considerable indirect effect upon the life of India. Many of those who hear me will regret the passing of the horse. No one regrets it more than myself. But as a soldier who knows the fate which awaits the horse in modern warfare, I rejoice for its sake, that one of the greatest and best of friends of man is in future to be spared the horrors of war.
 I must wholly, though respectfully, dissent from the view that India is a military country. And I thank God that it is not. It may be that the Commander-in-Chief has a special meaning for the  term  which I do not know. Or is it that his India is composed of only the Defence Forces under his command? For me the Defence Forces are of the least importance in the make-up of the nation. I need not be reminded that life would be in constant peril if the forces were withdrawn. The forces notwithstanding, life is not free from peril. There are riots, there are murders, there are dacoities, there are raids. The Defence Forces avail little in all these perils. They generally act after the mischief is done. But the gallant Commander-in-Chief looks at things as a soldier. I and, with me the millions are untouched by the military spirit. From ages past India has had a military caste in numbers wholly insignificant. That caste has had little to do with the millions. This, however, is not the occasion for examining its contribution to the making of India. All I want to state, with the utmost emphasis at my command, is that the description of India as a military country is wrong. Of all the countries in the world India is the least military. Though I have failed with the Working Committee in persuading them, at this supreme moment, to declare their undying
 faith in non-violence as the only sovereign remedy  for  saving  mankind from destruction, I have not lost the hope that the masses will refuse to bow to the Moloch of war but will rely upon their capacity for suffering to save the country’s honour. How has the undoubted military valour of Poland served her against the superior forces of Germany and Russia? Would Poland unarmed have fared worse if she had met the challenge of these combined forces with the resolution to face death without retaliation? Would the invading forces have taken a heavier toll from an infinitely more valorous Poland? It is highly probable that their essential nature would have made them desist from a wholesale slaughter of innocents.
 Of all the organizations of the world the Congress is the best fitted to show it the better way, indeed the only way, to the true life. Its non-violent experiment will have been in vain if, when India wakes up from the present fear, she does not show to the world the way of deliverance from the blood-bath. The criminal waste of life and wealth that is now going on will not be the last if India does not play her natural part by showing that human dignity is best preserved not by developing the capacity to deal destruction but by  refusing  to retaliate. I have no manner of doubt that if it is possible to train millions in the black art of violence which is the law of the beast, it is more possible to train them in the white art of non-violence which is the law of regenerate man. Anyway if the Commander-in-Chief will look beyond the Defence Forces, he will discover that the real India is not military but peace-loving.
 Nor do I contemplate without uneasiness the prospect of Indian soldiers, trained after the modern manner, taking the motor spirit to their homes. Speed is not the end of life. Man sees more and lives more truly by walking to his duty.
 ON THE TRAIN TO SIMLA, September 25, 1939
 Harijan, 30-9-1939
 "
454,"September 25, 1939",CONUNDRUMS,"
    
Thus asks a well-known Congressman :
  What 	is your 	personal attitude towards 	this war consistent 	with non- 	violence? Is it the same as or different from your attitude during the last war?  How 	could you 	with your non-violence 	actively associate with 	and help the Congress whose policy is based on violence in the present crisis?  What 	is your 	concrete plan 	based on 	non-violence to 	oppose or 	prevent this war? 
The questions conclude a long friendly complaint about my
 seeming inconsistencies or my inscrutability. Both are old complaints, perfectly justified from the standpoint of the complainants, wholly un- justifed from my own. Therefore my complainants and I must agree to differ. Only this let me say. At the time of writing I never think of what I have said before. My aim is not to be consistent with my previous statements on a given question, but to be consistent with truth as it may present itself to me at a given moment. The result has been that I have grown from truth to truth; I have saved my memory an un- due strain; and what is more, whenever I have been obliged to com- pare my writing even of fifty years ago with the latest, I have dis- covered no inconsistency between the two. But friends who observe inconsistency will do well to take the meaning that my latest writing may yield unless, of course, they prefer the old. But before making the choice they should try to see if there is not an underlying and abiding consistency between the two seeming inconsistencies.
 So far as my inscrutability is concerned, friends should take my assurance that there is never any attempt on my part to suppress my thought when it is relevant. Sometimes it arises from my desire to be brief. And sometimes it must be due to my own ignorance of the subject on which I may be called upon to give an opinion.
 To give a typical instance, a friendlibtech_662_footnotebetween whom and me there never is any mental reservation, thus writeslibtech_663_footnotein anguish   rather  than anger :
 In the not-improbable event of India being a theatre of war, is Gandhiji prepared to advise his countrymen to bare their breasts to the enemy’s sword? A little while ago I would have pledged my word he would do so, but I am not confident any more.
I can only assure him that, notwithstanding my recent writings,
 he can retain his confidence that I would give the same advice as he expects I would have given before, or as I gave to the Czechslibtech_664_footnotelibtech_665_footnoteor the
 
 
 Abyssinianslibtech_666_footnotelibtech_667_footnote. My non-violence is made of stern stuff. It is firmer than the firmest metal known to the scientists. Yet, alas, I am painfully conscious of the fact that it has still not attained its native firmness. If it had, God would have shown me the way to deal with the many local cases of violence that I helplessly witness daily. This is said not in arrogance but in the certain knowledge of the power of perfect non- violence. I will not have the power of non-violence to be underesti- mated in order to cover my limitations or weaknesses.
Now for a few lines in answer to the questions :
  My 	personal reaction 	towards this war is one 	of greater horror 	than ever before. 	I was 	not so disconsolate 	before as I 	am today. 	But the greater 	horror would prevent me 	today from becoming 	the self- 	appointed recruiting 	sergeant that I 	had become 	during the last 	war. And 	yet, strange as 	it may appear, 	my symapthies 	are wholly 	with the 	Allies. Willy-nilly this 	war is 	resolving itself 	into one between 	such democracy 	as the 	West has 	evolved and 	totalitarianism as 	it is typified in 	Herr Hitler. Though the 	part that Russia is 	playing is 	painful, let 	us hope 	that the unnatural 	combination will 	result in 	a happy 	though unintended fusion 	whose shape no 	one can foretell. 	Unless the Allies suffer 	demoralization, of 	which there is 	not the slightest 	indication, this 	war may be 	used to 	end all wars, 	at any 	rate of 	the virulent 	type that 	we see 	today. I 	have the 	hope that India, 	distraught though 	it is 	with internal 	dissensions, will play 	an effective 	part in 	ensuring the 	desired end 	and the spread of 	cleaner democracy than 	hitherto. This 	will undoubtedly 	depend upon 	how the Working 	Committee will 	ultimately act 	in the 	real tragedy 	that is 	being played on 	the world 	stage. We 	are both 	actors in and 	spectators of 	the drama. 	My line 	is cast. 	Whether I act as a 	humble guide of 	the Working Committee 	or, if I may 	use the same expression, 	without offence, of the 	Government, my 	guidance will 	be for 	the deliberate purpose 	of taking 	either or both 	along the path 	of non-violence, 	be the 	step ever so 	imperceptible. It 	is plain that I 	cannot force 	the pace either way. 	I can 	only use such power as God may endow my head or heart with for the moment. I think I have covered the second question in answering the 
first.
 There 	are degrees 	of violence as of 	non-violence. The 
 
 Working Committee has not wilfully departed from the policy of non- violence. It could not honestly accept the real implications of non- violence. I felt that the vast mass of Congressmen had never clearly understood that in the event of danger from without they were to defend the country by non-violent means. All that they had learnt truly was that they could put up a successful fight, on the whole non- violent, against the British Government. Congressmen have had no training in the use of non-violence in other fields. Thus, for example, they had not yet discovered a sure method of dealing successfully in a non-violent manner with communal riots or goondaism. The argu- ment is final inasmuch as it is based on actual experience.
 I would not serve the cause of non-violence, if I deserted my best co-workers because they could not follow me in an extended application of non-violence. I therefore remain with them in the faith that their departure from the non-violent method will be confined to the narrowest field and will be temporary.
  I 	have no 	ready-made concrete 	plan. For me 	too this is 	a new 	field. Only I 	have no 	choice as 	to the means. 	It must 	always be purely 	non-violent, whether I 	am closeted 	with the members 	of the 	Working Committee 	or with 	the Viceroy. 	Therefore what I 	am doing 	is itself 	part of 	the concrete 	plan. More will be 	revealed to 	me from day 	to day, 	as all 	my plans 	always have 	been. The famous 	non-co-operation 	resolutionlibtech_668_footnotelibtech_669_footnotecame to me within less than 24 hours of the meeting of the 
 A.I.C.C. at which it was moved in Calcutta in 1920; and so did practi- cally the Dandi March.libtech_670_footnotelibtech_671_footnoteThe foundation of the first civil resistance under the then known name of passive resistance was laid by accident at a meeting of Indians in Johannesburg in 1906libtech_672_footnotelibtech_673_footnotecon-vened for the purpose of finding the means of combating the anti-Asiatic measure of those days. I had gone to the meeting with no preconceived resolution. It was born at the meeting. The creation is still expanding. But assuming that God had endowed me with full powers (which He never does), I would at once ask the English to lay down arms, free all their vassals, take pride in being called “Little Englanders” and defy all the totalitarians of the world to do their worst. Englishmen will then die unresistingly and go down to history as heroes of non-violence. I would further invite Indians to co-operate with  Englishmen   in   this
 
 godly martyrdom. It will be an indissoluble partnership drawn up in letters of the blood of their own bodies, not of their so-called enemies. But I have no such general power. Non-violence is a plant of slow growth. It grows imperceptibly but surely. And even at the risk of being misunderstood, I must act in obedience to “the still small voice”
 ON THE TRAIN TO SIMLA, September 25, 1939
 Harijan, 30-9-1939
 "
455,"September 25, 1939",THE OLD REVOLUTIONARY,"
    
 Readers of Harijan know that after twenty-five years, part of which was spent in jail and sixteen in hiding as an absconder, Sardar Prithvi Singh finds himself a free man. He cannot call a life of  freedom those sixteen years of dodging the C. I. D., assuming new names and new dresses as circumstances demanded. The reader will recall that Prithvi Singh made up his mind to discover himself to me last year when I was convalescing in Juhu, to confess his past sins and regulate his future under my guidance. I advised him to surrender himself to the police and purge his past by becoming a prisoner amenable to prison discipline by choice. I had told him that though I would try to secure his discharge, he must not bank upon my success but should be content, if necessary, to pass the rest of his life in prison. Quite cheerfully and light-heartedly he showed his prepared- ness to face life imprisonment. With sincere conviction he accepted the truth that voluntary imprisonment might be as good service of the country as life outside.
 I am glad to be able to say that he was true to his word. The readers know from Mahadev Desai’s description of him after his visit to the Sardar in Rawalpindi prison that he was a cent percent model prisoner. He endeared himself to his jailors who never found misplaced the trust that they had reposed in him. He learnt wool- spinning and cotton-spinning and worked at the first so assiduously that even his powerfully built body had to take relaxation from strenuous labour. First Pyarelal’s and then Mahadev Desai’s enthusiastic testimony in favour of Sardar Prithvi Singh’s exemplary conduct in the jail decided me. Mahadev Desai felt confident that he could plead the cause successfully before Sir Sikandar Hyat Khan. I let him go. Sir Sikander made a generous response. He was impressed with the truth of Mahadev’s description, fortified as it was by the uniformly good reports from the officials in charge of Sardar Prithvi Singh. Mahadev knocked also at the Viceregal gates. The result was
 that Sardar Prithvi Singh was delivered to me by the authorities on the 22nd instant.
 I greeted him with the remark that he had transferred himself from one jail to another and harder. He smiled a hearty assent. He knows that he is on his trial. He has been a  staunch  believer  in violence as the only way to the deliverance of his country. He has to his credit examples of daring which may be equalled by some but surpassed by no revolutionary. His life is rich in romance. But by patient introspection he discovered that fundamentally his was a life of falsity, and that true deliverance could never come out of falsity. In spite of the glamour that surrounded his life of hiding and the adoration of his companions who marvelled at his exploits, he had wearied of the false life and the hiding. The gymnastic lessons he gave to hundreds of young men had given him no satisfaction. Fortunately he had companions like Nanabhai of Dakshinamurti. They guided his footsteps towards me. I have told him I will not be satisfied unless he becomes a better example of ahimsa in action than I could ever be. I was never full of himsa in action except the himsa of a coward. He was himsa in action personfied. If now he has assimilated ahimsa, his non- violence should be infinitely richer in romance than his past violence. He should by God’s grace be a modern exemplar of the proverb: “The greater the sinner the greater the saint.” He has shown me authenticated leaves from his diary in which he describes his  first night as a voluntary prisoner as death. I pick up the following striking passage from it:
 Today is the day of my surrender when under divine guidance I surrender everything I can call my own. For a period of 25 years I had faced all perils and worked hard to acquire the light which could guide me in the field of service. As  a revolutionary of good experience I used to look upon my achievements with pride. 19th May is an eventful day in my life—the day when I realized that by treading the trodden path I would not enrich my nation nor make any contribution to the uplift of humanity. This 19th May is the day of the greatest adventure of my life. The present life has no charm, no meaning for me. I must have a new life. How can I have it without embracing death? But to embrace death is not the objective.   A new life is the objective. But how could   I come to it except through death? There was not much room for reason. It was faith which led me to make my choice.
 May the freedom the Sardar now enjoys prove that his notes were no creation of a heated imagination but were an expression of a yearning soul.

467,"September 28, 1939",HINDU-MUSLIM UNITY,"
    
 During my last journey to Simla my attention was drawn to the bitterness with which, it was alleged, the Muslim League and its doings were being criticized in some Congress organs. I have not seen any such criticism for the simple reason that I do not see the papers except for a few moments daily. But if there is any ground  for such complaint, it should certainly be removed. The Muslim League is a great organization. Its President was at one time an ardent Con- gressman. He was the rising hope of the Congress. His battles with Lord Willingdon cannot be forgotten. The Jinnah Hall of the Bombay Congress is a standing monument of the President’s labours for the Congress and a mark of Congressmen’s generous appreciation of his services. The League contains many members who were whole- heartedly with the Congress during the memorable Khilafat days. I refuse to think that these erstwhile comrades can be as bitter in their hearts towards their fellow-workers of yesterday as their speeches and writings of today will show. It is, therefore, wrong of Congressmen and Congress organs if they are bitter against the League or its individual members. The Congress policy of non-violence should put an easy restraint upon the speech, writings and actions of Congress- men in their dealings with the League and its members. They must resolutely believe and hope that sooner or later, and sooner rather than later, there is to be communal unity, not superficial but real and lasting.
 Zahid, the late Big Brother’slibtech_679_footnotelibtech_680_footnoteson, who met me in Simla said, “We must not quarrel. Blood is thicker than water. We are of the same blood. You must work for unity.” Other Muslim friends who met me during the journey said: “You must bring about unity. You alone can do it. Heaven help us if unity is not achieved in your lifetime.” I have a similar message from a great Muslim.
 All this may flatter my vanity. But I know that it does humble me. I wish God had given me the power to realize the hope genuinely expressed by so many Muslim friends. I assure them that not a day passes but I think of and pray for the unity. It is neither for want of will nor effort that I have to be a helpless witness of so much bitterness and quarrelling between the two. I have not lost hope that I shall live to see real unity established between not only Hindus and Muslims but
 
 all the communities that make India a nation. If I knew the way to achieve it today, I know that I have the will and the strength to take it, however difficult or thorny it may be. I know too that the shortest and the surest way lies through non-violence. Some Muslim friends tell me that Muslims will never subscribe to unadulterated non-violence. With them, they say, violence is as lawful and necessary as non-violence. The use of either depends upon circumstances. It does not need Koranic authority to justify the lawfulness of both. That is the well- known path the world has traversed through the ages. There is no such thing as unadulterated violence in the world. But I have heard it from many Muslim friends that the Koran teaches the use of non-violence.
 It regards forbearance as superior to vengeance. The very word Islam means peace, which is non-violence. Badshah Khalibtech_681_footnotea staunch Muslim who never misses his namaz and Ramzan, has accepted out- and-out non-violence as his creed. It would be no answer to say that he does not live up to his creed, even as I know to my shame that I do not. If there is difference in our actions, the difference is not one of kind, it is of degree. But argument about non-violence in the holy Koran is an interpolation, not necessary for my thesis.
 I hold that for the full play of non-violence only one party need believe in it. Indeed if both believe in it and live up to it, there is no appreciation or demonstration of it. To live at peace with one another is the most natural thing to do. But neither party gains the merit that the exercise of non-violence carries with it. Unfortunately, at the present moment, those Hindus who do not know the use of violence, though they have it in their hearts, are sorry for their incapacity and would fain learn the trick—I won’t call it the art—of violence, so as to be able to match what they describe as Muslim violence. And if peace is to be brought about by both parties being equally matched in the use of violence both offensive and defensive, I know that peace will not come in my lifetime and, if it came, I should not care to be witness of it. It will be an armed peace to be broken at any moment. Such has been the peace in Europe. Is not the present war enough to make one sick of such peace?
 Muslim friends who hope much from me will perhaps now recognize my agony for the unattainment of peace in spite of the travail that I have gone through and am still going through. They
 
 should also see that my principal work lies through teaching at least the Hindus to learn the art of non-violence unless I can bring the Muslims to the position the Ali Brothers and their associates took up during the Khilafat days. They used to say: “Even if our Hindu brethren cut us to pieces, yet will we love them. They are our kith and kin.” The late Maulana Abdul Bari used to say: “Muslims of India will never forget the ungrudging and unconditional support that Hindus have given to us at this critical period of our history.” I am sure that both Hindus and Muslims of those days are the same today that they were then. But times have changed and with them have changed our manners. I have no shadow of a doubt that our hearts will meet some day. What seems impossible today for us God will make possible tomorrow. For that day I work, live and pray.

 A STRIKING THOUGHT
 A Pathan friend who met me during the journey, talking about violent deeds, said: “You know the Government is strong enough to put down any violence however organized it may be in our country, but your non-violence is uncanny. You have given our country a wonderful weapon. No Government in the world can put down non- violence.” I complimented my visitor on the striking thought he gave me. In one sentence he presented the matchless beauty of non- violence. If only India can understand the full implications of the remark so naturally, so effortlessly made by the Pathan friend, she will become unconquerable in the face of any combination of invaders. Ten to one there will be no raid on a people trained in non-violence. Indeed the weakest State can render itself immune from attack if it learns the art of non-violence. But a small State, no matter how powerfully armed it is, cannot exist in the midst of a powerful combination of well-armed States. It has to be absorbed by or be under the protection of one of the members of such a combination. Well does Badshah Khan say, as reported by Pyarelal during my last tour in his province :
 We would have fared ill if we had not learnt the lesson of non-violence. We have taken it up quite selfishly. We are born fighters and we keep up the
 tradition by fighting amongst ourselves. Once a murder takes place in a family or a clan it becomes a point of honour to avenge it. There is no such thing generally as forgiveness among us. And so there is avenging and re-avenging and re-re-avenging. And thus the vicious circle never ends. This non-violence has come to us as a positive deliverence.
What is true of the Frontier Provice is true of all of us. Without
 knowing it we move in the vicious circle of violence. A little reflection and corresponding practice should enable us to get out of the circle.
 NARSINGHGARH
 The reader knows that at the invitation of the Dewan of Nar- singhgarh and with the  consent  of  the  Secretary  of the  Central India States Conference I had sent Rajkumari Amrit Kaur to inquire into certain allegations made against the State. The Rajkumari was given every facility by the State to make what inquiry she liked. Shri Kanhaiyalal Vaidya was present during the enquiry. The Rajkumari’s way was made easy by the State giving her every facility. The imme- diate cause of complaint was soon settled to the satisfaction of all con- cerned. The Maharaja has given cautious assurances of civil liberty. The people of these States have hitherto been strangers to civil liberty and all it means. I hope the Maharaja and his advisers will remember that civil liberty means the fullest liberty, consistent with non-violence, to speak, write and do what the people like, even though it may mean strong criticism of the acts of the State. He has, however given full permission to Shri Vaidya to do khadi, Harijan and other constructive work. He has also requested the Rajkumari to send Shri Shankerlal Banker or a representative of the A.I.S.A. to the State in order to explore the possibilities of khadi work in the State which grows plenty of cotton. He has also shown interest in other village industries and basic education. I hope that the beginning so well made will continue uninterrupted, and that the people of Narsinghgarh will show political, economic, social and moral progress on an  ever-increasing  scale. From the correspondence I had with the Dewan, I have reason to hope for the best. Much will depend upon the sym-pathy of the Maharaja and his advisers towards all-round progress and the restrained manner in which the workers use the liberty given by the State. I must congratulate the Maharaja and the Dewan on having shown wisdom and courage in calling in the Congress aid (for my aid is virtually Congress aid) for settling their domestic difficulty. This is perhaps the second instance of its kind.

           SEGAON, 
  September 28, 1939 An advance copy of Reuter’s 	summary of the Lords’ debate on Indian affairs has been shown to 	me. Perhaps silence on my part at this 	juncture would be a distinct disservice both to India and England.  	I was unprepared for the old familiar flavour in the debate in the 	shape of drawing comparisons unflattering to the Congress. I 	maintain that the Congress is an all-inclusive body. Without offence 	to anybody it can be said of it that it is the one body that has 	represented for over half a century, without a rival, the vast 	masses of India irrespective of class or creed. It has not a single 	interest opposed to that of the Mussalmans or that of the people of 	the States. Recent years have shown unmistakably that the Congress 	represents beyond doubt the interests of the people of the States. 	It is that organization which has askedlibtech_684_footnotelibtech_685_footnotefor 	a clear definition of the British intentions. If the British are 	fighting for the freedom of all, then their representatives have to 	state in the clearest possible terms that the freedom of India is 	necessarily included in the war aim. The content of such freedom can 	only be decided by Indians and them alone. Surely it is wrong for 	Lord Zetland to complain as he does, though in gentle terms, that 	the Congress should, at this juncture when Britain is engaged in a 	life- and-death struggle, ask for a clear declaration of British 	intentions. I suggest  that   the   Congress  has  done  nothing   	strange   or   less than      published 	by the The Bombay 	Chronicle and The 	Hindu on September 	29.  
 honourable in asking for such a declaration. Only a free India’s help is of value. And the Congress has every right to know that it can go to the people and tell them that at the end of the war India’s status as an independent country is as much assured as that of Great Britain. As a friend of the British I, therefore, appeal to English statesmen that they will forget the old language of imperialists and open a new chapter for all those who have been held under imperial bondage.

It is only in praise of the experiment at Segaon. Mentally I decry it every day. I will not support what you write.

 THANKS
 Sir Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan has made much of my seventy- first  birthday.  He  has  sent  me  his  booklibtech_692_footnotelibtech_693_footnoteof  praises  from  friends, known and unknown to me. With it he has been good enough to send also a covering letter of further appreciation. I do not know when I shall have the time to go through all the tributes collected in the volume. I can only pray that God may give me the capacity to live up to the contributors’ picture of me whatever it may be. To Sir Sarvepalli and all those who have sent me their blessings and greeti- ngs, I return my thanks hereby. It is impossible for me to send per- sonal acknowledgements.
 One warning I should like to issue to my admirers. Some would like to erect my statues in public places, some others would have portraits, yet others would proclaim my birthday as a public holiday.
 C. Rajagopalachari knows me well and so he has wisely vetoed the proposal to declare my birthday a public holiday. These are days of dissensions and discord. I should feel deeply humiliated if my name became in any way an occasion for accentuating them. Avoidance of such opportunity is a real service to the country and me. Statues, photographs and the like have no place today. The only praise I would like and treasure is promotion of the activities to which my life is dedicated. He or she who does a single act to produce communal harmony or to destroy the demon of untouchability or to advance the cause   of  the   villages,  brings  me   real joy  and  peace.  Workers  are
 
 striving during these days to dispose of the khadi stock that has accumulated in various khadi bhandars. I can conceive no greater or more tangible blessing to me than to know that the whole of the surplus khadi stock was taken up by the people during the khadi week or fortnight mis-named after me. I am nothing without or apart from my activities.
 FURTHER FALSEHOODS
 I had the misfortune to remark the other daylibtech_694_footnotelibtech_695_footnoteon the sanatanist propaganda being supported by falsehoods. I have the following wires from Madura and Kumbakonam respectively :
 Srirangam temple being forcibly entered today. Armed Madura temple peons dispersing opposing orthodox worshippers. This is waging war during world war. Pray issue immediate instructions suspending such high- handedness. We have after all to live together. K. R. VENKATARAMA IYER .
 Minister Rajan threatening Harijan-entry Srirangam with police. Pray interference to avoid bloodshed. Inform Rajaji. KUPPUSAMI.
Rajaji happened to be in Wardha when these wires were received.
He gave the following reply :
 There is no Harijan-entry being tried in Srirangam. This is impossible without Government consent, and the Government has not yet given any such consent.
In the face of this flat denial I can only regard the wires as
 figments of imagination. It is noteworthy that there is no complaint from Srirangam itself. Madura and Kumbakonam are too far from Srirangam to know first-hand what may happen there. Trichy is the only town near enough to Srirangam to know events there, if the people interested themselves in the happenings in that temple town. An opposition that requires palpable falsehoods to support it, must be on its last legs. I have seen correspondence which shows that Meen- akshi temple has not been boycotted by anybody except a few ortho- dox Brahmins. It is as popular as ever with the vast mass of temple- going population.

480,"February 25, 1926",LACK OF SENSE OF HUMOUR,"
    
 
 I cannot resist publishing the following very frank and well- meaning letter addressed to the Editor :
 I earnestly request you to be kind enough to give me a few minutes to clear some of my doubts. I write this letter not as a critic. I am an ardent seeker after truth and one of the many ‘Ekalavyas’ of Bapuji.
 I am rather very much pained to read the following in this week’s
 Harijan in the course of a note under the caption “Why Only Prohibition”libtech_696_footnotewritten by Bapuji: “Therefore if I treated these evils as I have treated the drink evil and if I begin to organize picketing in respect of them, I should lose my caste, lose my mahatmaship and even lose my head which of course has very little value at this time of my life. But as I do not wish to suffer the triple loss,    I must allow my correspondent and others like him to think that I am shirking an obvious duty.”
 I was not prepared for the above note, especially the portion quoted by me, along with his previous writings and my reading of his life. For, I was, and am still, of the opinion that Bapuji stands for ‘Truth’ and he would be ready to lose any donation whatever it may be, his mahatmaship, his caste and, if necessary, even his head for the sake of Truth, i. e., God.
 Now let us examine some of his writings. In his Autobiography (Part V, Ch. X) he says when he accepted Dudabhai, an untouchable, and his family, “All monetary help, however, was stopped. . . . With  the  stopping  of monetary help came rumours of proposed social boycott. We were prepared for all this.”libtech_697_footnote
 This clearly indicates that he was not ready to accept donations or maintain his caste at the cost of his principle, i. e., Truth.
 In an article “Truth v. Brahmacharya” (Young India, February 25, 1926) he
 says: “My mahatmaship is worthless. It is due to my outward activities, due to my politics, which is the least part of me and is therefore evanescent. What is of abiding worth is my insistence on truth, non-violence and brahmacharya.”libtech_698_footnoteIn yet another article he has tried to show the “Handicap of Mahatmaship”libtech_699_footnote(Young India, Nov. 8, 1928).
 What else is necessary to show that he cares naught for his mahatmaship?
 
 Moreover he says in the course of a conversation reported in Harijan, August 29, 1936: “I am here to serve no one else but myself, to find my own realization.       Man’s ultimate aim is  the realization of  God, and all  his
 activities, social, political religious have to be guided by the ultimate aim of the vision of God.”libtech_700_footnotelibtech_701_footnoteIn another place (Young India, October 11, 1928) he says:
 “I know too that I shall never know God if I do not wrestle with and against evil even at the cost of life itself.”libtech_702_footnote
 I hope that these are enough to prove that he stands for Truth and not for anything else. It may be perhaps that he does not recognize these evils, viz., gambling, race, cinema, etc., as such or so dangerous as the evil of drink or untouchability to lead an agitation against them, “to wrestle with and against them at the cost of life itself”.
 Anyhow I am sure that there will be a number of readers of Harijan like me who will not be prepared to read a statement like this from the pen of Bapuji. Now I ask you what does he stand for? For donations, caste, mahatmaship, etc., at the cost of Truth, or for Truth at the cost of all these? Will you kindly refer this to Bapuji and correct the misunderstanding created by the above note ?
If the writer, who is manifestly a close student of my writings
 and is himself a schoolmaster, took seriously my note in Harijan about gambling, etc., there must be quite a number of other readers who too had the same doubts as the correspondent. The corres- pondent has quoted enough from my writings to enable him to know that the note was written in a humorous vein. But unfortunately many of us have no sense of humour. Therefore, in order to secure appreciation, humour evidently has to be boldly labelled as such. The reader should have known that by writing the note I had expressed my disapproval of cinemas, races, share market, gambling and the like. I had tried to show also that these vices were fashionable and therefore were not capable of being dealt with like prohibition. I claim to be a practical reformer. I know almost instinctively what vices are ripe for being publicly dealt with. Of course it may be that I lack the courage to tackle the others and cover my cowardice by pleading untimeliness. No man can get over his limitations beyond a point.
 But my correspondent has shown from my writings that at the time I had the courage to the face unpopularity and loss of every- thing. Let those who might have been disturbed by my innocent note
 
 reassure themselves that I retain the same spirit as before to face difficulties and trials in the prosecution of public causes. Time has not weakened it in any way; it has, if possible, strengthened it. But I am humble enough to restrain my ambition and to feel thankful to God for what capacity He has vouchsafed to me for the service of the country and humanity.

482,"October 2, 1939",UNFORTUNATE PEOPLE OF TRAVANCORE,"
  	I have just glanced through your production for five minutes. I have 	nothing whatsoever to say against the front page or the contents. 	You have every right to express your views in the manner that may 	seem best to you.  Yours sincerely,  M. K. GANDHI 	From   a  facsimile: 	 Mahatma   Gandhi—The   	Great  Rogue   of   India, between  pp. 	4 and 5         	An evil fate seems to dog the career of the people of Travancore in 	so far as they are represented by the State Congress. The Congress 	is composed of some of its bravest and most self-sacrificing men. 	But unfortunately there never have been happy relations between them 	and the able Dewan of the State. The charges brought against him by 	the Congress in the preliminary stages of the movement for res- 	ponsible government somehow or other acerbated the relations. The 	framers of the charges, as I happen to know from personal con- 	versations with them, honestly believed in them. But when I reasoned 	with them that they were bound to withdraw them if their cause was 	the attainment of responsible government, and not the removal of the 	Dewan—a case in which India could not be interested—they saw the 	wisdom of my advice and promptly acted upon it. This cleared the 
 ground for them and made their case unassailable. But I feel that the estrangement created by the charges between the Dewan and  the leaders has persisted. I wish it has been otherwise. Though civil disobedience has been discontinued and personal talks between the Dewan and the leaders have taken place, cordiality between them has been lacking. On the contrary there has been a ring of distrust about their talks. The Dewan has kept himself at a safe distance from the leaders. Negotiations after a struggle are generally preceded by discharge of prisoners and withdrawal of prosecutions and removal of other disabilities. In Travancore these things have not happened. Can- cellations of lawyers’ sanads and suspension of elected members of the Assembly remain. In fact there is not much sign of an advance by the State towards the leaders. And now comes like a bombshell suspension of negotiations for political reform. These are the words of the Travancore communiquelibtech_703_footnotelibtech_704_footnote:
 For reasons which must be obvious and which have, for instance, influenced the Government of India in their decisionlibtech_705_footnoteregarding the Federal negotiations, no conversations can possibly take place regarding any constitutional reforms until normal conditions are restored and the position is stabilized.
This is followed by the following minatory warning :
 With reference to the statement to the Press issued by the President of the Travancore State Congress and his letter to the Dewan, Government wish to point out while they do not intend to curb or put a check upon ordinary activities of political organizations and while their ideas are unaltered as to consultations with political organizations and leaders as soon as conditions permit, they cannot possibly allow an organized scheme of agitation to be conducted at this juncture, in view of the present situation and especially the likelihood of increased unemployment owing to war conditions and the public excitement that may be caused by the situation regarding foodstuffs and other commodities. Such a scheme of agitation is bound to give rise to serious repercussions and results, and the Government, who have a duty to protect the law-abiding inhabitants of the State, cannot possibly take the risks involved thereby nor can they at present devote any attention to questions relating to constitutional demands. Government desire to warn the Travancore State
 
 
 Congress and other organizations with similar programme that they will be forced to take steps both under the ordinary law and under the Defence of Travancore Proclamation and Rules for maintaining normal conditions and a peaceful atmosphere in the State.
The reason for suspension of contemplated reform is wholly
 unconvincing. So far as I know in no State has such suspension been thought necessary. Indeed I venture to suggest that the offer of the States to the British Government lacks the spirit assumed to be behind the aims of the Allies, viz., the saving of democracy for the world. The States’ offer to be consistent with the time spirit has to carry with it the will and the co-operation of their people. This is clearly impossible if the people of the States do not feel that they are partners with the Princes in the administration of the States. Viewed in this light, the grant to the people of the greatest measures of responsibility consis- tent with their own safety becomes a first and first-class war measure so far as the States are concerned. And who will say that the people of Travancore, where education has for years been given to the people on a liberal scale, are ready for shouldering the burden of managing their own affairs? The responsibility in large States can mean no more than that of a big corporation in the Provinces. This suspension of political advance in Travancore on the ground of war comes as a shock and a surprise. What connection political reform in the States has with the suspension of Federation is not easy to understand. But for the opposition of the Princes, the Muslim League and  the Congress, Federation would have come long ago; and I make bold to say that the British Government would gladly bring it in today if the three parties desire it. Political reform in the States is overdue and has to come irrespective of Federation.
 I mean no offence to the Princes when I say that generally speaking they may in a sense be compared to Herr Hitler. The difference is that they  have  not  his  dash,  energy,  resourcefulness and capacity. Every one of the Princes has the powers of absolute autocrats, and they have times without number exercised such powers. In their own sphere they enjoy powers which the British monarchs have not possessed for centuries. The present British King is merely the first citizen of his country. He cannot arrest a single person at his mere wish. He cannot administer corporal punishment to a single person without coming like any other citizen under the law of the State. This severe limitation on the British monarchy is rightly the envy of the world. But every Indian Prince is a Hilter in his own State.
 He can shoot his people without coming under any law. Hilter enjoys no greater powers. If I am not mistaken, the German Constitution does impose some limits on the Fuhrer. Great Britain’s position as the self- constituted guardian of democracy is compromised so long as it has more than 500 autocrats as its allies. The Princes will render Great Britain a real service when they can offer their services not as so many autocrats but as true representa-tives of their people. I venture, therefore, to suggest to Sir C. P. Rama-swami Aiyar, the distinguished constitutional lawyer that he is, that he has ill served the people and the Prince of Travancore and the British Government by suspending political reform and threatening the State Congress with dire consequences if it dares to carry on the contemplated agitation for political advance during these times.

 October 3, 1939 It will be a very serious tragedy in this tragic war if Britain is found to fail in the very first test of sincerity of her professions about
democracy. Do those declarations, or do they not, include the full
 freedom of India according to the wishes of her people? This is a very simple and elementary question asked by the Congress. The Congress has the right to ask that question. I hope that the answer will be as it is expected by the Congress and, let me say, all those who wish well by Great Britain.

497,,INDIA’S ATTITUDE,"
         	On the 27th August last, i.e., just before the senseless war broke 	out, Shrimati Kamaladevi Chattopadhyaya wrote to me as follows :    
 I have sent you an appeal through The Bombay Chronicle, asking you to voice the attitude of India and of the exploited peoples of the East on the present situation. What I meant was not mere reiteration of our old position that we can have nothing to do with this imperialist war, but something more than that. The present conflict is mainly centred round the usual scramble for colonies, or spheres of influence as they are now called in polite phraseology. On this question the world thinks there are only two opinions, for it hears only two views: one which believes in the maintaining of the satus quo; the
 other which wants a change but on the same basis, in other words, a redistribution of the loot and the right to exploit, which of course means war. It is in the very nature of things that such a redistribution can never come about without an armed conflict. Whether there will be anyone or anything left to enjoy, of course, is another question. But the world is mainly torn between these two. If the thesis of the one is accepted, then that of the other should also be. For, if England and France have the right to rule over large tracts and big nations, then Germany and Italy have an equal right. There is as little moral justification in the former countries crying halt to Hitler as there is in his what he calls his rightful claims.
 That there is a third view the world hardly seems to think, for it rarely hears it. And it is so essential that it should find expression: the voice of the people who are mere pawns in the game. Neither Danzig nor the Polish corridor is the issue. The issue is the principle on which the whole of this present Western civilization is based; the right of the strong to rule and exploit the weak. Therefore it is centered round the whole colonial question, and Hitler and Mussolini are never tired of reminding the world of that. And that is exactly the reason why England has raised the cry of the Empire in danger. This question therefore vitally concerns all of us.
 We are against the status quo. We are fighting against it for we want a change in it. But our alternative is not war for we know that the real solution does not lie there. We have an alternative to offer which is the only solution of this horrible muddle and the key to future world peace. It is this which I would like to be placed before the world. It may seem today like a cry in the wilderness; still we know that it is the voice which will ultimately prevail; and it is those hands which seem so feeble before these mailed fists that will finally reshape a battered humanity.
 You are eminently fitted to give voice to it. India has, I think, a peculiar place today in the colonies of the world. It has both a moral prestige and organizational strength enjoyed by few colonies. The others look to it for   a lead in many matters. It has already shown to the world a superior technique
 
 of struggle whose moral value the world is bound to appreciate some day. India has therefore to tell a very distraught and maddened world that there is another path humanity must tread if it would save itself from these periodical disasters and bring peace and harmony to a bleeding world. It is only those who have suffered so much against this system and who are bravely struggling to change it that can speak with all the conviction and moral basis necessary, speak not only for themselves but all the exploited peoples of the world.
I  am sorry I  had not seen Shrimati Kamaladevi’s letter to  the
 Chronicle. Try as I will, I simply cannot do adequate justice to the reading of newspapers. The letter then remained on my file for want of time to deal with it. But I think delay has not affected the object of her letter. Perhaps this is the psychological moment for me to express what is or should be India’s attitude. I agree with Kamaladevi’s analysis of the motives of the parties to the war. Both are fighting for their existence and for the furtherance of their policies. There is, however, this great difference between the two; however incomplete or equivocal the declarations of the Allies are, the world has interpreted them to mean that they are fighting for saving democracy. Herr Hitler is fighting for the extension of the German boundaries, although he was told that he should allow his claims to be submitted to an impartial tribunal for examination. He contemptuously rejected the way  of peace or persuasion and chose that of the sword. Hence my sympathy for the cause of the Allies. But my sympathy must not be interpreted to mean endorsement, in any shape or form, of the doctrine of the sword for the defence even of proved right. Proved right should be capable of being vindicated by right means as against the rude, i.e., sanguinary, means. Man may and should shed his own blood for establishing what he considers to be his ‘right’. He may not shed the blood of his opponent who disputes his ‘right’ India as represented by the Congress has been fighting in order to prove her ‘right’, not by the sword but by the non-violent method. And she has carved out for herself a unique place and prestige in the world although she is yet far—let us hope, not very far—from the independence of her dream. Her novel method has evidently struck the imagination of the world. It has the right to expect India to play a decisive part in this war, which no people of the world have wanted, by insisting that the peace this time is not to be a mockery designed to share among the victors the spoils of war and to humiliate the vanquished. Jawaharlal Nehru, who has a right to speak for the Congress, has said in stately language that the peace must mean freedom for those who are held in bondage by
 the imperialist powers of the world. I have every hope  that  the Congress will also be able to show the world that the power the armaments give to defend right is nothing compared to the power that non-violence gives to do the same thing and that too with better show of reason. Armaments can show no reason, they can make only a pretence of it.

 In dealing with the situation in Travancore last weeklibtech_713_footnoteI omitted to refer to the controversy between the Dewan and the State Congress as to the source of the information on the basis of which I had wiredlibtech_714_footnoteto the Dewan hoping that his notice did not ban the conference that was to be held in Travancore by the State Congress. Shri Thanu Pillai had said that neither he nor any other member of the State Congress was responsible for suggesting that there was any ban. He could not, therefore, say that my telegram to the Dewan was based on such information. In saying this he was quite correct. As a matter of fact, however, my wire was certainly based upon the information contained in Shri Verghese’s wirelibtech_715_footnote. But there was no suppression of fact by Shri Verghese. Shri Thanu Pillai made his position clear in his letter to the Dewan dated the 23rd ultimo thus :
 In the letter under reference, Government seem to disbelieve my statement that no one from the State Congress informed Gandhiji that there was a ban on the conference. Your contention is at best an inference from a telegram from Gandhiji while my assertion is confined to facts within my knowledge. The following is the substance of the Government communique as communicated by wire to Gandhiji by the Chairman of the Reception Committee: ‘Government sprung surprise in issuing Press note this noon in view outbreak war state of emergency arisen necessitating measures safeguarding public peace and avoiding incidents likely creating public excitement or large concourses. Regarding conference preparations being made for processions and demonstrations and as large crowd may gather at conference, Government in public interest call upon conference organizers and
 
 
 all political or other organizations in the State to postpone or stop assemblages at present juncture and until further notice.’ Gandhiji might have taken the Government communique calling upon the organizers of the conference and all political or other organizations to postpone or stop such assemblages at the present juncture and until further notice as virtually amounting to prohibiting all meetings and processions. If Government still persists in their contention that the State Congress misled Gandhiji, they should in fairness substantiate it.
The language according to the Travancore legal form may not
 mean a ban. I could give it no other meaning. Whether it was technically a ban or not, its effects was that the Congress authorities felt obliged to cancel processions and the other demonstrative part of their programme. If, therefore, there is any difference between the language used by the Dewan in the Government communique and a ban, it is the same that exists between Tweedledum and Tweedledee. It is also suggested that the communique had to be issued because of objections taken to the holding of the conference. Why should a big organization be prevented from functioning properly merely because somebody objects to its so doing? I can only appeal to the Dewan not to harass the leaders of the State Congress beyond the point of endurance. They should not be made useless even for constructive constitutional activities. This is their humble programme :
 This conference resolves that the immediate programme of the State Congress will be :
  Intense, 	systematic and 	countrywide propaganda 	for educating 	the people 	on the 	issue of 	responsible government.  The 	strengthening of 	the State 	Congress organization 	throughout the State and putting the same on self-reliant and permanent foundations.  Real 	and effective mass contact 	through a carefully 	planned programme, 	emphasizing a mass 	literacy campaign, khadi 	and swadeshi and 	prohibition. Establishment 	of a permanent 	volunteer and desh-sevika service.  Opening 	of centres 	or camps 	for a minimum 	period of training 	for workers 	in the various 	programmes outlined above. 
 In order to leave no room for doubt, this conference has to point out that the above programme will be wholly constitutional, and that the State Congress has no intention of creating a conflict with Government in the prosecuting of the above programme. The object of the above programme is to make the constitutional demand of the people irresistible.
 They do not ask for immediate responsible government. Surely they have every right to educate the people along the lines of
 responsible government. It should be a proud day for the Travancore Maharaja and for his people when it can be said of the latter that by patient and quiet training they made themselves fit to shoulder the responsibility of managing the affairs of their State.

499,"October 9, 1939",A MINISTER’S DREAM,"
    
 If you can give a message or direction to the Provincial Governments and the people to see that spinning and weaving are made compulsory for boys and girls in all the schools, I have no doubt that within a short time the children of schools will be wearing cloth made by themselves. This will be the first step. I have not lost faith in your ideals and I am hoping to see that each home will make its own cloth and each village will become self-sufficient not only with regard to cloth but also every other article of necessity under your village industries scheme and education scheme. I believe with you that real swaraj in this land can be established only when the budget of the villager is balanced alongside of the budget of the Provincial Government or that of the Government of India which is brought about by artificial adjustments and manipulations generally.
Thus writes a Congress Minister. If I had the powers of an
 autocrat, I would certainly make hand-spinning compulsory in at least the primary schools. A Minister who has the faith should do so. There are several useless things made compulsory in our schools.  Why should not this most useful art be made compulsory? But nothing can be made compulsory in a democratic system, if it is not widely popular. Thus compulsion in democracy is only so called. It removes laziness, it does not force will. Such compulsion is an educative process. I suggest a milder preliminary course. Let there be prizes given to the best spinner. This competition will induce many if not all to take part in it. No plan will succeed if the schoolmasters themselves have no faith in it. If basic education is accepted by the Provincial Governments, hand-spinning and the like is not merely part of the curriculum, it is the vehicle of education. If basic education takes root, khadi surely becomes universal and comparatively cheap in this afflicted land of ours.

500,"October 10, 1939",THE UNBRIDGEABLE GULF,"
    
The following letter comes from a friend :
 In the Harijan dated 30-9-1939, on page 1 at the end of your articlelibtech_716_footnote, you write: “Speed is not the end of life. Man sees more and lives more truly by walking to his duty.”
 And then you subscribe: “On the train to Simla”. I am surprised that, with all the fund of humour you possess, you could not see how the words “On the train to Simla” pointed the finger of ridicule to the statement “Man sees more and lives more truly by walking to his duty.”
 Time was when this friend used to believe in my method and was a valuable supporter. Somehow or other I have now fallen from grace. He should have had no difficulty in following the rich humour behind the writing which he exposes to ridicule. But I must deprive the ridicule of its sting by informing my friend that I was in my senses when I wrote the note referred to. I might easily have avoided the exact place where it was penned. But I wanted to add point to my remark and to discover to the reader the vast gulf that separates me from my ideal. Let the waverers take heart from the fact that though my note containing the flat contradiction of the ideal has provided my friend with mirth, I have got the credit for trying my best to live up to the ideals, I may profess. If I am to make an ever-increasing approach to my ideal, I must let the world see my weaknesses and failures so that I may be saved from hypocrisy and so that even for very shame I would try my utmost to realize the ideal. The contradiction pointed out by the friend also shows that between the ideal and practice there always must be an unbridgeable gulf. The ideal will cease to be one if it becomes possible to realize it. The pleasure lies in making the effort, not in its fulfilment. For, in our progress towards the goal we ever see more and more enchanting scenery.
 Coming, however, to the friend’s gibe let me tell him and the reader that I could pen those lines because it is never a pleasure to me to travel by motor or rail or even a cart. It is always a pleasure to walk. Nor should I mind in the least if every rail was removed and men, except the sick and the maimed, had to walk to their businesses. I can not only imagine but am working for a civilization  in  which possession of a car will be considered no merit and railways will find no place. It would not be for me an unhappy event if the world
 
 became once more as large as it used to be at one time. Hind Swaraj was written in 1909libtech_717_footnotelibtech_718_footnote. Since then it has undergone many editions and has been translated in many languages of the world. I was asked last year by Shrimati Sophia Wadia to write a forewordlibtech_719_footnotelibtech_720_footnotefor the edition that she was bringing out. I had the pleasure, therefore, of having to re-read it carefully. The reader may know that I could not revise a single idea. I had no desire to revise the language. It is a fair  translation of the original in Gujarati. The key to understand that incredibly simple (so simple as to be regarded foolish) booklet is to realize that it is not an attempt to go back to the so-called ignorant, dark ages. But it is an attempt to see beauty in voluntary simplicity, poverty and slowness. I have pictured that as my ideal. I shall never reach it myself and hence cannot expect the nation to do so. But the modern rage for variety, for flying through the air, for multiplicity of wants, etc., have no fascination for me. They deaden the inner being in us. The giddy heights which man’s ingenuity is attempting, take us away from our Maker who is nearer to us than the nails are to the flesh which they cover.
 Therefore even whilst I am travelling at the rate of 40 miles per hour, I am conscious that it is a necessary evil, and that my best work is to be done in little Segaon containing 700 souls, and in the neighbouring villages to which I can walk. But being a highly prac- tical man I do not avoid railway travelling or motoring for the mere sake of looking foolishly consistent.libtech_721_footnotelibtech_722_footnoteLet the reader know that during the hurricane Harijan tourslibtech_723_footnotelibtech_724_footnotethat Thakkar Bapa had arranged for me I had gently suggested to him that I would like to do the whole of the years’s tour on foot. He would not listen. And we had violent demonstrations during the tour. Twice or oftener we escaped serious injury and it might have been even death. When we reached  Purilibtech_725_footnotelibtech_726_footnote, there was fear of bloodshed. So I put my foot down and insisted on performing the remaining pilgrimage on foot. Thakkar Bapa readily consented.libtech_727_footnotelibtech_728_footnoteWell,  the  demonstrators  who    were  prepared  only   for
 
 demonstrations by rail and motor could not overtake the pilgrims who covered only 8 to 10 miles per day in two stages. This was the most effective part of our tour. The awakening was solid. Our experiences were rich. And the demonstrators had no excitement left for them. They had no desire to kill me in cold blood. They were out for sensations. Sensations are not to be had with non-violent men and women walking to their mission without any fear of man and in the certain knowledge of having God as their infallible Guide and Protector.

501,"October 10, 1939",ON TRIAL,"
    
 In the course of the conversation with the members of the Working Committee, I discovered that their non-violence had never gone beyond fighting the British Government with that weapon. I had hugged the belief that Congressmen had appreciated the logical result of the practice of non-violence for the past twenty years in fighting the biggest imperialist power in the world. But in great experiments like that of non-violence, hypothetical questions have hardly any play. I myself used to say in answer to questions that when we had actually acquired independence we would know whether we could defend ourselves non-violently or not. But today the question is no longer hypothetical. Whether there is on the part of the British Government a favourable declaration or not, the Congress has to decide upon the course it would adopt in the event of an invasion of India. For, though there may be no settlement with the Government, the Congress has to declare its policy and say whether it would fight the invading host violently or non-violently.
 So far as I can read the Working Committee’s mind after a fairly full discussion, the members think the Congressmen are un- prepared for non-violent defence against armed invasion.
 This is tragic. Surely the means adopted for driving an enemy from one’s house must, more or less, coincide with those to  be adopted for keeping him out of the house. If anything, the latter pro- cess must be easier. The fact, however, is that our fight has not been one of non-violent resistance of the strong. It has been one of passive resistance of the weak. Therefore there is no spontaneous response in
 our hearts, at this supreme moment, to an undying faith in the efficacy of non- violence. The Working Committee, therefore, wisely said that they were not ready for the logical step. The tragedy of the situation is that, if the Congress is to throw in its lot with those who believe in the necessity of armed defence of India, the past twenty years will have been years of gross neglect of the primary duty of Congressmen to learn the science of armed warfare. And I fear that history will hold me, as the general of the fight, responsible for the tragedy. The future historian will say that I should have perceived that the nation was learning not non-violence of the strong but merely passivity of the weak and I should have, therefore, provided for Congressmen’s military training.
 Being obsessed with the idea that somehow or other India will learn true non-violence, it would not occur to me to invite my co- workers to train themselves for armed defence. On the contrary, I used to discountenance all sword-play and the display of stout lathis. Nor am I even now repentant for the past. I have the unquenchable faith that, of all the countries in the world, India is the one country which can learn the art of non-violence, that if the test were applied even now, there would be found, perhaps, thousands of men and women who would be willing to die without harbouring malice against their persecutors. I have harangued crowds and told them repeatedly that they might have to suffer much including death by shooting. Did not thousands of men and women brave hardships during the salt cam- paign equal to any that soldiers are called upon to bear? No different capacity is required from what has been already evinced, if India has to contend against an invader. Only it will have to be on a vaster scale. One thing ought not to be forgotten. India unarmed would not require to be destroyed through poison gas or bombardment. It is the Maginot line that has made the Siegfried line necessary, and vice versa. Defence of India by the present methods has been necessary because she is an appendage of Britain. Free India  can have  no enemy. And if her people have learnt the art of saying resolutely ‘No’ and acting up to it. I dare say, no one would want to invade her.
 Our economy would be so modelled as to prove no temptation for the exploiter.
 But some Congressmen will say: ‘Apart from the British, India has so many martial races within her border that they will want to put up a fight for the country which is as much theirs as ours’. This is perfectly true. I am, therefore, talking for the moment only of
 Congressmen. How would they act in the event of an invasion? We shall never convert the whole of India to our creed unless we are prepared to die for it.
 The opposite course appals me. Already the bulk of the army is manned by the Mussalmans of the North, Sikhs and Gurkhas. If the masses of the South and the Centre wish to become militarized, the Congress, which is supposed to represent them, will have to enter into competition with them. The Congress will then have to be party to an enormous military budget. There may be all these things without the Congress consent. It will make all the difference in the world whether the Congress is party to them or not. The world is looking for something new and unique from India. The Congress will be lost in the crowd if it wears the same old outworn armour that the world is wearing today. The Congress has a name because it represents non- violence as a political weapon par excellence. If the Congress helps the Allies as a representative of non-violence, it will give to the Allied cause a prestige and a power which will be invaluable in deciding the ultimate fate of the war. But the members of the Working Committee have honestly and bravely not made the profession of such non- violence.
 My position is, therefore, confined to myself alone. I have to find out whether I have any fellow-traveller along the lonely path. If I am in the minority of one, I must try to make converts. Whether one or many, I must declare my faith that it is better for India to discard violence altogether even for defending her borders. For India to enter into the race for armaments is to court suicide. With the loss of India to non-violence that last hope of the world will be gone. I must live up to the creed I have professed for the last half a centrury and hope to the last breath that India will make non-violence her creed, preserve man’s dignity, and prevent him from reverting to the type from which he is supposed to have raised himself.

FRIENDlibtech_730_footnote","
    
 
 
SEGAON,
  [On or after October 10, 1939]libtech_731_footnote  FRIEND: 	We have been out-and-out Gandhji-ites for several years and we do 	not know what we are to do at this juncture. The Working Committee’s 	resolution has puzzled us. GANDHIJI: 	But let me know what you mean by ‘out-and-out Gandhi-ites’.  Those 	who are prepared to follow your principles through thick and thin.  	Well, then let me tell you, I am not one myself, for in my  practice 	I am far from what I have conceived as the ideals of truth and 	non-violence.  I 	quite see what you mean. I simply wanted to say that in our humble 	way we were trying to do constructive work as shown by you. What are 	we to do if civil disobedience comes? We voted for the A.I.C.C. 	resolutionlibtech_732_footnotebecause 	it was the official resolution sponsored by Rajendra Babu, Sardar 	and others. But when we think of non- violence we do not see how we 	could have voted for it. There 	was nothing against non-violence in voting for the  	resolution. What you will do is of consequence. And, as you will see 	from the next Harijan, I am writinglibtech_733_footnotelibtech_734_footnotefor 	friends like you. You will see the position developed from week to 	week. But I can sum it up for you. There is no question of civil 	disobedience for there is no atmos- phere for it—at any rate there 	is no question of civil disobedience in the aggressive sense as we 	launched in 1930 and 1932. We might have to offer it if all 	constructive work was made impossible, that is to say, if grave 	irritation was given by Government. I fear no such thing. At any 	rate I will not keep ‘Gandhi-ites’ in the dark. You should make 	a point of following carefully what I write every week.  But 	my difficulty is this. We 	believe implicitly 	in  developing 	 strength through 	constructive work which 	is non-violence 	in action. 	But as 	we are part 	and parcel of the Congress, they may come down with a heavy hand on our ashrams and     A.I.C.C. 	session was held in Wardha on October 9 and 10.    
 take possession of them as they did in 1930.
 It will depend on what the Congress will do. Supposing what is unlikely happens and the Congress decides upon a course of aggre- ssive civil disobedience, for which as I have said there is no atmos- phere, you will have to isolate your ashram from the Congress, that is to say, you may have to secede from the Congress even at the risk of being labelled as ‘cowards’.
 I see, I see. There is one thing more about which I wanted to ask you. We have quarrels in the course of our day-to-day work in the ashram.
Therefore, you see, you are far from being ‘out-and-out
Gandhi-ites’.
 No, but we have implicit faith in your teachings, and it is only in that sense that I used that term.
But if in spite of that faith they quarrel, then they have not
 understood even the A.B.C. of ‘Gandhism’. What is faith worth if it is not translated into action.
 We may not go about parroting truth and non-violence and steering clear of them in daily life. Take the law of gravitation. The discovery of the law led to numerous other discoveries based on the law. Even so unless you go on discovering new applications of the law of non-violence you do not profit by it. You have to reduce it to a science. To say that you have bickerings in the ashram which make smooth work impossible or difficult, is to say that non-violence is not being practised. Don’t you go away with the impression that we have no bickerings here in Segaon. We have them, and that is why I said that I was not an ‘out-and-out Gandhi-ite’. But if I seriously thought that these bickerings would make communal life impossible, I might close down the institution. It is not an improbability. I should not shirk that duty if the idea possessed me. Well, that is only to say that the difficulties are enormous everywhere. Let God guide you and me and us all.

If you can make some arrangement for that, you may let her go. There is no sanatorium in Nagpur. But the T. B. specialist is a competent, experienced and philanthropic doctor. Balkoba and Mathew were treated by him. You will stay at Wardha, i.e., in Segaon, or wherever else I arrange. Hence if you do not feel better, come over. Let the doctor there examine you.

510,"October 13, 1939",STATEMENT TO THE PRESSlibtech_739_footnote,"
    
 
 
SEGAON,
  October 13, 1939 I regard 	the recent resolutionlibtech_740_footnotelibtech_741_footnoteof the A.I.C.C. on the situation as moderate and wise. 	It was bound to reiterate the Congress demand for an 	unequivocal declaration. Its merit lies in not fixing any time-limit  	for the declaration. It is noteworthy that the resolution was 	carried by a majority of three to one. It is to be hoped that the 	British Government will appreciate the friendly spirit in which the 	Congress is approaching the situation. It is to be hoped also that 	the Europeans of India will range themselves alongside of the 	Congress.  But  the greatest help can only come from Congressmen 	themselves. If they do not act on the square, no external sympathy 	and even help will be of any avail. I see that impatience has seized 	some Congressmen who want to be doing something to signify their 	opposition to a war which they believe to be for defending 	imperialism. I suggest to them that they will be defeating the 	common purpose by acting in opposition to the Congress decision 	expressed in the only way open to a democratic organization. They 	had their say at the A.I.C.C. meeting. They are in honour bound to 	defer direct action till the Working Committee or the  	A.I.C.C. decides otherwise. No reliance can be placed upon an 	organization which is not able to exercise effective control over 	its members. Imagine an army whose soldiers, under the false belief 	that they are advancing the common cause, adopt measures in defiance 	of those taken by the head-quarters. Such action may well spell 	defeat. Therefore I beseech Congressmen at this critical juncture to 	desist from any action that would savour of indiscipline or 	defiance. They should surely see that by such action they undermine 	Congress  prestige and weaken its influence.  Harijan, 	21-10-1939

Courtesy Dr. Sushila Nayyar         	The following article by Shri Gajanan Naik on the superiority of 	palms over cane and beetroot for the purpose of yielding sugar is 	presented for the criticism of sugar experts:libtech_742_footnote  Sugar 	in its pure form is composed of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen (C12 	H22 	O11 	). As such it does 	not take anything from the soil, but the crops now mainly cultivated 	for extracting sugar, viz., the beet and the cane, require for their 	develop-  ment 	a number of substances from the soil in which they grow. Therefore 	their culture exhausts the soil. What is worse still is that the 	space now occupied by the beet in Europe and the cane in the 	tropics, might and ought to serve for the culture of food and fodder 	crops. . . .  But 	people must have sugar. Is there a way of getting it without 	encroaching on the soil fit for superior crops? Yes—according to 	the opinion expressed by Mr. Devry at the Congress of Giessen. 	(Watt’s Dictionary 	of the Economic Products of India, Vol. 	I, pp. 301-4.) He says that palms can supply the required sugar for 	they can be grown on inferior soil where even to try to grow cereals 	would be a vain endeavour.  The 	statement throws much 	light on 	the place of the palm for  the  gur 	industry. It 	would be 	wrong to 	take it 	only as 	a philanthropic 	proposition for exploring 	avenues of employment 	for the toddy-tappers 	who will be 	rendered idle through prohibition. It has immense potentialities in the economics of  national 	agriculture. . . .    
 Sugarcane cannot be grown with profit in the same field year after year. It has  to be rotated with some cereal.	Cane has to be cultivated year after year while
 palms once planted yield sugar for  20  to  50  years. Heavy   manuring and  regular
 watering are required for cane while palms  require neither.	Palm plan-tations are
 not affected by wind, flood or shortage of rain. Moreover, and this is very important, factory-made apparatus, such as crushers are indispensable in cane gur making while the accessories necessary for palm gur manufacture  are  procurable  locally  in  villages, and their cost is negligible as compared with those used for cane gur.

BOSE libtech_755_footnote","
   APPENDIX I    MY 	DEAR MAHATMAJI,          May 31, 1939 
  You 	have probably learnt from the papers that I and Sjt. Lalit Chandra 	Das,  M. 	L. 	C., 	my colleague 	on the 	Prisoners' Release 	Advisory Committee, felt compelled 	to resign 	from this Committee. 	The reason 	we gave 	the Home Minister for 	doing so 	was that our approach 	to the 	question of 	release of 	the convicted 	prisoners differed 	fundamentally from that 	of most 	of the other 	members of the Committee. 	This became clear 	to us during 	the last few weeks, 	more particularly 	in course 	of the 	discussions following 	the interviews 	with a number 	of prisoners 	which took place on May 	6, 7, 8 and 	9. Those 	discussions showed that 	the attitude of 	the majority 	of the 	members of 	the Committee 	was very stiff in 	the case of 	prisoners convicted in 	the more serious 	cases, and that 	they were not prepared 	to release them either on 	the assurance contained 	in your 	letter of 	the 13th April 	1938 or 	on the reiteration 	by the 	prisoners of 	what they had told you 	when you met them. It 	became apparent to 	us that the 	majority of 	those prisoners stood no 	chance of 	being released until they 	had served 	or practically served out 	their term. As 	regards the 	rest it 	became apparent that the 	most that 	the majority 	of the 	members of 	the Committee 	were prepared 	to do was to recommend 	reduction of sentences 	in some 	cases and conditional 	release or release 	on giving specific 	undertakings in some 	other cases.  To 	the Home Minister we gave our reasons for our resignation in general 	terms only. But I feel I ought to give you more details as well as a 	resume of what we did during the time we served on the Committee.  You 	probably remember that 	when the proposal for 	an Advisory 	Committee for the 	release of political 	prisoners was 	put forward and I was requested by Sir Nazimuddin 	to suggest 	names from the 	Congress Party, 	I was 	not quite sure in 	my mind as to what we 	should do. I asked Subhas to seek your advice and he discussed the 	matter with you when 	he met you at Delhi 	towards the end of 	September or 	beginning of 	October last. You 	were of opinion that 	I should accept 	membership of 	the Committee. 	Accordingly, I made 	the position of 	the Congress 	Party in regard 	to the 	question of 	releasing political 	prisoners perfectly 	clear to Sir Nazimuddin, 	and communicated to 	him our decision 	to serve 	on the 	Committee in 	the hope that      
 theGovernment would release the prisoners within a short time. Copy of my letter to Sir Nazimuddin (dated October 23, 1938) is set forth below :
 Kindly refer to D. O. No. 3810 dated the 26th September from Mr. R. H. Hutchings to me, in which he asked me on your behalf to suggest the name of a member of the Bengal Legislative Assembly and also that of a member of the Bengal Legislative Council from the Congress Party who might be invited by Government to serve on the Advisory Committee regarding release of political prisoners.
 You are well aware as a result of the conversations you had with Mahatma Gandhi and with the President of the Congress that the Congress Party cannot identify itself or agree with the Government policy in respect to political prisoners. Mahatma Gandhi’s letterlibtech_756_footnoteof the 13th September to you has also made that clear.
 At the same time, I feel that we should not obstruct any endeavour to bring about the release of these prisoners. It is out of this feeling that I am responding to your request for assistance. I earnestly hope that Government will see their way to set at liberty all the political prisoners at a very early date.
 I would suggest the name of Sjt. Lalit Chandra Das, M. L. C., from the Congress Council Party. As regards the Congress Assembly Party, I am prepared to represent it on the Committee. You may issue invitations to Sjt. Lalit Chandra Das and myself.
 After this the work of the Committee began and we made some progress. Naturally, the less difficult cases came up for consideration first, and we were able to bring round our objecting or hesitating colleagues to our point of view, so that recommendation for unconditional release were sent to Government, resulting in the release of 112 prisoners, including all the women prisoners. But as we proceeded with our work, a cleavage of opinion made itself distinctly felt. It became obvious that the Government were not prepared to follow the recommendations of the Committee in all cases. The unanimous recommendation of the Committee, in which the initiative was taken by the Chairman himself (who, I may tell you, had always been over- cautious rather than under-cautious) was referred back to the Committee. It also came to my ears that in some cases the Government were imposing conditions (not recommended by the Committee) when it was perfectly well known that prisoners were not prepared to submit to any conditions or give any assurance except the one they had given to you.
 This  attitude  of  the   Government   had   its   reaction   on   the   members   of   the Committee. In  the  first  place,  they  shrank  from  making  recommendations even when they were satisfied about  the  attitude  of  the  prisoners.  Of  this,  the case of Sjt. Purnananda Das Gupta. who was convicted in connection with
 
 the Inter-Provincial Conspiracy Case, is a good example. There was a consensus of opinion among the members of the Committee that he had made a perfectly frank statement disavowing faith in terrorism. Yet the majority of the Committee did not venture to make the necessary recommendation for his release but accepted the suggestion of the official member on the Committee that a further report be called for from Government about him. Secondly, there was insistence on individual declarations which amounted to a specific undertaking for good behaviour. While most of the prisoners were prepared to reiterate their declaration to you, and actually did so, they resented fresh individual undertakings and were not prepared to give them. I and Lalit Babu considered that the prisoners had said enough in their statements to you and, by reiterating their adherence to those statements, had given convincing indication of a change of heart. After the interview I told the Committee that I was perfectly satisfied that the prisoners had abjured violence for good and all of them should be released. But my views did not find favour with the majority of the Committee. They were not prepared to accept that kind of declaration as satisfactory.
 I also noticed an increasing restiveness among the prisoners in respect of the interviews as well as the assurances required. This restiveness and impatience had been present in greater or lesser degree from the very first. But we had been able by tactful management to keep it from becoming obtrusive. It was, however, impossible to overcome the reluctance of the prisoners when they found that guarantees of a more hard and fast character were required of them. In such circumstances, their hostility to the procedure of the Committee came to the surface, and we became convinced that sooner or later its work was bound to come to something like a deadlock.
 This is in short what we saw and thought as members of the Committee. Besides this, the general attitude of the Government in regard to the remaining convicted prisoners had also to be taken into account. It was clear to us that the Government were not prepared to release all the prisoners, no matter how favourable  the atmosphere was. In these circumstances I did not think it advisable for us to remain on the Committee any longer.
 After our resignation, the Government issued a communique, copy of which is set out below :
 The Committee appointed by Government to advise on the release  of terrorist convicts has considered 183 cases. Government have passed orders on the recommendations of the Committee in 112 cases and in 68 the recommendations of the Committee are about to be submitted to Government. Three cases are under consideration by Government, and 56 cases remain to be examined by the Committee. The Committee have recently interviewed a large number of prisoners individually before disposing of their cases in particular. All the female prisoners appeared before the Committee and were recommended
 for release after giving satisfactory assurance as to their future conduct. They have since been released. Government regret to have to announce that two members of the Committee, Mr. Sarat Chandra Bose and Mr. Lalit Chandra Das, have tendered their resignations which have been accepted. The two members gave as the reason for their resignation that their approach to the question of release of the convicted prisoners differed fundamentally from that of most of the other members of the Committee.
 The question now is, what should be done to procure the release of the remaining prisoners. I would very much like to have your advice as to how we should proceed. What I am apprehensive of is that the prisoners may commence a hunger-strike. If they do so, the situation will become extremely complicated. At the same time, I do not know what hopes I can hold out to them.
 I hope you are better now. My health is still below par. With pranams,
 Yours affectionately,
 SARAT CHANDRA BOSE

DEAR MR. GANDHI
 Thank you very much for your letter of 22nd June. It raises one or two points on which I should like to touch in my reply.
  As 	regards Jaipur, the 	Durbar have, 	I am 	quite sure, no 	desire to 	detain Seth 	Jamnalal Bajaj any 	longer than is 	necessary. Indeed, as 	you will remember, they 	were at 	considerable pains to 	avoid detaining him 	in the 	first instance. Seth 	Jamnalal has 	been made fully aware of 	the conditions 	on which 	the Durbar are 	ready to take 	the desired action 	now in 	regard to 	him and the other 	prisoners, and 	to the 	best of 	my knowledge the position has not altered since the departure of H. H. the Maharaja.  I 	have read with close 	attention  what 	 you  say  in  the  last  	paragraph  of 	your letter, and 	I  am  very  grateful  to  you  for  letting 	 me  know  your  views. 	 I  think 	it is fair 	to say 	that the 	Political Department have 	given no 	moreencouragement to 	“anti-Congress 	personalities”, to use, 	if I 	may, your own phrase, 	than to 	pro- Congress personalities to establish contacts with Rulers and their subjects.

  From 	a microfilm: 	Lord Linlithgow 	Papers. Courtesy: 	National Archives of 	India. Also from a copy: C. W. 7828. Courtesy: G. D. Birla    APPENDIX III   Prohibition 	by stages is a feasible scheme. It will make both the public as well 	as the Excise Department experienced in the task of handling 	problems out of the enforcement of prohibition. Moreover, it will be 	financially a success and it will release for the nation-building 	activities that portion of the revenue derived from extra taxes like 	property tax, sales tax, etc.  Speaking 	generally, I may say that 	the motives 	actuating the 	Bombay Government 	are quite 	laudable, but the methods 	they have been hitherto following or 	intend following 	in future 	in connection 	with the 	problems of 	the property 	tax and 	the sales tax are neither scientific nor conducive to the end they have in view. . . .  The defects in the Prohibition Scheme are more than one	Illicit distillation  will 	increase and there will be a rush of men to the wet zone every 	evening and particularly during every week-end.  Prohibition 	is a measure of social 	reform and no social 	reform can  be  	successfully brought about without winning. . . . the goodwill of the people. The  fact 	that consistent opposition is being offered by some influential 	sections of the community shows that the Government have not yet 	been able to carry with them the approval and goodwill of the people 	in general.  Mahatma 	Gandhi did the right 	thing when he opined 	that prohibition should not 	be forced on Europeans in 	India because they did not believe in it and it would amount 	 to coercion 	to force 	it on them. 	The same 	principle of non-violence 	should be applied to Asiatics 	and Indian 	people as well 	both in theory 	and in 	practice. Why 	should we 	force prohibition on 	non-Indian Asiatics who 	do not 	believe in 	it, if 	we do not force 	 it on Europeans? 	It would 	be wrong 	to make 	a distinction 	between Europeans and 	Asiatics in this respect either in law or in actual administration.  Now 	turning to 	the economic 	side of the 	question, I 	may say that 	it is difficult 	to approve 	of a method 	which involves the sudden 	imposition of an 	additional tax 	over a 	crore of 	rupees on 	Bombay alone 	in order 	to make 	good the loss of excise 	revenue. With 	millions of half-filled 	stomachs, with hundreds of 	thousands dying every 	year of preventible diseases and with 92 percent of our people still unable to read or write. I      
 consider it no part of statemanship to raise additional money by heavy taxation, not one rupee of which would go towards the better fulfilment of stomachs or saving human lives or making our people more literate. I am, therefore, inclined to think that the introduction of prohibition by stages is the more appropriate and scientific method. This would not involve heavy taxation for financing prohibition, would save a portion of the taxable capacity of the people for future requirements and would not involve a sudden change in our national economy.
 Nobody who has eyes to see in Bombay can fail to be impressed with one important aspect of the Government policy. It unfortunately happens that one small community in Bombay which for many years past has been extensively engaged in the liquor trade is being directly affected by this policy. The Parsis are a small but influential community. Who does not know of the many beneficial institutions and activities which have been brought into existence and conducted by them? The overwhelming majority of the community have been opposing this policy and as a minority community the Parsis are entitled to be heard. I understand that the Parsis are apprehensive that the sudden launching of immediate and total  prohibition  in Bombay will throw into the streets a large number of families and would prejudicially affect the income of the charity trusts many of which are for the benefit not of Parsis alone but of the Indian community in general.
 Besides the Parsis, the Muslims of Bombay are also affected by the programme. While they are not opposed to prohibition on principle, they have objection to the 10 percent property tax, which is required for financing prohibition. It is urged on their behalf that the 10 percent property tax subjects them to exorbitant taxation as compared with their population and they resent being taxed in order to force non- Muslims to abstain from drink.
 The effect of prohibition on our general economy is of greater consequence than even its effect on the Parsis or Muslim community. To give a small instance, a large number of hotels and restaurants will be badly hit and may have to close down. Not only will their owners suffer loss but the employees will also be thrown out of employment. It is not impossible that migration from the prohibited area to outside places may take place and the importance of the port of Bombay may also be affected. The fact is that while piecemeal introduction of partial prohibition is possible, piecemeal introduction of total prohibition is next to impossible. . . .

 LETTER FROM SIKANDAR HYAT KHANlibtech_759_footnote
 
 
SIMLA,
 July 20, 1939
    MY DEAR MAHATMAJI,  Many 	thanks for your letter of the 17th July which I received this 	morning.  This 	has crossed my letter of the 18th July.  I 	am sorry 	I overlooked 	to answer 	your query 	about the representation 	of Harijans 	in the proposed 	Lahore Corporation. I 	have made enquiries from 	the Minister concerned 	and am 	informed that 	no provision 	has been 	made in the 	bill to 	provide separate 	electorates for Harijans. 	The method 	of election 	and representation 	is at 	present embodied in 	the rules and 	it is proposed to 	leave th 	is matter to 	the rules in 	the new 	measure also. I 	am almost certain that 	the question 	of separate 	representation for 	Harjans will be 	raised in 	the Assembly when the 	bill is 	under consideration as 	several representations 	have been received from Harijan organizations. So 	far as Government is 	concerned, they 	do not 	contemplate at 	the moment 	to make 	a departure 	from the 	existing practice unless 	the Harijan 	representatives in 	the Assembly 	press for 	a revision and, 	if so, 	it would 	largely depend upon what 	view the Assembly takes 	regarding this 	matter. Personally, 	as you are aware, I am 	not averse 	to  joint electorates; 	but unfortunately 	the trend 	of events 	during the past 	few years 	has made 	it even 	more difficult to 	achieve this 	ideal in the 	absence of 	genuine rapprochement 	between the 	two major communities.  I 	am grateful 	to you 	for careful consideration 	to my alternative 	scheme of 	Federation. Allow 	me to remove 	one or 	two misapprehensions 	which seem to 	have arisen 	due to the reason that you have not had time to make a comparative 	study of my scheme with 	the one embodied 	in the Government 	of India 	Act. My proposals 	do not 	contemplate a 	wholesale rejection of 	the scheme 	adumbrated in the 	Government of 	India Act. At the most it 	would necessitate modification of about half a dozen sections   in 	the Act and the addition 	of perhaps 	two or 	three new 	sections. It 	would of 	course involve 	a revision 	of the 	Federal, Provincial and 	the concurrent lists as 	you will 	have noticed from 	the revised list 	which I 	sent with my 	letter of 	the 18th July. 	As regards 	the ‘Zonal’ 	Legislatures contemplated in 	my scheme, there 	again seems to be some 	misapprehension. You must 	have noticed that 	I do 	not contemplate 	any executive 	authority for the 	‘zones’, and 	the legislative powers 	delegated to the Regional 	Legislatures are 	meant only to bring 	the various units 	in a 	‘zone’ closer 	together in order to bring about mutual confidence and trust between the various units. It would      
 not involve any additional expenditure since the members of a Regional Legislature would also be members of the Federal Legislature and will collectively constitute the Federal Legislature. No separate building or organization will be required. If and when necessary, they will meet together to ratify or pass a measure on which the units in a particular ‘zone’ are agreed. As a matter of fact, my scheme would be comparatively less expensive as I have suggested a unicameral instead of a bicameral Federal Legislature.
 As regards the composition of the Army, I have suggested no more than retention of the status quo so far as the peace-time strength of the Army is concerned. As I explained to you in the course of our conversation, my insistence on this provision is actuated by a desire to create mutual confidence, and in the interests of national harmony and solidarity.
 I appreciate your remarks regarding acceptance of Dominion Status. I am aware that all the important political organizations in the country have now adopted ‘complete independence’ as their final goal. But I am sure you will agree with me that in the circumstances it would be inadvisable to clutch at a shadow and discard the substance if it happens to be within our grasp. After all, what we want is complete control over the administration and affairs of our country and this will be obtained if we get Dominion Status. I am fully aware of the fact that some of our fellow- countrymen would prefer to chase a will-o’-the-wisp rather than give up their demand for complete independence; but it would be for an eminent patriot and leader like you to persuade them to accept the substance and leave alone the shadow.
 You mention in your letter that “Yours is the only proposal of a constructive character on behalf of the League.” Let me hasten to make it quite clear that my scheme has got nothing to do with the League. It has been formulated by me alone and without consultation with any member of the League or for that matter of any other party in the country. It has been conceived with the intention of providing a solution  of our communal and political problems and I trust it will be examined and studied by all concerned in the spirit in which it has been conceived.
 As regards your draft solution of the communal problem and my comments thereon, I shall be grateful if you would kindly give me some more definite indications of your views, if you desire me tolibtech_760_footnoteproceed with the matter further. I quite realize that the draft represents only your views; but that is quite sufficient for my
 purpose provided you approve of my suggestions with reference to the various items of the draft. I can then proceed to sound important Muslim leaders and the Working Committee of the League and let you know their reactions. It would be no use my trying to bring them round to my point of view unless I am assured of your whole-
 
 
 hearted approval and support in regard to the points mentioned in my note which I handed over to you at Bombay. I need hardly assure you that the correspondence between us will be treated as strictly confidential. Perhaps, you would like to consult the Working Committee of the League and other prominent Muslims. If there is agreement on these points, then we could bring the representatives of the two Working Committees together to approve and ratify them informally.
 As regards services, I do not think we need worry about the number of communities which would fall under the category of ‘minorities’. The obvious course would be to fix the share of the majority community in each province and leave the balance to be distributed amongst the minorities. This is what we have done in the Punjab We have given 50 per cent to the Muslims and 50 per cent to non-Muslims. The proportion (7 per cent) surrendered by the the majority community was added on to the share of the smaller minorities in the shape of weightage. So the problem is not so complex as it appears to be at first sight. What we need is a genuine change of heart and once this is achieved there should be no difficulty in adjusting differences. I am afraid my letter has become somewhat lengthy; but in view of the issues involved  I have taken the liberty of encroaching on your time by answering the points raised in your letter in some detail.
 With best wishes and kind regards,

 APPENDIX V
 HARIJAN SEVAKS’ CONFERENCE RESOLUTIONSlibtech_761_footnote
 June 4/7, 1939
  This 	Conference of Harijan 	sevaks resolves that Harijan sevaks should not 	visit those temples which 	Harijans are not allowed 	to enter. 	It should 	be clearly 	understood that Harijan 	sevaks are not to enter 	such temples, not only 	for the purpose 	of worship 	but also 	for sight-seeing, 	provided that this rule is 	not intended to 	come in 	the way of doing 	service to Harijans. 	Similarly Harijan sevaks are 	not to attend public 	meetings which are not 	open to Harijans.  The 	Western and 	Central India Harijan 	Sevaks’ Conference held 	at Poona 	very much appreciates 	the organization 	of Harijan 	welfare work in 	Holkar State 	as explained 	by Prof. 	R. K. Yardye, 	Hon. Secretary of the 	Indore H. 	S. S., but considers 	that the grant 	of Rs. 	7,000 is 	too low for the purpose 	and therefore 	requests His 	Highness the 	Maharaja Holkar and 	his Government to 	raise the 	grant considerably to 	enable the 	work to be organized 	efficiently. This 	Conference is 	also of 	the opinion 	that the object of the State regarding Harijan emancipation will be better served by 
 
 the appointment of a special officer, as is done in Bombay, Mysore, Travancore and Cochin, to look after Harijan interests.
  The 	report of 	the Harijan 	Sevak Sangh, Gwalior 	State, submitted 	by the 	Secretary to 	this Conference, 	shows that the cause 	of Harijans 	suffers on account 	of the 	utter lack of 	practical support by 	the Government 	of Gwalior. 	Considering the views of 	His Highness 	the Maharaja 	Saheb as expressed 	repeatedly in his 	public speeches, it 	is most regrettable 	that such indifference 	should exist. This 	Conference respectfully 	draws the attention 	of the 	Administration and 	the Ruler of the 	Gwalior State 	to the 	necessity of 	taking an 	active part 	in the 	work of the 	amelioration of 	the conditions 	of Harijans, 	as well 	as the 	removal of 	untouchability. For 	this purpose 	this conference 	requests the appointment 	of a 	special officer or 	that of 	a Committee 	with an 	annual grant of 	a substantial 	sum of 	money in 	the annual budget. This 	Conference is 	also of 	opinion that 	a public 	declaration of the 	State policy granting 	civic rights to 	Harijans for 	the use of public 	wells, tanks, temples, conveyances and 	schools should be 	issued forthwith. The 	universal disinclination 	to do physical work, particularly work 
 involving the handling of dirt, is one of the causes that are responsible for the custom of untouchability. For example, scavenging, flaying of dead cattle, tanning, leather work, barber’s work and similar duties are regarded as causing pollution. Similarly personal service and hospitality rendered to a member of a so-called lower caste is forbidden.
 To achieve total eradication of untouchability, it is necessary to remove as early as possible this false feeling of detestation towards socially beneficial occupations. This Conference therefore appeals to all Harijan sevaks and persons interested in the cause of Harijan uplift that they should feel no hesitation in doing with their own hands the aforesaid duties and thereby demonstrate to the world that they involve no indignity or pollution.
 This Conference further appeals to all Hindu sisters and brothers to remain absolutely certain that no individual loses his caste by virtue of personal service of any description. Bearing this religious principle in mind they should extend to guests of whatsoever caste coming under their roof the same cordial hospitality that they render to their own caste people. One need not have a guilty conscience in rendering service to such guests.
 A growing tendency is to be noticed among self-respecting  Harijans  to abandon their hereditary occupations because these are socially despised. Although this Conference does not regard any honest occupation as low, it fully appreciates the feelings of Harijans and declares that they have every right to give up these occupations if they so choose, and that it would be unjust on the part of caste Hindus to coerce them into doing such tasks.
 
  With 	a view 	to remove 	untouchability and bring 	about a speedy 	uplift of Harijans, 	this Conference 	requests all Provincial 	Boards of the 	H.S.S. concerned to 	take necessary steps in 	order that elementary education is made free and compulsory at least 	for Harijan 	children in those 	places where there are 	already schools of 	a District School Board or a Municipal School Board.  This 	Conference takes 	this opportunity to 	point out 	to the 	managers of 	Harijan students’ 	hostels of 	the H.S.S. that 	segregation is 	not  the 	 object  of 	conducting Harijan 	hostels, and that 	therefore an endeavour 	should be made 	to secure 	the admission 	of Harijan 	boys and 	girls of 	all Harijan 	sub-castes and also 	of a 	few caste 	Hindu boys and girls 	in the Harijan 	hostels, provided that no 	monetary burden is 	thrown on the resources of the Sangh in respect of caste-Hindu pupils.  This 	Conference is of opinion 	that it is necessary 	to afford 	legal protection to 	Harijans who 	are subjected to 	social boycott on 	account of their 	enjoying a 	common civic 	right, and 	recommends to 	the Bombay 	Government, as a 	measure of 	partial protection, 	that the 	Government should 	undertake, along with  other 	legislation contemplated 	by Government, 	suitable legislation to 	provide that 	refusal on 	the part of 	a shopkeeper or 	a regular dealer in 	articles which are 	necessaries of 	life, to 	sell such articles to 	a Harijan or 	his servants or 	his family dependants as 	an item of 	social boycott on 	the ground 	of such 	Harijans trying to 	enjoy or 	having enjoyed any 	common civic rights, 	should be made 	a punishable 	offence.  It 	is resolved by 	this Conference that the 	various Provincial Boards 	should request 	the Municipalities 	in their 	jurisdiction to start 	welfare work for their 	Harijan employees 	on the lines 	of the Bombay 	Municipal  Corporation,  	and  the 	 Municipalities may be requested to use at least the Fine Funds for this purpose. 
 The line of work can be suggested on the following fundamental points: recreational, educational, social, economical. And the welfare work will also include the work of a labour officer, i. e., to receive complaints about the working conditions of the employees and to redress them.
  This 	Conference urges the 	Provincial Boards and 	the Local Committee of 	the H.S.S. 	to make concerted and 	special efforts 	for securing  to  	Harijans  the enjoyment of civic rights in respect of wells, hotels, etc.  This 	Conference is 	of opinion that the 	Government of 	Bombay should 	take necessary steps to 	provide for 	free studentships to 	all deserving 	Harijan students in the secondary grant-in-aid schools in the Bombay Presidency as soon as possible.  Whereas 	in various 	Harijan localities, there are 	no grocery 	shops and the 	Harijans have 	to purchase 	corn and other 	provisions from 	shops belonging 	to otherpeople 	at a 	very high price, 	this Conference 	requests the Harijan 	Sevak Sanghs to 	endeavour to 	open such shops 	on a 	co-operative basis in 	those villages where the 	Harijan population is 	sufficiently numerous.  This 	Conference requests all 	Harijan sevaks that they 	should try their 	best to enlist active co-operation of women workers in the cause of service to Harijans.  Whereas 	it has been found by experience 	that in 	multi-member 	constituencies for 	legislatures and 	local bodies where seats 	are reserved 	for Harijans, 	votes are 	not, as 	a rule, mutually given by 	caste-Hindu voters and 	Harijan voters, and 	whereas it 	is necessary with 	a view 	to foster 	brotherly feelings and to 	fulfil the 	real purpose 	of the Poona 	Pactlibtech_762_footnotethat 	the votes should be 	mutually given, this 	Conference calls 	upon all caste-Hindu 	voters to 	exercise at 	least one 	vote in 	favour of 	Harijan candidates, 	and Harijan 	voters to exercise 	at least 	one vote in 	favour of 	caste-Hindu candidates. 	This Conference 	is further 	of opinion 	that the distributive 	system of 	voting is better suited than the cumulative system to achieve the end in view.

I have 	 in fact, 	as I said, 	nothing very special to 	talk about, and 	my invitation 	to you 	to meet 	me at Delhi was 	merely in 	pursuance of 	my desire to 	keep in 	touch with you 	and maintain 	contact from time to 	time.

These States present the greatest possible variety in size and government.

 0.29 square mile, a population of 206 souls and an income of Rs. 500 a year.	Sir
 George Macmunn must have had these statelets in mind while writing his famous book The Indian States and Princes. In the very first chapter he says:
 The Ruling Princes of India number between five and six hundred, and their principalities vary from that of the Nizam, as large as a third of France, to others no larger than Battersea Park.
 The real demand of the States subjects, it must be presumed, is self-government or responsible government and not merely good government. Nothing short of extensive democratization of the administrative machinery is likely to satisfy them. As democratization must of neccessity involve certain financial commitments, it is neither helpful nor politic to demand it from Rulers of States whose annual income is less than, say, Rs. 50 lakhs. Joint administration is, therefore, the only alternative to the existing arrangement for such States.
 Joint administration for small States is no novel or visionary suggestion. His Excellency the Viceroy himself, than whom none can claim to be more solicitous for the welfare of the Princes, is responsible for propagating this view. The germs of this theory, however, are traceable in the Butler Committee Report, 1928-29. Dealing with the classification of States, the Report says:
 The petty States of Kathiawar and Gujarat, numbering 286 of the total of 327 in the third class, are organized in groups called thanas under officers appointed by local representatives of the Paramount Power, who exercise various kinds and degrees of criminal, revenue and civil jurisdiction. As the cost of administration rises, the States find it necessary to distribute it over larger areas by appointing officials to work for several States. Already there is talk in some of the larger States in Kathiawar of appointing a High Court with powers over a group of such States.
 
 He Excellency’s views on this question may be gathered from the following extract from his address delivered on the occasion of inaugurating the session of the Chamber of Princes in March last:
 In no case is the need for co-operation and combination more patent, more pronounced and more immediate than in the case of the smaller States. Those States whose resources are so limited as virtually to preclude them individually from providing for the requirements of their people in accordance with modern standard, have indeed no other practical alternative before them. I would take this opportunity to impress upon the Rulers of such States, with all the emphasis at my command, the wisdom of taking the earliest possible steps to combine with their neighbours in the matter of administrative services so far as this is practicable.
 Though the principle of combination enunciated by the Viceroy can apply to smaller States all over India, it is particularly suitable in the case of Kathiawar States. One peculiar feature of these States is that, unlike their neighbours, the Gujarat States or the Central India States, they are geographically one compact province. The
 process of combination or grouping or to be a little bolder, of confederation, is immensely facilitated by this continuity. The total area of all these States is just over 40,000 square miles and the total population is 42,29,494. The total annual income is estimated at about Rs. six crores.
 During the last three months the Kathiawar Princes have met a number of times and they were reported to have discussed the feasibility of having a combined
 police force, common Excise, Medical, Public Health, Public Works and Forest Deparments and a common High Court. . . . It is so easy to see the futility of combined administration in these important spheres without providing for a combined legislature. For, the question arises, to whom will these common administrations be responsible? Certainly not to all one score Princes and their Governments. You cannot earnestly be responsible to twenty authorities unless confusion is their aim and to bungle your wish.

 LETTER FROM SUBHAS CHANDRA BOSE TO CONGRESS PRESIDENTlibtech_765_footnote
 August 7, 1939
 I am exceedingly sorry for the delay in replying to your letter of the 18th July, from Ranchi. You have asked me for an explanation of my action in protesting against certain resolutions of the All-India Congress Committee passed at Bombay.
 
 In the first place, one has to distinguish between protesting against a certain resolution and actually defying it or violating it. What has so far happened is that I have only protested against two resolutions of the A.I.C C.
 It is my constitutional right to give expression to my opinion regarding any resolution passed by the A.I.C.C. You will perhaps admit that it is customary with a large number of Congressman to express their views on resolutions passed by the
 A.I.C.C. when a particular session of that body comes to a close. If you grant Congressmen the right to express their views on resolutions passed by the A.I.C.C., you cannot draw a line and say that only favourable opinions will be allowed expression and unfavourable opinions will be banned. If we have the contitutional right to express our views then it does not matter if those views are favourable or un- favourable. Your letter seems to suggest that only expression of unfavourable views is to be banned.
 We have so long been fighting the British Government among other things for our civil liberty. Civil liberty, I take it, includes freedom of speech. According to your point of view we are not to claim freedom of speech when we do not see eye to eye with the majority in the A.I.C.C. or in the Congress. It would be a strange situation if we are to have the right of freedom of speech as against the British Government but not as against the Congress or any body subordinate to it. If we are denied the right to adversely criticize resolutions of the A.I.C.C. which in our view are harmful to the country’s cause then it would amount to denial of a democratic right. May I ask you in all seriousness if democratic rights are to be exercised only outside the Congress but not inside it ?
 I hope you will agree that when a resolution is once passed by the A.I.C.C., it is open to us to have it reviewed or amended or altered or rescinded at a subsequent meeting of that body. I hope you will also agree that it is open to us to appeal against the A.I.C.C. to the higher court of appeal, namely, the open session of the Congress. You will agree further, I hope, that it is open to a minority to carry on a propaganda with a view to converting the majority to its point of view. Now how can we do this except by appealing to Congressmen through public meetings and through writings in the Press? The Congress today is not an organization of a handful of men. Its membership has, I believe, reached the neighbourhood of 45 lakhs. We can hope to appeal to the rank and file of the Congress and to convert them to our point of view only if we are allowed to write in the Press and also to hold meetings. If you maintain that once a resolution is passed in the A.I.C.C. it is sacrosanct and must hold good for ever, then you may have some justification for banning criticism of it. But if you
 grant us the right to review or amend or alter or rescind a particular resolution of the
 A.I.C.C. either through that body or through the open session of the Congress, then I do not see how you can gag criticism, as you have been trying to do.
 I am afraid you are giving an interpretation to the word ‘discipline’ which I cannot accept. I consider myself to be a stern disciplinarian and I am afraid that in the name of discipline you are trying to check healthy criticism. Discipline does not mean denying a person his constitutional and democratic right.
 Apart from the fact that it is our constitutional and democratic right to protest against resolutions which in our view are harmful to the country’s cause, a consideration of the merits of the two resolutions will show that such protests were really called for. In our view these two resolutions, if given effect to, will serve to accentuate the drift towards constitutionalism, to increase the influence, power and authority of the Provincial Ministries at the cost of the Congress organizations, to isolate artificially the Congress from the general public as also the A.I.C.C. from the rank and file of the Congress. Moreover, they will serve to undermine the revolutionary spirit of the Congress. Consequently, in the best interests of the country, these two resolutions should be immediately held in abeyance and ultimately altered suitably or withdrawn.
 In this connection I cannot help drawing your attention to certain incidents at
 the time of the Gaya Congress in 1922 and after. Please do not forget what the Swaraj Party did in those days. Please do not forget either that when the A.I.C.C. amended the resolution of the Gaya Congress, the Gujarat P.C.C. resolved to defy it.
 Lastly, please do not forget that Mahatma Gandhi wrotelibtech_766_footnotein Young India, if my recollection is correct, that the minority has the right to rebel. We have not gone so far yet as to actually rebel against the decision of the majority. We have simply taken the liberty of criticizing certain resolutions passed by the majority in the teeth of our opposition.
 I am really surprised that you have made so much of what we regard as our inherent right. I hope you will accept my explanation as satisfactory. But if you do not do so, and if you decide to resort to disciplinary action, I shall gladly face it for the sake of what I regard as a just cause. In conclusion, I have to request that if any Congressman is penalized in connection with the events of the 9th July, then you will also take action against me. If the observance of an All-India Day of the 9th is a crime then I confess, I am the arch-criminal.
 With kindest regards,

 CONGRESS PRESIDENT’S DECLARATION libtech_767_footnote
 July 6, 1939
 I have been much surprised to read in the papers Shri Subhas Chandra Bose’s statement fixing the 9th July for protesting against resolutions passed by the All- India Congress Committee at Bombay. It is well known that the resolution was passed after prolonged debate by a very large majority against the opposition of Shri Subhas Chandra Bose. If Committees subordinate to the All-India Congress Committee and office-bearers of such Committees or minorities within the Congress begin to defy such resolution and organize and hold protest meetings  against decisions arrived at after full deliberation by the All-India Congress Committee or the Congress, there will be an end to all discipline within the Congress and a complete disruption of the organization. I therefore desire to impress on all Congress Committees and their office-bearers that the policy and practice of the Congress no less than loyalty to the Congress organization require that they should carry out and give effect to the resolutions passed by the All-India Congress Committee, and participation in and organizing of protests and condemnation against such resolution will be a breach of discipline. I trust the Congress Committees and their office- bearers will desist from organizing or participating in such protests and demons- trations.

 APPENDIX X
 LETTER FROM CONGRESS PRESIDENT TO SUBHAS CHANDRA BOSE libtech_768_footnote
 July 18, 1939
 A delicate and difficult situation has been created by your action in organizing protests against certain resolutions of the All-India Congress Committee, passed at Bombay. As I made clear in the statements which I issued before the meetings of the 9th July were held, it appears to me that it will be impossible for the Congress organization to function if subordinate Committees and office-bearers of  the Congress, whose duty it is to carry out and give effect to the  resolution  of  the
 A.I.C.C. and  the  Congress, were, instead of  doing that, to  organize protests and
 
 
 demostrations against these resolutions. I personally look upon any such action on their part as not only destructive of all discipline but fraught with the gravest consequences for the future of the Congress organization. I shall therefore place the whole matter before the Working Committee for consideration and such action, disciplinary or otherwise, as it may think fit to take. But in order that the Committee may have your explanation of your action and your point of view also before it. I shall be obliged if you will let me have it at an early date.

 APPENDIX XI
 CONGRESS WORKING COMMITTEE RESOLUTION libtech_769_footnote
 The Working Committee have given their earnest consideration to the critical international situation and to the danger of war that overhangs the world. In this world crisis the sympathies of the Working Committee are entirely with the people who stand for democracy and freedom, and the Congress has repeatedly condemned Fascist aggression in Europe, Africa and the Far East of Asia as well as the betrayal of democracy by British imperialism in Czechoslovakia and Spain. The Congress has further clearly enunciated its policy in the event of war and declared its determination to oppose all attempts to impose a war on India. The Committee are bound by this policy of the Congress and will give effect to it so as to prevent the exploitation of Indian resources for imperialist ends. The past policy of the British Government as well as the recent developments demonstrate abundantly that this Government does not stand for freedom and democracy and may at any time betray these ideals. India cannot associate herself with such a Government or be asked to give her resources for democratic freedom which is denied to her and which is likely to be betrayed.
 At its meeting held in Calcutta on May 1, 1939, the All-India Congress Committee reiterated this policy of the Congress and expressed its disapproval of the despatch of Indian troops to foreign countries. In spite of this clear expression of opinion, the British Government has sent, or is sending Indian troops to Egypt and Singapore against the declared will of the Indian people. Even apart from the war situation, the Central Legislative Assembly has previously declared that no Indian troops should be sent abroad without the consent of the Legislature. The British Government has thus flouted the declaration of the Congress and the Assembly and
 
 
 has taken steps which might inevitably lead to India’s entanglement in a war. It has further prolonged the life of the Central Assembly by another year. The Working Committee cannot accept these decisions of the British Government and must not only dissociate themselves from them but also take such steps as may be necessary to give effect to the Congress members of the Central Legislative Assembly to refrain from attending the next session of the Assembly.
 The Committee further remind Provincial Governments to assist in no way the war preparations of the British Government and to keep in mind the policy laid down by the Congress, to which they must adhere. If the carrying out of this policy leads to the resignations or removal of the Congress Ministers they must be prepared for this contingency.
 In the event of a war crisis leading to danger to any part of India from the air or otherwise it may be necessary for protective measures to be taken. The Committee will be prepared to encourage such measures if they are within the control of the popular Ministries in the Provinces. The Committee are however not agreeable to such protective measures being used as a cloak for war preparations under the control of the Imperial Government.

             DEAR 	MR. GANDHI,    APPENDIX XII  LETTER FROM 	YADAVINDRA SINGH libtech_770_footnote  RANBIR 	VILLA, 	CHAIL,  September 	 9, 1939 
  I 	thank you 	for your letter dated the 	30th ultimo enclosing a 	copy of 	the letter 	reported to have been 	despatched to me on the 3rd August which, as I intimated you in my 	telegram dated 28th 	ultimo, was never 	received by me. 	I was 	somewhat surprised 	to learn of the 	publication in 	the vernacular Press of the  letter 	 from  your correspondent 	together with your comments and 	was inclined to 	think that since you 	did not consider it 	worthwhile to 	await my 	reply before 	releasing to the 	Press your 	correspondent’s letter, 	it was 	unnecessary for 	me to reply 	to your 	letter. However, I 	have since received your 	message conveyed through my 	vakil at 	Simla informing that 	whereas an 	intimation had 	been given 	in time 	to the 	English Press to 	withhold publication 	of this 	matter, owing 	to rush 	of work 	similar instructions 	could not 	be conveyed 	to the vernacular 	Press. I am, indeed, 	thankful to you for 	intimating me 	that the 	comments that 	have already appeared in 	the vernacular 	Press will be 	revised or 	withdrawn in case it was considered necessary on receipt of my reply.    
 Your correspondent’s letter deals with two issues, namely, (a) the Hidayat of 1988 and (b) the threatening language alleged to have been used by me during the course of an interview I gave to the deputation that waited upon me on the 18th July. .
 The main criticism against the Hidayat has been that since it was intended to meet a special situation, its retention as a permanent law of the land was not justifiable. The communal disturbances, as you will agree, were precisely the kind of special situation to meet which the Government have to keep themselves armed with such special legislation. It will appear, therefore, that it is the abuse, by those who were responsible for disturbing intercommunal harmony, of the liberty conferred on them, which was responsible for the subsequent order enjoining the enforcement of the provisions of the Hidayat. The fact that this unfortunate occurrence rendered it necessary for me to invoke the provisions of the Hidayat,  was appreciated even by
 those who had earlier organized agitation against this enactment, as is evident from their voluntary decision to abide by the order issued by me on the 25th of May. The period for which the enforcement of the Hidayat was enjoined is not yet over; however, as the communal situation has since eased considerably and I have exercised
 clemency and withdrawn cases against those involved in this communal clash. I would have considered the desirability of revising the provisions of the Hidayat, but  as you are aware, war has since broken out and while for the successful prosecution thereof emergency measures curtailing civic rights and liberties are being enforced, this emergency legislation has of necessity to be retained on the statute-book. I have not the least intention of going back over the assurance that was given by the District Nazim, Sunam, but I am obliged to await more favourable circumstances to do the needful.
 As regards the version of what transpired at the interview I gave to the depu- tation on the 18th July, I am sorry your correspondent has twisted what I told the deputationists and his letter contains several half-truths and mis-statements. I had assured them that while I was most anxious to redress the genuine grievances of my subjects, I did not approve of their being misled by those who were actuated by motives not wholly impersonal. I do not precisely remember the words I used, but I think I told them that I would readily respond to all legitimate wishes of my people but would not be intimidated by any agitation engineered by those not directly interested in the points at issue nor would I accept any dictation from any outside agency.
 In view of what I have stated above, I feel your comments that have appeared in the vernacular Press do not seem to be called for and I trust you will be good enough to withdraw them. I thank you for the courtesy you have shown me in inviting my comments on your correspondent’s letter.

 APPENDIX XIII
 WORKING COMMITTEE’S MANIFESTOlibtech_771_footnote
  The 	Working Committee 	have given their earnest 	consideration to 	the grave 	crisis that has developed 	owing to 	the declaration 	of war in Europe. The principles 	which should guide the 	nation in 	the event of 	war have been repeatedly 	laid down 	by the 	Congress, and 	only a 	month ago 	this Committee 	reiterated them and 	expressed their 	displeasure at 	the flouting 	of Indian 	opinion by the 	British Govern- 	ment in 	India. As 	a first 	step to 	dissociate themselves 	from this policy 	of the 	British Government, 	the Committee 	called upon the congress 	members of the 	Central Legis- 	lative Assembly 	to refrain 	from attending the 	next session. 	Since then the 	British Government 	have declared 	India as 	a belligerent 	country, promulgated ordinances, 	passed the Government 	of India 	Act Amending 	Bill, and 	taken other far-reaching 	measures which 	affect the Indian 	people vitally, and 	circumscribe and limit 	the powers 	and the activities 	of the 	Provincial Governments. 	This has been 	done without the consent 	of the 	Indian people whose 	declared wishes 	in such 	matters have 	been deliberately 	ignored by the 	British Government. The 	Working Committee must 	take the 	gravest view of 	these developments.  The 	Congress has 	repeatedly declared its 	entire disapproval of 	the ideology 	and practice of Fascism 	and Nazism and their glorification of war and violence and the 	suppression of 	the human 	spirit. It has 	condemned the 	aggression in 	which they have 	repeatedly indulged and 	their sweeping 	away of well-established 	principles and 	recognized standards of 	civilized behaviour. It 	has seen in 	Fascism and 	Nazism the 	intensification of 	the principle 	of imperialism 	against which the Indian 	people have struggled 	for many 	years. The Working 	Committee must 	therefore unhesitatingly 	condemn the 	latest aggression of 	the Nazi Government 	in Germany 	against Poland and 	sympathize with those who 	resist it.  The 	Congress has 	further laid down that 	the issue 	of war and peace 	for India 	must be 	decided by 	the Indian 	people, and no 	outside authority 	can impose 	this decision 	upon them nor can the 	Indian people permit 	their resources to be 	exploited for 	imperialist ends. 	Any imposed decision, or 	attempt to 	use Indian 	resources, for purposes 	not approved 	by them, 	will necessarily 	have to 	be opposed by 	them. If 	co- operation 	is desired 	in a 	worthy cause, this cannot 	be obtained 	by compulsion 	and imposition, 	and the Committee 	cannot agree to the 	carrying out 	by the 	Indian people 	of orders issued by external authority. Co-operation must be between equals by mutual

 Committee Resolution”, 22-11-1939.
 consent for a cause which both consider to be worthy. The people of India have in the recent past, faced great risks and willingly made great sacrifices to secure their own freedom and establish a free democratic State in India, and their sympathy is entirely on the side of democracy and freedom. But India cannot associate herself in a war said   to be for democratic freedom when that very freedom is denied to her, and such limited freedom as she possesses taken away from her.
  The 	Committee are 	aware that the 	Governments of 	Great Britain and 	France have declared 	that they are fighting 	for democracy 	and freedom 	and to 	put an 	end to 	aggression. But 	the history of 	the recent 	past is 	full of examples showing 	the constant 	divergence between the 	spoken word, the 	ideals proclaimed 	and the real 	motives and 	objectives. During the 	war of 1914-18, 	the declared 	war aims were the 	preservation of 	democracy, 	self-determination and 	the freedom of 	small nations, and 	yet the very Governments 	which solemnly proclaimed these aims 	entered into 	secret treaties 	embodying imperialist designs for 	the carving up 	of the Ottoman 	Empire. While stating 	that they did not want 	any acquisition of 	territory, the 	victorious Powers added 	largely to their 	colonial domains. The 	present European 	war itself signifies 	the abject 	failure of the 	Treaty of 	Versailles and 	of its 	makers, who 	broke their 	pledged word and imposed 	an imperialist 	peace on the defeated 	nations. The one 	hopeful outcome of that 	Treaty, the League 	of Nations, 	was muzzled 	and strangled 	at the 	outset and 	later killed by 	its parent States.  Subsequent 	history has demonstrated 	afresh how even a 	seemingly fervent 	declaration of 	faith may 	be followed 	by an ignoble 	desertion. In 	Manchuria the British 	Government connived at 	aggression; in 	Abyssinia they 	acquiesced in 	it. In 	Czechoslovakia and 	Spain democracy was 	in peril 	and it 	was deliberately 	betrayed, and 	the whole system of 	collective security was 	sabotaged by 	the very Powers 	who had 	previously declared their firm faith in it.  Again 	it is asserted 	that democracy is in 	danger and 	must be 	defended, and 	with this statement the 	Committee are 	in entire 	agreement. The Committee 	believe that 	thepeoples of 	the West are moved 	by this 	ideal and 	objective and 	for these they 	are prepared 	to make 	sacrifices. But again 	and again 	the ideals 	and sentiments 	of the 	people and 	of those who 	have sacrificed 	themselves in the 	struggle have been 	ignored and 	faith has 	not been kept with them.  If 	the war is 	to defend the 	status quo—imperialist 	possessions, colonies, 	vested interests 	and privileges—then 	India can 	have nothing to 	do with it. If, 	however, the 	issue is 	democracy and 	a world 	order based on democracy, 	then India is intensely 	interested in it. 	The Committee are 	convinced that 	the interests of 	Indian democracy 	do not 	conflict with the 	interests of 	British democracy 	or of world democracy. 	But there 	is an inherent 	and ineradicable 	conflict between democracy for 	India or elsewhere 	and imperialism 	and Fascism. 	If Great Britain 	fights for 	the maintenance 	and extension 	of democracy, 	then she must 	necessarily end 	imperialism in her own possessions, establish full democracy in India, and the Indian people must 
 have the right of self-determination by framing their own constitution through a Constituent Assembly without external interference, and must guide their own policy. A free, democratic India will gladly associate herself with other free nations for mutual defence against aggression and for economic co-operation. She will work for the establishment of a real world order based on freedom and democracy, utilizing the world’s knowledge and resources for the progress and advancement of humanity.
  The 	crisis that has 	overtaken Europe is 	not of 	Europe only but 	of humanity 	and will 	not pass 	like other crises or wars 	leaving te essential 	structure of the present- 	day world 	intact. It is likely 	to refashion 	the world 	for good 	or ill, 	politically, socially 	and economically. 	This crisis is the 	inevitable consequence of 	the social 	and political 	conflicts and 	contradictions which 	have grown alarmingly 	since the 	last great 	war, and it 	will not 	be finally 	resolved till these conflicts and 	contradictions are 	removed and a new equilibrium established. That equilibrium can only 	be based on the ending 	of the 	domination and 	exploitation of 	one country 	by another, 	and on 	a reorganization 	of economic 	relations on a 	juster basis 	for the common good 	of all. 	India is 	the crux of 	the problem, 	for India 	has been the outstanding 	example of 	modern imperialism, and 	no refashioning of 	the world can 	succeed which ignores 	this vital problem. With 	her vast 	resources she must 	play an important 	part in any 	scheme of 	world recognization. But 	she can only do so as a 	free nation 	whose energies have been 	released to 	work for this great 	end. Freedom 	today is indivisible 	and every 	attempt to 	retain imperialist 	domination in any 	part of the 	world will 	lead inevitably to 	fresh disaster.  The 	Working Committee have 	noted that many Rulers of 	Indian States have 	offered their services and 	resources and 	expressed their desire to 	support the 	cause of 	democracy in 	Europe. If 	they must make their 	professions in 	favour of 	democracy abroad, 	the Committee would 	suggest that their first 	concern should 	be the 	introduction of 	democracy within their 	own States 	in which 	today undiluted autocracy 	reigns supreme. The 	British Government 	in India is more 	responsible for 	this autocracy 	than even the Rulers 	themselves, as has been 	made painfully evident during 	the past 	year. This policy is the 	very negation 	of democracy 	and of 	the new world 	order for 	which Great Britain 	claims to be fighting 	in Europe.  As 	the Working 	Committee view past 	events in 	Europe, Africa and 	Asia, and more 	particularly past 	and present 	occurrences in 	India, they fail to 	find any 	attempt to 	advance the 	cause of 	democracy or 	self-determination, or 	any evidence that 	the present 	war declarations 	of the 	British Government are 	being, or 	are going 	to be, 	acted upon. The 	true measure of 	democracy is 	the ending of 	imperialism and 	Fascism alike and 	the aggression that has 	accompanied them in 	the past 	and the present. 	Only on 	that basis can 	a new order be 	built up. 	In the struggle for 	that new 	world order, the 	Committee are 	eager and desirous to 	help in 	every way. But the 	Committee cannot 	associate themselves or 	offer any 	co-operation in 	a war which is conducted on 
 imperialist lines and which is meant to consolidate imperialism in India and elsewhere.
  In 	view, however, of 	the gravity 	of the 	occasion and 	the fact that the 	pace of 	events during the 	last few days has often 	been swifter 	than the working 	of men’s 	minds, the 	Committee desire to 	take no 	final decision at 	this stage, so 	as to allow for 	the full elucidation 	of the 	issues at 	stake, the 	real objectives aimed 	at, and 	the position 	of India 	in the 	present and 	in the 	future. But 	the decision cannot 	long be delayed 	as India 	is being 	committed from day to 	day to 	a policy to 	which she 	is not 	a party 	and of which 	she disapproves.  The 	Working Committee 	therefore invite 	the British 	Government to 	declare in 	unequivocal terms 	what their war aims 	are in 	regard to 	democracy and 	imperialism and 	the new order that is 	envisaged, in 	particular, how 	these aims are 	going to 	apply to 	India and to 	be given effect 	to in the 	present. Do 	they include 	the elimination 	of imperialism 	and the treatment 	of India 	as a 	free nation 	whose policy 	will be 	guided in 	accordance with the 	wishes of 	her people? A 	clear declaration about 	the future, 	pledging the Government 	to the 	ending of 	imperialism and 	Fascism alike, 	will be 	welcomed by 	the people 	of all 	countries, but 	it is far 	more important to 	give immediate effect to 	it, to 	the largest 	possible extent, for only 	this will convince the 	people that the 	declaration is 	meant to 	be honoured. The 	real test of 	any declaration is 	its application 	in the 	present, for 	it is the 	present that 	will govern action today 	and give 	shape to the future.  War 	has broken out 	in Europe 	and the prospect 	is terrible 	to contemplate. 	But war has been 	taking its 	heavy toll 	of human life during the 	past  year 	 in Abyssinia, Spain 	and China. Innumerable 	innocent men, women and 	children have 	been bombed to 	death from the 	air in open cities, 	cold-blooded massacres, torture and 	utmost humiliation have 	followed each other in 	quick succession during 	these years of horror. 	That horror grows, and 	violence and 	the threat of 	violence shadow the 	world, unless 	checked and 	ended, will destroy 	the precious 	inheritance of past 	ages. That horror 	has to 	be chcked in 	Europe and 	China, but 	it will 	not end till 	its root 	causes of Fascism 	and imperialism 	are removed. 	To that 	end, the Working 	Committee are 	prepared to 	give their co-operation. 	But it 	will be 	infinite tragedy if 	even this terrible 	war is 	carried on 	in the spirit 	of imperialism 	and for the purpose 	of retaining 	this stucture 	which is itself the cause of war and human degradation.  The 	Working Committee wish 	to declare 	that the 	Indian people have no 	quarrel with the 	German people or 	the Japanese 	people or any 	other people. But 	they have 	a deep-rooted quarrel with systems which deny freedom and are based 	on violence and 	aggression. They 	do not 	look forward to 	a victory 	of one 	people over 	another or 	to a 	dictated peace, but 	to a 	victory of 	real democracy 	for all the 	people of 	all countries 	and a world freed from 	the nightmare of 	violence and 	imperialist oppression.  The 	Committee earnestly 	appeal to 	the Indian 	people to end 	all internal conflict and controversy and, in this grave hour of peril, to keep in readiness and hold 
 together as a united nation, calm of purpose and determined to achieve the freedom of India within the larger freedom of the world.

 APPENDIX XIV
 A. I. C. C. RESOLUTIONlibtech_772_footnote
 The declaration of war in Europe has created an international situation of the gravest import to the world and to India, and the A. I. C. C., charged with the heavy responsibility of guiding the people of India in this moment of world crisis, has sought guidance from the principles and declarations of the Congress in considering this grave situation. The Congress has been guided throughout by its objective of achieving the independence of the Indian people and the establishment of a free democratic State in India wherein the rights and interests of all minorities are preserved and safeguarded. The means it has adopted in its struggles and activities have been peaceful and legitimate, and it has looked upon war and violence with horror and as opposed to progress and civilization. In particular, the Congress has declared itself opposed to all imperialist wars and to the domination of one country over another.
 In spite of the repeated declarations of the Congress in regard to war, the British Government have declared India a belligerent country without the consent of the Indian people and various far-reaching measures have been hurried through the legislatures and promulgated in the form of ordinances, vitally affecting them and circumscribing and limiting the powers of the Provincial Governments.
 The A. I. C. C., however, does not wish to take  any  final  decision precipitately and without giving every opportunity for the war and peace aims of the British Government to be clarified, with particular reference to India. The committee approves of and endorses the statement issued by the Working Committee on September 14, 1939, on the war crisis, and repeats the invitation contained therein to the British Government to state their war and peace aims.
 While the Committee condemns Fascism and Nazi aggression, it is convinced that peace and freedom can only be established and preserved by an extension of democracy to all colonial countries and by the application of the principle of self- determination to them so as to eliminate imperialist control. In particular, India must
 
 be declared an independent nation, and at present application must be given to this status to the largest possible extent. The A. I. C. C. earnestly trusts that this declaration will be made by the British Government in any statement that it may make in regard to its war and peace aims.
 The Committee desires to declare afresh that Indian freedom must be based on democracy and unity and the full recognition and protection of the rights of all minorities to which the Congress has always pledged itself.
 The Committee approves of the formation by the Working Committee of the War Emergency Sub-Committee and authorizes the Working Committee to take such steps as may be necessary to give effect to this resolution and to their statement on the war crisis.
