In some villages of the district, where I felt relief was necessary, I have issued orders giving postponement of a part of the land revenue. Land holders must now, therefore, pay up their land revenue and the outstanding taqavi. If, nevertheless, anyone influenced by the wrong advice which is being given to them refuses to pay up his land revenue dues, I shall be compelled to take stringent legal measures against him.” This was followed by a statement from the Government of Bombay on January 16, which supported the Collector’s action, questioned the locus standi of the Gujarat Sabha in Ahmedabad in advising the farmers of Kheda, described the issue of such advice as “thoughtless and mischievous” and asserted that the Government would not allow “any intervention in the normal work of the collection of land revenue dues” in the “rich and fertile district”.

libtech_572_footnote,"1The rest of the speech is not available. Gandhiji’s fast became a subject of serious concern. Prof. Anandshankar Dhruva who discussed it with Gandhiji doubted its efficacy for bringing about a real change of heart among the mill-owners. They strove to dissuade him; some offered to concede the demand for a 35 per cent increase for Gandhiji’s sake, but. according to Mahadev Desai, he rejected it saying, “Do not give 35 per cent out of pity for me, but do so to respect the workers’ pledge, and to give them justice.”"
libtech_573_footnote,"1This leaflet appears to have been issued on the day following the fast. On the next day, i.e., March 17, a leaflet was issued by Shankarlal Parikh and a settlement was reached in the morning of March 18."

Commissioner Pratt repudiated the opinion expressed by Gandhiji and his associates, and insisted that the right course was for the farmers to pay up their dues. This was the background against which Gandhiji wrote to the Governor."
libtech_578_footnote,"1To this the Governor replied on March 17, as follows: “The Government has been kept fully informed of what has been happening in the Kheda district and is satisfied that the Collector and the other officers of the Revenue Department while acting strictly according to rules and regulations have the interest of the agriculturists at heart.”"

I have no 	desire   to 	pit my 	judgment against that 	of people 	better qualified by 	experience and 	local knowledge. 	But you would 	not like me 	to act except 	as my 	judgment approved, 	especially in 	important matters. 	Frankly, I am 	not satisfied 	of the 	expediency of 	passive resistance in 	the Kaira affair, 	even allowing 	that the rights 	of the 	case were with 	the ryots. 	I do not, 	however, approve of 	coercion by 	Govt. In 	fact, I 	pressed the 	urgent call 	for a 	conciliatory policy 	as strongly 	as I 	could both 	on Sir 	Ibrahim Rahimtullah 	and Sir James 	Duboulay, when 	I saw 	them yesterday. 	I am 	grieved to 	hesitate instead of 	springing to 	your side at 	your call.

libtech_667_footnote,"1This was 	sent in 	reply to 	Geddes’ letter, the 	main points of 	which were as 	follows, as 	recorded by 	Mahadev Desai: 	(1) It 	(Conference) was really 	perfectly English, 	with the succession 	of decorous 	speeches, by 	the proper 	persons, in the 	proper tone 	and with the proper 	conviction. (2) No 	great public 	conference has yet 	given English a 	thought, yet 	at Stratford 	on-Avon they play 	Shakespeare. Your 	theatres were 	silent. No 	sign of 	Tulsidas. (3) 	Why not take examples 	and methods 	from the West—like 	the Welsh 	“Eisteddfod”?—at the 	one before last 	I heard 	Lloyd George 	in his 	utmost vigour, his 	most flavouring 	mood, since tensely in 	his own 	vernacular—He said, “I 	have come here to 	sing.” 	(4) Their pandal 	was divided 	into groups 	of each 	quality of 	voice for 	collective song. 	(5) The Irish, 	reviving their language, 	may give you hints, 	e.g., establishment 	of small 	vacation gatherings. (6) 	Look to 	Provence—a great 	folk poet—Mistral. They 	do him 	honour, they 	reopened the 	ancient Graeco-Roman 	theatres of their 	region and brought 	from . . . Sarah 	Bernhardt and 	her company not 	simply to 	do their plays but 	to start 	their own acting 	at the 	highest level, and 	when the Swedes gave 	old Mistral the 	Nobel Prize, he 	built the 	Musee Provencal—no mere 	glass case museum. (7) 	In Denmark 	a Bishop 	and a 	layman laid 	their heads together and 	set about re-educating 	the youths 	and maidens 	not with 	the 3 	R’s but with 	plough and cow and tale 	and song. 	(8) You want 	for your 	meetings no 	mere transient 	pandal with its 	poor acoustics, 	but the open 	air theatre 	and amphitheatre where 	the Greeks perfected their language and literature. (9) Support 	strongly the 	plea of 	uniting Hindi and 	Urdu. It 	is very much like the 	union of 	the Saxon 	and the French 	vocabulary. English theme gained the 	best qualities of 	each— the 	homely directness 	and force of the Germanic 	languages yet 	gained  a  new  precision, 	new dignity 	from the clerical 	side. Might not therefore 	the union 	of Urdu 	and Hindi be 	worked up 	by the institution 	of essays 	and prize poems 	for next 	conference?”"
