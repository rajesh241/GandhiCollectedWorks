 Early in the morning I call to mind that Being which is felt in the heart, which is sat (the eternal), chit (knowledge) and sukham (bliss), which is the state reached by perfect men and which is the super-state. I am that immaculate Brahma which ever notes the states of dream, wakefulness and deep sleep, not this body, the compound made of the elements—earth, water, space, light and air.

 In the early morning I worship Him who is beyond the reach of thought and speech and yet by whose grace all speech is possible. I worship Him whom the Vedas describe as neti neti (not this, not this). Him they, the sages, have called God of gods, the unborn, the unfallen, the source of all.

 In 1934 George Allen & Unwin Ltd. brought out an adaptation of the work by John S. Hoyland. (For Gandhiji’s permission for its publication, vide “Letter to J. S. Hoyland”, 15-12-1933.) But in order to make the poems acceptable to English readers, Hoyland omitted a great deal, “chiefly Indian names and symbolism” but also much else so that at places it is difficult to recognize the original in the adaptation. See for instance Gandhiji’s translation of verse 8 and Hoyland’s adaptation of it (p. 388).
 The version reproduced here is taken from a photostat of the original work in Gandhiji’s hand (C. W. 4903).

 Guru (teacher) is Brahma, he is Vishnu, he  is  Mahadev,  he  is  the geat Brahman itself. I bow to that guru.
 NOTE. This refers of course to the spiritual teacher. This is not a mechanical or artificial relationship. The teacher is not all these in reality but he is all that to the disciple who finds his full satisfaction in him and imputes perfection to him who gave him a living faith in a living God. Such a guru is a rarity, at least nowadays. The best thing is to think of God Himself as one’s Guru or await the Light in faith.

Here was his brother lying senseless in the battle-field but he was thinking, at the time, of Bibhishana. Whether at home, or the teacher’s house, or the home of friends or the father-in-law’s, wherever he was treated, he never experienced the richness of those feasts as that of the wild berries provided by Sabari.

 O my mind, worship the beneficent feet of Rama. From these feet issued forth the Ganga and was caught by Siva in his ample lock of hair. It was therefore named Jatashankari; it came for the good of the three worlds. Bharata treasured as a token of love the sandals bearing the imprints of these feet. The Bhil chief would not steer Rama’s boat without being allowed to wash those feet. Saintly persons always worship these beneficent feet. The wife of the sage Gautama obtained salvation by the touch of those feet. Rama hallowed (with his feet) the Dandak forest and removed the distress of the rishis.

Apart from the remembrance of God there will be no company, thou wilt be alone. I seek refuge in the feet of Murari the cleanser from sin and deliverer from bondage.  Sahajram  says: Worship Rama, he will remove evil and grant happiness.

 On this globe worship of God is the greatest thing, there is nothing like it even in the heavenly world. By acquiring merit one reaches only paradise from there to come again to earth in the end.

 We should forsake him who dissuades us from taking God’s name; we should worship God with all our mind, speech and deed. For doing this we should (if necessary) leave caste, family, mother, father, sister, son, wife, even as the snake discards his skin. Prahlad left his father but would not give up God’s name, Bharata and Shatrughna gave up their mother but never Rama. Rishis’ wives gave up their husbands for the sake of God. Thereby they not only lost nothing but gained all the four ends. Narsaiyo says: The women of Vraj gave up their all for the sake of Vitthal and sported with the Lord.

 It is useless to sorrow over what God ordains. Without His will we cannot move a blade of grass. If we do fuss about things, what is left over is a legacy of sorrows. It is ignorance that prompts one to say ‘I have done this’, even as a dog under a cart fancies himself shouldering the weight of the cart. A few yogis only know that the whole universe depends upon Him. If a man could dispose things, he would root out all enemies and have only friends, he would have no kings and no beggars, he would plant  on  every  house  flags betokening (limitless possession of wealth). Even as a creeper gives in its season leaves, fruit and flowers so does man receive what is his due in due time; a foolish man only will therefore resort to vain cogitations. Often does man write much and fails to say the right thing. People worship what they like and they seem to believe whole-heartedly that theirs is the only true belief. But Narsaiyo says with folded hands: Consider wordly happiness to be vain; everything is nothing without Krishna; I want my God from birth to birth.

 No matter what one does, self-denial will not last unless it is based on dislike for the thing given up. If there is deep down the desire for it, it will not be relinquished. A man may wear the garb of a sannyasi but that will bring him no nearer the goal if the garb only hides the desire that has its full possession of the wearer. So long as desire, anger, greed and passion are not rooted out, the thing will come to the surface the moment there is an opportunity; the very sannyasa may become an additional source of self-indulgence. Just as the seed does not sprout during the dry hot season but does so as soon as the rains come, so is it with man’s desires; they await the due season. Just as iron moves in front of a magnet so do the senses move when they are face to face with their objects. They are still for want of opportunity but they run riot as soon as the opportunity comes. Therefore mere external renunciation will not answer if there is no corresponding response within. Such external renunciation will mean licence even from the restraints of Varnashrama (the four divisions) and is likely to result in harm. Such a man becomes useless like milk gone bad. It won’t yield ghee or butter and is unfit to drink.

 The mountain is in the straw but no one sees it in it even as none would notice a lion hidden among a flock of sheep. But he can discover himself by his roar, as the musk deer among the ordinary flock. The Absolute is hidden in the phenomenal as oil in the seed, fire in the wood, ghee in milk. Who will listen and to whom shall I talk of the Illimitable and the Unknowable? Speech does not reach it. There is an abode which is beyond the intellect. Though the mind is swift like the wind it cannot overtake it. This Immortal, Indivisible essence pervades everything movable and immovable. It has made this universe, there is not an atom where It is not. But by the grace of a true guru It is attainable. Why go in search of It here and there when It is in you? Servant Dhiro says: Thou art wherever I look.

 Beware O my mind, you have to walk on the edge of a sword; with courage you have to fight for truth; time is theenemy, the year is the lord, the twelve months are the generals, each month has thirty days which are the under-officers and then there is the day and the night and so in the year seven hundred and twenty. The hundred years of a lifetime are the besiegers of the body fort; these have to be defeated. There are five senses after you and then there are anger, desire, greed, infatuation, illusion, egotism—these are all first-class warriors tyrannical. You have to fight a very powerful foe. You have love, knowledge, true teacher, purity, contentment, forgiveness, hymns, faith. With these on your side you have to give battle. Meditation and yoga practices and the like will, Dhiro says, enable you to stand the heat of the battle.

 The world is mad, it respects humbug. The fool does not know the Maker though He is nearest him. He worships lifeless stocks and stones as Siva. How dark are people who ignore life? Under the sun’s blaze one does not see the philosophers’ stone. Put a stone vessel in the sea and try ever so hard, it is bound to sink. How can you press oil from sand or milk a metal cow? What avails a daily clean bath to a man who is unclean within? What is the use of destroying the snake-hole after the snake has bitten you? Knowers alone know how love is wounded. God is not far, He is near; only look within, clean thy heart and see the Lord within—the powerful Lord of Dhiro is everywhere in the world.

 Resolve upon enthroning Ramanama in thy heart. Yoga is no use, nor is the saffron-coloured robe nor mixing up all thy food. Whether thou wearest bhagava  or white garments is of little consequence, the thing to do is not to hurt any creature and to wish it well. Put the worldly men on one side, the yogis on the other and then show me the yogi who has seen God face to face. Because they served God, Narasinha Mehta, Mira, Prahlad, Sena barber, Dhano, Peepo, Rohidas, Koobo, Potter Goro, Rajput Bodano, Gangabai sawGod face to face. Poor good people, good-hearted butchers, worshipped God and found peace; show me the yogi who did likewise. Rama is not to be attained by smearing oneself with ashes or by hanging head downward nor by leaving wife and retiring to the forest. God can be attained only by diligent search. Rama is for him who can be happy in the jungle and who regards palaces as jungle, who regards bitter as sweet and sweet like bitter. Even as oil is hid in the seed, ghee in milk, so is God hid everywhere, says Narbho.

 Men of God should have abundant love for all; they should shed all egotism. Through God’s name they should banish the threefold afflictions, leave off sinning and take Ramanama. They should consider all to be good and themselves to be unworthy. They should in perfect humility distribute alms. They should devote themselves to their faith body, mind and speech and regard God as the giver and the enjoyer. They should not weaken in their decisions; they should speak sparingly. They should entrust secrets only to the trustworthy and their speech should be humble and [they should] be serious in giving opinions; they must not talk big before those who know how to discriminate, they should take the name of the limitless God and attain salvation and help others to do likewise, their devotion should be as of poor people.

 Devotion is for the brave, they do not turn back after having once begun. Having made up their minds, they go forward in full faith. They have killed desire, anger, arrogance and greed. When the temptations swelled and when the heat commenced, the cowards trembled and fled. The true men stood their ground and fought with God as their Help and Guide. They outdistanced many  and  then began to have a glimpse of Brahm[an]. They destroyed the effect of past action and met God face to face. They would not wish for the various gifts. To such salvation is easy. Bhojo Bhakta says: Thosewho have given up themselves body and mind and all and are ever equi-minded are the true devotees and they have heaven as  their  abode.

 The works of him who has an inner experience do not bind him for he has known God. He is the knowing one who has broken all ties. He is beyond everything and is a mere witness of everything; he is independent of all the six worlds. Being above these he stands alone. Of millions the fewest only realize this. One who has the inner experience knows the Nameless One. He has attained salvation for he is past the dual state, without striving for the One indivisible, he perceives It as if naturally. The truth is that all created things have to perish and so this endless ocean of life and death continues to roll on. The last stage is beyond the waking, dreaming, sleeping and the state beyond these three. It is beyond the physical and ethereal. That which is above even the first cause is described by the Vedas as ‘not this, not this’. I dote on the mother of him who has dedicated himself to common good, who is goodness personified and who is like the true guru. Nirant says: He who is eternal though nameless  has  many names.

 When will the matchless time come so  that  I  would  be  rid of all knots external and internal? When will I give up all the subtlest ties and go the way the great sages have gone? Would that I was indifferent to all the moods and that the body was used merely for self-restraint, that there was nothing to bind me for any cause imaginable and that I had no illusions about the body. Would that I should gain knowledge that comes from removal of obstruction in the path of perception, that I regarded body as separate from the soul and that I had recognition only of the soul. Would that obstruction to right conduct too was removed and there was concentration on pure self. Would that there was steadfastness of the three yugas (?) running practically to the time of death and that steadfastness was incapable of being shaken by sufferings however great. Would that even the yoga was only for attaining greater restraint over self and that there was implicit obedience to the precepts of the Jina for the sake of the soul. Would that even that activity also perceptibly decreased and I was absorbed in self-realization. Would that there were neither likes nor dislikes in matters received through the senses and that I was unaffected by their play. Would that I engaged in activities that came to me in due course and was not enslaved by time, place or circumstance. Would that I was angered against anger and that against respect paid to me I had humility enough not to be affected by it.
 Would that in respect of maya I was but a witness to its blandishments and against ambition I had ambition to thwart it, I had no anger against even the extreme wrongdoer and had no pride if an emperor paid respects to me, that I was unmoved even if the body perished and had no desire even for the greatest gifts. That I was the same to friend and foe alike as towards praise or insult, that there was [in-]difference in me whether I lived or died, that even regarding the cycles of birth and death or salvation I had only the simple natural state that I had crossed the alluring ocean of different temptations and was intent upon the state where all the passions arelibtech_310_footnotelibtech_311_footnotequenched, that at the time [of] death I would shed all desire and had perfect knowledge, that all the four kinds of activities were to me like a burnt hope— mere ashes, that I was living out only this life and that after that there was no more birth. That I had no desire for even an atom, that I was sinless, immovable and intent upon self-realization, that I was absorbed in the spotless, eternal everloving, neither small nor big, formless self-acting Being, that owing to past actions I was fit for the abode of the released—where [there is] eternal bliss, perfect perception and perfect experience. This is the state which the all-knowing Jina realized but could not describe. How can any other person describe  it?  It  is capable only of being experienced.

459. LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI
 SATURDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 13/16, 1930
 CHI. NARANDAS,
 This time I got your packet at 12 noon on Wednesday. I got a copy of the booklet Gitabodhlibtech_312_footnote. I take it that those who make notes about the work they do as yajna do so in their dairy. If you remind people often enough about this, they will be careful. See that everyone is soon able to use the instruments for weighing yarn and testing its strength. I have replied to Mahadev’s questions in my letter to Durga, and to questions about my health in my  letter  to  Kakasaheb. Therefore read both the letters.
 Afternoon
 There was a letter from Jayaprakash saying that Prabhavati  would go over there. She may have even arrived there before you get this letter. If she comes, look after her very carefully. She gets faint- ing fits and these should stop  immediately  in  the  Ashram.  You  may buy any fruits which may be necessary for her.  Consult  a  doctor if necessary. You may write to me about her whenever you wish to.
 
 Night, December 15, 1930 I got Manilal’s letter. I felt relieved. Let him observe as many restriction as he chooses, but not at the cost of his health. 110-115 lb.
is certainly low weight. Manilal should maintain his weight between
 I have had no reply to my inquiry about Devdas’s letter. I have even suggested that he should write again. If the Bombay air suits Jamna, do not insist on her returning to the Ashram. Do you still make bread there? If you do, of what quality are you able to make it, and who actua-lly makes it? If it is of good quality and if anyone is coming on a visit here, send a sample. You had described the process of making it, but it did not succeed here. I have not been able to discover where the error lay.
 I can say that, up to this evening, the bhakhari of jowar and bajra seems to have done me no harm. I eat very little in bulk but can keep up my strength all right. No one should worry on my account. I will not be obstinate and cling to the experiment.
 
 
 I did not find Hariyomalji’s and Gijubhai’s letters. I wonder if Gijubhai was written in place of Haribhai. I did not find the latter’s name in Radha’s note.

 Tuesday Morning, December 16, 1930 Pranayama (control of breath) and asanas (yogic postures) are referred to appreciatively in this chapter, but we should remember that
at the same time the Lord has stressed the need for brahmacharya,  i.e.,
 keeping the observances calculated to take us nearer and nearer to God. It should be clearly understood that the mere practice of asanas and the like can never take us to the goal of even-mindedness. Asanas and pranayama may be of some slight help in steadying the mind and making it single-purposed, provided that they are practised to that end. Otherwise they are no better than other methods of physical training. They are very useful indeed as physical exercise and  I believe that this type of exercise is good for the soul, and may be performed from a bodily standpoint. But I have observed that these practices do only harm when indulged in for the acquisition of supernormal powers (siddhi) and the performance of miracles. This chapter should be studied as a summary of the teaching in the preceding three chapters. It cheers us up in our spiritual struggle. We should never be down-hearted and give up the endeavour to reach evenness of temper.

 I got your letter. Though you are so near the Ashram, I do not send this letter along with the other post for the Ashram, and delay its reaching you by some days. Instead, I am taking the risk and writing it directly to you. I believe you will get it. Why do you give way to despair? One who believes in God can never feel despair. Since you are very eager to work, you earn merit as if you had been actually working. Why, then, do you feel impatient? Who knows for what service God has destined you? Or how can we say  that  your aspirations in themselves are not sufficient for His work? You do perform the daily yajna of spinning; what else is it, if not service? Start repeating Ramanama and rouse yourself. Shake off despair. Banish the very thoughts of weakness and disease. If you take interest in the Gita and the Ramayana, go on repeating to yourself verses from them. Write to me direct. And write often.

  	I have your letter. Even if I agree to see you I am afraid the 	permission will not be granted. Therefore for the time being, we 	must be content with letters alone. By speculation I did not mean 	that no forward transactions should be entered into. Speculation 	means gambling. With the expectation that market prices will go up I 	buy 1,000 bales of cotton. I do not need any cotton, I do not even 	store it in any warehouse. Only a book transaction is made. Now I 	await a rise in price. I sell the cotton when it rises; this I 	consider gambling. The nation or, rather, the world has lost a great 	deal through such 
 transactions. This was what I meant in my letterlibtech_315_footnotelibtech_316_footnote. Yes, I expect much more than this, but, at present, you will not be up to that. Without at all depending upon future market prices, to sell the commodities at a little more than the cost price is what I consider unsullied trade. Today it might be difficult to conduct such business, but ultimately, it might bear fruit. You might remember this is what I visualize for khadi. But I know this is a tall order. I shall be very happy and content if you brothers can give up speculation. However, do only what  is intelligently acceptable and within your power. I would not at all wish that you should act upon the suggestion simply because it happens to be mine and that, too, sent from jail. Faith should not have a place where reasoning is applicable.
 Jayaprakash informs me that, although you are not recruiting any new people just now, he will be absorbed somewhere because of my recommendationlibtech_317_footnote. I certainly hold that Jayaprakash is a worthy young man but I do not wish that a post be created where none exists today.
 I was a little worried to read of Malaviyaji’s fever in the news- papers. I am relieved now. I hope he will emerge from the jail in good health. I am glad about your health too. I am again experi- menting with a milkless diet. This time constipation was res- ponsible for it. Now I am taking chapatis prepared from millet for the prisoners, vegetables, three tolas of almonds and dates. I am trying to give up dates. Constipation has disappeared. I shall revert to milk if I lose strength. It is nearly a month since I gave up milk.

 BHAI UDIT MISHRAJI,
 Your letter. I have in general given the literal translation of Bhajanavalilibtech_318_footnote.  Now  it  is  up   to   Mirabehn.   I   do   not   consider   the translation worth publishing. It cannot even be published while I am
 
 in jail. How can I choose from the bhajans? Different bhajans appeal on different occasions. We might say that all are well liked. But I do wish to drop a few in the new edition. In “Who is not devoted to Rama and Vaidehi”libtech_319_footnoteI take Rama to mean  Daridranarayana and it is our duty to forsake the company of one who does not serve Daridranarayana. Non-co-operation emanates from that.
 Thanks for making a start in Gujarati. Considering all this connection with Gujarat, it is good to learn the language too. As a matter of fact, the more Indian languages one knows the better.
 I do not use the enema regularly. I regard it efficacious to use only when the need arises. To use it daily is not good. It can also prove harmful.
 My blessings to the children. I hope the ear-trinkets taken off have not been replaced. My hope is that now the children would have become simpler than ever before.

  LETTER TO KASHINATH TRIVEDI 
 YERAVDA MANDIR,
 December 18, 1930
 CHI. KASHINATH,
 A person without art is like a beast. But how will you define art? Art is “skill in work”. The yoga of the third chapter of the Gita is perfect art. And this is also true about the activities generally known as art. Any activity in which the masses cannot participate is not art, but a kind of self-indulgence, whether it concerns the voice or clothes or stone. Large numbers singing Ramdhun in unison is art, which ought to be cultivated. Many temples have art, and their art is something which can be appreciated by the masses. The daily worship and readings from holy books which take place in temples, if kept within measure and done with genuine faith, are the best form of art. Thus, there is art wherever harmony prevails as regards the time, the place and the occasion. I do not like films. I have never gone to a cinema.

  	You must have got my message. I was happy to learn that you are 	working hard in the field of public service. But it seems you fight 	shy of khadi saris. How can you serve the poor if you feel averse to 	the sacred products of their labour? Think over this.

  LETTER TO SUSHILA GANDHI 
 December 19, 1930
  	The letter to Radhabai is enclosed. Why do you write vancha vishlibtech_320_footnote? Why did you split the word? And why vish? 	It should be  veesh. The dictionarylibtech_321_footnotepublished by the Gujarat Vidyapith contains rules for 	spelling; acquaint yourself with them. Tara is bound to know about 	this. Is not language also included in our love for things Indian? 	We ought not to murder a language.  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	a photostat the Gujarati : G.N. 4780.   
           CHI. 	BALBHADRA,   LETTER TO BALBHADRA   YERAVDA MANDIR,  December 	19, 1930 
  	I have your letter. You seem to be rendering good service. And 	simultaneously you have been improving your weight. That is indeed 	creditable. Explain what you mean when you say that you eat 	everything. Do not overstep the limits of propriety. Do not beg from 	anyone. Be content with what you get.  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	a photostat of the Gujarati : G.N. 9215     LETTER TO PURUSHOTTAM GANDHI   YERAVDA MANDIR,  December 	19, 1930  CHI. 	PURUSHOTTAM,  	Since you have been doing your duty with sincere devotion, you 	should feel no other desires. What path should I suggest to you? We 	daily recite the verse  Prajahati yada kamanlibtech_322_footnote. You should burn   up      
 every personal desire. You will then yourself discover the path. Reflect over the verses describing the qualities of the  sthitaprajnalibtech_323_footnoteand know that they are for persons of your character. Think which of those verses you are not able to follow in conduct, and why. If you do this, all your mental problems will disappear. Write to me from time to time. My respectful greetings to the elders, and blessings to Jamnadas.

  LETTER TO KUSUM DESAI 
 
     CHI. 	KUSUM (SENIOR),  December 	19, 1930 
  	I got your letter. Is Kripalani all right? Kanti and others will 	meet me in a few days. Pyarelal tells me that his books about the 	rules governing sandhi and samas in Sanskrit are with 	you, or that you know where they are. Send them here. He requires 	them for a systematic study of the Gita. Both of us keep good 	health. So far, rotlas of jowar and bajra seem 	to have agreed with me.  	I give detailed news about my health in the letter meant for all, 	and so I do not write about it separately in each letter.  	You can send letters to Pyarelal through Trivedilibtech_324_footnotelibtech_325_footnote.  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	a photostat of the Gujarati : G.N. 1814

 Y. M.,
     MY 	DEAR VIDYA,  December 	19, 1930 
  	I am sorry you have not got my letter. I have forgotten your 	question. You must repeat it, if you want the answer. I trust you 	are keeping well. Are you taking enough daily exercise? You should 	set apart at least a few minutes daily for Hindi. Love.  BAPU  From 	a microfilm of the Hindi. Courtesy: National Archives of India and 	Anand T. Hingorani   
   LETTER TO MIRABEHN     YERAVDA 	MANDIR, 
    CHI. 	MIRA,  4.30 	p.m., December 20, 1930 
  	Your letter betrays about my health an anxiety which is wholly 	unnecessary. The weight which was taken on Thursday showed an 	increase of 1libtech_326_footnotelibtech_327_footnote/2 1b., a very good increase in seven days. Nor do I feel 	any weakness. I do my two hours’ spinning on the takli standing 	as a rule without feeling any appreciable fatigue. I have just now 	sat down to write this after finishing the takli. All the 	mistakes made last time are being avoided. Stools are well formed. 	Pyarelal tells me there is no smell worth noticing. The food is all 	well cooked, i.e., vegetables and chapati. The letter is rebaked 	when I receive it. Last time, you should remember, it was all raw 	food  including  cereals  and  pulses.libtech_328_footnotelibtech_329_footnoteAs 	 a matter of fact, I am now taking practically what I was taking 	before starting the raw cereals. The only difference is taking bajri 	or jwari in the place of wheat. Perhaps it is a change 	for the better. I am taking once boiling water, lemon and salt. In 	spite of all this apparent  improve [ment] if I find any 	irregularity about the stools or weakness (persistent) or a 	continuing decrease in weight, in any one of the three things 	happening, I shall go back to milk. But just now with the good feel 	about the health I must not deprive myself of the joy of avoiding 	milk and taking the bajri or jwari chapati. And what 	is more, I like the    
 taste of these chapatis. This detailed explanation and  description  ought to give you and other friends full satisfaction and free you from all worry as to the future.
 In my opinion, while it is necessary, so far as you are concern- ed, to keep a watch on your menu, your chief trouble is mental. Any pressure on the mind reacts immediately on your body. This anxiety complex, you should try to throw off. “Be careful for no- thing.” “Look at the lilies of the field, they toil not, neither do they spin and yet Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.” I do not know whether I have quoted correctly. Anyhow the lilies only seem neither to toil nor to spin. They do both but so naturally that we do not notice their toilsome spin. If they did not toil, they would wither. Only they have not the egotism and hence attachments, likes and dislikes that we have. But when we toil like them detachedly, our toil will not be noticed and therefore will not adversely affect the body.
 7.30 p.m. You and I and all of us have to make a conscious and deliberate effort to realize this blessed state. Or else, our reading of the Gita is
vain.
 You will take care not to burn yourself with the primus. You know how Gujarati women have burnt themselves over the use of the primus. The loose saris lend themselves to the wick especially at the time of lighting it. As it is kept on the floor, they have to bend and the rising flame easily catches a fold or a loose end of the sari. It may be wise for you, therefore, to keep it on a metalmounted stool. Then too there is precious little room in your little dormitory. Anyway, you have my warning. You will now take what precautions you may think right.
 In my seclusion, the idea of your bringing out a paper does not at all commend itself to me. That ties you down and I should like you to remain free for what comes to your lot. And then the paper will absorb the labour of several others. I dread the idea. But my opinion has no value. You and the other workers are the best judges.
 Yes, I have jut finished the first part of the introduction to my translation of the Gitalibtech_330_footnote. I hope to do at least a paragraph every day. If I succeed, the introduction cannot take long.
 The   new  Gandivlibtech_331_footnotehas   almost   all   the   improvements   I   had contemplated. It has two springs for the two mals. It is working like a
 
 musical instrument and requires very little attention. For the execu- tion of these improvement I am thankful to the Superintendent and an English co-prisoner, who is a clever mechanic and who takes a serious interest in the work. He has applied the spring to the holder in an original way. The idea is incredibly simple and equally effective. But I must not keep you over this any longer.
 I am glad you have taken Surendra in hand. It is criminal how he neglects his body. Even St. Francis, though he called his body an ass, took some care of it. And after all the ass is a most useful and patient animal. The brother ass can be equally useful if properly treated and neither pampered nor neglected.
And now here is the first verse of the morning prayer :
 “Early in the morning, I call to mind that Being which is felt in the heart, which is sat (the eternal), chit (knowledge), sukham (blis), which is the state reached by perfect men and which is the super-state. I am that immaculate Brahman which ever notes the states of dream, wakefulness and deep sleep, not this body, the compound made of the elements (earth, water, space, light and air).” You will be interested to know that the first verse was commended on 6th May last.libtech_332_footnote
 I am sorry that the very first verse needed correcting. The more  I think, the more clearly I see the meaning. And then I don’t mind how often I cut about the translation. Formerly I used to shudder to utter this verse thinking that the claim made therein was arrogant. But when I saw the meaning more clearly, I perceived at once that it was the very best thought with which to commence the day. It is a solemn declaration that we are not the changeful bodies which require sleep, etc., but deep down, we are the Being, the witness pervading the countless bodies. The first part is the recalling to mind the presence of the vital principle and the second part is the affirmation that we are that vital principle. The description of the Being, the Brahman, is also quite apposite. It is, nothing else is (sat), it is all knowledge or light (chit), and naturally, therefore, it is all bliss (sukham) or the word generally used is anand. The rest is simple. You will compare this translation with what you have already, translated by Valjibhai.  If  there is a material difference, let me have his  translation.  In scholarship I should yield the palm to him. So now God willing, you may expect a present of this character every week. And here goes the
 
 bugle telling me it will presently be 9 p.m.
Love.

  LETTER TO GANGABEHN VAIDYA 
 December 22, 1930
 CHI. GANGABEHN (SENIOR),
 It no doubt puts a very heavy responsibility on us when parents of grown-up girls entrust them to us. God will help us to bear it. When, however, you feel in a particular case that the responsibility will be beyond your strength, plainly refuse to accept it. Sent away any girl who refuses to submit to your discipline. Explain the position clearly to the parents and the girl before you accept her. If we do not take such steps of practical wisdom, God will not help us. He never helps the timid, the lethargic and those who are not vigilant.
 Have any facilities you require, but safeguard your health. If you think that tea and coffee are essential for it, take either without the slightest hesitation or without feeling ashamed about doing so. Giving up tea or coffee is not at present the purpose of your sadhana; that purpose is the service of those among the inmates of the Ashram who suffer.
 I cannot think of one single remedy which will help Madhu and all others in the Ashram who suffer from constipation. I will tell you how I overcame it in my case. For three or four days, I ate only cooked greens like tanka. That completely restored my bowel movement. Then I added almonds to the diet. You do not need them for the people there. Perhaps you will not get even greens. But you can certainly get onions. If those who suffer from constipation eat boiled onions, that, too, will probably help them. If you can get tomatoes, you may mix them with onions. If simple boiled onions do not taste well, even with the addition of salt, and if tomatoes are not available, they may use kokum.
 The persons may try shirshasan. It has helped people to overcome constipation from which they had suffered many years. The asana should be done only on an empty stomach. It is quite easy to do. The skirt should be tucked up behind and one should stand on one’s head, supporting the body against a wall. After some practice the support of the wall will not be necessary. The head should be supported by the palms joined together.
 I suppose you know that these days I eat the rotlas of jowar and bajra, and  vegetables,  served  to  prisoners  in  jail.  The  vegetables for me have to be cooked separately, because those cooked
 for other prisoners contain spices. I continue to eat dates. In place of milk I take four tolas of almonds. I keep fairly good health. If I do not keep it up, I will resume milk.

  LETTER TO PREMABEHN KANTAK 
 YERAVDA MANDIR,
 December 22, 1930
 CHI. PREMA,
 I got your letter full of information. Both the meanings of nij- anamagrahilibtech_337_footnotelibtech_338_footnoteare good. The meaning suggested by Narandas may suit Gujarati better, but the one suggested by you is not altogether in- appropriate. I imagine that you yourself are a little girl and reply to your question about prayer. Just as we have parents who gave birth to us, so they had their parents who brought them into the world. If we go further and further back like this, He whom we can conceive as the Father of all is God. It is because He is that that we also call Him the Creator. As our parents often come to know what we want without our telling them, so does God know our wishes. If our human parents have this power to know what we want, the Creator of all must have infinitely greater power to know our heart. That is why we also think of God as Antaryami, the Dweller within. It is not necessary that we should be able to see Him. We have never seen a good many of our relations. Somebody’s parents may have gone away to a foreign country or died while he or she was a child, but such a man or woman trusts other people and believes that the parents live or lived. Similarly, we should trust the testimony of saints about the existence of God and believe that the Antaryami does exist. If that is so, it is easy to understand why we should sing bhajans to Him and pray to Him. If we are good children, we bow to our parents, prostrating ourselves before them, the first thing in the morning after leaving bed and the last thing at night when going to bed. We should do the same to God. And as we tell our parents what we desire, so we should tell God. This should be enough for today. If you do not understand anything in this, do not hesitate to question me.

 DEAR SISTER,
 I got the two boxes of dates and the cotton send by you. Need I thank you for them? Write to Vithaldas and tell him that the dates were excellent. This does not mean, of course, that he should send me such dates more often. My request was that he should communicate the price to the Superintendent here and supply the dates as and when required, provided his brother orders enough quantity to spare some and sell it. I got your letter too. I will write to you when I require more cotton.

  	You are being really tested. See that you do not fail in the test. 	One preserves one’s self-respect better by giving up the very 	desire for being respected. You will not get another Gangabehn who 	will look after you like a mother as she does. She has an 	overbearing temper. Endure it. Understand and appreciate her zeal 	for service and her sympathy for all. Anyone who wishes to serve 	must learn to act as a member of an organization. To do this means 	to obey somebody’s authority. One’s superior has his or her 	superior too. Think over the verses of Chapter XII of the Gita. 	One of them says that a devotee and lover of God is equally 	indifferent to respect and disrespect, to praise and censure, and 	holds friend and foe in equal regard. Let this be true about you. Do 	not feel it a burden to write to me.  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	a photostat of the Gujarati : G.N. 9318

 December 22, 1930
  	I have your letter. From your postcard received yesterday, I thought 	I would receive a letter today, but I did not get one. From 	Jayaprakash’s letter it would seem you have now gone to the 	Ashram. But it is not clear from your letters whether you have. I 	should like you to go to the Ashram as soon as possible. I do not 	like your continuing to get the fainting fits. I must now get a 	report of your talks with Father. Incidentally, that will give me 	news about his health too. I am quite well. So far, I have been able 	to digest jowar and bajra.  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	a photostat of the Gujarati : G.N. 3385     LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI   Thursday 	Morning, December 18/23, 1930  CHI. 	NARANDAS,  	I got your packet yesterday evening. The letters to the Ashram which 	I handed in this time, that is, on Tuesday last, should reach you on 	Thursday, that is, today. I suggested to the official here to post 	them immediately, if possible, and he told me afterwards that this 	week’s letters were posted on Tuesday itself.  	I welcome your long letters, but I shall not be happy if you take 	special trouble to make them long. I can understand what a burden 	you are carrying. I did not want an explanation in regard to Keshu. 	But I can understand your having given it so that you could your 	pour out your heart and satisfy yourself.  	I had a postcard from Surajbhan, in which he says that he would be 	happy if Yashodadevi was called to the Ashram. She lives with the 	family of Lala Dunichand, a lawyer, in Ambala. Write to him.  	The Ratilal episode is both happy and painful. His foolishness is 	painful, but the display of humanity by the merchant, who returned 	the diamond, and by Gopi, who returned the money, makes one 
 happy. In my eyes, their subsequent conduct wipes out their initial guilt. Champa, of course, has always been foolish. She listens to no persuasion and re-mains fond of diamonds and other jewels, and loses money in conse-quence. Ratilal must have returned. Even if he has not returned, that will not worry me. God always saves him. But this is what life is. We pass our time in undoing the consequences of one another’s error. For those who can remain unattached while doing this, their labour is not wasted. To them it is a spiritual striving and they realize God through it. I had an experience of this yesterday when I saw God in a worm and a weevil. You are wrong if you think that you know Pyarelal fully. Being a poet, he is bound  to  be  dreaming always. I asked him to remove a worm from the dates. He should have put it in a safe corner, but, instead of thinking about his duty, he was thinking of something else, God knows what, and he put the worm in the wash-basin. The weevil, too, was dropped into the same. If now I washed my hands or face in the basin, I would be the cause of the death of both. I therefore, decided not to wash in it. But when, after I had finished my work, I got ready to wash my hands, I did not see the worm and the weevil in the basin. They had slowly moved away. I look upon this experience as seeing God in the two worms. An atheist or a rationalist would describe the incident as mere accident. It was an accident, no doubt, but seeing God is also an accident. If we but understand the truth, we would see Him every day; otherwise our whole life would pass without our seeing Him. But I will not dwell further on this. I wanted to note this incident in the diary yes-terday, but, in my preoccupation with other work I wrote in it only about the daily sacrificial work and forgot to note this. While writing about the merchant and Gopi, I remembered this holy experience and have shared it with you. I learnt much else, too, from it yesterday. God alone knows whether I shall be able to digest all that. I will now answer your question here. As we reflect deeper and remain peaceful, the meaning of ahimsa and truth becomes clearer. I even realize the supreme utility of these two. I believe we realize God in the degree to which we practise them. I am gett-ing more convinced than ever in my view that seeing God except through truth and ahimsa is an impossibility. How can members of a group practise ahimsa towards one another? They can do so by displaying generosity towards co- workers and their faults and everyone regarding his own faults with strictness. Anyone who observes the faults of others believes, whether he is conscious of the fact or not, that he does not have the same
 faults. This gives rise to pride. The true rule is that one should oneself observe all rules strictly and tolerate others who seem slack in  observing them. This is not kindness but strict justice. Do we really know what effort is made by a person in observing a rule even as slackly as he does? If our seeming strictness in observing rules comes naturally to us, what is the value of that strictness? Is it any cause for wonder if a man like Bhima can lift a weight of four pounds with the utmost ease? A girl, however, might slip down while trying to lift one pound; what would we think of that Bhima if he laughed at her then? Really speaking, the effort of that girl to lift one pound is of much greater value than Bhima’s lifting the weight of  four  pounds.  If Bhima had not lifted that weight, somebody else as strong would have lifted it; but by her effort to lift one pound that girl taught the world a lesson in doing one’s duty and earned God’s grace. Our dharma therefore does not lie in criticizing others and thereby commiting violence; it lies in becoming more vigilant ourselves. If a  strong bullock is yoked with one seemingly or really weak, the former’s duty is to do more work and make up for the deficiency of the latter. The driver goads it to labour harder. If the strong bullock does not do the work expected of it, it is looked upon as a shirker; it is selfish and has no pity on the other one. Let us never be shirkers. Let us always do our duty. God will judge us and our co-workers. He can see into the hearts of all. We scarcely can see into our own. We easily learn this if we strive sincerely to cultivate ahimsa.
 Through the pursuit of truth, we know the measure of purity in our motives. It increases our vigilance in regard to the smallest social duties and to our daily work. If we strive for truth, we would not be content merely to attend prayers but would try to concentrate our attention on them. We would try to follow the songs and the dis- courses, be punctual in attending the prayers and respond to them as to a fresh experience every day. The freshness does not consist in the variety of bhajans or other recitations, but should result from the increasing purity of our heart. We should grow daily more contented and feel greater peace of mind. If we do not have this experience, the fault will lie not with the quality of the prayers but with the element of untruth-fulness in us. If we attend the prayers with sincere devotion to truth, we would experience nothing but peace. The faithful who visit temples do not observe the lack of cleanliness in them,  or  pay  attention to the hypocrisy of the priest. They do not see the image as a stone. They experience peace in the midst of noise and return from
 the temples purified in heart. A person like me who feels suffocated by the noise there and sees the image only as a piece of stone should never visit a temple. God appears to us in the form in which we worship Him. For He is not outside of us. He is in the hearts of us all. If we understand this truth, our simplest and smallest actions would shed lustre on us and help us to see God. In order that we may learn this, prayers, spinning, and other daily duties are like a spiritual lighthouse to us or a right angle which is the standard of measurement.
 Saturday Morning
 If Giriraj remains quiet, that problem will then be over. I see that it will not be possible now to get the children to the Ashram. He has entrusted them [to somebody else]. Trust them to their fate now. I am going on quite well at present. I have gained a pound or a pound and a half in weight this week. I cannot say that I have at last succeeded in giving up dates and raisins. Only a few days ago, Jamnabehn and Vithaldas sent some dates and I ate them for two or three days. And now again I have stopped eating them. I am thus observing the effect of eating them and not eating them. I do want to give them up if I can. At present, therefore, my diet includes a little quantity of greens or cabbage or beetroot or turnip or pumpkin, bhakhari of bajra or jowar, four tolas of almonds, and lemon. If God keeps me fit with these, so far so good; otherwise I will humbly resume milk or curds. I cannot say yet that I am able to live on this diet. I will not say, either, that I shall not be able to do so. I had never expected that I would be able to digest jowar and bajra. At present, however, I seem to have no difficulty in doing so.
 I have noted what you say about yourself. Your selection of the items and their quantities is correct. I see that you have given up ground-nuts; there is nothing wrong in that. The fact that you are losing weight will do you no harm at all. You should not lose strength, however. If you find it necessary, increase the quantity of milk or curds. It will per-haps help you if you add just one tola of almonds to your diet. Solve the problem of Parnerkar firmly. It seems to have turned out a painful chapter. I got the chapters of Gitabodh. So far I have not received the piece of leather.
 You may extract from any of my letters what I say about the yajna of spinning and publish it. There is no harm in  publising  similar other material of public interest. The more the people  do  yajna for self-purification, the better. A mass yajna has an altogether
 miraculous effect. If you can, keep up with what you have started. The spinning-wheels and all other things must be in perfect condition. These things produce an effect on our minds and make a difference to the speed. Your speed has increased well enough. I have not been able to go beyond 200 on the spinning-wheel and 60 on the  talki. But  I do hope to do so. I do not know if there is something wrong with my fingers. If the nerves running through them are weak, it is possible that they may not be active enough. Just as you go to bed early, it will also be good if you make it a rule not to rise earlier than a fixed hour. You should do what you can between 4 and 9 and then stop. If you have more things to do than you can finish during that time, you may omit those which you safely can. You should entrust to others the things which they can attend to. It is really not necessary to give you advice in this matter, but I have said something all the same in order that you may be more careful. One test of non-attachment is that a person who is non-attached always feels as if he had no work, though he is never inactive even for a single moment. At present, however, that state of mind “is a wish beyond our reach”. All the same, we should grasp with our intellect the meaning of that verse and, having done so, strive to reach that state. The condition of a non-attached person should never seem pitiable. He should never  have  an expression on his face which might make anybody feel sorry for him and think that he was carrying an excessive burden of work. Think what “burden” of work God has to carry. Nevertheless He is the king of those who do not work. He is an object of pity to no one. On the contrary, we hunger for His mercy. We should never be satisfied with a state a whit inferior to His, though He may carry the burden of the entire universe and we that of something smaller than even a particle of dust. Just as He ever feels light, though carrying the burden of the universe, so should we do though carrying the burden of a mere fraction of a particle of dust. We can easily attain such a state of mind if we reduce ourselves to a cipher. Mirabehn finds it impossible to become non-attached, but she is a good woman and, therefore, will one day approach that state. From here I think she would do well not to undertake the responsibility of a new paper. I had understood  about Sitla Sahay even without a letter from him, and that is why I wished to get one from him.
 I do not like to give to anyone the impression of my palm. Apart from that, it would be against jail rules to do so.  I  have, therefore, no choice in the matter. Kakasaheb could not even give his signature on his photograph. And I think that it is a good rule too. I
 
 have written a letterlibtech_339_footnoteto Purushottam; read it. Kanu, too, seems to have been upset a bit.
 Sunday Morning
 It was not at all satisfied by . . . ’slibtech_340_footnoteletter. I take it that you will see him personally, or probably you have already seen him. Discuss the matter with him and convey to me the impression you form. This case, too seems like . . . ’slibtech_341_footnote. The latter would not admit anything more than what had come out and produced an impression on Surendra, Chhaganlal and others that nothing wrong had happened. He did not succeed in producing that impression on me, and ultimately confessed having been guilty of a serious lapse. I would not be surprised if a similar thing should happen in . . . ’slibtech_342_footnotecase. His language gives the impression of a guilty person attacking an innocent. Look into this.
 Kusum has referred in her letter to the problem that has arisen about the offer of a job to her in Porbandar. Read my reply to her and guide her as you think best. My compliments to Jaya for having gone to the rest-houselibtech_343_footnotelibtech_344_footnote. Has she any relation there to whom I   can write? If Kakasaheb has not been able to win over the others, I think it would be best to let the Gita recitation go on as at present. The suggestion to complete the whole recitation in seven days by reciting some verses in the morning and some in the evening has not appealed to me. I will congratulate ourselves if we can improve upon   the present practice. I have noted that you took two and three-quarter hours to write your letter to me. The time taken in dispatching the letters must have been in addition to this. It is fine indeed if you can get all this time. If you can reduce it a little, however, you should certainly do so.
 I see that I made an amusing mistake about Vidyabehnlibtech_345_footnote. I will be more careful in future when several persons claim the same name.
 I think you did right in detaining Bhagwanjibhai’slibtech_346_footnoteManibehn. She will be welcome to the Ashram when the two reach a level so that they feel as brother and sister to each other. At present it is best that they remain away from each other.
 
 
 Bhansali has been testing you a good deal. I got two Godrej boxes. I have written to the dealers to inquire for more. You may use the donation by Soniramji for any cause that you think good. Inform him to what account you credit the sum. Take Nayan to a doctor, if necessary. She must be helped to get rid of her fever. Your solution concerning Kashinath seems all right.

But as I have told you, having 	been filled with distrust nothing but an accomplished result will 	reassure me.    
 The question of debts is incredibly simple. The Lahore resolution has an explicit condition about reference to an impartial tribunal.libtech_348_footnotelibtech_349_footnoteBut you have my assurance that no Congressman has ever enunciated the doctrine of total repudiation. What Congressmen, including myself, demand is that the nation’s representatives should have the right of having any portion of the so-called national debt, concessions and the like, being referred to an independent tribunal whose decision should be final and binding on both the parties. I feel  I am quite safe in saying this even for Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. Not to adopt the course above indicated would be disloyal to the nation as total repudiation without just cause would undoubtedly be disho- nourable.

The better part of the day is spent in spinning and carding, and the remaining time is taken up by correspondence. I can, therefore, do very little reading.

Let him, if he wishes, 	come again to attack her. She should resist if he comes to carry her 	away by force. She should not be alone at any time. You need not 	take the trouble to find out where the man has gone. It is enough 	that you have written about it to his people at home. Be vigilant 	lest he come stealthily and attack her again. If Mother is of the 	same mind as you in this matter, you will meet with no difficulty in 	following the course which you have adopted.  	I have already replied to the question regarding marriage. I see 	that it is not enough, and also that it is. I have only pointed out 	the Vedic ideal modified to suit modern times. If one is unable to 	follow it, one may modify it further as much as necessary. It is not 	for me to take measure of anyone’s inability in this regard. 
 I don’t mind your having written about Gangabehn. She is not intentionally partial to anyone. She may act in that manner through haste and lack of understanding. However, she is the fittest to be the women’s leader. For Kalavati and others, therefore, service lies in doing as she says, and they ought to be satisfied with that. They should not lose heart if people give no co-operation in the work regarding cleanliness, khadi, etc. In the long run people are bound to yield to love and their daily experience of other people’s conduct. Their presence by itself is enough in such places, provided they spend the whole day in work. And they must carry the takli and the spinning-wheel with them. They should also clean people’s latrines, etc.

  LETTER TO BHAGWANJI P. PANDYA 
 December 29, 1930
 CHI. BHAGWANJI,
 I have your letter. If you regarded the world as unreal, i.e., transitory, does it in any way go contrary to reason? Whatever is transitory is unreal because it does not endure for ever. And there is no question of being attached to what is transient. After all you will seldom find reason being exercised in matters of faith. If it could be grasped by reason it ceases to be a matter of faith. Faith might indeed one day lead to experience.

     LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI   Saturday 	Morning, December 27/30, 1930  CHI. 	NARANDAS,  	This time I got your packet only yesterday (Friday) after 2 o’clock. 	Because of Christmas there seems to have been some confusion in the 	post office. Here the officials seem quite careful 
 about my post. That is why you got my packet on Thursday.
 I got the piece of leather for sandals. I see Mahadev’s name in your list, but I did not find his letter. Perhaps there was a letter by Durga, but I do not find even that. I did feel that Ratilal would return. Where had he gone on his pleasure trip? Send with a visitor some time  a sample of the bread which you make there. We do not know when Giriraj will see reason. Go on doing your best. His heart is pure and he is filled with the spirit of self-sacrifice. One day, therefore, he is bound to see reason. “No one seeking to do good ever comes to harm.”libtech_356_footnote
 I understand everyone being nervous about my experience in diet, for I have not fully succeeded in it. But perhaps you may tell people that you know that I wake up in time and make necessary changes, and that my body responds to them. How can I give up a dharma which has come to me unsought? I was weighed yesterday and again seemed to have gained a pound and a half. I advisedly say “seemed” because on the previous occasion I was weighed after I had passed stool and this time before I had done so. The weight of the stool is not real gain in weight, but an unnecessary load. We may therefore count half a pound less; even then there has been a gain of one pound. But more important than the weight is the energy which I feel in my body. I feel no sign of weakness yet. I  eat  without  difficulty one bhakhari of the size which they make here, half a piece at one meal. The quantity of almonds which I eat comes to nearly two ounces. At present at any rate I feel that, if I can continue to digest this amount of food, I shall be able to keep up my strength.There is, therefore, no reason at all for worry. I am taking the utmost care, and, after all, even in this matter one needs to practise non-attachment. Who can say when that thing, more fragile than glass, will slip from one’s hand and break?
 I suppose you remember that you sent to Kantulibtech_357_footnotelibtech_358_footnotea diary made of handmade paper. He has now sent it for my  autograph.  The binding is very bad. Not only that there is no neatness about it, but he has so bound it that one cannot turn the pages at all. The art of binding books is easy to learn. It can be learnt in a very short time. Someone from among us should learn it. Or we should get  our binding done outside. I intend to get the diary re-bound in the press here. This is just by the way. I have mentioned the matter for future
 
 guidance. “Yoga is skill in work.”libtech_359_footnotelibtech_360_footnoteThis should be illustrated even in our least important activities. “Skill in work” lies also in not attempting what we cannot do. That is a case of action in inaction. Even refraining from something is a form of action. There is a saying in English borrowed from Persian. “He who knows that he knows not is wise.” I am prompted to say all this form my own unhappy experience. I observe that my spinning displays too much evidence of lack of skill and slackness despite all the care that I take. There may be a knot in the thread which I observe, but I let it go. At times the yarn is much too loose, but I let it remain. I have acquired no proficiency at all in joining broken thread. But I go on, all the same. What kind of yajna is this? Whether you call it carelessness, laxity or indifference, I observe every day this weakness in me in regard to this great yajna of spinning. I try every day to improve myself, and fail. But I keep hoping that one day I shall do well in my yajna. Even if I do not, I derive consolation from the verse : “After man lives, the enlightened one attains Me”libtech_361_footnotelibtech_362_footnote. It is a dangerous verse. One may use it to remain content with one’s lethargy. If a person pays attention to the meaning of every word in it, he will not fall, otherwise the verse can be the cause of much harm to one. I hear the bugle sounded every day at 5.30. It is now time for me to pace up and down.
 7.30, Tuesday
 If you send your packet by unregistered parcel, it may per- haps be delayed. Make inquiries, however, and do what you think best. This time I have been hard pressed for time to cope with the work. Ordinarily, I should be spinning at this hour. I get letters from Prabhavati from time to time. She should arrive in the Ashram any day now. Drop me a postcard as soon as she arrives. Most probably I shall get it. Read my letters to Kaka and Mirabehn. Today I stop here.

          CHI. 	MIRA,   LETTER TO MIRABEHN   December 	29/30, 1930 
  	Your letter. This time I must be very brief as the post came two 	days late. I start therefore with the translation of the 2nd verselibtech_364_footnote:  “In the early morning I worship Him who is beyond 	the reach of thought and speech yet by whose grace all speech is 	possible. I worship Him whom the Vedas describe as neti, neti 	(not this). Him they (the sages) have called God of gods, the 	unborn, the unfallen, the source of all.”  	I do not think that this calls for any explanation. The translation 	of the prefacelibtech_365_footnotelibtech_366_footnoteis proceeding apace. And as there was no Ashram post 	till Friday, I devoted the spare time to translating more paras. The 	result is that now there are only 10 more left. It will be time then 	to consider whether I can translate the Gita notes I am 	writing for the Ashram inmates. Just now the 100 rounds on the takli 	take up much time. But I am now showing an increase in speed. 	The speed on the Gandiv today was for me quite a record, i.e., 169 	rounds in  40  minutes. This means 255 in 60 minutes. The 	improvements are primarily responsible for this speed. If I continue 	to show improvement, I may have some more time for writing work. For 	I do not want to be greedy just now in the way of increase in the 	output. I shall stick to 300 on the wheel and 100 on the takli 	till I show a permanently marked increase in speed. I 	was quite sure you would get your foreign mail. Of 	my health which is excellent more in the general letter.  	Of your journalistic venture my opinion remains unaltered and is 	reinforced by the recent ordinance. But, as I have said, my opinion 	ought not to count one way or the other. Love.

  LETTER TO SHANTA S. PATEL 
 YERAVDA MANDIR,
 December 30, 1930
 CHI. SHANTA (SHANKARBHAI),
 I have your letter. Let me give my blessings just now for the new year. If you take a vow, do so after full deliberation and, having taken one be firm in keeping it. There is no need at all to undertake a seven days’ fast. It is likely to prove too much for you. It is enough if you fast on the birthday. Write to Shankarbhai and to me and tell us what vow you take. Take the vow in the presence of the girl friends living there. If possible, spend that day with Kusumbehn. It would be good before taking your vow to consult her. The difficulty which you point out about eating food without spices is only an excuse. One who is determined to eat unspiced food will certainly find out what to eat. Surely, there are no chillies in rotla, rice and buttermilk. [Is it not so?] One should be satisfied with a rotla, buttermilk and salt. Just as we eat and drink every day, we should also write the diary every day. Everything can be done if one has the will. Kamu has  not acknowledge my letter. Ask her whether she got it. What will her husband do at Ahmedabad?
 How can anyone say that there is no sin in killing bugs and fleas? Even in cutting up vegetables there is sin. However, we do commit some sins which we regard as unavoidable. When we smoke a place to protect ourselves against fleas, countless fleas are killed, but we feel helpless and do that all the same. However, we realize through such necessities that it is everyone’s duty to seek deliverance from bodily life.

 I am hard pressed for time just now and will not, therefore, write a long letter. You did well in giving me all the details. I do not wish
 Valji to know my opinion for the present. He may be told about it after he is released. I am confirmed in my opinion after reading Hari- ichchha’s letter. But what happened has happened. I have written to Hari-ichchha and explained to her how she can now make the best of an unfortunate event.libtech_367_footnoteShe will probably show you that letter if you have not seen it already. Ask her to show it to you.
 Your duty now is to cling to the job which you have accepted. You may think of something else to do only when circumstances arise in which you on your own leave it—for I have already observed your unsettled state of mind. I have faith in you despite that, for  you belong to Valji’s family and are sincere at heart. Such persons often become steady all at once.

  	I got four letters from you together. You should not forget that 	after all I am a prisoner. I get the letters when the Superin- 	tendent visits [me]. However, I continue my efforts to see that I 	get my letters immediately. When will you now go to the Ashram? I 	should like you to do so without delay. Your weakness must 	disappear. Don’t be eager to start wroking as soon as you reach 	the Ashram. Take milk, curds and furits in sufficient quantities. 	And you of  course  know  the benefits of open air. May God protect 	you in every way. Don’t worry about me. I had given up eating 	fresh fruits during the [Dandi] march itself. Nor do I feel any need 	for them.

 December 30, 1930
 CHI. PRABHUDAS,
 For want of time, only this much now. I have understood your problem with the takli. Do you have that problem with the bamboo one or the iron takli? Your faith will produce the right means even in material things for you. Hence, be patient. For the present, keep a watch on how much yarn the Magan spinning-wheel, in its existing form, gives. You should not have any problem when a devotee of the Magan spinning-wheel, i.e. Dhiru, is with you. If the takli has started giving 330 rounds of yarn per hour, why cannot the Magan-wheel give 3330 rounds per hour? Do not be alarmed by it. Initially, the takli gave only 30 rounds, now it easily gives ten times more. It is not impossible to produce on Magan wheel ten times more than the takli.

  	I get your letters. But I put off writing to you thinking that you 	will soon be in the Ashram. The more you stay on there, the more I 	feel worried. Why don’t you go away immediately and leave matters 	to take care of themselves? If Jayaprakash cannot go immediately, 	cannot he ask Harasubabu? I see that the longer you delay in going  	to the Ashram, the weaker you are becoming. What further can I now 	write even to Jayaprakash?  	What is your diet in your present condition of health? Who watches 	over you when you are in a swoon? What did Father tell you when you 	met him? I feel afraid even to ask you questions, for it may be a 	burden on your mind to think and reply to them. I dismiss my worries 	in the faith that God has been protecting you  and  will  continue 	to do so. I am quite well.  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	a photostat of the Gujarati : G.N. 3387

  A LETTER 
 
 
 YERAVDA MANDIR,
 December 31, 1930
 
  	It is possible that, from an academic  standpoint,  my 	interpretation of the phrase “   is of no value. But I think it is possible to interpret it 	to refer both to the self and the body. The self unclouded by 	ignorance knows neither birth nor death. However, one who believes 	that it dies must believe also that it is born again. For, nothing 	in this world suffers total destruction, not even physical body. It 	ceases to exist in one form and takes another. It goes on ever 	changing its form. After the body has been reduced to ashes it will 	not remain unchanged for ever in the form of atoms, for the atoms 	will change too. “When turned into ornaments, gold acquires 	different names and forms but it, ever remains gold.” Does this 	appeal to your reason in any way? As Vinoba’s style is very 	lively, he wins our interest. However, I have come to the conclusion 	that it is possible to put more than one interpretation on the words 	of the Gita and that all of them may be right. The central 	meaning would remain the same, and consistent with it there may be 	as many interpretations as one may wish, which together, like the 	numerous instruments in an orchestra, produce a beautiful symphony. 	As regards “is seated,” “sits” and “walks,” it is 	possible to draw out three distinct meaning. But the Gita is 	not a technical or scientific work composed with such precision. It 	abounds in repetitions, and there is  looseness  of expression too. 	This is not a defect, but it is there.  	These days I have been spinning on the takli at least 100 	rounds a day. I have given up the iron takli, after having 	tried very hard to spin well on it, and now I am back to the bamboo 	takli. I feel a little better with it. The speed has risen to 	75 per hour. It will go up still. After I have mastered the bamboo 	takli fully, I will return to the iron one.  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	Gujarati : C.W. 9317. Courtesy : Narandas Gandhi 
  LETTER TO BHAGWANJI P. PANDYA 
 [December 1930]libtech_370_footnote
 CHI. BHAGWANJI,
 You have construed the answers  to your	questions all right.
Even then I will add a little here.
 There is no end to conflicts of loyalties and to miseries. True desire for knowledge arises from this.
 The body can be said to be an abode of  punyalibtech_371_footnotelibtech_372_footnotein spite of its origin in papalibtech_373_footnotelibtech_374_footnotein so far as it is a means to realization of the atman.
 Knowledge means the realization of the self. One who has fully realized truth and non-violence is a perfect jnani in spite of being unlettered. This includes the answer to the question why we should obtain, etc.
 Non-attachment means absence of attachment. Attachment means the desire for a certain fruit. Attachment is implicit in wanting to climb the Himalayas. Climbing the Himalayas when it falls to one’s lot is doing it free of attachment.
 Yoga : Action performed without attachment. You write books but you do not crave for honour on that account, nor money nor praise from anyone. And since it has been your lot to render service through writing what you do is yoga.
 Generally I do not forbid asking questions. But the better and correct way is to solve such problems by oneself and to consult others in case of doubt. Unless we did it our discrimination will not develop.

I have gone through them. You have 	collected some useful statistics. But the title of the booklet is 	certainly not appropriate. It gives more and more reliable 	information about mill-cloth than about handloom cloth. After 	reading it, I felt that its title “How to Compete with Foreign 	Cloth” was too ambitious for the contents. You have not attempted 	a careful and detailed examination of hand-spinning. If you have 	realized that the master- key for the solution of the problem is 	hand-spinning, you should put     
 the truth in your own manner. If you are not convinced that it is so, you should not give it a place in your scheme yielding to the present atmosphere. I am becoming more and more convinced that, without hand-spinning, permanent boycott of foreign cloth will be impossible and that even hand-weaving cannot survive without it. If you share this view, you should explain it convincingly.
 Despite my partiality for hand-spinning, I don’t think that Talchekar’s contention is supported by facts. I have even had correspondence with him on the matter. His claim that handspun yarn is superior is not borne out by experience.  By carefully co-ordinating  a variety of factors, it may be possible to produce hand-spun yarn which would be stronger than mill-yarn, but the ordinary hand-spun yarn will always be weaker than mill-yarn. But what does it matter? As compared to hand-made bhakhari, the biscuit produced in  a factory with the help of dies will always be perfectly round in shape, smooth and attractive in appearance, and still the former will continue to be preferred to it. You have tried to convince the readers that mill- cloth and handloom cloth can supplement each other. It may be possible for some time to regulate things in that manner, but not permanently. The division of the booklet into sections is not accurate. Go through it again. I have nothing more to add.

  LETTER TO PREMABEHN KANTAK 
 January 1, 1931
 CHI. PREMA,
 This week’s post, too, seems to have been delayed. Meanwhile  I have started writing my letters.
 When the mind is occupied with nothing else, it starts thinking about the boys and girls. Probably the children don’t know why the 23rd of December is the shortest day. In trying to explain this, you will automatically explain to them some facts of geography and astronomy. Will you not try this? While explaining the reason for the 23rd being the shortest day, speak about the longest day and about the dates on which the day and the night are equal. Simultaneously, you may explain the change of seasons. While doing so tell them what Christmas means. In such discussions, both the parties should feel interested. This is also true about the indigenous tables and methods
 
 of oral calculation. These things, too, can be taught to children in an entertaining way. From this, I am generally led to think about botany.  I can a complete ignoramus in this field. You, perhaps, know something of the subject. If you do not, you can pick up some general knowledge without much trouble and impart it to children, and to me through letters. You can teach as you learn. But you should not feel this as a burden on your mind. It will be a boon to the children and to me if you make some such effort.
 I constantly feel that we don’t give to children all that we ought to. We should, therefore, give that at any rate which we can without much trouble to ourselves. Discuss this matter with Narandas.

 DEAR ANAND,
 I am glad you got all my letters. The problem you present is incredibly simple. With all your faults and limitations, you should unreservedly offer your and Vidya’s services to Father whenever he can accept them. only you must not interpose yourself between Father and Mother. If he wishes to retire for a while or longer you need not grieve. It is a natural and proper thing. It would be better ifhe took some social or humanitarian service. There need be no question of his approaching you or you him. Let him know that you are his for ever. The rest will be easy.
 As for your distraction the greater your faith in God and your losing yourself in your task, the greater will be the inner peace.
Love to you both.

 CHI. SHIVABHAI,
 I have your letter. I had also got your letter describing your difficulties at Pij, and replied to it. I hope you received my reply.
 You have done well in confessing everything. In my opinion, you should certainly not have physical relations with your wife. You should make some arrangement for her education so that her intellect may develop. If you are firm in your decision to have no physical relations with her, you should plainly tell her about that so that she may not remain discontented and may not go on hoping. You should also let her marry again if she wishes to do so.  You should not do that  if deep in your heart you crave for physical gratification. In any case, you should make it clear to her that you cannot satisfy her as long as the present movement lasts. Since she is poor, you should bear the burden of maintaining her. You should ask her to go and live in the Ashram. The remedy against attacks of lustful thoughts is to devote
 oneself to work. How can a person who is always absorbed in work ever get time for such thoughts?

  	I have read the two renderings you have sent me of the first verse 	of the morning prayer. For use and perhaps conveying the meaning, I 	prefer my rendering. If you find any obscurity anywhere, please tell 	me.  The second I sent you by the last mail.libtech_385_footnoteHere is the third.  	“In the early morning I bow to Him who is beyond darkness, who is 	like the sun, who is perfect, ancient, called Purushottam (the best 	among men) and in whom (through the veil of darkness) we fancy the 	whole universe as appearing even as (in darkness) we imagine a rope 	to be a snake.”libtech_386_footnote  	The idea is that the universe is not real in the sense of being 	permanent, it is neither a thing to be hankered after  nor  feared 	because it is supposed to be God’s creation. As a matter of fact, 	it is a creation of our imagination even as the snake in the rope 	is. The real universe like the real rope is there. We perceive 	either when the veil is lifted and darkness is gone—compare. “And 	with the morn, those angel faces smile which I have loved long since 	and lost awhile.” The three verses go together and I think are 	Shankar’s composition. You do know of Shankar, do you not? Five 	more days and I shall have finished the translation of the preface. 	My suggestion is that I continue to send you the verses and the 	bhajans with such comments as then occur to me. You should 	for your own satisfaction, with the help of whoever comes your way, 	translate the weekly notes on the Gita. The plan I am now 	following is well thought out, i.e., that of looking through the 	translation of the whole Gita in the light of my rendering 	and translating the notes. The attempt may lead to     
 something good of which we have no knowledge today. If I begin the translation of the weekly notes, the above plan may fall through altogether. It would not be right. Of my food experiment, you will learn everything from Narandas. The assurance, that the moment I find it necessary I shall revart to milk, should remove all cause for anxiety.
 By the travelling wheel I suppose, you mean the box wheel of the Pratishthan type. Whatever it is, your speed is certainly quite good. Let the Gandiv disappear from your mind unless Kaka has something to show. libtech_387_footnote

If the 	experiment of starching yarn succeeds, that will undoubtedly help us 	very much.  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	a photostat of the Gujarati: G.N. 6224     LETTER TO VASUMATI PANDIT   YERAVDA MANDIR,  Sunday 	Morning, January 4, 1931  CHI. 	VASUMATI,  	I am writing this immediately after morning prayers. Taste 	ultimately is a matter of the palate and the mind. Our vow is that 	we will not gratify the craving of the palate. The latter will 	always feel and recognize the taste of every food. But to gratify 	the craving of the palate means to eat food which it likes and avoid 	food which it dislikes. We may certainly eat whatever food the body 	requires, but only at the time when and in the quantity which the 	body requires, and it does not matter then if it gives us pleasure. 	When Mahavir has conquered the palate, he will gladly accept what is 	for his good. Ordinarily, a man does not care for his spiritual good 	and does what will give him pleasure for the time being even if that 	is likely to harm him spiritually. Hence the attitude, that one 	should accept whatever is offered to one at any time, is not the 	right one for a spiritual seeker. We do not know from experience how 	a person who has attained perfection acts, and need not concern 	ourselves with the question. Let us wait till we have attained 	perfection. The question then will not arise at all. It this does 	not answer all your question, ask me again.  	It is a good sign that we notice even our small defects. We ought to 	know whether we are striving to overcome them. If I see that I have 	pride in me and if I am a spiritual seeker, I am bound to make an 	effort to get rid of it. I shall not feel easy in mind till I have 	got rid of it. If there is a snake in the house, we shall not feel 	easy in mind till we have caught and removed it. If asked, we can 	certainly say whether 
 we are trying to remove it. This is also true about snakes and other such poisonous creatures in our hearts. I am glad that your ear is now all right.

 MAD. RAIHANA,
 A girl whose brother is mad is hardly likely to be wise ! I have written a letter to Dahyabhai.libtech_393_footnote
 I am glad that you are improving, but do you think you will improve so much that you can shoulder the burden of leadership of the Kadi division? If you do indeed, we shall have to present an address to the doctor sister. A person with a grey beard, I am afraid, cannot escape suffering. A white beard is bound to have some effect at any rate. But all’s well that ends well. I am not surprised to hear about Father’s exploits. Isn’t he also a branch of the same tree?

  LETTER TO KASHINATH TRIVEDI 
 January 4, 1931
 CHI. KASHINATH,
 Your long letters are no trouble to me to read. Narandas has also written to me about you. He says that you refused to show him your diary. If this is true, your action was not right. Narandas is an extremely straightforward man and always does what he thinks right. You can tell him everything. Have a quiet talk with him and, if there has been any misunderstanding, remove it. If you wish to live in the Ashram and are not opposed to any of its rules, Narandas on his part will certainly take you back. He has even written to me to say so.
Whether or not you live in the Ashram, you can keep up
 
 
 connection with it for other purposes. You  can  ask  for  papers relating to your work. Difference of opinion should  not mean personal enmity.
 If you think it necessary to engage a lawyer to defend your brother-in-law, you may do so. If you have sufficient courage,  however, do without a lawyer. Your actions seem all right. I did not understand your reason for refusing to sign the summons. But that is  a minor matter. I have written to Shanta, Kalavati, Raghavdas and Banarsidas. Read those letters. You had asked the same, or a similar, question about art in your previous letter.  I have already replied to it.libtech_395_footnoteDid you get that letter? I got the booklet on vows. I did not see any letter from Ramnarayan.  There was one from Haribhaulibtech_396_footnotelibtech_397_footnote, and I have replied to him. Convey my blessings to all.
 Mother should take only so much of milk as leaves her hungry. If, however, she cannot remain hungry and begs repeatedly for something to eat, you may give  her a khakharalibtech_398_footnotelibtech_399_footnote.  If she can continue milk and light diet for some time longer still, she will become all right. You should do everything with the utmost patience. Don’t feel  unhappy about anything. “What God, World Teacher and Master has willed for the day, it is futile to grieve over. Without His will we cannot move a blade of grass. If we do fuss about things, what is left over is a legacy of sorrows.”libtech_400_footnote

            CHI. 	DURGA,   LETTER TO DURGA DESAI   YERAVDA MANDIR,  January 	4, 1931 
  	It is 7 o’clock on Sunday morning just now. It is extre- mely 	cold. The hands shake, but I cannot give myself a holiday from 	writing. After I have finished this letter. I will start the 	spinning yajna. You have done well in starting the experiment 	of eating oranges. While it continues, write to me regularly. Tell 	me in detail the effect       
 which it has. Weigh yourself from time to time. Enemas will also have to be continued. I suppose you take sun-baths too. If you have enough strength, you should slowly walk about a little.
Now for Mahadev :
 I don’t hope at all to leave this place with any new discovery about the spinning-wheel. Along with enthusiasm, one must have knowledge of the craft, too, which I don’t possess.  I shall be satisfied if I can make sufficient changes which will enable me to increase my speed. I do feel that one can acquire good speed despite one’s age. If, however, the nerves of my hands have become weak, the speed will not increase. But I do make changes from time to time to see if they help me to increase my speed. I see that I displayed great wisdom in not going to England despite Sastri’s view that I should go. Really speaking, it required no wisdom to come to that decision. My heart simply did not consent, however much I tried to persuade myself. The reins are held by that Master of the Play. Why, then, need we worry at all? On the contrary, we should daily leave the reins more and more in His hands and strengthen His hands.
 If any trace of fissure is noticed, [he] should immediately take steps to cure it. And [he] should not give up milk or ghee. It is our duty to obtain whatever facilities we can get and which are essential for our health. If we clearly see that we hold the body as a trust,  that  it is not our own, we shall think no more about the problem. It is good that Devdas has been working at Sanskrit to increase his proficiency in it. Mahadev will be able to help him in that. My blessings to all prisoners. Pyarelal spins daily 375 rounds on the spinning-wheel and 100 on the takli, and the work takes up the whole of the morning and an hour and a half in the afternoon.

Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	a photostat of the Gujarati: G.N. 3751     LETTER TO PREMABEHN KANTAK   January 	5, 1931  CHI. 	PREMA,  	I have your letter. In my opinion, the view of Vivekananda and 	Dhurandhar is one-sided. One should feel in the heart what one says. 	Surdas, Tulsidas and other bhaktas have described themselves 	as cunnings, lustful, etc. In doing so, they were not merely using 	the 
 language of modesty, but speaking from the heart. The truth is that we feel both ways. In an enlightened state, we know ourselves to be Brahman, but in the ignorant state we feel meek and humble before that Merciful One. He who does not feel so but knows himself as the perfect Brahman may not sing bhajans praying for God’s mercy. You will not come across one such person in millions. To realize one’s smallness is the beginning of being great. The drop of sea-water which has become separated from the sea would dry  up  if  it thought that it was still the sea. If it admitted to itself that it was no more than a drop, it would flow towards the sea, merge in it and become one with it.
 “Culture” means refinement of feelings and “education” means knowledge of   literature.  Education  is  a  means  and culture is the end. The latter is possible even without education. For instance,  if a child is brought up in a truly cultured family, it will unconsciously imbibe culture from its environment. In our country at any rate, present-day education and culture have no connection with each  other. If the educated still retain some culture, that is in spite of their education. This fact shows that the roots of our culture are deep.
 My blessings and compliments to Prasannabehn. I should like her to draw her husband also to the Ashram.
 You seem to be running a competition in the opposite direction with Narandas with regard to weight. It is good. You can afford to put on some more weight, and Narandas to lose some.
I like the translation of Gitabodh which Dhurandhar is making.

 APPENDIX I
 VICEROY'S LETTER TO SIR T. B. SAPRUlibtech_405_footnote
 VICEREGAL LODGE,
 SIMLA,
 August 28, 1930
 DEAR SIR TEJ BAHADUR,
 I have to thank you for informing me of the results of the conversations held by Mr. Jayakar and yourself with the Congress leaders now in prison and for sending me copies of their joint letter of the 15th August and of your reply thereto. I should wish you and Mr. Jayakar both to know how great has been my appreciation of the spirit in which you have pursued your self-imposed public-spirited task of endeavouring to assist in the restoration of normal conditions in India. It is worth recalling the conditions under which you entered upon your undertaking. In my letter of 16th July I assured you that it was the earnest desire of myself, my Government and    I had no doubt also of His Majesty's Government, to do everything we could to assist the people of India to obtain as large degree of management of their own affairs as could be shown to be consistent with the making of provision for those matters in regard to which they were not at present in a position to assumeresponsibility. It would be among the functions of the Conference to examine in the light of all the material available what those matters might be and what provision might be made for them. I had previously made two other points plain in my speech to the Legislature on the 9th July. The first is that those attending the Conference would have the unfettered right of examining the whole constitutional problem in all its bearing. Secondly, that any agreement at which the Conference was able to arrive would form the basis of the proposals which His Majesty's Government would later submit to Parliament. I fear as you will no doubt recognize that the task you had voluntarily undertaken has not been assisted by the letter you have received from the Congress leaders. In view both of the general tone by which that letter is inspired and of its contents, as also of its blank refusal to recognize the grave injury to which the country has been subjected by the Congress policy, not the least in the economic field, I do not think any useful purpose would be served by my attempting to deal in detail with the suggestions there made and I must frankly say I regard discussion on the basis of the proposals contained in the letter as impossible. I hope if you desire to see the Congress leaders again you will make this plain.
 There is one further comment I must make upon the last paragraph of your reply to them dated 16th August. When we discussed these matters, I said if the Civil
 
 
 Disobedience Movement was in fact abandoned, I should not desire to continue the Ordinances (apart from those connected with the Lahore Conspiracy Case and Chittagong) necessitated by the situation which EX-HYPOTHESI would no longer exist. But I was careful to make it plain that I was unable to give any assurance, if and when the Civil Disobedience Movement ceases, that local Governments would find it possible to release all persons convicted or under trial for offences in connection with the movement not involving violence, and that while I should wish to see a generous policy pursued in the matter, the utmost that I could promise would be to [ask] all the local Governments to consider with sympathy all the cases individually on their merits.
 Upon the point of your reference to the representation of the Congress at the Conference in the event of their abandoning the Civil Disobedience Movement and desiring to attend, my recollection is you explained that the demand of the Congress was not for predominant, in the sense of majority, representation at the Conference and that I expressed the view that I should anticipate little difficulty in recommending to His Majesty's Government to secure that the Congress should be adequately represented. I added that if events so developed, I should be ready to receive a panel of names from the leaders of the Congress Party of those whom they would regard as suitable representatives. I feel that you and Mr. Jayakar would desire to be clearly informed of the position of myself and my Government as it may be desirable that the letters should be published at an early date in order that the public may be fullyinformed of the circumstances,in which your efforts have failed to produce the result you hoped and they so certain]y deserved.

  NOTES OF 	CONVERSATIONS WITH VICEROYlibtech_406_footnote   On 		the constitutional 		question, the position 		would be as stated 		in the 		four fundamental points in para 2 of the Viceroy's letter to us of 28th August.  With 		reference to 		the question 		whether Mr. Gandhi 		would be 		allowed to 		raise at 		the Round 		Table Conference the 		question of 		India's right to 		secede from 		the Empire at 		will, the 		position was 		as follows: 		“As the Viceroy 		has stated 		in his 		said letter 		to us, 		the Conference was 		a free 		conference. Therefore, anyone could raise any 		points he 		liked, but 		the Viceroy thought it 		would be 		very unwise 		for Mr. Gandhi 		to raise 		this question now. 		If, however, he 		faced the Government 		of India 		with such a question, the Viceroy would say the Government were not prepared to treat it as an     
 open question. If, in spite of this, Mr. Gandhi desired to raise the question, the Government would inform the Secretary of State of his intention to do so at the Round Table Conference.”
  As 	regards the 	right to 	raise the 	question at 	the Round Table 	Conference of India's 	liability to 	certain financial 	burdens and to get them 	examined by an independent 	Tribunal, the position 	was that 	the Viceroy 	could not entertain 	any proposition 	amounting to 	total repudiation 	of all 	debts, but 	it would 	be open 	to anyone 	to raise, 	at the 	Round Table Conference, 	any question 	as to any 	financial liability 	of India 	and to 	call for 	its examination.  As 	regards the 	granting of 	relief against the 	Salt Act, the position of 	the Viceroy 	was that (1) 	the Salt Tax was going to 	be provincialized if the recommendation 	of the 	Simon Commission in 	that behalf was 	accepted, and 	(2) there has 	been already great loss 	of revenue 	and therefore 	the Government 	would not like 	to forgo 	this source, but if the Legislature was persuaded to repeal the Salt 	Act and if any proposal 	was put forward to make good the loss of revenue occasioned by such 	repeal, the Viceroy and 	his Government would 	consider the question 	on its merits. 	It was not, 	however, possible for 	the Viceroy to 	condone open 	breaches of 	the Salt Act so 	long as 	it was law. When goodwill and peace were restored and, if Indian 	leaders desired to discuss 	with H. 	E. the Viceroy 	and his Government 	how best economic relief couldbe given 	to the 	poorer classes on his 	behalf, the 	Viceroy would 	be glad to call a small 	conference of Indian leaders.  With 	reference to picketing, 	the position 	was that 	if picketing 	amounted to nuisance 	to any 	class of people 	or was 	coupled with 	molestation or 	intimidation or 	the use of 	force, the 	Viceroy reserved 	to the 	Government the 	right of 	taking such 	action as 	the law allowed 	or taking 	of such 	legal powers as might 	be necessary 	to meet 	any emergency that might 	arise. Subject 	to the above when  peace  was 	established the 	Ordinance against 	picketing would be withdrawn.  With 	regard to the 	re-employment of 	the officers who 	resigned or 	had been dismissed 	during the Civil 	Disobedience campaign, the 	position was 	that this matter was 	primarily a 	question for 	the discretion of 	local Governments. 	Subject however to there 	being vacancies and 	as long 	as it did 	not involve dismissing 	men who had 	proved loyal, the 	local Government 	would be 	expected to 	re-employ men 	who had thrown 	up their 	appointments in a 	fit of 	excitement or 	who had been swept 	off their 	feet.  As 	for the restoration 	of printing 	presses confiscated under 	the Press Ordinance, there would be no difficulty.  As 	regards the 	restoration of 	fines and 	properties confiscated 	under the 	Revenue Law, that required closer definition. As to the properties confiscated or sold 
 
 under such law, there might be the rights of third parties involved. As to refunding fines, there were difficulties. In short, all that the Viceroy could say was that the local Government would exercise their discretion with justice and take all the circumstances into consideration and try to be as accommodating as they could.
  As 	to the release 	of prisoners, 	the Viceroy 	had already 	explained his views 	in his letter 	to us dated 	July 28th.

 APPENDIX III
 NOTE FROM NEHRUSlibtech_407_footnote
 NAINI CENTRAL PRISON,
 August 31, 1930
 We have had further interviews with Mr. M. R. Jayakar and Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru yesterday and today, and have had the advantage of long talks with them. They have given us a copy of the letter, dated August 23, addressed to them by His Excellency Lord Irwin. In this letter, it is stated clearly that Lord Irwin regards discussion on the basis of the proposals contained in our joint letter of August 15 to Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru and Mr. Jayakar as impossible, andunder the circumstances, he rightly concludes their efforts have failed to produce any result. This joint letter, as you know, was written after a full consideration by the signatories to it, and represented the utmost they were prepared to go in their individual capacities. We stated there that no solution would be satisfactory unless it fulfilled certain vital conditions, and that a satisfactory declaration to that effect was made by the British Government. If such a declaration was made, we would be prepared to recommend to the Working Committee the advisability of calling off Civil Disobedience, provided simultaneously certain steps indicated in our letter were taken by the British Government in India.
 It was only after a satisfactory settlement of all these preliminaries, that the question of the composition of the proposed London Conference and of the Congress being represented at it could be decided. Lord Irwin, in his letter, considers even a discussion on the basis of these proposals as impossible. Under the circumstances, there is or can be no common ground between us. Quite apart from the contents, the tone of the letter and the recent activities of the British Government in India clearly indicate that the Government has no desire for peace. The proclamation of the Working Committee as an illegal body in the Delhi Province soon after a meeting of   it was announced to be held there, and the subsequent arrest of most of its members can have that meaning and no other. We have no complaint against these or other arrests or other activities of the Government, 'uncivilized' and 'barbarous' as we
 
 consider some of these to be. We welcome them. But, we feel, we are justified in pointing out that a desire for peace and an aggressive attack on the very body, which is capable of giving peace and with which it is sought to treat, do not go well together. The proscription of the Working Committee all over India and the attempt to prevent its meetings must necessarily mean that the national struggle must go on, whatever the consequences, and that there will be no possibility of peace, for those who may have some authority to represent the people of India will be spread out in British prisons all over India.
 Lord Irwin's letter and the action taken by the British Government make it plain that the efforts of Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru and Mr. Jayakar have been in vain. Indeed, the letter and some of the explanations that had been given to us take us back, in some respects, even from the position that was previously taken. In view of the great HIATUS that exists between our position and Lord Irwin's, it is hardly necessary  to go into details, but we should like to point out to you certain aspects of his letter. The first part of the letter is practically a repetition of his speech to the Legislative Assembly and of the phrases used in his letter dated July 16, addressed to Mr. Jayakar and Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru. As we pointed out in our joint letter, this phraseology is too vague for us to assess its value. It may be made to mean anything or nothing. In our joint letter, we have made it clear that a complete National Government responsible to the people of India, including control over the DefenceForces and economic control, must be recognized as India's immediate demand. There is no question of what are usually called safeguards or any delay. Adjustments there necessarily must be for the transference of power and in regard to these we stated that they were to be determined by India's chosen representatives.
 As regards India's right of secession at will from the British Empire and her right to refer British claims and concessions to an independent tribunal all that we are told is that the Conference will be a free conference and any point can be raised there. This is no advance on the previous statement made. We are further told, however, that if the British Government in India were definitely faced with the possibility of the former question being raised, Lord Irwin would say they were not to treat it as an open question. All they could do was to inform the Secretary of State of our intention to raise the question at the Conference.
 As regards the other proposition, we are told that Lord Irwin could only entertain the idea of a few individual financial transactions being subjected for scrutiny. While such scrutiny may take place in individual cases, its scope will have to extend to the whole field of British claims including, as we have stated, the so-called Public Debt of India. We consider both these questions as  of  vital importance and previous agreement in our joint letter seems to us essential.
 Lord Irwin's reference to the release of prisoners is very restricted and unsatisfactory. He is unable to give an assurance that all of the non-violent civil disobedience prisoners even will be discharged. All he proposes to do is to leave the matter in the hands of the Local Governments. We are not prepared to trust in such a
 matter to the generosity or sympathy of Local Governments or local officials but, apart from this, there is no reference in Lord Irwin's letter to other non-violent prisoners. There are a large number of Congressmen and others who were sent to prison for political offences prior to the Civil Disobedience Movement. We might mention in this connection the Meerut Case prisoners who have already spent a year and a half as under-trials. We have made it clear in our joint letter that all these persons should be released.
 Regarding the Bengal and the Lahore Case Ordinances we feel no exception should be made in their favour as suggested by Lord Irwin. We have not claimed release for those political prisoners who may have been guilty of violence not because we would not welcome their release but because we felt that as our movement was strictly non-violent,  we would not confuse the issue. But, the least we can do is  to press for ordinary trial for these fellow-countrymen of ours and not by an extraordinary court constituted by an Ordinance which denies them the right of appeal and the ordinary privilege of accused.
 Amazing events including the brutal assaults that have occurred even in open court during the so-called trial make it imperative that the ordinary procedureshould be followed. We understand that some of the accused in protest against the treatment accorded to them have been on hunger-strike for a long period and are now at death's door. The Bengal Ordinance, we understand, has been replaced by an Act of the Bengal Council. We consider this Ordinance and any Act passed on it most objectionable, and the fact that an unrepresentative body like the present Bengal Council has passed it does not make it any the better.
 As regards the further picketing of foreign cloth and liquor shops, we are told, Lord Irwin is agreeable to the withdrawal of the Picketing Ordinance, but he states that if he thinks it necessary, he will take fresh legal powers to combat picketing. Thus, he informs us that he might re-enact the Ordinance or do something in Simla to it whenever he considers it necessary. The reply regarding the Salt Act and certain other matters referred to in our joint letter is also wholly unsatisfactory. We need not deal with it at any length here as you are an acknowledged expert on salt. We would only say we see no reason to modify our previous position as regards these matters.
 Thus Lord Irwin has declined to agree to all the major propositions and many of the minor ones laid down in our joint letter. The difference in his outlook and ours is very great, indeed fundamental. We hope you will show this note to Mrs. Sarojini Naidu, Mr. Vallabhbhai Patel, Mr. Jairamdas Doulatram and in consultation with them give your reply to Mr. Jayakar and Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru. We feel that the publication   of the correspondence must no longer be delayed, and we are not justified in keeping
 the public in the dark. Even apart from the question of publication, we are requesting Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru and Mr. Jayakar to send copies of all correspondence and relevant papers to Chaudhri Khaliq Usman, the Acting President of  the  Indian National Congress. We feel we ought to take no steps without immediate information being sent to the Working Committee, which happens to be functioning.
