 To me your question itself seems to spring from morbidity. The instances from British life which I mentioned had no connection with the point whether or not the people there live a luxurious life; it is all a matter of custom. When a person living in a hot country goes to a cold country, he has to exercise greater care to protect himself against the cold than the residents of the country need do; in the same way I believe it very necessary for Indian youths to exercise special care [when they go to England]. It was not my intention to suggest that all or most young men in England remain perfectly pure; all that  I wished to suggest was that some of the freedom which people take in England may be harmless. If we take that freedom, we would sully our purity. The moral laxity which we find among the young in England is the effect, not of the limited freedom which I have described, but of other factors which are easy to appreciate. A person who keeps away from drinks because he understands the evil of drinking is not a coward but a wise man, that is, a man of discrimination. Evil desires spring from inner darkness, from lack of  discrimination  and ignorance of the true end of human life. The suggestions which I have made for being able to observe brahmacharya are not copy-book maxims or the result of ingenious guesswork; they represent my own experience, and that of others too, over a long period of time. I would, therefore, advise you not to dismiss Chapter XIX  of  An Autobiography without trying to understand it properly. I know  lustful persons who are vegetarians on principle, who wear only a khadi shirt and cap and live an outwardly simple life but dwell in their minds on pleasures and luxuries, and I also know real brahmacharis who, following the practice in their country, eat meat and have always dressed themselves in coat and trousers. The main thing is to  be simple in one’s thoughts. If a man harbours the violence of meat- eating in his thoughts and his mind dwells on the pleasures of a grand palace, do not believe, merely because his body lives on fruits and is covered merely with a bit of blanket, that he lives or can live a blameless life. Anyone who wants to live a life untroubled by impure desires or to acquire such purity must always remain vigilant.
You seem to confuse the caution of a vigilant person with
 cowardice. If so, you are in the grip of a terrible error. Please wake up.
 A CAUTION
 A newspaper correspondent informs me from Aden that a woman known by the name of Benibai has arrived there and has been cheating credulous people by posing as my daughter. A similar thing had happened in Rangoon and Mombasa, and it seems this same woman had gone to those places. I cautioned people some time ago that I have no daughter, and that I have not authorized anyone to collect money in my name.

   KHADI IN KATHIAWAR  
 The reader will find in this issue nearly the whole of the Report sent in by Shri Lakshmidas after inspecting the work of the three khadi centres in Kathiawar.
 The Khadi Karyalaya in Amreli has been taken over by the Kathiawar Political Conference. I intend to publish its accounts shortly in Navajivan. Just now I only wish to draw attention to Shri Lakshmidas’s Report.
 The reader will observe that it is only in place where famine conditions prevail that khadi is produced by paying spinners. We shall not discuss at the moment whether the khadi so produced turns out to be cheaper or dearer [than that manufactured from yarn spun by amateurs]. It will suffice to admit at present that, though the quality of khadi is very much better than what it used to be, it will not prove as strong as mill khadi of the same count. Even so, no one should feel any doubt, after reading this Report that residents of Kathiawar should always prefer khadi produced in Kathiawar. If what is stated in the Report is true, people who wear such khadi are helping victims of famine. It is very much better to make them self-supporting than to help them with free doles. There can be no argument about this. Moreover, everyone cannot afford to contribute money for free doles, but certainly every person of ordinary means can afford to help by purchasing khadi, which costs more than other cloth, and making up for the loss by economizing in other matters.
 I, therefore, hope that the people of Kathiawar will welcome the present sale-tour of Abbas Saheb among them. From a report which I have received from Wadhwan, I see that he was enthusiastically welcomed by the residents of the place, and that there was no one who did not show him due respect. I hope that, as his tour progresses, he
 will get more and more encouragement.
 The suggestion to khadi workers in Lakshmidas’s Report deserves attention. Water flows into the public trough only in proportion to the quantity in the well. Workers will be able to inspire faith in others only in the measure that they themselves have it, and the strength which they lack in themselves they will not be able to draw from others. If the women who spin also learn carding, they will earn twice as much and the public will get better yarn. They can earn money by carding, which they do not at present. As long as the workers themselves are not proficient in carding, they cannot inspire enthusiasm for carding among the women who spin, let alone being able to teach them the art.
 The suggestion about testing the strength of yarn deserves the same attention as that about carding. This is necessary to ensure the strength of the yarn. If the quality of yarn is carefully maintained, khadi will become cheaper. That is, with the same rates of payment as at present, there will be improvement in regard to quality and price. In big factories, they are able to increase the profits, without raising the prices of the products, merely by skilful management. In our innumerable factories—for every hut is a spinning-mill—let the workers increase their earnings through improved efficiency and also reduce the burden on the people. In those big factories, what with the innumerable financial manipulations and changes in the exchange- rate which they resort to and which result in crores of rupees changing hands, the workers are always exploited. In our factories, improved efficiency will not mean large sums changing hands in this manner but will generate, rather, a spirit of equality and promote the welfare of the workers in corresponding measure. These happy results depend on the spirit of self-sacrifice, efficiency, perseverance, humility and energy which khadi workers may be able to display.
 Let nobody draw the conclusion from my observations or Shri Lakshmidas’s Report that the work done so far has been wasted or that it was not done properly. What we both mean is that our work is so well organized now that we are in a position to take a step forward. It is our duty to see that, with experience, our work  goes  on  improving. There is no doubt that, relatively speaking, khadi has made excellent progress. Now the consumers need to satisfy themselves only whether
 khadi 	workers are honest 	and hard-working; the money which they pay for khadi goes into the pockets 
 of the poor;
 the 	women who 	spin are 	really helped;  it 	is a fact that they 	would not be 	able to 	make both ends meet if 	they did 	not get spinning-work; and it is a fact that they have no other more remunerative work. 
 If the replies to these questions are in the affirmative, the people of Kathiawar should, without considering whether khadi is cheap or costly, see that the khadi produced in Kathiawar does not remain unsold.

   ABOUT MILL-WORKERS  
 The movement among the mill-workers in Ahmedabad against the drink-evil is proceeding very well at present. All people may not know that in America, where only a few years ago every worker used to drink, they have stopped drinking for some years now. Their paper has published the following information.
 Millions of rail-road workers have, in their Union meetings, welcomed prohibition and recounted their experience that drinking turns good citizens and workers into bad ones and good husbands into cruel ones. They have also declared that, had the workers continued to drink, the hundreds of workers’ banks which have been formed and in which millions of their dollars are deposited would never have come into existence. The Secretary of their Union has stated that during the last four years Labour Unions in America have been rapidly throwing up honest and able leaders.
 If the mill-workers in Ahmedabad also realize  the  sin  of drinking and understand that liquor is a poison and give it up, one can easily imagine the improvement in their condition which will follow.

         DEAR 	FRIEND,    LETTER TO ROMAIN ROLLAND      May 	22, 1926 
 I 	have before me a translation by Mira of your kind and 
 touching letter of 17th February last. I have been anticipating your permission to make cautious use of portions of that letter without mentioning your name.
 I am glad you think with me that the proper course for me was not to come to Europe this year.
 With reference to India being heard in Europe, I hold the view that India will not be heard in Europe or the West Until she has suffered more, and on a more extensive scale than hitherto. Hers will be a voice in the wilderness at the present moment. And I feel even the hired, and in some cases bribed, journalists of Europe will shudder to take as gospel truth all the manifest and one-sided exaggerations and falsehoods circulated by the B.G.libtech_214_footnoteif India is not represented. I feel too that this non-violent battle does not need the same kind of propaganda that a battle based on violence would. Thirdly there is the practical difficulty that you mention of finding one who can be at all heard. The only person I have in view for the moment is Andrews, since the Poetlibtech_215_footnoteis unavailable. Andrews will certainly be heard in the quarters that matter.
 I hope you are keeping well and that God will permit you to hold out till the battle is fairly over in India.
 Yours sincerely,
 M. K. GANDHI

            DEAR 	FRIEND,    A LETTER       THE 	ASHRAM, SABARMATI,  May 	3, 1926 
  	I have had your letter for a long time with me. But I have not been 	able to reach your letter earlier.  	Your letter of the 29th ultimo puts me in mind that I must now 	hasten to reply to you. I am afraid that the Ashram life will not 	suit you. It is all hard work commencing with cleaning closet 	buckets and ending with agriculture, cooking, etc. There is little 	time left  for literary pursuits. From all I can understand of your 	life, it appears to     
 me that you would hardly be able to stand the life and atmosphere at the Ashram. I therefore suggest to you that if you still feel that you should come and stay at the Ashram, you may pay a preliminary visit to see things for yourself and then decide.
 There is another difficulty also. At the present moment the Ashram is over-crowded. I have no room, therefore, to spare. I could not therefore give you even the privacy that you perhaps want and I would like to proivde. If in spite of. libtech_216_footnote

  	I have your letter as also Krishnabai’s. I understand the position 	and appreciate it. I quite agree with you and Krishnabai that her 	talent for painting should be developed. I therefore quite 	understand her desire to stay with you and go on with her painting 	work. I would like to have some photographic specimens of her work.  	I am not writing to her separately.

SADANAND    THE 	ASHRAM, SABARMATI,  May 	3, 1926  MY 	DEAR SADANAND,  	So you have got your agency after all. Let your correspondent come 	like the Associated Press Correspondent and pick up what infor- 	mation he can. As there is so little for me to communicate, what can 	poor Mahadev or Subbiah or Pyarelal give you? I could certainly send 	you wires about khaddar from day to day but that will be just the    
 thing to kill your agency and you will soon ask me to stop sending those wires. Happily the khaddar movement does not depend so much on dissemination of news about it as on organized distribution of spinning-wheels and collection of yarn and manufacture and sale of khaddar.
 I do not know what difficulties there are in the way of your correspondent receiving copies of Young India on  Wednesday evening. There should be no difficulty. However, I shall see Swami and let you know.
I hope that in your office everybody is clad in khaddar.
 Yours sincerely,

            DEAR 	FRIEND,    LETTER TO R. D. SUBRAMANIAM    THE 	ASHRAM, SABARMATI,  May 	3, 1926 
  	I have your postcard. It is not the quantity of time that you will 	give to the spinning that counts. It is the feeling behind that you 	would get your Young India by your labour that appealed to 	me. I therefore propose to send you Young India as soon as 	you have furnished 50,000 yards.  	The yarn would still be national property because it was my 	intention to give the yarn to the Spinners’ Association or the 	Satyagraha Ashram and take from them subscription on your behalf for 	Young India. There is no occasion for you, therefore, to feel 	conscience pricks because you will be getting after so many hours of 	labour Young India for one year.  Yours 	sincerely,  SJT. 	R.  D.

   LETTER TO UDIT MISHRA  
 ASHRAM, SABARMATI,
 Tuesday, May 4, 1926
 BHAI UDIT MISHRAJI,
 I got your letter several months ago, but I could not reply to it immediately. We may not despise in our heart persons whom  we regard as bad men, but we need not seek their acquaintance either, unless there is some reason. That is, we may have contact with them only if we get an opportunity to do them good. It is more difficult to become a guardian of children than of grown-up students. When a father leaves his children to our care, we assume a great responsibility. It is, therefore, necessary that we love the children as much as their father does. But a father’s love is apt to be unthinking attachment, whereas a guardian’s should be completely unselfish and pure. Moreover, since children are quick to imitate what others do,  we  should show in our conduct all those virtues which we want them to cultivate. From this point of view, a guardian should particularly observe brahmacharya, follow truth and non-violence and display fearlessness, courage, magnanimity, humility and so on.

   LETTER TO PARAMANAND K. KAPADIA  
 Wednesday [May 5, 1926]libtech_217_footnote
 BHAISHREE PARAMANAND,
 I have read all your letters carefully. I shall try to deal with some of your questions in Navajivan. I want to write much more but I have to control myself.
      BHAISHREE 	PARAMANAND 	KUNVERJI 	BHAVNAGAR  From 	the Gujarati original: G.N. 11586  Vandemataram 	from  MOHANDAS 	GANDHI 
      NOTES    PROHIBITION 	AND MADRAS 	GOVERNMENT  	Sjt. C. Rajagopalachari has unearthed a Government order which is 	simplicity itself but which conveys a world of meaning. In a note 	accompanying a copy of the order Sjt. Rajagopalachari writes to the 	press :  Among 	the many post-Reform additions to our recurring charges are the new 	Health Officers and their staff. They are expected to educate the 	people about cholera, malaria, etc. Some 	of the members of the staff seem to have enquired  	whether they should carry on propaganda against the drink habit also 	and the laconic reply received was :  The 	Government consider that the Public Health staff should not carry on 	anti-drink propaganda.    
 It is to be noted here that there is no reason assigned for the ban on anti-drink propaganda. On the contrary, one would expect explicit instructions to these conservators of health to instruct the people about the evil effects of drink on the body under a popular Government. They would be required to tell the people how deadly the effect of alcohol is upon the human body and show by magic lantern slides in a graphic manner the ruin that alcohol brings wherever it finds a place. But it is madness to expect the existing Government to do any such thing. One may as well expect the keeper of a public house to warn its visitors against running into the death-trap. Is not the Government the keeper of all the public houses of India? It is the 25 crores revenue that enables us to give University education to our children. It enables the Government to impose pax Britannica upon us. Not till the people realize their duty and develop strength to resist the Government in its pro-drink policy will it be possible to have a dry India.
 PROHIBITION IN AMERICA
 One hears so much about prohibition being a failure in America that it is refreshing to find references which prove the contrary. The cuttings that a correspondent has sent show that delegates to the Middle-West Students’ Conference representing 1,23,000 college students in the South-East and Middle-West of America passed resolutions opposing liquor drinking by students.
 The February issue of the journal of the Locomotive Engineers contains the following :libtech_218_footnote
 The railorad brotherhoods as well as hundreds of thousands of sober, industrious working men in the American Federation of Labour are opposed to drink because they know it never made any man a better citizen, a better worker, or a better husband or father. We do not believe the remarkable growth  of labour co-operative banks in this country would have been possible if the working men were still putting their savings over the bar. We are further convinced that the progress of the American labour movement depends upon leaders with clear, cool heads and not upon those whose brains are addled by alcohol. Perhaps it is worth noting that the leaders of British labour, who have made much substantial progress economically, and politically, since the War, are overwhelmingly dry. . . .
It is not my purpose to make the reader believe that
 
 
 prohibition in America has been wholly successful. I  have  read enough literature on the gigantic experiment to know that there is another side to the picture. But allowing for all the exaggerations on either side, there is little doubt that prohibition has been a great boon to that wonderful people. It is yet too early to state results with certainty. The problem is much simpler in India, if only we have all the bars and distilleries closed.
 CHARKHA IN ANDHRA SCHOOLS
 Here is an extractlibtech_219_footnotefrom the report prepared by the Bhumavaram Taluk Board, West Godavari District :
 A reportlibtech_220_footnotefrom   Tirupati  Municipal  Council  shows  figures  of spinning in its schools.
 I would like to draw the attention of the teachers and organizers of spinning in schools that it is in every way better to introduce taklis instead of the spinning-wheels. For co-operative spinning in schools takli will be found to be more efficacious, more economical and more productive in the end.

   FROM FAR-OFF AMERICA  
 Some   time   ago   I   answered    some    questionslibtech_221_footnoteput    by    a correspondent in America. He now returns to the charge and puts several further questions, the first being :
 What good is that brave and fearless mentality when it cannot save the things you love? You may not be afraid to die, but what is it that will keep a band of robbers from taking away from you what you cherish if you are going to remain non-violent to the end. If the victims of a robber do not offer violent resistance it is so much easrie for the robber to loot them. Robbery has been going on and it will go on in the world till the victims are easy. The strong will rob the weak, resistance or no resistance. To be weak is a sin. Not  to prepare by all means to get rid of this wekness is a crime.
 The writer forgets that retaliation does not always succeed. The robber is likely, if stronger, to defeat the protector and vent his wrath, kindled by the resistance received, on the unfortunate victim whose
 plight would therefore be the worse for the resistance offered on her behalf. It is true that the protector will have the satisfaction of having done his best for his charge. But the same satisfaction will be available to the non-violent protector. For, he too will die in the attempt to rescue the victim. What is more, he will have the additional satisfaction of having tried to soften the heart of the robber by his pleading. The writer’s difficulty arises from the fact of his having assumed that the non-violent protector is to be a mere passive helpless spectator of the robbery. As a matter of fact, however, in my scheme, love is presumed to be a more active and potent force than brute force. He who has not the love and remains passive is a coward. He is neither man nor brute. He has proved himself unfit to protect.
 The writer obviously cannot realize, as I have done, the tremendous power that non-violent resistance has over  one’s adversary. Non-violent resistance is the resistance of one will against another. That resistance is possible only when it is freed from reliance on brute force. Reliance on brute force as a rule  presupposes surrender when that force is exhausted. Does the writer know that a woman with a determined will can successfully resist her ravisher however powerful he may be?
 I admit that the strong will rob the weak and that it is sin to be weak. But this is said of the soul in man, not of the body. If it be said of the body, we could never be free from the sin of weakness. But the strength of soul can defy a whole world in arms against it.  This strength is open to the weakest in body. A weak-willed Zulu, though strong as a giant in body, surrenders to a little white child. Who has not seen strong- bodied bullies surrendering helplessly to their frail mothers? Love con-quers the brute in the son. The law that subsists between mother and son is universal in its application. Nor need love be reciprocal. It is its own reward. Many a mother has tamed by her love her erring defiant children. Let us all prepare to get rid of the weakness of love. There is chance of success there. For rivalry in loving is conductive to health. The world has been trying all these ages to become strong in the wielding of brute force and it has miserably failed. Rivarly in generating brute force is race suicide.
The writer adds :
 The British rulers seem to have as much soul-force as you have, but they have military force and practical knowledge of human nature besides. The result is obvious.
 Military force is inconsistent with soul-force. Frightfulness, exploitation of the weak, immoral gains, insatiable pursuit after enjoyments of the flesh are utterly inconsistent with soul-force. The soul-force that the British rulers have is therefore subservient to the brute force if it is not asleep altogether.
The writer then puts the eternal conundrum:
 There are certain greedy persons in the world and they are doing mischief. They have power in their hands. They may be mad, but they are doing harm nevertheless. It will not do for us to stand by with folded hands and let them go on with their devilish work. We must take the power away from them even at the cost of non-violence, so that they may not do any more harm.
 History teaches one that those who have, no doubt with honest motives, ousted the greedy by using brute force against them have in their turn become a prey to the disease of the conquered. If it be better to be slaves than slave-drivers, if this is no mere copybook maxim, we can easily afford to let the slave-drivers do their worst, whilst, being weary of the brutal tug of war, so unbefitting our human nature, we try to explore the possibilities of matching the brute force of the greedy exploiters and the like with soul-force.
 But the writer is met with this difficulty at the threshold of the experiment :
 Mahatmaji, you admit that the people of India have not followed your creed. You do not seem to realize the cause of it. The truth is that the average person is not a Mahatma. History proves this fact beyond doubt. There have been a few Mahatmas in India and elsewhere. These are exceptions. And the exceptions only prove the rule. You must not base your actions on the exceptions.
 It is curious how we delude ourselves. We fancy that one can make the perishable body impregnable and we think it impossible to evoke the hidden powers of the soul. Well, I am engaged in trying to show, if I have any of these powers, that I am as frail a mortal as any of us and that I never had anything extraordinary about me nor have any now. I claim to be a simple individual liable to err like any other fellow mortal. I own, however, that I have humility enough in me to confess my effors and to retrace my steps. I own that I have an immovable faith in God and His goodness and unconsumable passion for truth and love. But is that not what every person has latent in him? If we are to make progress, we must not repeat history but make new history. We must add to the inheritance left by our ancestors. If we
 may make new discoveries and inventions in phenomenal world, must we declare out Bankruptcy in the spititual domain? Is it impossible to multiply the exceptions so as to make them the rule? Must man always be brute first and man after, if at all?

   LETTER TO RADHAKRISHNA BAJAJ  
 ASHRAM, SABARMATI,
 Thursday, May 6, 1926
 CHI. RADHAKRISHNA,
 I read your letter to me and the one to Shankarrao. I am sure your rule about eating salt-free food is not for all time. Its significance lies in that it reduces the keenness of the palate. This is the main point to bear in mind, and, therefore, as a guest at someone’s place you may accept whatever simple food is offered. You may leave aside any item on the menu, with or without salt, which is  not acceptable to you. But the three items—milk, boiled rice and chapatties—can be had anywhere. You may leave aside curry or vegetables which contain chillies and spices. Where hand- ground flour is not available, you may use mill-ground flour without any hesitation. When the road surface is very hot and in a place strewn with thorns, you should certainly use shoes, which in fact are called kantarakhanlibtech_222_footnotelibtech_223_footnoteor pagarakhanlibtech_224_footnotelibtech_225_footnote. You should not hesitate to write to me whenever you are faced with such conflicts of duties. Take very good care of your health.

            CHI. 	CHHOTALAL,    LETTER TO CHHOTALAL    ASHRAM, SABARMATI,  Thursday, 	May 6, 1926 
  	I got your letter written from Jaipur. I had earlier letter too. I 	intended to write to you after you had reached Calcutta, but your 	letter from Jaipur impels me to write today. I do not at all like 	your     
 manner of counting the cost of the thing. We must be very careful but we should not overdo it. If you go to some place for a cure of your mental or physical illness, you can certainly charge the expense to the Ashram’s account. Why do you at all keep any money as yours? Which is better, that you should surrender your all or that you should retain a little of “I”and “mine”? And just as the Ashram should bear the expenses when you go out elsewhere, similarly it should pay for the lessons you take in shorthand. Satis Babu will certainly pay you for any work you do, but it is better that you should work without expecting payment and also learn shorthand without paying. Rather than raise such fine issues, it is more necessary that you learn to determine with the utmost care what your duty is and then have no doubts and hesitations about it in your mind. Anyone who goes too deep into things, as you do, gets lost in mazes and is unable to see his plain duty which stands before him as unmistakable as a hill. Write to me regularly. You left for Prayag, and Bhuvarji came here.

 DEAR SIR,
 
 Your letter. The Tilak Fund came to about a crore of rupees. Its accounts appeared in all the papers. Its report has also been published in book form and is available at the Congress office. A major portion of the sum has already been spent, chiefly on national schools, removal of untouchability and khadi work.
  In 	my opinion, a 	leader should not 	travel first or 	second class if his health can stand the strain of third class travel.  I 	certainly believe that 	Hindu-Muslim unity is 	possible, for 	unity is 	in human nature. 	Even if 	neither Hindus 	nor Muslims 	make efforts 	to bring 	it about, 	time does its work.  Those 	whose economic condition is 	not good may adopt 	still greater 	simplicity in their 	lives and consume 	less khadi; in this 	manner a non-co-operator 	should, in the present 	circumstances, put 	up with 	hardships but 	be faithful 	to his 	chosen dharma.

   LETTER TO FULCHAND  
 ASHRAM,   SABARMATI,
 Friday, May 7, 1926
 BHAISHRI FULCHAND,
 I got your postcard. I don’t think it was a virtue in Bhai Shivlal that he should be suffering from piles and yet not give so much as a hint to anyone. I would rather blame him for not doing so. He cannot now carry on his work of service. No one can say how long he will be in bed; besides, the illness will mean expenditure which could have been avoided. But who can make Shivlal see reason? You should now immediately take whatever measures are necessary to get him cured.
 I follow what you say regarding the Wadhwan Udyogalayalibtech_226_footnote. Your letter seems to suggest that I have been unfair in forming my opinion about Wadhwan and that I am partial to the Amreli Centre in supporting it, and that too is a form of injustice. How can I convince you that I am neither partial towards the one nor hostile to the other? I am partial only to khadi. After inspecting the Amreli Centre personally and also through others’ eyes I came to the conclusion that it did not deserve to be closed. I had not examined the Wadhwan centre, nor did I think it necessary to look into its working, as I had confidence in your ability and used to get regular reports about it from Devchandbhai. I thought about the Centre only when the problem of selling khadi arose. And when you showed me the accounts in the course of my inquiry, I was startled. If it is a fact that in Wadhwan you offer higher rates for spinning, weaving and carding, is it [worthwhile] to continue to run the Centre?
 I apply one ccriterion to khadi activity at all places. Are the women who will be spinning starving for want of employment? If so, and if, to our good fortune, they agree to spin, we may start khadi work in that place. Provided workers were available in sufficient number, I
 
 would try to maintain all those centres in Kathiawar which satisfied this principle. Write to me if you have anything to say after  this explanation, and try to convince me. I yearn for testimonials from my co-workers certifying to my impartiality. I regard you as one such co- worker. I, too, will not give up the effort to convince you.

  	I have your letter. I do not think that the vaccine is obtained by 	killing cows. But I believe that it requires torturing them.

It was received after the All-India Congress 	Committee session was over. But do you think that any purpose can be 	served by calling a special session of the Congress? It can be of 	use only when there is a policy or programme that requires 	confirmation by it. But unfortunately we have neither policy nor 	programme. On the    
 
 
 
 
 contrary, the tallest among us distrust one another and even where there is no distrust there is no agreement as to facts or opinion.
 In the circumstances a Congress session can only accentuate the existing depression. It seems to me that time alone can solve the difficulty which seems to baffle us.
 I wish that it was possible for us at least to devise means of ascertaining the causes and of defining the results of each riot. But it seems that we have become incapacitated even for this very simple work.
 Yours sincerely,

 CHI. KUSUM AND DHIRU,
 I have your letter. I do not want to apportion blame for what has happened. I only wish that you should now take full advantage of the free time you will get there, and in this manner you should make your influence felt in the neighbourhood by being more regular in your daily work of spinning, etc., and strengthen your resolves. Keep writing to me. I see your handwriting still needs much improvement. Dhiru’s especially is extremely poor. I shall forget my grief over Dhiru’s going away to Bombay if he religiously follows there all his vows. Tell Bhanumati that, if she starts spinning regularly and forms the habit of getting up at four, I will think that letting both of you go to Bombay has been of great value. Devdas is there; he is to be operated upon, and is along with Ba and Mahadev. You must have heard about all this.

 DEAR SISTER,
 
 I have your letter; also the honey. It looks that after all I shall have to go to Mahabaleshwar. There is a letter today from Sir Chunilal Mehta. It seems to have been written at the instance of the Governor himself. He has invited me in his letter to stay with him. I think I should accept the invitation. Most probably I shall start from here as early as next Thursday. Personally, I would have liked to stay either with you or with Nargisbehn, but every time we must consider what our duty requires of us.

  	One of your questions remains to be answered. You wanted to know 	whether you could spend anything for helping the poor women who 	spin. You can spend about Rs. 100 for the purpose. Please let me 	know how you intend to utilize the amount. Within this limit, write 	to the Ashram for the amount which you spend.  	I send with this the results of the tests carried out by Shri 	Lakshmidas as to the quality of the yarn. You will see from them 	that it is very necessary to pay attention to improving it. In Shri 	Lakshmidas’s view, the strength ought not to be below 50%. Why 	could they not supply moistened yarn if they keep it with them for 	eight days? In this weather, moistened yarn dries up within two or 	three hours.  From 	a microfilm of the Gujarati : S.N. 19538      
 
 
 
 
 
 BHAI KAKA,
   LETTER TO D. B. KALELKAR  
 ASHRAM,   SABARMATI,
 Saturday, May 8, 1926
  	I have to further postpone the writing of the book for you, because, 	if I do not write a letter to you under the excuse that I am to 	write a book for you, I am afraid I may write neither.  I had 	thought that  I would write out the book soon so that I need not 	write the letter. But the Congress Committee took up practically my 	three full days, with the result that the Girnar of work has now 	become the Himalayas. On top of this, I see from today’s mail that 	I shall have to go to Mahabaleshwar. Nothing is likely to come out 	of the visit, but courtesy requires that I should go; let the 	outcome be what it will.  	I have never felt that the inmates of the Ashram are indifferent to 	Dr. Talwalkar, but it may be that my indifference, if it can be 	called so, has been reflected in their attitude.  	If you have been using olive oil as a substitute for cod-liver oil, 	[by all means] go on with it. Some regard it as superior to 	cod-liver oil. Shri Bhansali had used this same thing in jail.  	My habit of drawing lots has absolutely no relation with your 	“examination as of a bride’s qualities”. The poor little piece 	of paper cannot bear all that burden. There is no attempt in it to 	win over the gods; on the contrary, there is a sort of indifference 	about lots. In cases  in which we need not tax our reason, in which 	we are indifferent to either of the alternative courses and yet must 	adopt one of them, and none of our good friends is prepared to take 	a decision for us, I think it  is an excellent practice to seek the 	good offices our friend, the lot. This saves time and also spares us 	the burden on our mind. In matters of principle, drawing lots is an 	immoral solution.  	You cannot draw lots whether or not you should steal. But is it not 	better to draw lots rather than go on debating whether or not to go 	out for a walk with A, citing reasons from Vedas and other holy 	books for and against? If we try to consult the inner voice in such 	matters, the latter would lose  all  its  value;  a  child like  	Rasik  might  excuse himself from doing any work by pleading his 	inner voice! Have we not known instances of such abuse of the plea 	of inner voice during the non-co-operation movement? Suppose 	tandaljo and methi are both permissible items of diet, 	both are easily available but only one of them 
 is to be purchased, and suppose further that we cannot make up our mind immediately, would it not, in such circumstances, be better to draw lots and be indifferent to the result, rather than make it a matter of conscience?
 I shall see about Shri Harihar when he comes here. Shri Narahari had thought of getting Harihar to open a nursery school in Surat. If the people of Surat are ready to have such a school and collect a big  amount they are certainly welcome to start it, but we cannot try the experiment on behalf of the Vidyapith. I remember having been told by  Shri.  .  .libtech_229_footnotelibtech_230_footnoteas early as when I was in jail that Shri . .   .2    had  gone romantic. He had shown me an indecent poem signed . . .3, when I asked who this . . .4 was, I think he said it was . . .5 of the Ashram. But may be, I am mistaken. It may not have been . . .6 but someone else who told me this. We shall have to think about the matter when . . .7 is here.
 Nothing has yet been decided about [my visit to] Europe. Yes, Swami too had expressed to me his disagreement. The Ame- rican tour would have only meant addressing thousands of people; going to Finland means attending a convention of student-delegates from all over the world. There is a great difference between the two propositions. Moreover, in America I was supposed to give to the people India’s message; though there was no message to give. In this case the idea is that I should establish a spiritual bond with students. There  is  no question of delivering a message. These are the reasons why the idea of going to Finland is tempting me, though, of course, there are some misgivings in my mind. That is why I have thrown on K. T. Paul the responsibility of arranging my visit after telling them of my conditions. He, too, instead of accepting the responsibility, has passed on my letter to Geneva. If they will keep the invitation open, can we say it is God’s wish that I should go? Personally I will certainly believe so.
 I am convinced that Uttamchand will have nowhere else the facilities which he enjoys here. And now we have started a course of injections by Dr. Talwalkar. He is keeping well enough.

   SERVICE OF THE CITY  
 To everyone who wishes to serve his city I would recommend a perusal of Dr. Hariprasad’s accountlibtech_231_footnotelibtech_232_footnoteof the seven-month-long efforts to keep the city of Ahmedabad clean and bright. Those who do not know how to serve their own city can never serve their country. The good work done in these seven months by people who believed that selfless service is its own reward could not have been done by the municipality of the city even at a cost of thousands of rupees. This  effort to keep  the city clean is an example of co-operation between a municipality and the citizens, and if the rich do not co-operate, what has been already achieved is likely to be wasted. It is possible to raise the necessary funds to make Ahmedabad a model of cleanliness. Most of the suggestions made by Dr. Hariprasad cannot be carried out without the help of the wealthy citizens. The money given for this work will bring a handsome return, for if the city has a sufficient number of open  gounds with trees in them, if the old ruins and dirty sights are removed and stinking lavatories are seen no more, the health of the citizens will improve considerably and the price of  the land will also appreciate. The citizens can insist that the expenditure should be incurred under their own supervision. Hence the money given for this work will not be  a gift but will be an instance of economic foresight.

 DEAR FRIEND,
 I have your letter. It is a most difficult thing for me to make fixed appointments one year in advance. I can only therefore say that  I would be prepared tentatively to accept the invitation. It may  be necessary to shorten the programme and it may be also that I may be so absorbed in Indian affairs at the time that I might not be able to move out of India. I wonder if with the uncertainty attaching  to  my  acceptance the associations concerned will care to send me  the  invitation.
 Please also tell the friends that if I go out at all, I shall be accompanied by two companions.

Manibehn and the younger Kashi do  	the  cooking. Kumibehn, Rami’s aunt, arrived here today. Kanti and 	Manu had been to the station to receive her. Ba should not worry on 	our account.  
 Rameshwarprasad, his mother and others arrived yesterday, and are leaving for that side today. You must have got my letter in which I told you about my going to Mahabaleshwar. I take it that Mahadev will remain there for the time being. He should write to me if he wants me to fetch anything for him from here. I think we shall have to take with us some extra covering for nights. It seems that we shall have to stay in Mahabaleshwar for three days, viz., Saturday, Sunday and Monday. I have also been thinking that, leaving there on Tuesday morning, we should look up Kaka in Sinhgarh and, if possible, make a trip to Deolali as well. This may take up two more days. If we start on Tuesday morning we can reach Sinhgarh at about 10 or 11, and I am thinking that we may then go to Deolali if we can come down the same evening. But I may even drop the visit to Deolali if Mahadev thinks that it is not very necessary to go, because I also feel there is no point in going to Deolali unless we can stay there for a couple of days. Just now I shall write nothing about this to Mathuradas. I have decided to be guided by Mahadev’s advice. Will you yourself arrange for a car from Poona? A train for Poona leaves [Bombay] at 10-30 a.m. If that is so, I think it will be best to catch that train, after seeing Devdas, and reach Mahabaleshwar the same night. I think it would be better to arrange for two cars from Poona.

I have not decided whom I should ask here to accompany me. 	There will be one person, and most probably it will be Subbiah.  	I shall arrive there in the first train. Take me to  Revashan- 	karbhai’s. If Devdas is better, I shall go to see him after I have 	had my bath and lunch; otherwise I will go directly from the 	station. We must leave for Poona the same day. That will be no 	trouble to me.  I intend  to reach Mahabaleshwar the same evening, 	i.e., at nine on Friday. Please inform Revashankarbhai.  	It is all right that you know Mehta, but it would have been better 	if you had not written to him for a car. It will not look well if he 	makes any arrangements on behalf of the Government.

           MY 	DEAR SANTANAM,    LETTER TO K. SANTANAM    THE 	 ASHRAM, 	 SABARMATI,  May 	11, 1926 
  	Rajagopalachari discussed with me your difficulties when he was at 	the Ashram. I sympathize with you. But it is difficult to conform to 	 an absolute rule of conduct. Whilst it is proper to exact the 	uttermost from oneself, to refuse to serve till one had attained the 	ideal height would be to cut off the possibility of reaching that 	height. We rise only by actual service and by taking the risk of 	making mistakes whilst we are serving. Not one of us is perfect. Not 	one of us is able to realize the whole of our spiritual ambition. 	All the same, in the humblest manner possible we have to continue to 	serve and hope that through that service we may some day realize 	that ambition. If we all refuse to serve, until we attain 	perfection, there will be no service. The fact is that perfection is 	attained through service. If you were to say we must not take or 	accept power till we are perfect, I should entirely agree with you. 	And, therefore, it is best never to take any power, and, when it is 	thrust upon us to use it for service only. I hope therefore that, in 	spite of the weaknesses that you may detect in yourself, you will 	not  refuse  to render khadi service so long as the weaknesses do 	not interfere with that    
 service. Thus a man who has the weakness of dishonesty or drunknesses or the like is naturally unfit for that service. But a man who in spite of strenuous effort is unable (say) to regulate himself with his wife as if he was her brother is not unfit for service. I hope I have made myself quite clear and that you will return to the khadi work you love and do so well.

And a scientific scale gives both the weight and price of all the foodstuffs taken. You cannot be always taking one rupee and four annas worth of rice even when the price of rice has doubled, as it sometimes is. Of the staples you have to take the same quantity irrespective of price. Therefore, I would like you to give me the exact  quantity  taken including those things which come to you free of charge and you  should put down the prices of such things also as you get free.
 I want to publish the scale of diet taken in the various institutions so as to guide workers. And let there be no et ceteras. You have “salt, etc.”. Instead of that you should say salt, turmeric, ginger or whatever spices, if any, you are taking.
 Yours sincerely,

   LETTER TO C. RAJAGOPALACHARIAR  
 THE  ASHRAM,  SABARMATI,
 May 11, 1926
 I have your two letters. I enclose herewith Kelappan’s letter. What you have done is quite right. He must render an account of his work to you from time to time.
 I am writing to Santanam.  Herewith a copy of my letterlibtech_245_footnoteto him. About Ramanathan, I shall discuss with Shankerlal. I do not apprehend any difficulty.
 Can’t very well draw lots about Finland. And, even if I do, it is too late now. But I share your misgivings. I have prescribed my terms and if they have me in spite of them there may be something in the visit.
 You will be ready in June, won’t you, for touring even if you have to have somebody from here temporarily. How would Chhotalal suit you? He cannot be there for a long time. But it would be possible to  induce him to come there willingly for two or three months  if he can be of any assistance and give you some relief.
 
 I have now seen Shankerlal. He thinks that if Ramanathan’s salary is raised to Rs. 150 there is bound to be pressure from others for raising their salary. It is a risky thing for a public and universal body like the Charkha Sangh to depart from fixed rules. At the same time, I see your or rather Ramanathan’s difficulty. My suggestion, therefore, is that so long as it is absolutely necessary, you should pay Ramanathan from the Seva Sangh. For this, perhaps, Jamnalalji will have to be consulted which you should do or if you want me to I will. If the thing can be postponed you should come here at the time of commencing your tour and discuss with Shankerlal. I take it that Ramanathan will not insist upon the increase coming from the A.I.S.A.

BHAISHRI KAKA,
 I got your second letter about mother goat. If, now, I myself come to Sinhgarh, instead of sending you a book there, I will make nothing but speeches. We need not now leave this place on Thursday and reach Mahabaleshwar on Friday, because the next week suits the Governor better. When I shall be able to leave, I can say only after some time. Even apart from the visit to Mahabaleshwar, Devdas has been operated upon and I must see him. Since Bombay is on the way, I may even start earlier for his sake. That will depend upon Devdas’s wishes.
 I agree with every word of what you say about books worth trans- lating. My inquiry was only in connection with Jamnadas Memorial Series. Neither Shankerlal nor Swami has the list which you prepared. Of course we should get the translation done only by competent men. The books too should be such as would meet some immediate needs of the people and should be easy to follow. In your letter you have
 explored a whole ocean of books. But all we have to consider at present is what books we should select for this series. Please, therefore, think about that.

    LETTER TO MAHADEV DESAI        ASHRAM, 
      CHI. 	MAHADEV,  Wednesday [May 12, 1926]libtech_248_footnote 
  	I have your letter. I also got a telegram from Jamnalalji. A 	telegram from Sir Chunilal has just been received. The Governor will 	see us on Tuesday. I am, therefore, sending a wire that I shall 	start tomorrow. I will take the first train. We shall fix up the 	rest of the programme after I reach there. I would prefer that we 	leave for Deolali on Friday itself in the evening and return to 	Bombay on Sunday morning. We may then spend Sunday and Monday in 	Bombay and finish the work for Young India and Navajivan 	till the usual period of my vow of silence on Monday is over. I 	should break my silence on Monday evening and leave for Poona, from 	where I can immediately take the train to Mahabaleshwar. We can have 	our wash and lunch in Mahabaleshwar itself. This will impose the 	least strain on us. But you should, all of you, consult among 	yourselves about any changes which may seem necessary in this 	programme; we will alter it accordingly after  I arrive there. We 	should stay in Mahabaleshwar on Tuesday and Wednesday and leave 	there on Thursday morning. On our way we should cover Sinhgarh; we 	should start  descending  immediately after sunset and take the  	train  from  Poona  so as  to  reach Bombay  the following morning, 	and Ahmedabad  on Saturday morning.  As  far as I can see, we cannot 	 save a  single  day from this  programme.  We must reserve two days 	for Mahabaleshwar. We can, if we wish, spend Monday in 	Mahabaleshwar. But it seems best that we should    
 spend Sunday and Monday with Devdas. Or, we can spare one day more for Mathuradas. In any case, we should spend Monday in Bombay.
 I think I have nothing to add. Oh yes, I forgot one thing. I have yielded to Kumi’s repeated requests and Kanti, Rasik and Minu are leaving for Rajkot tomorrow. My conditon is that they too should be sent back on Friday. On asking the children, I could see that they wished to go and so I thought it best to let them go.
 Ramniklal has started a ten-day fast from today, the reason merely being his own several years old, strong wish to do so. So now Bhansali has a companion during the last days of his fast. The latter is going on very well with his fast. Today is the twelfth day, but he does not show in any way that he has been fasting. There is no observable effect even on his face. He sleeps quite soundly. He takes enemas, and that ensures bowel movement. Drinks plenty of water. He himself reads for an hour every day, and also gets others to read a little from religious books.
 Since Devdas is all right, . . .libtech_249_footnotecan now come away.  Rami, being alone, is likely to feel a little, though of course Mani, Radha and others look after her with great care. I propose to bring Subbiah along with me.

Any way,  I am delighted that you have changed your food and are taking more nourshing things. Do please continue. It will be criminal if you weaken your body or become ill. A few rupees spent in getting proper nourishment will be well spent. I know that you are not the man to eat for pleasure, but when things are required to sustain life they must be procured.

Though the atrocious injustice done by the 	Hindus to the suppressed classes is admitted generally by even the 	orthodox Hindu society, there are men, otherwise liberal-minded, so 	blinded by prejudice that they see no injustice in the treatment 	meted out to our suppressed countrymen.  Thus a correspondent writes 	:libtech_253_footnote  . 	. . I do not agree with 	people who say that 	the untouchables 	are oppressed 	and suppressed. . . . I am afraid that your mission to elevate them, to	place them 	on an equal 	footing with 	other communities of 	the country, 	is doomed 	to failure. 	Personally, though 	I feel 	that much should be 	done to 	elevate them      1  From 	the postmark  2  Only 	excerpts are reproduced here. 
 socially, it cannot be done as if by magic in a single day. Millions of money will have to be spent to educate them, to free them from economic distress, to persuade them to abandon the vices of drinking and killing cows and eating dead animals. . . .
Degradation   lies   in   not   touching the  “untouchable”.	What
 though a man drinks, kills cows and eats carrion? He is no doubt an evil-doer, though no greater than the one who commits secret and more deadly sins. But he is not to be treated as an untouchable even as society does not treat the secret sinner as one. Sinners are not to be despised, but pitied and helped to rid themselves of their sinfulness. The existence of untouchability among Hindus is a denial of the  doctrine of ahimsa on which we pride ourselves. We are responsible for the evils among the “untouchables”, of which the writer complains. What have we done to wean them from their ways? Do we not spend a fortune to reform members of our own families? Are the untouchables not members of the great Hindu family ? Indeed, Hinduism teaches us to regard the whole of humanity as one indivisible and undivided family and holds each one of us responsible for the misdeeds of all. But if it is not possible to act up to the grand doctrine for its vastness, let us at least understand the unity of the “untouchables” with us since we regard them as Hindus.
 And what is worse, eating carrion or thinking carrion? We daily create, harbour and nourish millions of untouchable thoughts. Let us shed them, for they are the true untouchables deserving to be hated and cast out. And let us do penance for our past in- justice towards the “untouchable” brothers by lovingly embracing them. The correspondent does not question the duty of serving the untouchables. How are we to serve them if their very sight offends and pollutes us?

   FURTHER MARCH FIGURES  
 Here are the figureslibtech_254_footnoteof   production  and  sale  of  khadi  for  the month of March from some centres. I hope that all those who are not yet regularly sending their returns would begin to do so.
 The Andhra figures are as usual incomplete. Bengal figures included those of the Khadi Pratishthan, Abhoy Ashram, and Arambagh
 Khadi Kendra.
 COMPARATIVE FIGURES
 The Abhoy Ashram authorities have sent the following comparative figureslibtech_255_footnoteof khadi production and sales under its aegis :
 Thus it will be seen that in 1925-26, the quarterly production in the Abhoy Ashram was 25 times as much as during the corresponding period in 1923-24. This is a remarkable rise. I would ask all the chief khadi organizations in India to favour me with similar comparative statistics. If they show a rise at all like the Abhoy Ashram, they will be a complete answer to those who tell us that khadi has progressively gone down instead of rising during the past five years. Progressive figures like those of the Abhoy Ashram should hearten khadi workers for greater effort. For the work before them is not to manufacture khadi worth lacs. They have to manufacture crores of rupees worth of khadi.

   THE CATTLE PROBLEM  
 Some months ago the Collector of Ganjam Mr. A. Galletti sent me a sheet, being a reprint of his notes contibuted to The Statesman, in which he gave his opinion based on his Italian expe- riences, (1) that the agriculture of India depended upon good cattle, (2) that the cattle  of India were ill-kept and therefore worse than elsewhere, (3) that they could be improved only by India growing cattle crop instead of merely depending on common pastures, and (4) that by the system of rotation cattle crop could be grown side by side with food  grains without diminishing the returns of the latter.
 I had difficulty in applying the Italian conditions to the Indian inasmuch as we have small holidings even as little as two acres and sometimes even less. To my objection which I conveyed to him, Mr. Galletti sent me the following replylibtech_256_footnote:
 Many thanks for yours of the 26th February, received today in my camp in my Agency hills. I will replylibtech_257_footnoteto your objection from experience.
 The appeal of the crores of India’s cattle lies not to me alone, but to every Indian who can think for himself, more especially perhaps to

 every Hindu who prides himself on being the special protector of the cow. I hope that the readers have been perusing the carefully prepared notes by Sjt. V. G. Desai on the slaughter of India’s cattle. They give a graphic description of the condition of the cattle in the cities of India. Mr. Galletti paints the condition of farm cattle and prescribes in detail the remedy for improving them. The question of improving the breed of cattle and preserving them is a question as well of first rate economics as of religion. How far Mr. Galletti’s remedy is applicable to Indian conditions, I do not know. Practical farmers alone can give an authoritative opinion. But one  difficulty  is  obvious.  Millions  of farmers are too ignorant to adopt new and revolutionary methods. Assuming the truth of Mr. Galletti’s prescription, its application depends upon the agricultural education of the large mass of Indian humanity. But those who know anything of agriculture and who have a patch of land under cultivation should try Mr. Galletti’s remedy and publish results.  For such, I give below the relevant extractslibtech_258_footnotelibtech_259_footnotefrom  the sheet sent by Mr. Galletti :

   NOTES  
 KHADI DURING NATIONAL WEEK
 The All-India Spinners’ Association has received certain re- ports of khadi work during the National Week  according  to  which  in Banaras Babu Shiva Prasad Gupta who organized volun- teers for the sale of khadi, in Banaras sold nerely Rs. 2,000 worth of khadi : at Allahabad, over Rs. 1,200; at Ghazipur, over Rs. 160; and at Banda nearly Rs. 1,000 worth of khadi was sold. The result was that there was hardly any local khadi left in the U.P. In the Punjab, great enthusiasm was shown. Rs. 11,000 worth of khadi was disposed of. Many leaders went about hawking khadi. In Tamilnad, the sales in  all  depots amounted to Rs. 18,622-11-11.
 I wish that the other khadi centres throughout India would send their reports. There is nothing starling about these figures, but they show that if only leading men and women will work in their own centres steadilly, all the khadi that can be produced can be  disposed  of without the slightest difficulty in the province of production and that
 there need be no check put upon the manufacture of good khadi for want of custom. Manufacture requires skill and sustained effort. Sale requires prestige and pushfulness. Sales therefore can be best effected by volunteers of recognized status giving a portion of their time during certain months in the year.
 TO S. L. R.
 I wish, instead of filling eight sides of a thin notepaper, you had written on one side of your notepaper so as to make your writing legible. You could have condensed your statement to a fourth of its size.
 I suggest to you that remembrance of a bad deed does not mean hatred of the evil-doer. I do not forget “the atrocities” committed by many of my friends and relatives, but I am not aware of the slightest hatred against them. On the contrary, I love them in spite of their “atrocities”. But it would be wrong for me to support  evil-doing friends or relatives. Similarly would it be wrong for the nation  to support a servant who has been guilty of atrocities such as General Dyer was. Absence of hatred does not and must not mean the screening of the guilty. You infer without any authority that my severe condemnation of the sin of Jallianwala includes condemnation of the whole of the British race. I must ask you to search the file of Young India and you will discover that I have done the opposite of what you attribute to me.

It is 	best that at present you stay there and study everything carefully; 	in any case, now that you are there I think you should spend some 	time acquainting yourself with the position. . . .libtech_263_footnoteof affairs there.  The ideas which have recently 	occurred to you will also mature while you are there. The Ashram 	needs everyone but is dependent on none. That should be the attitude 	of the inmates, too, towards the Ashram. They must feel the need to 	remain in the Ashram, but at the same time they ought to be 	fearless. The inmates must certainly want to remain in the Ashram as 	long as it encourages the spirit of self-confidence in them, but 	should leave it the moment they feel that it obstructs their spiri- 	tual development. Thus, in retaining you in the Ashram I think I am 	serving both you and the Ashram. So you need not at all think that I 	want to keep you in the Ashram solely for your good, irrespective of 	whether your presence serves or harms the Ashram. I request you once 	again to stop thinking too much. I hope you got my last letter. 	Reflect over it and stop worrying.  	You must have learnt that Devdas has been operated upon for 	appendicitis. The operation was performed on Sunday. I learn from 	his letter today that he is quite well. He will soon be discharged 	from the hospital. Ba, Mahadev and Jamnalalji are with him. I am 	leaving for Mahabaleshwar today to see the Governor there. I shall 	certainly see Devdas on my way.  From 	a photostat of the Gujarati : S. N. 19505

  	I  have  written  an  articlelibtech_265_footnotelibtech_266_footnoteon 	 the  Centre  for  the  next  issue  of Navajivan; please go 	through it and let me know if I have omitted anything. These days I 	find in your letters a mixture of sadness, impatience and despair. I 	also see that you did not like Shri Lakshmidas’s criticism. But 	there is no reason for you to feel sad or give way to despair. And 	one must not be impatient of criticism. It is not always that a 	critic can do well what he criticizes in others. It is your duty to 	accept and use as much from the criticism as you can. You should let 	Lakshmidas know and have a discussion with him about what you 	cannot. If you do this, you may learn something. The present 	widespread demand for khadi is the result of a sentiment. It is your 	duty to nurse and strengthen this sentiment. If you work from there 	in a spirit of self-sacrifice, you will be able to get more work 	done and also improve the quality of yarn and khadi. It is only by 	improving their quality that you can nurse and strengthen the love 	for khadi. You ask for some person to examine the quality of khadi 	produced by families which had kept back some cotton from their 	crop. Where can I find such a person? I explained to you, when you 	were here, that you should cut out a strip three to four inches 	wide, from every piece woven and send the strips here, so that every 	roll can be examined. Both the rolls and the strips should be 	numbered, so that whenever a strip is rejected the corresponding 	roll can be promptly identified. This will consume some time; but I 	think that is inevitable. If people get a return for their money, 	why should they lose faith in khadi? If you cannot do this, I can 	only tell you that you may pay only for such khadi about the quality 	of which you feel sure. There should be no difficulty in doing this 	if the payment is to be made at one place. When payments are to be 	made at several places, inspection of the material should be carried 	out at one place; otherwise this arrangement will not work.

Perhaps you know that Devdas is in a hospital. Kusum and Dhiru, too, are in Bombay. They wanted to be with Jaya during the time [that Devdas was in hospital].

   STATEMENT ON COLOUR BAR BILL  
 May 14, 1926
 Mahatma Gandhi who arrived in Bombay on Friday morning was met on the train by an Associated Press representative who showed him a message from Cape Town that the Colour Bar Bill has been passed. Gandhiji received the news with pain [and said]:
I am sorry to learn the news that the Bill has been passed by the
 joint session of the two Houses of the Union Parliament. I had hoped with Mr. Andrews that better counsels would prevail and that the Bill would be rejected. Theoretically speaking, this Colour Bar Bill is worse than the Class Areas Reservation Bill over which there is to be a round table conference. One had wished that the spirrit of justice that actuated the Union Government to postpone the passing of  one  bill  would induce them not to force the passage of the other. The acrimonious debate that took place over the passage of the Colour Bar Bill makes one suspicious as to the fate of Class Areas Reservation Bill. The duty of the Governor General of South Africa, in my opinion, is quite clear. His assent to this cruel Bill should be refused especially in view of the fact that General Smuts backed, as he was, by many  other  South  African leaders put up such a strong opposition against it. The Colour Bar Bill, if it becomes a law of the Union, will set up the whole of the native population of South Africa against the white settlers. I regard it as an act of suicide on their part.

The   Conference  has   honoured  itself   in   getting  Mr.  Amritlal
 
 Thakkar, the champion of the Bhils and the Antyajas, as its president. I hope that khaddar will have its proper place in such a conference, khaddar whereby thousands of untouchables earn their honest livelihood and by which innumerable hungry sisters earn an  honest anna protecting their womanhood. I also hope that the curse of untouchability which has crept into Hindu soceity would be removed.

 DEAR FRIEND,
 I got your letter at Deolali. I am here to see Chi. Mathuradas on my way to Mahabaleshwar. It seems to me that you are not gaining strength fast enough. I am anxious to know your weight. You can have only cow’s or goat’s milk, and that again after heating it with half an ounce of water. It must not be boiled for any length of time. I hope to return to the Ashram from Mahabaleshwar on Saturday. I shall reach there tomorrow.

   COBWEBS  OF IGNORANCElibtech_277_footnote  
 An English writer has observed that in vindicating truth there is far more labour in disentangling the knots of ignorance than in propounding the truth itself. Truth is by nature self-evident. As soon  as you remove the cobwebs of ignorance that surround it, it shines clear. That is just the sort of handicap under which the simple and straight movement of the spinning-wheel is labouring today. It is expected to fulfil conditions which no one ever claimed it to fulfil, and when it fails to do so, the blame is laid at its door rather than at the critic’s! A capital illustration of this is afforded by some paragraphs sent by a lover of khadi, the substance of which is :
  Now 	that you have begun to 	claim the 	spinning-wheel as 	a universal 	provider, it has 	simply filled us 	with disgust. 	And, so, 	today, we, 	the intelligentsia, 	repudiate you 	and your 	spinning- wheel 	alike.  It 	may be 	possible to introduce 	hand-spinning in 	 small villages and if 	you confined yourself 	simply to 	that,  nobody would 	criticize you and you 	might even get 	some sympathy. But when you try to make out that even spiritual salvation

 can come through the spinning-wheel you make yourself ridiculous. But you being a ‘great’ man, it is just possible that some simple-minded people may swallow whatever you say. The educated are not going to stand your nonsense any more; because you have now cast all moderation to the winds, and particularly since your voluntary retirement, you have not hesitated to prescribe the spinning-wheel to everybody and for every conceivable object under heaven. Does one want to observe brahmacharya ? Let him take to the spinning-wheel. Do you want to secure the release of the innocent Bengal patriots who are in jail ?—Ply the wheel. Do you want to ameliorate the economic condition of India? Why then,—the wheel again ! Not only this, you have even offered the spinning-wheel to veteran soldiers fit to wield the sword and the spear. The wonder is that you do not perceive the utter madness of all this.
  What 	would it matter to 	Britain if India ceased 	 to purchase sixty 	crore rupees worth 	of cloth 	from her? Do you 	suppose that 	would make her 	abdicate her 	 political  power  in 	India? See, how 	woefully mistaken you 	are in declaring 	that there is 	no political programme 	more valuable than hand-spinning. You have yet to prove that the spinning-wheel can solve 
 even the bread problem for the masses. The harm  that  has resulted from it, on the other hand, is quite apparent. Just think of the khadi shops that have come to grief already!
  You 	even seem to suggest 	that other industrial 	activities should 	be dropped 	for the sake of hand-spinning. 
 I have condensed the objections in my own words. I do not think that I have thereby done the writer any injustice. On the contrary, I have erred, if at all, in removing or toning down the bitterness of his writing. An embittered patriot has a right to employ harsh language towards a person who has come to be dubbed a ‘Mahatma’. For it enables him to mollify, to some extent at least, his rising anger over the spectacle of destitution that his country presents on the one hand and its utter helplessness to remedy it on the other. My duty is not to advertise his anger but to try, if it is at all possible, to remove the confusion engendered by that anger.
 To proceed now to the examination of the six points of the correspondent :
  A UNIVERSAL 	PROVIDER 	?—I 	have never tried 	to make 	anyone  regard  the  spinning-wheel 	  as 	 his 	  kamadhenulibtech_278_footnoteor 	  universal 	provider; I 	have certainly 	regarded it as my 	kamadhenu and 	in this 	I have 	done nothing more 	than what crores of 	Hindus in 	India are 	today doing, 	when they take up a 	little bit 	of clay, 	mould it into 	a small 	oval ball, 	mentally invest it with 	the Divine presenece and 	make it 	their kamadhenu by 	offering up 	their entire 	being to 	it. They 	do not 	ask their 	neigh- bours 	to worship 	it; on 	the contrary 	after their worship 	is over, they 	consign that 	sacred ball 	of clay 	to the 	waters. Why 	should then 	the intelligentsia 	feel disgusted if, with 	crores of my fellows, 	I lose 	my head 	and make the spinning-wheel 	my kamadhenu 	? May 	I not 	expect a 	measure of 	toleration from 	them ? But 	as a 	matter of 	fact the 	intelligentsia as 	a body 	have not given me 	the go-by 	yet. To 	believe or 	give others 	to believe, 	therefore, that all the 	intelligentsia are 	disgusted because a 	few are, is 	hardly proper. But 	supposing, for 	the time being, that 	all of 	them do 	actually abandon me 	altogether, then, 	if my faith 	is inviolate, 	as all 	true faith must be, 	it will 	simply blaze forth and 	burn all 	the brighter for that reason. 	  When in 1908libtech_279_footnotelibtech_280_footnote, on board the  Kildonan 	Castle, 	I declared my 	faith in 	the spinning-wheel 	in the 	pages of 	the Hind Swaraj 	(Indian 	Home Rule), 	I stood 	absolutely alone. Will, then, 	my God who guided 	my pen 	into making 	that declaration 	of faith 	at that 	time, abandon me, when it is put on its trial?  SPIN 	FOR SACRIFICE—It 	is in the villages only 	that the spinning-wheel 	is largely 	meant to be introduced, 	and it 	is just there that 	it is at present 	going on. And if 	today I 	beg for sympathy 	and support, it is for 	its revival in 	our villages. 	Again it is just 	for this that I have 	to canvass 	the sympathy 	of the 	educated class. 	For, just as if we want 	to teach 	our villagers who 	are ignorant how 	to protect 	themselves against the 	ravages of 	malaria and 	such other diseases, 	some people from the 	educated and 	middle class 	will first have to become 	adepts in 	the knowledge of 	the sanitary measures 	necessary to extirpate 	these diseases and 	to observe the 	rules themselves, 	similarly it is only 	when some of us 	learn spinning and 	practise it 	ceaselessly ourselves 	that we shall 	be able 	to teach it 	to our villagers 	and overcome 	their apathy by 	our personal 	example. And 	it goes 	without saying that 	unless we 	use the khadi that 	they produce 	the spinning-wheel 	cannot live. My 	appeal to 	the people 	who live in the cities, 	therefore, is 	to spin for sacrifice, 	while their

 brethren in the villages do it for reward. The thing is simplicity itself. If only we get at the heart of it, we will find that it hardly affords any room for criticism.
  I SPEAK 	FROM  EXPERIENCE—I 	do regard 	the spinning-wheel 	as a gateway to my 	spiritual salvation, 	but I 	recommend it 	to others only 	as a 	powerful weapon for 	the attainment of 	swaraj and 	the amelioration of 	the economic 	condition of the 	country. To 	those also who aspire 	to observe brahmacharya, 	I do 	present the 	spinning-wheel. It 	is not 	a thing 	to be despised, 	for it is experience 	here that speaks. A 	person who 	wants to 	subdue his 	passions has 	need to 	be calm. All 	commotion within 	him ought 	to cease; 	and so 	quiet and 	gentle is 	the motion of 	the spinning-wheel, 	that it has been 	known to still 	the passions 	of those 	who have 	turned it in the 	fulness of 	faith. I 	have been able to 	compose my 	anger by 	turning it, 	and I can 	adduce similar testimony 	of several 	other brahmacharis. 	Of course it 	would be 	quite easy 	to laugh 	down all such 	persons as 	fools and 	nincompoops, but 	it would 	not be 	found to 	be cheap 	in the 	end. For 	the scoffer in 	a fit 	of anger 	loses a beautiful 	means wherewith 	to compose his 	passions and attain 	vigour  and 	strength. I 	therefore particularly 	recommend to every 	young man and 	young woman who reads 	these lines to give 	the spinning-wheel a 	trial. They will find that 	shortly after they 	sit down to spin, 	their passions begin 	to subside. 	I do 	not mean to 	say that they would 	remain calm for 	all the rest of 	the day 	even after 	the spinning 	is  discontinued; 	 for, human 	passions are fleeter 	even than the 	wind and to 	subdue them 	completely requires no 	end of 	patience. All 	that I 	claim is 	that in 	the spinning-wheel 	they will find a powerful means of cultivating steadiness. But 	then, someone will 	ask, why do not 	I recommend 	the far 	more poetical 	rosary, if that 	is the 	purpose which 	it is intended 	to subserve? 	My reply 	to this 	is that 	the spinning-wheel 	possesses some virtues 	in addition 	to those 	it has in common 	with the rosary. 	I  have  not prescribed 	it for 	a recluse 	living in a 	state of 	nature in 	a cave 	of the 	Himalayas and 	subsisting on 	the herbs 	and roots 	of the 	forest. I 	have placed 	it only 	before such 	countless persons 	like myself 	who, while living 	in the 	work-a-day world, are 	anxious to 	serve the country 	and to 	practise brahmacharya simultaneously. 
 And as for ridiculing my suggestion to ply the spinning-wheel for securing the release of the Bengal prisoners, it only comes to this
 that we are not prepared to stir ourselves a single inch to secure their release. For the spinning-wheel here means the boycott of all foreign cloth. And what a compelling force that has and how we are at present unable to develop any other kind of force, we shall presently see as we proceed with our examination of the other points that follow. My presenting the spinning-wheel even to veteran soldiers fit to wield the lance and the sword, therefore, is not a sign of madness but a hall-mark of knowledge—a knowledge not derived merely from book-learning but from the plenitude of experience.
  WHY 	IT IS 	THE  ONLY 	 POLITICAL 	 PROGRAMME—The 	question as 	to what loss would 	the British 	suffer if India 	stopped purchasing her 	sixty crore rupees 	worth of 	cloth from them is 	quite out of 	place. Our duty is 	simply to 	see whether 	and if 	so, how far it 	would profit us. 	The stopping 	of the 	purchase of 	sixty crores worth of 	foreign cloth would, 	 in the 	first place, mean the 	saving of 	so much money to 	the crores 	of Indian 	homes. In ohter 	words it would 	mean so much 	addition to 	their income. Then, it 	would spell the 	creation of 	so much fresh industry, 	the organization 	of crores 	into a 	joint co-operative 	effort, the conservation 	and utilization 	of the 	energy of 	the millions 	and the dedication 	of crores 	of lives to 	the service 	of the 	motherland. The 	carrying out 	of such 	a gigantic 	task would, further, give us 	a realization of 	our own strength. 	It would 	mean our 	acquiring a thorough 	mastery of 	the details and 	innumerable knotty 	problems which 	it presents, 	e.g., learning 	to keep 	account of every 	pie, learning 	to live 	in the 	villages in sanitary 	and healthy 	conditions, remov-ing the 	difficulties that 	block the 	way and so on. 	For, unless we learn all this, we would not be able to accomplish 	this task. The 	spinning-wheel, then, 	provides us with 	a means 	for generating 	this capacity in 	us. So 	long, therefore, as 	one has not grasped 	the inner 	meaning of 	the wheel, 	one may ridicule 	it, but when 	once the grand 	meaning is 	understood it 	would become simply 	impossible to  tear 	oneself away from it. 
 Again, the British are an intelligent people. The officials are a wise and shrewd lot. I know this. That is why I present the spinning- wheel to my people. We cannot overreach the British by the glibness of our tongue or by the power of our pen. Our threats they have grown quite accustomed to, while as for our physical prowess it can avail us but little against their bombs rained down from the aeroplanes. But these people understand and respect patience,  perseverance,  determination and capacity for organization. Cloth represents the biggest item of their trade. The accomplishment of its boycott by us would awaken them to
 a sense of our strength. They are not holding India merely to feed their pride; nor is it by mere force of arms, but it is by tact and cunning that their rule over us is maintained. When their trade is made to rest on our untramelled free will, their rule also will undergo a similar transformation. Today both are being imposed on us against our will.  If we succeed in shaping one of them according to our will, the other will automatically follow suit. But it is easy enough to understand that while their trade relations with us remain unchanged, no change in the political relationship is possible.
 I may repeat that I would today discard the spinning-wheel if someone shows a better and more universal political programme than hand-spinning. But up to this time I have found none, I have been shown none. I am anxious to know if there is any.
 HOW 	IT 	SOLVES 	THE BREAD 	PROBLEM—That 	the spinning- 
 wheel can solve our bread problem hardly needs to be proved to a reader of the Navajivan. The figures published about various khadi organizations would show that thousands of poor women are today eking out their living by spinning. Nobody has yet denied that the spinning-wheel can bring the spinner at least an anna a day. And there are crores of people in India who hardly earn even a pice a day. So long as things stand thus, it is hardly necessary to point out the close relation that exists between the spinning-wheel and the bread problem.
 As for the charge that the spinning-wheel has done harm to the country it is up to those who level it to prove it. This activity is by its very nature such that there can be no waste of effort in it. Nothing can interrupt its continuity and even a little exercise of it saves one from mighty evils. What does it matter if some khadi shops came to an end? That phenomenon is common to every trade. The money invested in them has at least remained in the country, while the experi-ence gained through it has enabled us to make further progress. Besi-des, if some of the shops had to close down, instances can be cited of many more, better organized shops that have grown up in their place.
  SUPPLEMENTS, 	DOES 	NOT 	REPLACE—I 	have not contemplated, 	much less advised, 	the abandonment 	of a 	single healthy, life-  giving 	industrial activity for 	the sake of 	hand-spinning. The 	entire foundation 	of the 	spinning-wheel rests 	on the 	fact that there are crores of semi-unemployed 	people in 	India. And 	I should 	admit that if there 	were none s 	uch there 	would be no room 	for the spinning-wheel. 	But  as a matter of fact everybody who has been to our villages knows that 
 they have months of idleness which may prove their ruin. Even my appeal to the middle class people to spin for sacrifice is with reference to their spare hours. The spinning-wheel movement is destructive of no enterprise whatever. It is a life-giving activity. And that is why I have called it Annapurna libtech_281_footnoteor the butter for bread or the replenisher.

   MY NOTES  
 AMRELI  KHADI CENTRE
 This Centre was started by Shri Chitalia at the very beginning of the khadi movement. Thereafter Shri Amritlal Thakkar took it over and expanded its work considerably. As everyone was inex-perienced at that time, loss was inevitable. The results, however, were beneficial on the whole for, besides our gaining experience, some  poor  women  got  a little help. Shri  Jivanlal and Ramji Hansraj also came to take interest  in its activities. The former invested some money in it, and Ramjibhai took over as its Manager. He engaged Shri Jaisukhlal’s services. They made a hand-press for yarn and started preserving it in the form of bales. They then established branches around Amreli in places where poverty was rampant and good workers were available, and brought about improvement in the quality of the yarn and the  khadi. Previsously, yarn of three counts was used for weaving, whereas now yarn of eight counts is used and this yarn is stronger than three-count yarn. With the beginning of this year the Centre entered the fourth stage in its growth, that is, Shri Jivanlal and Shri Ramji asked me to relieve them of the responsibility of running thus Centre and expressed their wish that some institution should take over its management. Shri Ramji pleaded his failing health and Shri Jivanlal wished to be free so that he might be able to help in his own business. The management of this Centre, therefore has been taken over on my advice by the  Kathiawar Political Conference, and it will shortly be handed over to trustees appointed by the Conference so that the Centre may be run properly. The amount of ten thousand rupees invested by Shri Jivanlal in this Centre remains with it. Besides this, the amount of five thousand rupees contributed by him to the purse is also invested in the Centre in accordance with his wishes. He is also giving a grant of two thousand rupees annually, and this he will continue for three years. The following
 
 plan has been drawn up for the present year.
 There was a stock of old cotton and yarn weighing approximately 430 maunds. Cotton weighing 850 maunds has been purchased at the new, that is, cheaper rate. All the cotton will be spun, but at the end of the year 350 maunds of yarn will remain on hand, unwoven. For this programme to be fulfilled the following amounts of money will have to reach homes of the poor by the end of the year.
Rs. 2,000 for carders
Rs. 1,000 for women preparing slivers
 Rs. 8,000 for spinning (distributed among 1,000 women) Rs. 14,000 for weaving and bleaching
 The Centre has four branches : at Chalala, Bagasara, Chittal and Babara. At the last place, work is done on a commission basis. In all, 17 persons work there, including a cook and a peon. The highest salary paid is Rs. 70 and next in order are Rs. 50 and Rs. 35. Five persons get Rs. 30 each. Then there is one man get- ting Rs. 25, two getting Rs. 20 each, two others getting Rs. 18 each, one getting Rs. 15, two others Rs. 12 each, and one more person getting Rs. 10. The monthly salary- bill comes to Rs. 455. Add to this Rs. 70 as rent, Rs. 55 travelling expenses and Rs. 10 postage, making a total of Rs. 590. The expenses incurred at the villages of Babara, Gariyadhar and Panch  Talavada, where work is done on commission basis, come to about Rs. 50  a  month.
 We shall now examine the costs. The old stock of cotton weighing 430 maunds was purchased at the rate of Rs. 22 per maund and the 850 maunds of new cotton at the rate of Rs. 13 per maund. The cost of cotton, therefore, comes to about Rs. 16 per maund. Hence :

 This 	comes to 6libtech_285_footnote annas 	per yard (of unbleached khadi; width 28 
 inches).  	Expenses on management have not been counted in working out this 	figure. The payment for carding is not always Rs. 3. It varies bet- 
 ween Rs. 2libtech_286_footnote
 2
and Rs. 3. Payment is at the rate of Rs. 3 only if the
 
 carding 	is of the highest quality. The rate of payment for spinning is 2 
  	paise per count, and the Rs. 7libtech_287_footnote  2 counted 	here is for yarn of seven 
  	counts. These rates, therefore, should be considered as approximate. 	The price at which the khadi is sold includes half an anna per yard 	added to the cost as worked out above, but that is not sufficient to 	defray the expenses on manage-ment. Shri Jivanlal’s grant will be 	utilized to meet this loss and any other loss which may occur will 	be met from the general collections made. But the aim is to  see  	that management expenses do not exceed one anna per rupee. This 	ideal, however, has not been realized any- where in the country. 	But, as we gain experience, the workers become more efficient and 	the quality of spinning improves, the expenses on management will 	come down. The position today is not what it was four years ago. The 	point which anyone who buys khadi should note is this, that 	deducting the half anna per yard for management expenses, the rest 	of the price they pay for 
 khadi, 	i.e., 6libtech_288_footnote annas 	per yard, goes into the pockets of the cultivators 
  	and the persons engaged in carding, spinning and weaving. If, even 	from this, we deduct the cost of cotton, the wages paid for carding, 	spinning and weaving come to one and a quarter times the cost of 	cotton. The reason for calling attention to all this is to tell the 	consumer who buys khadi that, if indigenous cotton is used in 	manufacturing all the cloth we require, not only will the cost of 	cotton be paid to our cultivators but the balance of the price paid 	by him will also go into the pockets of our workers. On the other 	hand, those who purchase foreign cloth send the money outside, and 	those who purchase mill cloth help to make the rich richer. The 	worker gets at the most one pice for every yard.  	The reader will now appreciate Abbas Sahib’s motive in undertaking 	a sale-tour of Kathiawar in such a hot season, and the reason why 	people should buy all the khadi he has. The women who are engaged in 	spinning have no other work or source of income, and the few pice 	they earn daily go a long way to help them. The purchaser of this 	khadi, therefore, helps these sisters and, along with them, those 	poor people who are engaged in weaving and carding, by providing 	them work.

  	I had your  telegram about Devdas. Dr. Dalal suspected appendicitis 	and advised operation. I had no hesitation in agreeing and so the 	operation was performed in the presence of Jamnalalji and Mahadev. I 	was not present but I saw him on Thursday on my way to Mahabaleshwar 	and Deolali where I went to see Mathuradas who is ailing. Devdas is 	doing quite well and expects to be discharged about the 25th 	instant. There is no cause for the slightest anxiety. I am dictating 	this at Mahabaleshwar which I reached this afternoon at about 5 	o’clock.  I am to see the Governor on Tuesdaylibtech_289_footnotelibtech_290_footnote.  	Here is a copy of the letterlibtech_291_footnotefrom Vithalbhai.   He came to    the Ashram after 	writing the letter. I told him about the conver- sation we had about 	the Speaker’s salary. He told me that he knew nothing of any 	arrangement for giving half or any portion of the salary to the 	party funds. I thereupon told him that I must consult you before 	accepting the cheque. Will you please tell me what is to be done ?

      PUNJAB COMPARATIVE FIGURES    	I am enabled this week to give the following comparative tableslibtech_299_footnoteof production and sale of khadi in the Punjab :  	Though the figures do not show the rise as in the Abhoy Ashram, the 	figures are nearly twice as much as in 1923-24 or 1924-25 during the 	corresponding period. This is no sign of khadi losing ground in the 	Punjab.  Young 	India, 20-5-1926      WAR OR PEACE    	It was not without purpose that I reproduced the main parts of Mr. 	Page’s very able pamphlet on the World War.libtech_300_footnoteI hope that the reader followed them with the care 	and attention the chapters deserved. Mr. Page has proved 	conclusively that both the parties were equally to blame and that 	both resorted to barbarous and inhuman practices. We did not need 	Mr. Page’s help to learn that no war of which history has any 	record took so many lives as this did. Moral loss was greater still. 	Poisonous forces destructive of the soul (lying and deception) were 	brought to perfection as much as the forces destructive of the body. 	The moral results have been as terrible as the physical. It is yet 	too early to measure the effect on mankind of the collapse of the 	sexual morality brought about by the War. Vice has usurped the 	throne of virtue. The brute in man has for the time being gained 	supremacy.  	The after-effects are, perhaps, more terrible than the actual and 	immediate effects. There is no stability about the government of any 	single State of Europe. No class is satisfied with its own 	condition.      1  Not 	reproduced here. These were for 1922-23 to 1925-26.  2  Vide 	“Notes”, 	26-11-1925. 
 Each wants to better it at the expense of the rest. War between the States has now become a war within each State.
 India has to make her choice. She may try, if she wishes, the way of war and sink lower than she has. In the Hindu-Muslim quarrel, she seems to be taking her first lesson in the art of war. If India can possibly gain her freedom by war, her state will be no better and will be, probably, much worse than that of France or England. Paste examples have become obsolete. Not even Japan’s comparative progress can be any guide. For,“the science” or war has  made  much  greater “progress” since the Russo-Japanese war. Its result can only be studied in the present condition of Europe. We can safely say that if India throws off the British yoke by the way of war, she must go through the state Mr. Page has graphically described.
 But the way of peace is open to her. Her freedom is assured if she has patience. That way will be found to be the shortest even though  it may appear to be the longest to our impatient nature. The way of peace insures internal growth and stability. We reject it because we fancy that it involves submission to the will of the ruler  who  has imposed himself upon us. But the moment we realize that the imposition is only so-called and that through our unwillingness to suffer loss of life or property, we are party to the imposition, all we need do is to change that negative attitude of passive endorsement. The suffering to be undergone by the change will be nothing compared to  the  physical suffering and the moral loss we must incur in trying the way of war. And the sufferings of war harm both the parties. The sufferings in following the way of peace must benefit both. They will be like the pleasurable travail of a new birth.
 Let us not be misled by a hasty generalization of the events of 1920-21. Great as the achievement of that brilliant period was, it was nothing compared to what it might have been, had we been true and had faith. Violence was in the breasts of many of us whilst with our lips we paid homage to non-violence. And, though we were thus false to our creed, so far as we had accepted it, we blamed it and lost faith instead of blaming and correcting ourselves. Chauri Chaura was a symptom of the disease that was poisoning us. Ours was claimed to be a peaceful, non- violent way. We could not sustain the claim in  its  fulness.  The  ‘enemy’s’ taunts we need not mind. They saw vilolence within.
The way of peace is the way of truth. Truthfulness is even more
 important than peacefulness. Indeed, lying is the mother of violence. A truthful man cannot long remain violent. He will perceive in the course of his search that he has no need to be violent and he will further discover that so long as there is the slightest trace of violence in him, he will fail to find the truth he is searching.
 There is no half way between truth and non-violence on the one hand and untruth and violence on the other. We may never be strong enough to be entirely non-violent in thought, word and deed. But we must keep non-violence as our goal and make steady progress towards it. The attainment of freedom, whether for a man, a nation or the world, must be in exact proportion to the attainment of non-violence as the only method of achieving real freedom, keep the lamp of non-violence burning bright in the midst of the present impenetrable gloom. The truth of a few will count, the untruth of millions will vanish even like chaff before a whiff of wind.

 employment in Australia, even if he were a very good engineer and could hold a piece of land, if at all, only in the name of a white trustee.
 This letter is an eye-opener. It was thought that in Australia there was no racial discrimination against those Asiatics who had settled there. But the correspondent’s letter, fortified as it is with an original letter from the Mines Department, leaves no room for doubt.
 TWO ANGLES OF VISION
 The deciding reason why with all the will in the world Europeans and Indians do not have hearty communion as a class is because we have different angles of vision. We say that reforms are inadequate, that the educated classes can best represent the masses and that we are one nation though differing in language and religion. It is not to  the purpose just now to prove the assertions. It is enough to state that educated India honestly holds the views set forth above.
 But the European view honestly held is set forth in the briefest and the   boldest   manner    in    manifestolibtech_304_footnoteaddressed    by    the    European Association to every European in India:
 How is it possible for the two to meet for common action in frank and free fellowship when the two stand as poles asunder in thought and aspirations as the manifesto clearly shows? A mere make-believe association or co-operation can only debase both, for they meet with mental reservations and mutual distrust. The situation is tragic; but ture. To end the tragedy, the first essential is to realize the truth of it. Union is desirable, it must come, but it will come only when we have begun to think the same thing. And that will come when we Indians show our earnestness and prove our belief in a common nationality and capacity for representing the masses by acting as one nation and suffering for the masses.

   LETTER TO JAISUKHLAL  
 ASHRAM,   SABARMATI,
 Saturday, May 22, 1926
  	I had been to Mahabaleshwar to see the Governor, from where I have 	returned today. I got your letter before I had left Mahabale-shwar. 	The Governor and I practically talked about nothing but the 	spinning- wheel movements. Devdas is quite well; he will leave the 	hospital in a few days. Kusum and Dhiru are still with Jaya. I met 	them too. They will leave Bombay on the 25th. I had also been to 	Deolali to see Mathuradas. His health may be described as fairly 	good. I met there Prabhudas and Vijaya, too. Prabhudas seems to have 	improved. He is under the treatment of some vaid.  	Is the fine yarn which you have with you also strong enough? If it 	is, can you arrange to get it woven by Wanjas? At Bagasra these 	people weave khadi out of very fine yarn. Formerly, they would not 	touch mill-yarn at all. Do you know that in the year 1915 we made 	special arrangements with them and had khadi woven out of such fine 	yarn? The Marwari teacher’s father in Amreli may also weave khadi 	out of fine yarn. The first thing to ascertain, therefore, is 	whether or not the yarn is strong. I shall think about this matter, 	whether the weaving can be done here. I do not know what happened 	about the strips of  khadi from Gariyadhar. In any case, I think it 	will be better if you can collect such strips. If people hesitate to 	give them, cannot you convince them that it is very necessary to 	have all the samples tested by one expert to ascertain whether both 	the warp and the woof in every sample are hand-spun, and therefore, 	strips have to be sent [to Ahmedabad]? If, however, sending strips 	is impossible, you may get the samples tested there with the help of 	any person selected by you and pay everyone as soon as his material 	is tested.

   MY NOTES  
 “V EGETABLE GHEE”
 Nowadays misuse of names has been on the incerease. Only cloth woven by hand from hand-spun yarn can be called khadi, but the mills give to the thick cloth produced by them the name of khadi. Again, some cheat the people by giving the name partial khadi to cloth woven by hand from mill-spun yarn. The same practice is followed in regard to ghee. Ghee is in fact a product made from milk; still there is now a new product called “vegetable ghee”. Coconut oil does not become ghee by merely calling it “vegetable ghee”, nor can it have the properties of ghee. Nowadays such synthetic ghee is being improted in large quantities. It is well packed and appears just like ghee; hence simple-minded people buy it. Moreover, since fat is sold under  the name of ghee or because it is mixed with ghee, many people use “vegetable ghee”, being afraid of using ghee.
 I shall not only use but even propagate vegetable ghee if a vegetable produce possessing the same properties as ghee is available. I find fault with the use of ghee. But I cannot disregard its good properties. It has not so far been possible to extract a product from vegetables which will serve as a substitute for ghee. Therefore, the product which is being sold as vegetable ghee has to be rejected on two counts : one, it is not ghee and two, it does not contain the properties of ghee. Thirdly, the harm done is that today we use many foreign  products and we have now unwillingly started using one more foreign product, much to our detriment. Therefore, everyone using “vegetable
 ghee” should beware and give up its use.
 HIGH  OR LOW?
A newspaper correspondent writes :libtech_308_footnote
 This is a difficult question. But from the point of ahimsa, there can be only one reply and that is that one who inflicts pain on small creatures for a selfish purpose also becomes low himself. Man is a mixture of humility and greatness. His greatness lies in his ability to be humble. If he does not have the capacity to be humble, he cannot be considered to be great. Then there will be no scope whatever for rising high. Therefore it is said that one who does not harm other creatures for achieving his own ends and is ready to suffer pain for the sake of all living beings is alone fit to attain the vision of the self.

   SOCIETIES FOR COW-PROTECTION  
Bhai Jivraj Nenshi writes as follows :libtech_309_footnote
 This is not a new suggestion. The All-India Goraksha Mandal has been established just for this purpose. But as I get more experience I realize the difficulties in the way of bringing all such societies together under one body and a common set of rules. I have asked for full details from as many societies as have sent their names and addresses. But very few of them have supplied the information asked for. It is not that they do not wish to send particulars, but probably lethargy or indifference or a feeling of shame prevents them from replying. The shame is on the score of lack of proper management, for I have seen institutions which were not properly managed and did not maintain proper accounts. At many places the people who run these institutions are so ill-educated that they simply cannot furnish the information asked for.  It is said that

 The letter is not translated here. The correspondent had suggested that the various bodies in the country for the protection of weak and infirm cattle should unite to form an all-India body and formulate a plan whereby they would maintain healthy cattle, supply pure milk to the people and from the income so derived look after weak and infirm cattle.
 
 there are some 1,500 goshalas is India. If they are  all  properly  managed and turned into dairies, there is no doubt at all  that  the problem of protecting the cows will be then very easy to solve.  But what  is the way to bring this about? Who will bell the cat? I will only say this, that it is necessary to infuse life into all these institutions. It is difficult to frame rules for them unless they work as model dairies and leather work-shops. The All-India Goraksha Mandal has not been indifferent to this task. Efforts are being made to plan a dairy with Sir Harold Mann’s help; and similarly plans for a leather work-shop are also being drawn up. Such experiments for the purpose of cow- protection being new, plans for them cannot be prepared immediately. The articles written by Shri Valji Desailibtech_310_footnotelibtech_311_footnoteand Mr. Galletti show that India stands lowest in regard to treatment of cattle. How can we, then, get experts in dairy science and leather work so easily?

 YOUR WIRE. WROTE FULLY SATURDAY. VIEW DIFFICULTIES FINANCIAL OTHERS MENTIONED YOUR LETTER SUGGEST CANCELLATION INVITATION.
   From 	a photostat : S.N. 11347  GANDHI 
      LETTER TO K. T. PAUL    THE 	 ASHRAM, 	 SABARMATI,  May 	23, 1926  DEAR 	FRIEND,  	I have your letter. I have not telegraphed to you because your 	letter do [es] not lend itself to a brief telegram. From your letter 	I gather that this proposed visit of mine is causing you a great 	deal of trouble and worry. Please do not worry over this thing. Do  	not in  any way consider that because you have been the vehicle for    
 conveying the invitation to me you must make it a certainty. You and I must look at this thing with complete detachment and undertake the mission only if the hand of God appears to be in it in the clearest manner possible. If then there is any question of forcing the pace you may retrace your step and dimiss the invitation from your mind as if it had never been sent.
 You mention the finance. That must be a consideration for the Central Council, not for you and me unless you are supposed to find the wherewithal. I would have gladly begged the necessary funds from a friend if it was thought necessary. But I hold it to  be  wrong  on principle, for those who invite me should bear the cost.
Again, as far as I am concerned I could go with just as much
 comfort in 3rd class as I would in 1st class. Given cleanliness and sufficient privacy and protection against bad weather, I would prefer deck to saloon passage. On my return from South Africa I took a 3rd class ticket from Cape Town to London and was none the worse for it. There was no deck passage available. But in the present case I suppose nothing but the saloon is to be thought of as a matter of show. But if the Central Committee undertook to carry me as a 3rd class passenger I should not regard it as an insult in any shape or form but the whole thing must be done by the Central Council or by those who are responsible for the invitation without any interference or prompting on my part.
 So far as goat’s milk is concerned I would not think of you or any of my companions being responsible for milking or keeping goats. It must be left to the steamship company. The managers must make what arrangements they choose. It is no easy matter for passengers to control such things on steamer. What would one do when there is a storm or if the goats die. Such things are always best left to the steamship owners. They know how to manage them.
 My companions would be two—Mahadev Desai and Devdas Gandhi, my youngest son. At first I had intended to take only one but I feel that in the present state of my physical condition and public engagements which I must carry out whether I am stationary or not these two assistants are necessary. I should consider it a privilege to have you also as a helper but I am afraid you could not take the place of either Mahadev Desai or Devdas. What class they should travel is not  a matter of any moment but if they are to travel by a class lower to mine there must be an arrangment with steamship owners so as to enable me
 
 to have access to them all the time I want them for my assistance. Needless to say both are vegetarians.
 I suppose you remember what I stated in my first letter to you that passports and everything else will have to be managed by the inviting party.
 I now conclude as I began and repeat that all things considered it would be better for you to drop the idea of my visit to Finland.

 THE  ASHRAM,  SABARMATI,
 May 23, 1926
 MY DEAR FRIEND,
 
 I have your letter. I knew that you would take the blow—for such it is from a worldly standpoint—bravely. I do believe  that  truly  speaking we can say that God had no more work for Shums Tyabji in the body that is now lying peacefully in the grave and fast being  reduced to dust. If you had no faith in God and no faith in the persistence of the soul after the dissolution of the body and you refused to shed tears, you would be considered callous. But as I know that you have faith in the persistence of the soul and in the Divinity that permeates the universe your refusal to give way to grief is a sign of resignation to the will of God and an appreciation of the true nature of death.
 Jamnalalji is still in Bombay and you can see him yourself. I shall write to him. Do you know that Devdas is in Sir Harikisendas Hospital?
 Yours sincerely,

 I know that Stokes is doing great and good work and gives his all to it. How I should love to convince him that he does not need Government recognition for his school. There must be some method of enabling the boys to earn their own living without the Government patronage. The path is not easy but it is the only one that he or shall I say we must tread. However I must not criticize. He must work by the light of his own conscience even though to an outsider he may seem to be erring.
 If I go to Finaland at all, I shall bear in mind all your caution and take with me a wardrobe full of warm clothing and I promise, if I feel the cold so much, to wrap myself out of recognition.  If I go to Finland   I shall see that all the notes that are taken you receive a copy of. Meanwhile send me all the questions that arose in your mind.
 The path of ahimsa, I know, is thorny. At every step the thorns prick and sometimes bleed one.
 I was out for nearely a week passing a few hours with the Governor at Mahabaleshwar trying to persuade him that the only recommendation that the Royal Commission on Agriculture can make is to popularize the charkha and assure the masses that all the yarn that they can spin will be taken up by the Government and woven for the people.
 With love to you all including the baby with kiss added for it.  I do not know whether it is he or she.
 Yours sincerely.

 DEAR FRIEND,
I have your letter and the parcel of khadi for which I thank you.
 If you persist long enough you will find that you have all the assistance you need. Your yarn is not as even as it might be nor as strong. You must attempt to spin better.
 Your weaving is also not close enough but all these things are merely a matter of practice and practice will make you perfect.
 Yours sincerely,

 MY DEAR DEVADHAR,
 I have your letter. It will be pleasure to meet you whenever you can come. And when you do come of course you will stay at the Ashram. I know that you are not likely to come here before the rains have probably set in. At the present moment we are boiling here. I don’t want you to find yourself in the oven with us.
 I hope Mrs. Devadhar is better now. She must come next winter  to the Ashram and pass a few days here.
When you return you will send me a report about Manorama.
 Yours sincerely,

 MY DEAR INDRA,
 I have your letter. I am replying to you in English as you have chosen to write to me in English. But why in English? My promise of swaraj   in   1921   was   conditional.libtech_313_footnoteThe   condition   was   absolute acceptance of non-violent non-co-operation by the people at large. At Viramgam, Bombaylibtech_314_footnotelibtech_315_footnoteand Chauri Chauralibtech_316_footnotelibtech_317_footnotethese conditions were broken not by the masses but by live Congressmen. If I am silent about what is called the political aspect of the situation I am silent because through my silence I am preaching non-violence. I cannot say anything useful on the many controversial questions that are troubling the country today. And If I am harping upon the charkha in season and out of season again it is because the charkha to me represents non-violence in  a concrete shape, for, non-violence is action in the correct sense of the term whereas violence is bad action or in action.libtech_318_footnotelibtech_319_footnoteIf people want swaraj through non-violence means they can attain it by complete exclusion of foreign cloth and through the charkha and all it means. During the year of grace 1921, I had the hope that we should achieve boycott of foreign cloth by a sudden and simultaneous manifestation of the charkha spirit on the part of the people. That was not to be.  And  now we have to build the   charkha atmosphere among the people.  I  do not think it will be so long as you imagine before the charkha becomes universal. But even if it  does,  thinking  non-violence  I cannot think of any other instrument or activity.
 I see you expect a public reply to your question. Do you really want a public reply? I am more anxious to convince you of the soundnes of my position than to discuss with others or in Young India the question raised by you.

   LETTER TO C. RAJAGOPALACHARI  
 
THE  ASHRAM,  SABARMATI,
 May  23,  1926
 Here is a letter from Santanam in reply to mine. I shall no longer strive with him but wish him every success in his struggle. His is a very good letter.
 I saw your letter to Jamnalalji yesterday in Bombay. I hope you have already got rid of pleurisy. With proper care this is a complaint that can be brought under subjection without difficulty. Where do you think your tour should commence? If it is to be in the Southern Presidency and if you do not propose to come to Ahmedabad before commencing the tour, Jamnalalji told me he would join you wherever you want him to. If, however, you consider that the Southern Presidency should for the time being be left alone, some other province can be selected. The selection will then be made here. If it will be too late for your letter to reach here you will telegraph your intentions. In no case will you think of commencing the tour, if you have not got rid of your pleurisy entirely, because more travelling is likely to do some good. Travelling in the monsoon has its danger for a pleurisy patient.
 I need not entertain you with a description of my talks with the Governor. You may know in one sentence that I began the talk and ended it with the charkha. And for the 2nd interview, like the good advertising agent I am, I took with me Mithubai’s khaddar saris to demonstrate to the Governor and his wife the possibilities of Andhra khadi. The Governor listened to all I had to say about the spinning- wheel with great attention but, if you ask me how much he was impressed I cannot say.
 I saw Mathuradas, Kaka, Devdas and Behram Khambhatta. My rapid wandering was worth while if only to see these precious petients. Devdas is all right and much healthier looking than he was while he was admitted to the Hospital. Kaka has made splendid progress but he must cover still more ground. Mathuradas is better than he was but he cannot be said to be out of wood entirely. Not that there is any danger imminent but he has to take extraordinary care of himself. Behram Khambhatta has some intestinal growth. You may not know him. He  is one of the devoted, selfless and silent workers always deliberately putting himself in the background. And his wife is equally good, an incarnation of Sita.
 
 If it will serve as any stimulation for you to become stronger I present you with the information that ten to one I shall not be going to Finland, for, Paul seems to have put his foot into it. Any way he is at  sea and does no know how to manage me or my travelling. He offers  to milk the she-goat, evidently thinking that it would be the buisness of my attendants to perform the ceremony from day to day. However the thing will be finally decided within the next fortnight at the most.

 DEAR SATIS BABU,
 
 I have your letter. I have a long letter at last from Hema Prabha Devi. It seems to me that she is living at Sodepur under most trying circumstances. She must not do it at the sacrifice of her health. If the climate there is malarial you must find out some other way of building the workshop than by putting Hema Prabha Devi there and making her the first victim. Your own body should also be kept up to the mark which Hema Prabha Devi thinks is not being done.
 Nirmal Kumar has done well. I am writing to him. If you can  get something from Lalgola it will be good help. I am told that Chhotalal has now left you. I do not think he will stop there long.

 I have your letter. It was my duty to have gone to you. I have started reading Mrs. Eddy’s book. I will certainly write to you after I have finished it. But meanwhile I would suggest to you that you should consult a doctor or a vaid for general advice and use ordinary medicines, and take the utmost care of your health. There is no sin in taking proper care of one’s health, but it is a great sin to forsake one’s dharma for the sake of one’s body. We should treat the body as the field in which the atman strives and wins its liberation, and take every innocent measure to preserve it. Please write to me from time to time and keep me informed about your health. Convey my blessings to Tehminabehn.

 I have not yet had your dictated letter. I can wait for it. All I can report to you about Mahabaleshwar is that I had pleasant three hours with the Governor. We talked mostly about the spinning-wheel and somewhat about the cattle of India. If there was anything more behind this interview, I did not fathom it. Nor did I try to.
 Devdas expects to be discharged in a week’s time and is likely to go to Mussoorie for convalescene.

ASHRAM,
  Wednesday, 	May 26, 1926  CHI. 	DEVDAS,  	I got your letter, and also Lalji’s. Yesterday I dictated my 	letter in a hurry, and so one thing was left out. The faintness that 	you felt when you tried to stand up was not weakness, it was the 	result of your not having had the practice of standing and walking 	for some time. Perhaps you may not remember that, when  Colonel  	Maddock permitted me to walk to the lavatory during daytime, he 	warned me that my legs might tremble and I might feel giddy, but 	told me not to be alarmed on that account. After you have walked 	once or twice with some support, you will get back the ability to 	walk. Hence I am not in the least wor-ried because of your having 	felt giddy when you tried to stand up. But I also see that your 	wound has not completely healed; this is a common enough experience 	in such operations. No doctor can understand all the facts about the 	condition of the patient’s body, and, therefore, some complication 	always develops after an operation, but it can be easily cured. The 	only thing is that the period of your convalescence is becoming a 	little too long.I have now concluded that Lalji and you will be 	discharged at about the same time. This, I think, sould please you, 	though what you wanted was that you should get well but should have 	the privilege of staying on for Lalji’s sake. It seems that you 	will not have that privilege. If,however, all our wishes were 	granted, would not the world perish? As against one good wish, based 	on regard for truth, entertained by one person, how many wicked 	wishes, based on disregard for truth, would there be entertained by 	others?  	Yesterday I got a telegram from Paul, and there was second one 	today. He informs that he has collected Rs. 6,000 and hopes that I 	will not think it necessary to cancel the trip. I will wait for a 	reply to my letter, but it seems to me that we shall have to go. By 	not going, we may perhaps put Mr. Paul in an embarrassing position.  	I was glad to read all that you write about Dr. Dalal’s kindness. 	I was glad that Abbas Saheb went and saw you; the man’s courage is 
 boundless. Keshu has stayed back, and is bound to be of some help to you.
It will do if he arrives here on the 29th.

   QUARTERLY FIGURES  
 The All-India Spinners’ Association has received from most provinces quarterly returns of production and sale of khadi between January and March 1926.  I give the figureslibtech_326_footnotebelow :
 The Andhra figures give no indication of the extent of the work that is being done. In spite of several reminders full reports from that province are not available. The Karnatak figures also are largly incomplete.    The   figureslibtech_327_footnotefor   comparison   with  the   corresponding quarter of the last year are available in the case of the following provinces and it will be seen that all the provinces except Bombay show larger figures this year.
 The higher figure for the Punjab sales last year is only apparent because the sales this year are given net while the figure of last year includes inter-sales between branches. Burma and Utkal sales show a slight decrease.
 The figures are an under-statement for every province, more espe-cially for Andhra Desha. I once more urge the workers in every province to be prompt in their returns. If the All-India Spinners’ Association is to become an efficient organization covering  every village of India, it must have the disciplined and intelligent  co-  operation of all its workers.
 Young India, 27-5-1926
 
   ITS MEANING  
 On my return from Mahabaleshwar I was waylaid, though by previous appointment, by fellow non-co-operators. I  had  limited myself strictly to visiting patients during this unexpected visit to His Excellency the Acting Governor at Mahabaleshwar. And so before reaching Poona station I had arranged just to go to Prof. Trivedi’s house to see my young friend Manu who among others had been to
 
 me at the Sassoon Hospital in Poona in 1924 an angel of mercy. It was during this visit that I had to divide my time between Manu and the non-co-operators. The latter had the lion’s share of it. Manu  disengaged me in a few minutes. I envied him as a patient. For though he has been laid up in bed for over six mon-ths, I found him quite cheerful and resigned. I had therefore no compunc-tion about leaving him for a chat with the non-co-operating friends.
 “How can you go to the Governor and call yourself a non-co- operator?” was the question with which I was greeted.
 “I knew what your ailment was, ” said I. “I shall answer all your questions fully, but on condition that nothing of what I say is to be published by you. If I find it advisable I shall deal with the matter in the pages of Young India.”
 “Yes, we won’t publish anything and shall be satisfied if you will answer our questions in Young India. Not that I have any doub about the propriety of your action,” added the questioner, “but I represent a large number of non-co-operators whom you often confound by your unexpectted acts.”
Well, then, let me have all your question and I shall endea- vour
 to answer them though I confess that it will be all a waste of  time.  For  I feel that time is past for explanations and persuasion. Non-co- operators must instinctively know that I not likely  to do  anything contrary to our code. And if I do,—for I admit I am lible to err,—they must disown me and remain firm in their own convictions. They may have derived their non-co-operation from me but if they have assimilated it, their convictions must not depend upon mine. It must be independent of me and my weaknesses and errors. If I turn traitor, or to put it mildly, if I alter my opinion, they must be ready to denounce me and still abide by their own convictions. That is why I say that our conversation will be a waste of national time.
 Convinced non-co-operators know their task. Let them fulfil it. But  let me have your questions. “
 It has been suggested in Bombay that you went to the Governor uninvited, in fact you forced yourself upon his attention. If so, was it not co-operation even without response? What could you have to do with the Governor, I wonder?”
 My answer is that I am quite capable even of forcing myself upon the attention of my opponent when I have strength. I did so in South Africa. I sought interviews after inerviews with General Smuts
 
 when I knew that I was ready for battle. I pleaded with him to avoid the untold hardships that the Indian settlers must suffer, if the great historic  marchlibtech_328_footnotelibtech_329_footnotehad   to   be   undertaken.     It   is  true   that   he   in   his haughtiness turned a deaf ear; but I lost nothing. I gained added strength by my humility. So would I do in India when we are strong enough to put up a real fight for freedom. Remember that ours is a non-violent struggle. It presupposes humility. It is a truthful struggle and consiousness of truth should give us firmness. We are not out to destroy men. We own no enemy. We have no ill-will against a single soul on earth. We mean to covert by our suffering. I do not despair of converting the hardest-hearted or the most selfish Englishman. Every opportunity of meeting him is therefore welcome to me.
 Let me distinguish. Non-violent non-co-operation means renuncia-tion of the benefits of a system with which we non-co- operate. We therefore renounce the benefits of schools, courts, titles, legislatures and offices set up under the system. The most extensive and permanent part of our non-co-operation consists in the  renunciation of foreign cloth which is the foundation for the vicious system that is crushing us to dust. It is possible to think of other  items of non-co-operation. But owing to our weakness or want of ability, we have restricted ourselves to these items only. If then I go to any official for the purpose of seeking the benefits above-named, I co- operate. Whereas if I go to the meanest official for the purpose of converting him, say to khaddar, or weaning him from his service or persuading him to withdraw his children from Government schools, I fulfil my duty as a non-co-operator. I should fail if I did not go  to him with that definite and direct purpose.
 Now for the case in point. I went to the Acting Governor at his instance. He wrote to me not as Governor nor for any  purpose connected with his office as Governor. He invited me to go to Mahabaleshwar to discuss with him agricultural matters. As I explained some time ago in the pages of Navajivan, I told him that I could not be identified with the Royal Commission in any way, that I was still confirmed in my views on non-co-operation and generally had no faith in Commisions. I added further that it would suit me to see him when he descened to the plains. His Excellency therefore wrote saying it would suit him to meet me in June. But susbequently he changed his
 
 mind and sent a message that it would suit him better if I could go to Mahabaleshwar. I had no hesitation in going there. We had two very pleasant and long talks. And you are entitled to guess (and that correctly) that our talk revolved round the charkha. That was the central theme. And I could not discuss agriculture without discussing the terrific cattle problem!
 I have given but a brief summary of the pleasant conversation I had with the No-change friend. In parts I have amplified my answer in order to make it more intelligible to the general reader.
 There were many other points discussed, of which I must mention one or two. I was asked to give my opinion on the Sabarmati pact. I refused to say anything for publication. I must not add to the existing bitterness into the controversy. I can say nothing that would bring the parties together. They are all my co-workers. They are all patriots. The quarrel is purely domestic. It behoves me as a humble servant of the country to be silent where speech is useless. I prefer therefore to wait and pray. I was told that I was misrepresented. I must own that I have studiously avoided reading the literature about the pact. I am used to misrepresentation all my life. It is the lot of every public worker. He has to have a tough hide. Life would be burdensome if every misrepresentation had to be answered and cleared. It is a rule of life with me never to explain misrepresen-tations except when  the cause requires correction. This rule has saved much time and worry.
 “But what should we do when all accept offices and what should we do at the forthcoming elections?” was the last question. My answer was:
 When the acceeptance of office by all parties becomes a settled fact I presume those who have conscientious scruples will refrain from voting altogether. At the forthcoming elections, too, those who have conscientious objections will refrain. The others will naturally follow the Congress lead and vote as the Congress directs. I have given my definition of a Congressman already in these pages. Not every man who says, “I am a Congressman” is such, but only he who does the will of the Congress.

   SPINNING  AN  ART  
A   Madras  Inspectress  of   Education  has   pronounced sentence
 
 against the spinning-wheel for Brahmin girls. This judgment of hers has given rise to criticism against the lady. If the charkha is good enough for non-Brahmin girls why not, it is argued, for Brahmin girls? The question is apposite when caste arrogance is being levelled to the ground. Moreover the Inspectress evidently does not know that the finest yarn is spun by Brahmin girls and that in many Brahmin families the tradition of spinning for the sacred thread is still kept up.
 But a side question has arisen out of the criticism of the Inspectress. Is spinning an art? Is it not a humdrum monotonous process likely to weary the children? Well all the evidence hitherto collected goes to show that spinning is an elegant art and the process itself is extremely pleasant. No mechanical pull is enough to draw the various counts. And those who do spinning as an art know the pleasure they derive when the fingers and the eyes infallibly guide the required count. Art to be art must soothe. I reproduced over a year ago the testimony of Sir Prabhashankar Pattani to show how after the day’s trying work he went to the charkha for soothing his nerves and giving him undisturbed sleep. I extract the following passage from the letter of a friend who found solace for her shattered nerves in spinning:
 When . . . .I hastened to my room and then in the dark struggled  with  an anguish which rent me from top to toe, I prayed and strove for some time and then turned to the spinning-wheel and found in it a magical comfort. The quiet regular motion of its rhythm immediately steadied me and the thought of its service brought me nearer to God.
This is not the solitary experience of one or two but many
 spinners. It is however no use saying that spinning will be pleasurable to all because it has been the joy of many. Painting is acknowledged to be an exquisite art. But it is not everybody who takes to it.

In 	less time than that, one can learn the elementary principles of 	spinning and weaving, but experience has shown that this is not 	enough. If persons with inadequate practice settle in villages, they 	may come to feel disappointed.  The monthly expenses will probably  	come to Rs.  	15. If you wish to send Surendrarai, write either to me or the 	Manager so that we may arrange about his board and lodging before 	asking him    
 to  come  over.	At present the Ashram is pretty full and it may, therefore, take some time before he can be admitted.

            DEAR 	FRIEND,   LETTER TO DR. NORMAN LEYS   THE 	 ASHRAM, 	 SABARMATI,  May 	28, 1926 
  	I have your letter of the 26th ultimo forwarded through Mr. Vaze.libtech_333_footnotelibtech_334_footnoteI 	thank you for that latter.  I appreciate it for I know that it is 	only by a frank exchange of views that we come nearer one another. 	For me the word ‘political’ is inclusive. I do not divide 	different activities—political, social, religious, economical—into 	water-tight compartments. I look upon them all as one indivisible 	whole each running into the rest and affected by the rest. I also 	believe with you that our political freedon properly so called will 	depend upon our ability to solve many of our domestic problems such 	as the communal trouble. In other words, it will depend upon 	internal reforms. The outward will be merely therefore a symptom of 	the inward. I do not at all hold that this communal problem is 	insoluble. It seems to defy human effort for the time being. But I 	have the fullest faith in our ability finally to solve it. It may be 	of course that before we reach a solution there will be bloody 	fights between the two. In spite of all efforts sometimes they 	become as it were unavoidable.  	I would however like to add a word of caution against thinking, if 	you did think, that these communal troubles are not due to our 	dependence upon the British rule. It is my conviction that rule is 	based upon the policy of ‘divide and rule’ which policy 	sometimes English officials have been frank enough to admit. If the 	Government chose, it can certainly contribute much to a speedy and 	permanent solution.   
 But if I mention this I do so not to excuse our inability to solve the problem without the help of the rulers, but I mention it to explain our difficulty.
 Yours second point is too difficult for me to pronounce an opinion upon. I am not an attentive student of European politics or European history to be able to draw the distinction that you do between the European States where Roman Catholicism is predominant and where Protestantism is predominant. And, for the  reason  I  would  prefer to hold silence upon the third point which is equally intresting as the second. There is no doubt that mankind is affected largely by the way it looks upon God. So far as India is concered the vast majority think of God as the Monitor within each one of us. Even the illiterate masses know that God is only one, that He is all-pervading, and, therefore, is the witness of all our actions.
 If you wish to elucidate further the two points of your letter which at present I understand but partialy and if you can find time, I shall read your elucidation with all the attention I am able to give to it. And I know that I shall profit by it.

It was then put among my jacket which 	I was not able even to look at in Mahabaleshwar. I reached these 	papers only yesterday but I have not yet been able to go through the 	statement which I shall do in a day or two. But I think I have told    
 
 
 
 
 you that had I known that the complaint was about your father, I would not have sent the telegram without first referring the matter to you. I suppose you want my opinion for your satisfaction which I shall give gladly. You have sent me two copies of the same letter about yourself.
 I am sending you Rs. 100 by insured post today. You will tell me if you need more. Mahadev was asking me only the other day whether you were likely to return in the early future. And I told him I thought that from all the accounts you had sent me about Guruji your place was more near him than me. And even now you will not leave him unless you yourself feel absolutely sure that he could be safely left. If, however, you can come it will be quite handy because at the present moment both Pyarelal and Devdas are away. But there is another question to be considered. What if I go at all it will be on the 1st of July that is the day the last steamer that can enable me to reach Finland in time leaves Bombay docks. The matter will be decided probably by the end of this week, certainly by the end of next. If I must go I propose to take Mahadev and Devdas with me. There will be  a lot of work left behind to be done. But whether you would come down for that work and leave Guruji is a question I feel for separate consideration. In every case Guruji’s health should have the paramount consideration with you.
 Devdas is going on all right though he is still in the hospital. He  is likely to be discharged inside of a week. Lalji has undergone an operation and occupies the same room as Devdas. These two patients are in Sir Harikisendas Hospital. Yeshwant Prasad also has been ailing. Several minor operations have been performed on him. He had guinea-worms.
 I am sorry to hear that your sister has become widowed. Do please convey my sympathies to her. I am carefully going through all the cuttings that Guruji sends me. Some of them are valuable. I had never seen “Muhamed’s treaty” before. I knew that his successors had entered into a treaty of that character with the Cristians and the Jews.

           DEAR 	FRIEND,   LETTER TO JOHN HAYNES HOLMES   THE 	ASHRAM, SABARMATI,  May 	28, 1926 
 I 	have your kind letter of the 14th April last. I am surprised at 
 
 
 
 
 your not receiving my cable which I sent you on the 16th February last giving you an affirmative reply. I have not assigned copyright to anybody as yet because I have been in correspondence with you and because you cabled to me that you were in correspondence with the Macmillans. If the English-speaking public outside India is sufficiently interested in these chapters I do not mind selling the copyright though I have never done it before. The idea of making anything out of my writings has been always repugnant to me. But your cable tempted me and I felt that there might be no harm in my getting money for the copyright and using it for the charkha propaganda or the uplift of the suppressed classes. And I felt that if the chapters were published by a house of known standing the message contained in the chapters might reach a wider public. You may please therefore continue your negotiations whether for copyright in America or for both America and Europe. I have several letters from German and other friends for copyright in their respective states but to all I have sent a reply saying that they should wait.
 Meanwhile as I am receiving repeated applications for back numbers of Young India containing the chapters, I am arranging to issue the first part in book form so as to satisfy this demand.

 THE  ASHRAM,  SABARMATI,

 DEAR FRIEND,
 
 I have your letter. I think that you should try to persuade your parents to let you go to Shantiniketan. But till you have obtained their permission it will be better for you to remain where you are and retain your peace. There should be satisfaction in your agreeing  to  the wishes of your parents however unpleasant that may be. Disobedience of parents’ wishes is justified when obedience will be a moral breach. The same things applies to swimming. You should reason with your parents and get their permision to learn swimming. If they supervised your swimming probably they would not be afraid.
 It is necessary to declare one’s deceptions to those whom one has deceived. It is a cleansing process. The shock received by the parents by confession would be a momentary one. The reason for confession of sin is precisely the reason that requires us to rub and clean a dirty surface. What scrubbing and washing is for removing
 
 dirt on a material body, confession is for removing dirt on the spiritual plane.

 I am so delighted that you are in “excellent health”. Shankerlal must have written to you. But, in any case, I expect you  to report yourself at the Ashram on the 15th June. Whilst you are touring certainly leave Lakshmi here.
 Chhotalal is just now travelling here, there and everywhere. He
 
 has got the blues. He went to Khadi Pratishthan and passed a few days with Satis Babu. He is now in Wardha. I suggested that he should stay with you for some months and help you in your work. He was not inclined to do so because he said he would gladly render personal service if you need it but otherwise he did not know that he will feel comfortable. Now, however, he writes asking me if you will have him. He still harps on personal services. But whatever he does, whether he helpes you in the khadi work or whether he becomes your cook, waiter and sanitary attendant or whether he weaves your khadi, I suggest your having him on his terms. And if you find him moody you may ask me to withdraw him. If he wishes to tour with you let him do that. But you know him best. Are you prepared to have him? Or will you rather discuss the thing when you are here?
 Your curse on the Finland visit is likely to bear fruit; for, a letter I have written to K. T. Paul seems to have put him in a fix. I have told him that he must look upon  this proposed visit with complete detachment.libtech_338_footnotelibtech_339_footnoteBut it appears to me that he has prompted the invitation and that the World Committee of the Y.

  DRAFT  HOUSING  SCHEME  FOR  MILL-WORKERSlibtech_340_footnote 
 The additional sums that may be received, if the demand for increase in wages is conceded, should be utilized for one year to implement a housing scheme for workers. Under this scheme, it is intended to build houses for workers, which would meet the health requirements of the workers, and provide them necessary amenities and yet not be beyond the means of the ordinary working man.
 In every locality with houses built under this scheme, every provision will be made to meet the common needs of the workers living
 
 there and provide them other facilities. These will include, funds permitting, schools, gardens, halls with facilities for playing games, libraries, shops and dispensaries.
 A committee consisting of representative of the Labour Union and the the Millowners’ Association—the former being in a majority—will implement this scheme in accordance with the  conditions of the Trust, will look after the properties and manage the fund. The management of the properties will be with the Labour Union. All workers employed in the mills during the current year and entitled to an increase in their wages will be regarded as joint owners of the funds of the Trust and the property purchased with that money. The share of each worker in the property will be in proportion to his contrbution to the fund. Each such worker who is a joint owner of the property will be given a share certificate. Shareholders will not be permitted to sell or mortgage their shares to any person or body other than the Trust except in accordance with the conditions to be laid down by the Trust. Houses will be allotted to workers on the results of lots drawn for the purpose. The claims of shareholders will receive priority. The decision to implement this scheme will be taken after obtaining in writing the votes of workers in every department and ascertaining whether there is a two-thirds majority in favour of it.
 If it is decided to utilize the increased quantum of wages in this manner, no demand for a further increase in wages will be made for a period of one year thereafter, and if, in violation of this condition, any workers go on strike for increase in wages, such workers will not be entitled to take benefit of this scheme for a period to be decided by the Trustees.

 Shri Pragati Khandubhai Desai, who was sentenced to two years’ imprisonment for his articles in Navayuga, was released  from Sabarmati Jail on the 22nd of this month. Though in the beginning
 he was much harassed by the authorities, he passed the later part of his term, specially after he had been transferred to Karachi, in great peace and comfort, with the result that he is now in excellent health. While in jail, he also got plenty of time to read and think quietly. At present, he has gone to Surat to meet his wife, and also Shri Kalyanji and other co- workers to consult them on what work he should take up now.
 
 REQUEST FROM EAST AFRICA
A young man from Nairobi writes:libtech_341_footnote
 I congratulate this team of young men. If their monthly is being started for the sole purpose of public service, I wish it all success. I welcome his remark about people who wear khadi. The correspondent understands my love for khadi, but not the reasoning which inspires this love. I, therefore, welcome this opportunity to explain that reasoning. He may be surprised to learn that I do not recommend khadi for improving the conditions of Indians in East Afria; even if I did, out of blind attachment for khadi, I would have to use the word ‘khadi’ in an absolutely diffrent and a much wider sense. But I have no such attachment and, therefore, I can  safely  say  that  khadi  is almost useless in fighting the hardships of our people in East Africa. I would not advise people living near the North Pole to use the spinning wheel. If our countrymen in East Africa occasion-ally used khadi, that would certainly be a good thing, for they would show thereby their appreciation of the circumstances in India. But there is no doubt that, for improving their own lot, what they need to do is to become united. That would be only the first step; and it would not be enough. Indians there are accused of being dirty, and there is a good measure of truth in the charge. They must give up their dirty habits. There is some truth in the other charge too, that they are miserely. Miserliness here means excessive economy in our way of living. In a foreign country we cannot afford to have the same room to serve us as a shop, as living room and as kitchen. There we earn more and it is necessary, therefore, to adopt a higher standard of living. If we do not, we may be justly charged with unfair competition. The other tradesmen will certainly not like one who, in disregard of accepted buisness standards, lives in extreme want and brings down the market prices. We should not give any such cause for complaint and jealousy.
 
 The Indians in East Afria should also take suitable measures to spread education in their midst. It is beyond doubt  that,  if  their children grow up without education, they would not be able to compete with the British population there. If, moreover, there is any truth in what I have heard, that the Indians in East Africa, instead of emulating the virtues of the British, have freely taken to their vices, such as drinking and immorality, they would do well to keep aloof from these. Finally, in order to live there with self-respect they should cultivate strength for satyagraha, that is, for the utmost suffering in the cause of public welfare. Provided they do this, they would deserve little blame for not wearing khadi. Without wearing khadi, they will have done their duty of preserving their self-respect.

  NON-CO-OPERATION AND EDUCATIONlibtech_342_footnote 
 A reader of Navajivan writes as follows:libtech_343_footnote
 Personally, I have not become lukewarm in the slightest degree about  any  aspect  of non-co-operation. My  views  about education remain what they were in 1920-21, and could I but persuade the students or their guardians, not a single student would remain in the Government schools. If I do not discuss this  matter  in  the Navajivan as frequently as I used to do, it is because the time is past for delivering speeches or writing articles in order to get the schools vacated. What we have to do now is to strentgthen the schools which have held on unflinchingly to the principles of non-co-operation. It pains me to have to admit that, unlike the khadi movement, that of national education is not showing progress. Indeed, as far as the number of schools and that of students are concerned, the movement is on the ebb. I do not hesitate to comment on this fact when the
 
 occasion demands, but I see no need to do that every day. The fact of the ebb does not make me lose heart about the future. If we do not give up faith, this ebb is bound to be followed by a full tide. I am quite confident that, if the schools which have held fast to non-co-operation continue to do so sincerely and do not compromise in regard to any of the basic principles of non-co-operation, the results will be good. I know that the Proprietary High School is in serious difficulty.  Some  of the teachers and a good many students have left it. But why should that matter? We have to carry on the work of non-co-operation neither in a spirit of impulsive imitation nor as a “policy” or useful expedient. Those who have remained faithful to non-co-operation rely on their own strength and have confidence in themselves. Quite possibly they may yet have to pass through trying times. If they have to, I hope that like gold which, when heated, shines brighter still, the non-co-operators will come out brighter from the test. Those alone will be true non-co- operators who hold out till the end. Whether there is only one such non-co-operator or there are many, it is he or they who will win swaraj for the country. What Sardar Sardul Singh said recently in a speech in the Punjab is true. There can be no co-operation between a tiger and a lamb. There can be real co-operation only between equals. In the existing circumstances, to describe any association between the Government and the people as co-operation is a misuse of the word “co-operation” When we are strong enough  to get  our  terms accepted, co-operation will follow as a matter of course and that will be real co-operation.
 But the fact that misunderstandings about non-co-operation continue to prevail indicates that we still do not know the real nature of the movement. Our non-co-operation is not satanic or violent, uncivil or malicious. In peaceful non-co-operation, there is no room for contempt for anyone. Non-co-operation will in no way be discredited if Shri Anandashanker’slibtech_344_footnotelibtech_345_footnoteknowledge and ability are utilized  for  the benefit of the Vidyapith. We have not co-operated with the Government in any way by making him Chairman of the Commission for the Vidyapith. On the contrary, the latter has not only honoured itself by inviting him to be the Chairman, but has demonstrated the true nature of non-co-operation, for non-violent non-co-operation bears no ill-will towards individuals. We may certainly take advantage of the virtue even of a Viceroy as a human being, provided that in doing so
 
 we do not avail ourselves of his official position; if we refuse to take such advantage, we would show ourselves stupid non-co-operators.
 In running an institution like the Vidyapith, we are not wasting public money but are putting it to quite good use. We are not here looking at the matter from the point of view of those who look upon non-co-operation as sin. Those who contributed money for the Vidyapith believe in the principles of non-co-operation. Their money is not wasted if it is used for carrying on this great experiment in the field of education; it is true, of course, that as the numbers diminish, the organizers, the teachers and the students should show correspondinlgy greater strength of character. Only then will public money have been well used. If the university to be established by the Government draws away our teachers, I would conclude that they did not have sincere faith in non-co-operation. The establishment of that university should have the effect of increasing our devotion to duty. It may well be attractive from the point of view of money and prestige, but I know it will not lead us to swaraj. Here, on the other hand, the teachers may have to put up with poverty and ridicule, but I cannot give up my faith that through it we are advancing step by step towards our goal of swaraj.

 The reader will find elsewhere in this issue some information collected by Shri Lakshmidas concerning the progress of spinning in Gujarat. We can see from it that even in big cities like Ahmedabad and Nadiad spinning has been adotped only by a few isolated individuals. We must admit that it has a very limited field, but we can see that for those women who do spinning it is the only work they can take up. No effort is made to induce a woman to take up spinning if she can earn more through some other work. The spinning-wheel has a place in our life which nothing else can fill. It has been conceived only for those people who have no other honest means of livelihood, but in a vast and thickly populated country like India spinning is the only work which crores can take up. If people can be found to ply it for money even in cities like Ahmedabad and Nadiad, we can easily imagine how useful it can prove in the villages. If we do not hear the sweet music of
 this annapurna, the spinning-wheel, in the homes of the poor, it is for lack of sufficient number of dedicated, self-sacrificing and intelligent workers.
 There is, of course, the other equally strong reason for this state of affairs, namely, that very little khadi is used in Gujarat. It will come to be universally used, like wheat and ghee, and all the khadi produced will be sold out, when national consciousness has fully developed in us. We have not yet entered the homes of the poor in Gujarat, have not qualified ourselves nor do we feel the desire to do so. When we really feel a new life in us, large numbers of young men will come forward to go into villages and serve the people, and they will take pride in living on the modest return they will get from such service.

            MY 	DEAR VAZE,   LETTER TO S. G. VAZE   THE 	 ASHRAM, 	 SABARMATI,  May 	30, 1926 
  	I have your circular letter about the Society’s publications. I 	have just heard that Sastri is there. But as the matter contained in 	my letter to him is urgent lest he might not be there I send you 	herewith a copy. And if my offer is at all considered possible of 	acceptance you will be at liberty yourself to come and take up your 	abode in the Ashram and bring with you as many as you like and edit 	the paper from the Ashram till the press is re-established in Poona.

 May 30, 1926
 DEAR FRIEND,
 As I did not know your whereabouts, being still unrepentant in spite of your rebuke about my neglect of newspaper reading, I wrote to Devadhar expressing my distress over the terrible fire which has reduced to ashes the press owned by the  Soceity.  I  have  therein offered to render such service as I am capable of in connection with your publications. I have now before me a circular letter from Vaze asking me to announce the fact that, till new arrangements are made, The Servant of India and the Dnyan Prakash cannot be published.
 I understand you are already in Poona. Though I have not consulted Swami, I feel certain that we could print for youThe Servant of India here without much difficulty. Do please make use of this humble offer if it is practicable. Its acceptance, I need hardly assure you, will give me the greatest pleasure. For, though technically I am not one of you, I have ever regarded myself as one of you in spirit and that in spite of fundamental difference between you and myself on many matters of importance to the country.
 Yours sincerely,

            DEAR 	FRIEND,   LETTER  TO  K.  T.  PAULlibtech_346_footnote   THE 	 ASHRAM, 	 SABARMATI,  May 	30, 1926 
  	I have your letter. Mr. Andrews has been with me for the last three 	days. He has read the whole of the correspondence between us and we 	have both come to the conclusion that the invitation should be 	finally accepted which I do hereby though not without a great deal 	of hesitation and reluctance. The hesitation and reluctance proceed 	from my diffidence. I did not know that it is worth while undergoing 	all the    
 expense of taking me and my companions to Finland. But it is not given to man to know God’s purpose. And I simply derive satisfaction from the knowledge that I have in no way forced the pace or even wanted to go to Finland. You will now make what arrangements you like.
 I see you will be taking return passages, and you contemplate the same between London and Helsingfors. I must, however, say that if I receive invitations to go to other places in Europe, I want to hold myself free to accept them. In that event, it might not be advisable to take a return passage from London to Helsingfors. I am bound in any case to go to Geneva to see M. Romain Rolland. My return therefore may not be absolutely by the same route in Europe.
 So far as the passport is concerned you will please bear this in mind and not accept any conditions as to the time or places I might visit.
 You will keep me informed from time to time as to what progress you are making. Of course, I should be delighted if you could, instead of going by the 15th June, go with me by the boat that leaves on the 1st of July.
 I do not think that there can be any difficulty about procuring goat’s milk in Europe. Moreover it can be condensed, evaportated or sterilized. Evaporated milk is undoubtedly the best to keep. It is absolutely reduced to powder.

         DEAR 	FRIEND,   LETTER  TO  K.  T.  PAULlibtech_347_footnote     May 	30, 1926 
  	I have your letter. Mr. Andrews has been here for the last three 	days. He also has read your letter and the rest of the 	correspondence between us. After deep and prayerful consideration we 	have  both come to the conclusion that the invitation should be 	cancelled or that I should decide not to go to Finland. It seems to 	me that the invitation is in substance from you and from the World’s 	Committee only in form.    
 And yet if I went, I will be said to be going in response not to your invitation but to that of the World Committee. I feel that it would be a wrong thing for both you and me or at any rate for me. I feel that if it  is the World Committee that invites me then, it is that Committee which should bear the financial burden. Whereas in this case the financial burden has to be borne by you. It therefore appears to amount to a forcing of the position. I therefore strongly advise you to forget the invitation, and drop the matter altogether. I would ask you therefore to treat this matter as closed unless you find that by my not going you will be in any way compromised or embarrassed. If you are in any way embarrassed or compromised I shall gladly  reconsider  the position. But if it has to be reconsidered and if it is possible for you to move out will it not be better for you to come down to the Ashram so that we might thrash out the whole matter.

            DEAR 	FRIEND,   LETTER TO A. I. KAJEE   THE 	 ASHRAM, 	 SABARMATI,  May 	30, 1926 
  	I have your letter of the 24th April last with all the enclosures 	mentioned therein. I have also your cable just received. I have had 	long talks with Mr. Andrews who is, even as I am writing this here 	at the Ashram, living with me. The victory is great but much work 	still 
 remains to be done, in fact more than has been done already, because, the work hitherto done was one of necessary destruction; the work of construction must now begin.
 You have raised three points in your cable. So far as I can see there will be no direct participation by the Congress in the Round Table Conference. But the Congress must have a hearing. The Conference itself, I imagine, will be between the representatives of the two Governments. But Mr. Andrews and others are watching carefully and whatever can be done will certainly be done. If any step has to be taken on your side, you will be duly advised.
 It is a very good idea to hold the annual Congress in Johannesburg. Your resolutions must concentrate on fundamental points to be dealt with by the Conference and should be plain. Your resolutions should be moderate, firm, brief, telling and to the point.
 After the Colour Bar Bill I have expressed myself in the strong- est terms. All parties have also taken action. Mr. Andrews has seen  the Viceroy but I very much fear that the Bill itself will receive the Royal assent. What will happen is that at least for the time being it will not be applied to Indian settlers and may never be applied at any time if we are strong, united and moderate.

  	It is certainly not possible to reply to your letter through 	Navajivan. I am sure that the educational and other reforms 	which you advocate will not come about at the present time. All of 	them may be indications of an attitude of tolerance, but they cannot 	create such an attitude. At present it will be more than enough if 	though going our separate ways, we live in peace with each other. I 	cannot think just now how inter-marriages will ever become possible. 	How can we have  a family in which one member is a vegetarian and 	another a non- vegetarian? In which tradition will the children of 	such a couple be brought up? Problem alliances of this kind will 	raise many other issues besides these. Any attempt at this time to 	persuade people to act upon your suggestions will furnish one more 	ground for opposition  or make the achievement of political unity 	impossible. How unwise it is to imagine a connection between 	political unity and other issues where none exists!  From 	a microfilm of the Gujarati: S. N. 19588

  	I have your letter. I fully appreciate your struggle. But I have  no 	doubt that if the humiliations you may be suffering purify you, they 	may to that extent and only to that extent benefit your fellows. My 	non-resistance is activized resistance in a different plane. Non- 	resistance to evil does not mean absence of any resistance 	whatsoever but it means not resistinglibtech_350_footnotelibtech_351_footnoteevil 	with  evil but  with good.  Resistance, therefore, is transferred to 	a higher and absolutely effective plane.  	Capitalism, therefore, is to be resisted not with the ways openlibtech_352_footnotelibtech_353_footnoteto 	capitalism but with absolutely new weapons. If only employees will 	realize the power within them, they will not, as they do today, 	merely change the form but they will radically change the substance. 	And for this desirable reform the power comes from within. One does 	not need to wait till the rest have made the commencement. One 	persom making the beginning will in the end be enough to destroy the 	system. But I am free to confess that in the intervening period, one 	may have to put up with estrangement and much worse, which, however, 	is the lot of almost every reformer.

 Cash subscriptions and donations amount to Rs. 6, 100-15-0 whereas proceeds of the sale of yarn subscriptions and donations amount to Rs. 26-6-6. Those who send in hand-spun yarn as their donations will please not that if they will put more attention and skill into their work for the same amount of labour spent they will perhaps double the value of their subscriptions. The yarn received is very indifferently spun. Some of it is really not capable of bearing any price in the market because it cannot be woven into khadi. It can only be used for ropes or at best for carpets. And yarn so indifferently spun fetches only a nominal price. Therefore those who have been sending their donations or subscriptions in yarn for the  All-India  Cow Protection Association will please bear in mind that any indifference in spinning means so much less for the cow.

  THE BAR SINISTER 
 Lord Birkenhead has spoken on the Colour Bar Bill of South Africa and he has blessed it. I hold to my opinion that as a piece of racial legis-lation it is worse than the Class Areas Reservation Bill which awaits discussion at the forthcoming Conference. It may not be put into operati-on against Asiatics for the time being or at all. It may not be enforced ha-rshly against the Native population. But the objection against that mea-sure is based upon a fundamental principle and upon the vast possibilities of mischief it contains. It is no wonder, therefore, that the Indian settlers are agitated and that Mr. Andrews has spoken strongly upon it. The settlers must continue their agitation against the Bill with vigour and prepare their case for presentation to the Conference. No presentation can avoid reference to the Colour Bar Bill. For the one reflects the policy of the other. The Colour Bar Bill  is an indication of the designs of the Union Government in respect of Natives and Indian settlers. And the Class Areas Reservation Bill must be examined in the light of the Government policy on the Colour Bar Bill. The postponement of the former does not mean any change of policy. It may well mean only postponement of the agony. It is therefore necessary for all who are interested in this thorny question not to relax vigilance. What has been done hitherto was work of destruction. The more difficult work of construction has now begun. Much will depend upon the attitude of the Government of India. They control the situation if the settlers are weak. When the latter are strong they can mould their own destiny.
 But I am sorry to note that the Hon. Syed Raza Ali considers that there should be no protest in India against the  Colour  Bar  Bill.  Though he commences his statement by saying that it is not  a  legislative measure against Indians, ‘he is forced to admit  that  the Union Government will under the Bill have the power to extend such prohibition to our people if it deems it necessary’. Why is he then surprised at Mr. Andrews’ opposition? The Syed Saheb should also know that the Indian settlers in South Africa are much agitated over the Bill. In a cable just received, the Secretary of the South African Indian Congress says: ‘Trust strong action taken by you on Colour Bar Bill which has not yet received the Royal assent.’ Mr. Andrews is bound to
 object to this inhuman legislation which is principally aimed at Natives of South Africa, if he may be expected to raise his voice on behalf of us Indains. He has merged himself in us as a citizen of the world, not for any special virtues of our own. But the reason for his intervention is not the point at issue. The point at issue raised by the Syed Saheb is whether we here should oppose the Bill or not. Well, we have always opposed it. The settlers have always opposed it. And there  is  no  burden on us, now that the Conference is agreed upon not to oppose the Bill. There was—could be—no tacit understanding not to oppose it. We may distinguish as we have distinguished between the two measures. The Colour Bar Bill is not so deadly in its effect against us  as the Class Areas Reservation Bill. And therefore it was that greater stress was put upon the latter by the Indian deputation and the public. But the opposition to the former cannot be abated because the latter has been postponed.
 Nor are the honesty and good intentions of General Hertzok relevant to the discussion. General Hertzog is  not  the  autocrat  of South Africa. He is no permanent head. He may find himself tomorrow in the same placelibtech_365_footnotelibtech_366_footnotethat General Smuts occupies today.    It is only the written undertaking of the Government that can be taken into account, though we have found to our cost that even written undertakings may be thrown on the scrapheap when occasion requires the performance. The coming Conference cannot be endangered because we oppose a measure which it is our duty to oppose. In order to ensure a peaceful atmosphere at the Conference all that is necessary is for us not to impute motives, not to exaggerate and not to use harsh language in discussing subjects, however painful they may be. To go beyond is to surrender the right of free and just criticism and judgment. To do so would be to pay a price out of all proportion to the result sought to be achieved.

  NATIONAL  EDUCATIONlibtech_367_footnote 
A Gujarati correspondent has raised certain questions about
 
 national education. Some of them are summarized below:
 Since some of the staunchest supporters of non-co- operation have lost faith in it and since the numbers attending national institutions are dwindling, what is the use of holding on to these tottering schools and colleges and wasting good money after bad institutions?
 My believing eye detects a flaw in this argument. My faith in non-co-operation remaining as staunch as ever, I can find it possible to reconcile myself to the existing national institutions even though the attendance may be reduced to half a dozen. For the half a dozen will be the makers of swaraj whenever it comes. When virgins are required to perform certain sacred ceremonies, others are not accepted as substitute if no virgin is found. And even one virgin if found is enough to save the situation. So will it be with the planting of the swaraj flag-post. The flags will be unfurled with the unsullied hands  of those, be they ever so few, who have remained true to their creed.
 I do not therefore regard  it  as  waste  of  money  to  continue  the  national  institutions.  They  are  so  many  oases  in  the  desert. They give the water of life to the souls thirsting for freedom. In writing this I cast no reflection upon those who attend or otherwise support Government schools. They are entitled to hold the view if they choose that theirs is the only way or also a way to freedom. National institutions are meant for those whose thirst for freedom is not satisfied by the ones managed or patronized by the Government. Few as they are, insignificant though they may appear, they supply a felt want and contain in them the seeds, as it appears to non-co-operators, of true and lasting freedom.
 The final success of these institutions depends upon the worth of the teachers. “But they are deserting the national  schools  and colleges,” says the critic. So some of them are. It tries the faith of the survivors. Have they the courage to stand alone? Are there enough monied men to support the surviving national institutions? On the correct answer to these questions depends the future of the national institutions and with them the freedom of the country, and so far as I can judge, there are teachers enough to stand the severest test and there are monied men enough to support them. I know no organization that has died for want of funds. Organizations die always for want of men,
 i.   e.,   honesty,   efficiency and  selfsacrifice.	And it is my certain knowledge that where there are teachers, pupils are not wanting.
But the pupils have perhaps the largest share of responsibility on
 their shoulders. The future depends upon their ability, integrity, application, and patriotism. The teachers cannot give what the pupils have not. The teachers can help to ‘draw out’ in the pupils what they have. If it were otherwise, if the teachers were capable of putting something into their pupils, all the latter receiving instruction under them will be alike, whereas we know as a matter of fact that no two pupils have been yet known to be alike. The pupils must therefore have initiative. They must cease to be mere imitators. They must learn  to think and act for themselves and yet be thoroughly obedient and disciplined. The highest form of freedom carries with it the greatest measure of discipline and humilty. Freedom that  comes  from discipline and humility cannot be denied; unbridled licence is a sign of vulgarity injurious alike to self and one’s neighbours.

 I have not the slightest doubt that not only will the subscribers excuse the unavoidable intrerruption in the publication of the two journals, but that the Society will have the fullest sympathy of the subscribers and numerous other friends like myself in the great loss that the Society, or rather the public, have suffered by the destruction of the two presses. I  hope  that  the  publication of the  Servant of India and the Dnyan Prakash will be soon resumed.
 PATRIOTISM v. CAPITALISM
 These two “isms” are no doubt contradictory or have been so hitherto. But capital is totally different from capitalism and the capitalist from both. Capital is necessary for all enterprise. Labour itself may be described as a kind of capital. But even in the narrower sense of money, some capital, be it ever so little, is necessary even for labour’s enterprise. Therefore there is no contradiction between capital and patriotism. A capitalist may or may not be patriotic.  Khan  Bahadur Mohiuddin Ahmed, Registrar of Co-operative Societies in Bihar, has pointed out a patriotic way to the capitalist. The Times of India says :
 On the occasion of the opening ceremony of the new building of the Motihari Central Co-operative Bank, the Khan Bahadur, in his speech, distinguished harmful  from useful capitalism. He suggested that industrial activities should be divided into two classes, one to be taken up by the capitalists and the other to be taken up on
 
 co-operative lines for the benefit of 90 per cent of the population in India. Any industry based on agricultural produce such as cotton, sugar, oil-seeds, wheat, etc., should be on a co-operative basis so that the producers could secure the best value for their outturn. All sorts of mining and iron works, leather and other large-scale industries, which do not exploit  the agriculturists, should be left to the capitalists so that they may also use their capital for more production of wealth in the country rather than forexploiting the farmers and thereby sapping the very source of wealth in India.
If the capitalists would follow the Khan Bahadur’s advice and
 restrict the use of their capital for purposes beneficial alike to the masses as also themselves, India’s poverty would soon be a thing of the past. In the Khan Bahadur’s opinion :
 Jute mills, sugar mills, cotton mills are all meant to exploit the agriculturists and these exploited men are driven into the factories to work like slaves. The jute millowners of Bengal did not show the least concern for the Bengal jute- growers during the War when foreign export was closed. The result of this
 exploitation was that the jute-growers were reduced to poverty and jute millowners realized cent per cent dividends.
 RESOURCEFULNESS
 The manager of the Satyagraha Ashram tells me that he has more orders than he can cope with for taklis. It is a  healthy sign that so many people want taklis. But if spinning is, and it is, an art, it must evoke one’s resourcefulness. It is not possible to supply millions of taklis in one centre. The virtue of spinning lies in its capacity to be independent of central help. The aim of the All-India Spinners’ Association is to de-centralize everything at the earliest possible moment. Taklis are being manufactured at the Ashram for those who need inducement to make the effort. But it is an insturment that can be and should be made by every-one for himself. A simple piece of dried bamboo, a piece of broken slate, a knife, a little hammer, a small file, and if possible a compass, is all that is necessary to make first class taklis at one pice each. A bamboo takli can be made inside of half an hour and gives just as good work as the steel instrument. Those who will master the art must be resourceful. Let us remember that spinning is the poor man’s art. It is his solace. The tools also of that art must be within easy reach of the poorest. Let each boy and girl be therefore taught to make the takli himself or herself. They will take pleasure in making their own taklis and greater pleasure than hitherto in spinning with taklis made by themselves.
 GOOD AND BAD
 The Vice-Chairman of the Berhampur Municipal Council says in his letter to the All-India Spinners’ Association :
 Only boys’ schools have been supplied with 54 charkhas. Ten tolas of yarn is being spun per month. Rs. 15 a month is paid to the spinning instruc- tor. One period of 40 minutes is allotted for spinning in each school per day.
This is good in so far that the wheel has found a place in the
 boys’ schools under the Berhampur Municipal Council. But it  is  bad in that the output of yarn is too poor for the number of the wheels. A boy can easily spin half a tola of 10 counts per half-hour. That means 27 tolas per day from 54 wheels. And that would be 675 tolas per month of twenty-five working days. A spinning insturctor who is satisfied with only 10 tolas per month out of 54 wheels does not deserve to draw Rs. 15 per month of national money. I hope that there is some mistake in the figures sent. For ten tolas per month would be too little even for one wheel. The wheels are not ornamental furniture. They are wealth-producing machines. And it is up to the keepers to see that thay are not left idle. Every spinning instructor should deem it a point of honour to earn his wages by ensuring production enough to pay them. And this he can do easily when he has a large class and he does not mind himself carding and making slivers for the boys. It is the best way of interesting and instructing his pupils in the art of spinning. Let it be remembered that spinning includes carding and ginning. And carding and ginning are processes that fetch more money per day than spinning.
 APRIL FIGURES
 The following are the figures for production and sale of khadi during the month of April :
 The Andhra figures are incomplete and to some extent even the Karnatak figures. The Bombay figure includes only those of All- India Khadi Bhandar, Charkhasangh Bhandar and the Sandhurst Road Khadi Shop. I do wish we could make the figures complete for all the provinces.

 I have told Devdas that he is a free agent. I think that he will be discharged from the Hospital today and is likely to go to Mussoorie to join Jamnalalji. I suppose Simla atmosphere is too strong for him.

 I have not been able to write to you at all of late. But I have been doing what needs to be done. Your health will of course improve there gradually. But it would be best to go to Panchgani. Pattani has written me a very kind letter saying that I should have no hesitation at all in using his bungalow in July. Still I feel that we should not use his bungalow for too long. Hence, I have declined his offer.  I  have decided not to go to Finland. I have kept only one option open, that is, I will go if by my not going Mr. Paul , who sent the invitation, is embarrassed in any way. But I see no reason why he should be. Therefore, you call take it that I shall not be going. I do wish this to be my last letter to you at Deolali. Swami is a fast worker and so I do not think the matter will take too long.

 BHAISHRI JAYANTILAL,
 I have your letter. I do not know if you interpret  a  love- marriage in a way contrary to mine. But I would regard as desirable a marriage between a man and woman who have maintained pure relations and wish to be united in wedlock, when the union does not involve a breach of propriety. I cannot understand how in the case of  a true love-marriage one partner can after the other’s death ever think at all of remarriage. But I do believe that we should not oppose a virgin widow desiring to marry. I would regard the intermingling of
 
 the four varnas as needless and undesirable as also marriages within the gotra, the principle being that there cannot be too much circumscription in regard to marriage.

  LETTER TO H. S. L. POLAK 
 THE  ASHRAM,  SABARMATI,
 June 4, 1926
 MY DEAR HENRY,
 I have your two letters. You have given me a full budget of family news which I appreciate although the news is all about illnesses. Of Maud’s illness, I knew all from her own letter and also Matar’s. I hope they are both now well and strong. With Millie it is her courage which keeps her up and I know that it will stand her in good stead for many a year to come. Please tell Waldo not to keep me in suspense for a long time but make some time if he cannot find it for giving me  a long letter. He must write to me as to an old friend and bed-fellow, not a stranger whom he knows only by name. The intricacies of his examinations, I do not understand. But I know that he can give a good account of himself being your son.
 Devdas evidently got jealous of Maud. He too therefore developed appendicitis, underwent an operation on the other day and was discharged as cured yesterday. Miss Slade, otherwise Mirabai, is standing this hot season exceedingly well. She has become a very good spinner. She cards her own cotton. Andrews has been with us for the last five or six days. He will probably leave tomorrow for Kotgarh where he is going to see Stokes. Ramdas is hawking khadi and seems to like it well.
 I was delighted to receive to your copy of the Bhagavad Gita translations. I note your careful instructions. I am keeping it under lock and key. You will have the book back sent duly insured as soon as I have made a copy.
 99 to one I am not going to Finland. But if I do go and if I come to London naturally I shall stay with you unless you wanted me to stay elsewhere for public or other reasons.

 I have your letter. You can simplify your life by reducing your wants consistently with the retention of your health. You can simplify your dress. You can cultivate the habit of going to bed earlier, getting up at four o’clock in the morning, offering prayers just before retiring to bed and after rising from it. You can spin regularly for at least half an hour a day. Study Hindi and Sanskrit and read clean literature. Spinning includeds carding and ginning. You can
 befriend the so-called untouchables.

             BHAISAHEB,   LETTER TO A MUSLIM LEADER   THE 	 ASHRAM, 	 SABARMATI,  June 	 4,  1926 
  	For many days now I have been thinking of writing to you. I had no 	intention of writing in English , and have none now. I wanted to 	write at length, and it is hard for me to write such a long letter 	in the Urdu script. This I am getting written in the Urdu Script by 	a brother of an Ashram inmate. I have your message from Brother 	Andrews. I wanted to write to you even before I got the message, in 
 fact since the time Alibhai went to Mecca. Regarding the Hindu- Muslim question I have deliberately refrained form saying anything. What can I write? To whom can I tell the tale of my woe? I know very well that I have no influence whatsoever over the quarrelling elements. Bhai Shaukat Ali and Manzur Ali spoke to me at length about your grief, and I have also been given to understand that you were rather pained at my silence. Since I am unable to bring about a compromise what is the good of my writing? I cannot bring myself to believe the various Press reports. I am asked to make a public statement that Malaviyaji and others are enemies of the Muslims, the Hindus ask me to make a similar statement regarding the Muslim leaders. How can I write something which I do not believe? I cannot accept that Malaviyaji and others are enemies of the Muslims; this does not however mean I approve of everything they do. Nor can I agree to calling Mahomed Ali an enemy of the Hindus. In his case, too, I do not approve of all he does. I am asked to state my opinion regarding the Calcutta affair. What opinion can I give out? I have no occult power by which to know who started the trouble in Calcutta and whose crime was heavier. But I do know that the parties are both prejudiced against each other, they look only for each other’s faults and have lost mutual trust. In the circumstances there is no other way for a person like me but to keep my peace. I cannot tolerate the killing of even a single Muslim or Hindu or for that matter of any human being. Nor can I tolerate the destruction of a mosque or a temple or a church. It is my belief that the same God that dwells in the heart of a Hindu is enshrined in the heart of every other person. And I also believe that a temple belongs to God as much as a mosque.  I can never agree to the rule of blood for blood and temple for a mosque. But who listens to me? It is my firm belief, however, that God does not approve of this rule of blood and temple for a mosque.  A day will come when Hindus and Muslims will own their guilt, feel sorry for their behaviour and unite with each other. This is the culmination that I wish to witness in my life-time. And I always pray  to God to recall me from this world if I am not to see the light of that day. My desire to live springs solely from this hope. And I want you
 
 too to cherish this hope with me and never despair.
 Brother Andrews tells me about your proposal that Brother Stokes and he should invite, on their own, a few Hindus and Muslims and attempt a reconciliation. I am afraid their efforts cannot achieve this task. Nor is the time ripe to bring the Hindus and Muslims together in this way. You alone can bring them together when the time comes. Those Muslims who are regarded as enemies of the Hindus as well as those Hindus that are supposed to be Muslim-haters must also be invited to this conference. What good can mere  discussions bring when there is mutual mistrust and  when  people speak one thing and think another in their hearts?
I hope you are in Mussoorie and keeping well.

 CHI. JEKI,
 Received your letter. I am sending it to Doctor . I shall write to you on hearing from him. The money which I have asked to be sent to you has nothing to do with the school work. I will send that letter to you, if I have not torn it up. I shall look for it and, if it is there, shall send it to you. Even now Doctor’s health can’t be considered good. He stammers a little and can hardly sign his name. A mere look at his face does not reveal any illness. These are the news. It is pointless, in my view, for Bhai Manilal to strive to get into the Council. Nor do I see any gain in going out of India. I consider it right to settle down here and bear all the hardships that come his way. Why suppose that hardships will be his lot for ever?

 BHAISHRI AMRITLAL,
 Your letter. You should write to your sister’s husband and her father-in-law saying that you could not send her to them and infrom them of all the hardships faced by her. Before you do this, you have to ascertain from her what she really wishes to do, because she may have run away impulsively and might repent it later or she might become a victim of passion and do some thing wrong. It would perhaps be better if she realizes all this and returns to her husband and submits to all hardships that may befall her. Thus no definite answer can be given to your question because you alone can take a right
 
 
 decision since you know the temperament of your sister, her husband and his parents. I can only say that if your sister does not want to go to her husband’s people you must stand by her. You may not compel her to return there.

  	You must have got the telegram I sent you yesterday.  Lakshmidas 	must have settled down there. His health would not rally here. He 	cannot do without work. I have therefore decided to send him to you 	so that he may rest along with Devdas. I have come to the conclusion 	that there is no point in keeping Lakshmidas here no matter how long 	Devdas stays there. There must be plenty of doctors in Mussoorie. If 	you feel that Lakshmidas must consult one, let him do so.  	You must have learnt that Girdhari has been operated on for fistula. 	I believe he will get much relief. It is good that he was operated 	on in time. 
 The visit to Finland has almost been called off. It is a different matter if I have to reconsider this because of the embarrassment it may cause to Mr. Paul. But the chances of such reconsideration are one in a hundred. I believe you will arrive by the 22nd at the latest.  If no one there is put to any inconvenience it is good that Lakshmidas stays there for quite some time. It is absolutely necessary that he recovers completely.
 
  LOSS SUFFERED BY SERVANTS OF INDIA SOCIETY 
 A terrible fire broke out last week in the historic Kibewada area in Poona and two printing presses, Dnyan Prakash and Aryabhooshan, owned by the Servants of India Society, were completely destroyed. This is a loss to the people as much as to the Society. Dnyan Prakash was a press as old as eighty years and the names of leaders like Chiplunkar, Agarkar and Lokmanya Tilak were associated with the Aryabhooshan Press, through which they had all started their public work. We may, therefore, say that the fire has destroyed two priceless memorials. Among other things, many valuable books, manuscripts of books and some considerable literature collected for a biography of the late Gokhale were lost in this fire.
 The immediate effect of this loss will be that two journals, Servant of India and Dnyan Prakash will not come out for some time. We may hope that readers will not mind this, and will also show their full sympathy for the Society by offering as much help as they can. We are glad to note in this connection that workers of both the presses have forgone their claim to bonus amounting to as much as eight thousand rupees, and that many other presses have come forward to offer immediate help to the Society.

 Navajivan, 6-6-1926
 
  PROBLEM OF NON-VIOLENCE 
A gentleman writes as follows :
 Such questions are frequently raised. They cannot be brushed aside, either, as being trivial. These problems have been discussed both in the West and the East in books dealing with the  deeper meaning of life. In my humble view, there is only one solution to these problems, since they all arise from the same cause. The actions mentioned above certainly involve violence, for every  motion  or action involves it and, therefore, no action is altogether innocent. The difference between one action and another lies only in the degree of violence involved in either. The very association of the atman with the body rests on violence. Every sin is a form of violence, and complete freedom from sin is possible only with the deliverance of the atman from the body. A human being, therefore, may keep perfect non-violence as his or her ideal and strive to follow it as completely as possible. But no matter how near it he reaches, he will find some degree of violence unavoidable, in breathing or eating, for instance. There is life in each grain which we consume. When, therefore, we adopt a vegetarian diet and abstain from non-vegetarian food  we cannot claim that we completely avoid violence. But we prefer the former and regard the violence involved in it as inescapable. This is why eating for pleasure must never be indulged in. We should eat only in order that we may live, and should live only to realize the self.  If our living for this purpose involves any violence, we may be a party to it as being unable to escape it. We can now see that if, in spite of all our precautions, there are germs in the water and bugs [in the furniture], we may do whatever we find necessary to get rid of them. I do not believe that it is a divine law that everyone should act in the same way at certain times and in certain circumstances. Non-violence is a quality of the heart. Whether there is violence or non-violence in our actions can be judged only by reference to the spirit behind them. Everyone, therefore, who regards the observance of non-violence as a moral duty should guide his actions by the principle stated above. I know that there is a flaw in this reply. One may commit violence as much as one chooses and then, deceiving oneself and  the  world, justify one’s actions with the plea of their being unvaoidable. This
 
 article is not meant for such persons. It is addressed only to those who believe in the principle of non-violence and are assailed by moral doubts from time to time. Such persons will commit even unavoidable violence most hesitatingly, and limit, not expand, the scope of their activities, so much so that they will not use any of their powers for sel- fish ends. They will use all their energies for  public  service, dedicating to God everything they do. All the gifts and abilities of a good man, that is, a non-violent, compassionate man, are for service to others. There is violence always in the attachment to  one’s  ego. When doing anything, one must ask oneself this question : “Is my action inspired by egoistic attachment?” If there is  no  such attachment, then there is no violence.

  NOTES 
 A  COMPLAINT
A gentleman writes as follows :
 If the friend who makes this complaint had been reading his Navajivan carefully, he would not have found it necessary to complain as he has done. He has requested a reply in the columns of Navajivan. Young India acknowledges  the  subscription  or contribution from every member by name, and a summary is  published in Navajivan from time to time. From that everyone can know the number of members in the Spinners’ Association. Detailed information about its working is also published occasionally in Navajivan. Still, I think it necessary to explain some points here. The Association’s office has not yet received yarn in such quantity that it can directly help to reduce the price of khadi; but indirectly the yarn received has had so great an effect that throughout the country the quality of yarn which the Association gets people to spin for payment of has improved. The yarn which is received as voluntary gift from members has proved extremely useful as a means of testing the other yarn received. The yarn which is received as voluntary gift from members has proved extremely useful as a means of testing the
 
 other yarn received and keeping a check on its quality. But the quantity of such yarn received as gift by the Spinners’ Association is so little, relatively speaking, that the khadi made from it will reach a very small number. That is why the khadi made from it has had to be mixed with that made from other yarn; not a single piece of it has been given away to any member of the office staff. The members pay for the khadi which they require, and some of them get it woven from yarn spun by themselves. If those who spin voluntarily keep with themselves the yarn which they have spun, get it woven and gift the cloth to someone without giving publicity to their act,  then  the purpose which can be served by an organized action will suffer or be defeated altogether, and the effort being made to improve the quality of yarn will have to be given up. The office expenses of the Association do not exceed its income. When they do, I myself would dissolve it or leave it. I must admit, though, that the expenses cannot be met from the quantity of yarn it receives as gift. The balance is met from other contributions in cash. If, however, the membership of the Association increases from the present number of four thousand to four crores, the expenses of the office can be met from the yarn contributed by them. Hundreds of young men would then earn their livelihood by working in the office and the increase in the number would also have considerable and direct effect on the price of khadi.
 IS THIS THE RIGHT METHOD OF COW-PROTECTION?
A worker in the cause of cow-protection writes as follows :
 This is a sorry state of affairs. Probably similar conditions prevail in many other goshals. One thousand five hundred  goshalas is not a small number. If all of them are run well and there is one common organization for them, they can maintain thousands of cattle-heads and increase the national wealth to the tune of crores of rupees, and we would discover the best method of cow-protection. There ought not to be a loss of Rs. 11,000 in the goshala referred to by the correspondent. Not a single calf ought to be given away as a gift. If this same goshala were turned into a model dairy, the people of the village would get milk and ghee at a low price, and if, at the
 
 same time, a tannery were also started side by side, the people would get shoes and other needed articles of leather. As things are, in spite of good money being spent, not a single cow is saved from the slaughter-house. In this way, the work of goshalas is becoming very limited in its scope. Running a goshala has come to mean looking after infirm cattle in a perfunctory manner.
 If we wish to start a business, we would engage efficient workers and pay them. If the business was running at a loss, we would try to find out the reasons, would effect some improvement every day and not rest till we had succeeded in stopping the  loss.  The  aim  in running a goshala is not merely to provide a small shed for cattle; it is to discharge the sacred duty of cow-protection. But we get this work done mostly through inexperienced men who do it in their spare time. Such persons deceive themselves and believe that they are doing some service; those who give the money deceive themselves by believing that the cause of cow-protection is served, and in this way hundreds of thousands of rupees are thrown away in the name of religion. If my correspondent had furnished the following particulars, I would have made further inquiries concerning the goshala.
 The 	number of 	infirm cattle. The 	number of 	milch cows and buffaloes. The 	daily yield of milk. The 	number of 	calves—male and female. The 	number of 	bullocks and he-buffaloes. The 	area of land. Is 	the goshala located 	in the village 	or away 	from it? The 	number of 	deaths among the cattle. Arrangements 	for disposal 	of cattle 	which die. 
 
PERPETRATING “ADHARMA” IN THE NAME OF DHARMA
 Shri Rameshwardas Birla donated Rs. 2,500 for a temple for Antyajas at Amreli and a beautiful temple was erected. An image of Lord Lakshminarayana was installed in the temple and it was duly opened to the public. The report of this event which I have received contains the following information.
The Brahmins cruelly harassed the priest who officiated at the
 cere-mony, though the gentleman on whose behalf they performed it did not belong to the untouchable class. At the time of this ceremony for the opening of a temple for Antyajas, the latter were made to sit in a separate enclosure. Even the gifts offered to the priest did not come from Antyajas nor the money with which the temple was erected. The only reason, therefore, for punishing the priest was that the temple was for the use of Antyajas. For this offence, he had to get his moustaches shaved off and to perform atonement.
 I cannot compliment the priest for thus forgetting his self- respect. If the ceremony of invoking the presence of God in the image was sacred act, the subsequent atonement was not atonement, but an act of sin. Even if the priest was afterwards boycotted by his community, what would he have lost in consequence? No one need be afraid now of the bogey of expulsion from one’s community. Those who have courageously let themselves be boycotted have not only suffered nothing thereby but have actually found themselves free
 from unnecessary bonds. Says Brahmanand : Embark not on a venture without knowing;
 Having gone to the field of battle, yield not to fear; He who rushes to the field, courage on his face,  And then flees from battle,
What good his living, carrying his lustreless face among men?
 How true are these words in the present case?  I  had  not expected that the Brahmins of a progressive town like Amreli would display so much ignorance, such fanaticism.
 If some Brahmins of Amreli disgraced Hinduism in this manner, there were also some who brought credit to it, for at the time of the installation of the image Hindus from all communities had attended the function. There were Brahmins, Vanias, Luhars, Sutars, Kanbis and others. There were some officials too. Other people, besides Antyajas, are also seen benefiting from this temple built specially for the latter. Some Brahmins have even agreed to read the Bhagavata and other holy books in the temple. It remains to be seen what effect that boycott has on these other Brahmins.

  LETTER TO K. T. PAUL 
 
THE  ASHRAM,  SABARMATI,
 June 6, 1926
 DEAR FRIEND,
 
 I have your letter and the original letters from the Committee of arrangements. The letters make it clear to me that the  idea  of invitation was prompted by you out of your great goodwill towards me and your exaggerated notion of my influence over people especially the young mind. But I feel more than ever convinced that the time is not yet for me to leave India on such pretext as is furnished by the correspondence before me. The call to go out of India for service has got to be pressing and overwhelming. The correspondence is really a response to your desire for my presence at the deliberations at Helsingfors. But I know my own limitations and recognize the difficulties in the way of my message going straight home. If there is any power in my message it would be felt  without  the  physical contact.
 I know that my decision will disappoint you but it has been my lot in life to disappoint loving friends. But I know that these disappointments have done good rather than harm. You will please forgive me for all the trouble that you have been put to  on  my account and ask for forgivness from friends at Helsingfors who might have expected my presence there. Needless to say my prayers will attend your deliberations and my best wishes accompany you on your voyage.
I return the original letters.
 Yours sincerely,

 It was a joy to receive your letter, for, I have often thought of you and a greater joy still to find that you were helping Mr. Stokes. What about the hereditary village wardenship? Who is taking your place? I hope that your eyes will be completely cured by your stay on the hills.
 Your Hindi writing is very good. It is better than my Tamil speech but it admits of much improvement. Your own name is not correctly spelt. The words of the hymn you have copied  are  beautiful. I am not writing separately to Savitri. Hers also is a good effort. But she must do much better.

To a question 	similar to the one you have asked a reply is given in the current 	issue of Navajivan. Is there no middle way betwen killing of 	bugs  and breeding them? We are not bound to do the latter, but we 	have no right to kill them. So we may pick them up and leave them at 	a    
 distance. I shall hand over your letter itself to Manibehn. I have sent Laxmidas to Mussoorie as soon as he arrived here. In order to fetch Mani, Velabehn left for Bombay with Ramdas who was also going there. On her way back she will stay for a day with you. Manibehn says that the book sent for her has not reached her yet.

If you write something  to  make  the learning 	of grammar easy and do not preach there through your philosophy, and 	the text is passed by other Sanskritists, I shall undertake to get 	it printed and circulated at cost price.

In any case what little is possible is being done 	through the Gujarat Vidyapith. But I own that it is nothing compared 	to what 
 can be accomplished if Sanskrit study can be made demonstrably easy. Personally I consider it to be easy enough. It would not increase the tremendous strain put upon our poor nerves by the unnatural English study. I call the present English study unnatural because it displaces the vernacular.

  INTERVIEW ON COLOUR BAR BILL 
 AHMEDABAD,
 [On or before June 8, 1926]
 2
 Interviewed regarding the recent communique of the Government of India on
 the Colour Bar Bill, Mahatma Gandhi said:
 The assurance given in the communique in my opinion takes us no further than we were before it. The Union Government have  indeed repeatedly said that they have no present  intention  of extending the scope of the Bill beyond the position that existed prior to the judgment in Rex v. Hildick Smith. Opponents of the Bill, however, attack it on the principle that the enabling powers under it go much beyond the position anterior to the judgment and that it can be made applicable not merely to the natives of the soil but to Indians also. Nor is it possible to derive any comfort from the fact that when the scope of the Regulations to be framed thereunder is extended, all parties in the Union will be enabled to make representations. The Bill does not take away the right of petition, and one knows by this time the fact of the representations by parties without power to enforce their will. I wonder if this assurance means that the party without the Union, namely the Government of India, will have no right of representation.

  LETTER TO JANAKDHARI PRASAD 
 THE  ASHRAM,  SABARMATI,
 June  8, 1926
 DEAR JANAKDHARI BABU,
 I was delighted to receive your letter after such a prolonged interval. I note the difficulties the school is going through. Faith has no limitation of time. That which is limited by time is not faith at all.  If therefore you have bondless faith in your mission, I have not a shadow of doubt that it will succeed, the cause being right.
 With reference to the two difficulties my prescription  is  the same. At the present moment, the atmosphere has become so impure that I cannot advise the formaiton of any new party or group. Those of us who do not believe in aggressiveness with regard to Hindu- Muslim unity, and do not believe in Council-entry in any shape or form must each one remain true to our ideal. We do not need any organization to keep up our spirits. Those who need that outward help are wanting in deep conviction and I am anxious that only those who have deep and abiding conviction should remain out. For, it may be that there are still greater trials in store for us. Those, therefore, who have weak faith will then succumb. It will be the indomitable remnant that will carry the day in the end, because, I see no freedom expect through non-co-operation. My faith in it is growing with time.
I hope you are keeping excellent health.

  	I have your letter. Certainly write for The Bombay Chronicle. I 	share your view for the most part. But education may not be the only 	remedy. If it is the only remedy unity must wait for a long time. 
 What is needed is the education of the heart. After all, in my opinion, the hands that fight may be the hands of the goondas but the brains behind them are the brains of educated Hindus and Mussalmans. If that education is to be multiplied, heaven help Hindusthan. But there can be no harm whatsoever in your writing for the paper. And, there certainly will be no harm if you do not write at all. You may let things simmer down a bit. There is no room for the time being for any solution except that of the cock fight.
 Ramdas was here for a day. He went over to Bombay to see Devdas and threatens to get down at Baroda on his return to see you and pay his respects.
 He says, but for you, he could have done nothing for the sale of his khadi. A white beard has its charm all its own.

 BHAI GHANSHYAMDASJI,
 I have your letter. So far Khadi Pratishthan has been given not less  than  Rs.   70,000   through  the Charkha  Sangh.	As far as I
 remember Rs. 25,000 have been given to Abhoy Ashram and Rs. 6,000 to the Pravartak Sangh. Many small sums have also been paid. All that would approximately amount to Rupees one and a quarter lakh. Even more would be granted to Bengal. I know the need of Khadi Pratishthan is great. Satis Babu wants to enlarge his activities considerably and I would like him to. But there is very little money with the Charkha Sangh today. So whatever is possible through the Charkha Sangh will be done, but do give to Satis Babu as much as you can.
 What shall I say about the Councils? There are fundamental differences between me and Malaviyaji on this subject. I can only say that if you believe that your entering the Council would benefit the people you should definitely do so. Opposition to the Swaraj Party and the temptation of gaining political education are both irrelevant from the moral angle. If you have a feeling that you have vowed in my presence not to enter the Council get rid of that impression. No such restraint was accepted categorically. You should feel free from any obligation and decide your stand about going to the Council from a moral standpoint, that is, with public service in view.
 Yours,

  LETTER TO RAI PRABHUDAS BHIKHABHAI 
 
ASHRAM,   SABARMATI,
 Tuesday, June 8, 1926
 BHAI PRABHUDAS,
 
 I have your detailed letter. You did well to write. Your argument is perfect, but it is my experience and also that of persons who have tried pranayam and other methods that brahmacharya cannot be observed merely with the help of pranayam. But I believe pranayam, etc., help those who have acquired control over their mind. We come across very few people who have made a deep study of the yoga from this point of view and have tried yogic methods. If one takes only one meal a day, I have nothing to say.  But  if  one consumes at one sitting a quantity of food equal to three meals, that will not help him in brahmacharya. This is a violation of it and it damages one’s health. There are two opinions and I have my own doubts regarding the need of nutritious diet for the observance of brahmacharya. But I do not want you to change your method if it greatly helps you in the observance of brahmacharya, if it keeps up your spiritual progress and all your senses are brought under control. You should try your own method and effect such changes as your experience may dictate. And if you succeed so that even your mind is not disturbed by passions the world will stand to gain by your experiment. Remember that brahmacharya implies control of all the senses in respect of thought, speech and action. According to this definition if you have a lustful eye or an evil thought or there is a discharge even in dream brahmacharya would be violated.

  NOTES 
 SERVANTS OF INDIA SOCIETY
 In the note issued by the Society upon the loss suffered by it owing to the recent fire nothing so much stirs one as the offer of the employees of the press. It is evidence of the scrupulous care with which the Society has dealt by its employees. Unless the latter felt the loss to be personal, they would not make the self-sacrificing and handsome offer that they have made of forgoing half the bonus and offering to work without extra pay for ten instead of eight hours a day and the printer himself offering to work for six months without any pay whatsoever. Both the Society and the employees deserve heartiest congratulations for this spirit of comradeship existing between what may be called Capital and Labour. This expression of the excellent spirit is no small compensation for the tremendous losses the Society has suffered.
 The loss of the valuable manuscripts containing Gokhale’s life and the files of the Dnyan Prakash for the last eighty years is indeed irreparable. But it is only in this manner that Nature gives us rude shocks and reminds us that there is nothing permanent, nothing ever- lasting except God himself; and that therefore ours is but honourably
 and humbly to labour only to do His will irrespective of consequ- ences.
 The members of the Society are now manfully striving to restart without avoidable delay the interrupted activities. The question is how will the public help. Assurances have been given from many parts of India. It is to be hoped that the assurances will be translated into action without delay and without fuss. However much one may differ from the politics of the Society, there is no denying the honest and self-sacrificing labours of its members, there is no denying  their patriotism. It stands unique in its great social activities  no  less  valuable than the political. I hope that the readers of Young India will show their appreciation of the many services of the Society, and their toleration where they differ from the Society’s politics, by sending in their subscriptions in response to its appeal.
 SPINNING-WHEEL IN MYSORE
 In his speech at the District Conference, the Deputy Commissioner and the President of the District Board of Mysore presented spinning as a useful subsidiary occupation, and as pre- eminetly suited in poor families to supplement the family income, and thus exhorted the local bodies and public-spirited people to take it up in right earnest :
 To secure increased popularity and to ensure its general adoption by the people . . . it is necessary that the leaders in each village, the Yejmans the Sahukars, the  Budhivantas should take to it.       I appeal to all  Municipal
 Councils, Panchayats, and Village Committees, Co-operative Societies and other Associations to stock and sell charkha to the local people, and secure at least one trained weaver for their town or village, provide him with a loom, and get woven into dupaties and towels all the yarn locally spun by people who could not drive any other trade or calling owing to age, infirmity, disease or lack of occupation.       The District Board hopes to be able to take
 full advantage in the coming year of the recent order of Government promising to meet half the cost of demonstrations and competitions arranged for weaving and spinning. . . .
 Here at least there is an official recognition of the spinning- wheel. The more the possibilities of this simple instrument are known, the greater will be its hold upon the people.
 
 SPINNING FOR FAMINE RELIEF
 The Kathiawar Rajkiya Parishad is nursing a khadi centre in Kathiawar in and near Amreli by way of famine relief. Though there  is no actual famine there, for want of sufficient rain the cultivation has been below par for three successive years, the result being that many cultivators are living from hand to mouth. It is in this centre that nearly a thousand farmers’ wives are supplementing their poor resources with wages earned from hand-spinning. Instead of these women remaining in idleness and in a state of semi-starvation, they are earning from anything between one to three rupees per month according to the time they are able or willing to give to spinning. Incidentally this work furnishes occupation for carders, weavers and washermen. The difficulty however had to be confronted of selling khadi so made. Mr. Abbas Tyabji came to the rescue and he, assisted by Sjts. Amritlal Seth and Ramdas Gandhi, toured in parts of  Kathiawar for the purpose of hawking the khadi. It was not possible to sell it as cheap as khadi produced in some parts of India where carders, weavers, washermen and even spinners do not demand or receive the same wage as those in Kathiawar. But Mr. Abbas Tyabji was able successfully to appeal to local patriotism for the disposal of his khadi. And he tells me that nowhere was he put off by people, but, as soon as they understood what this khadi meant, they took all that he had to offer. This khadi, as all other khadi, has had an interesting history. Its price has gone down in the same proportion as it has risen in quality. And yet there is plenty of room for improvement in the quality of khadi and decline  of  its  prices.  The  decline  in  prices and progress in improvement depend upon steady improvement in carding and spinning upon which increasingly great  attention  is  being bestowed. But the chief points to be noticed in this connection are that khadi has been the means of giving work and wages to poor women who would have been without either but for khadi and that there is unlimited scope for this work provided demand for khadi can be kept up.
 PERIPATETIC KHADI EXHIBITION
 Khadi workers all the country over are discovering the great utility of khadi exhibitions in popularizing and demonstrating the various processes connected with cotton till it becomes khadi on the weavers’ loom. Recently a peripatetic exhibition was organized in the district of Ratnagiri. It covered eight villages. In all these places
 demonstrations were given in hand-ginning, carding, spinning on the wheel as well as the takli, and methods of testing the strength of yarn. There were exhibited samples of indigenous dyes, yarn spun  by leaders, khadi of various grades and a small assortment of other swadeshi goods. Whilst the exhibition was on, in the respective villages, hawking too was resorted to. There was a reading-room improvised which furnished literature on khadi. There was a magic-lantern demonstration. Singing parties gave songs and bhajans . People were encouraged and enabled to subscribe to the All-India Deshbandhu Memorial [Fund] and addresses on khadi were delivered by well- known speakers. The whole thing was organized in an efficient and inexpensive manner. The expenses amounted to Rs. 622-9-11. And these were partly covered by profits made on the khadi sales. There is no doubt that such exhibitions have a great educative value and further experience and consequent improvements may make them self-supporting.

 The communique further states :
 that the Government of India have also been assured that should any such extension of the scope of these regulations be contemplated in future, every reasonable opportunity will be given to all parties in the Union interested in the matter to make representations.
 I hold these two assurances to be simple camouflage. For the Union Government, in reply to questions in the Union House of Assembly, have been repeatedly saying the same thing that they have now told the Government of India, namely, that they had no present intention of exceeding the scope of the regulations beyond the position that existed prior to the judgment in question. The sting of the new Bill lies in its enabling powers. It is like the sword  of  Damocles hanging over the heads of both the Natives of South Africa and the Indian settlers, for, it can be made applicable to the latter precisely as the former. The Bill is, therefore, as insulting as it can possibly be made. Only it does not affect the material interests of the Indians as much as the Class Areas Bill, not because of any goodwill on the part of the Union Government, but because Indians as a rule do not take to labour, skilled or unskilled, of the  kind  contemplated under the Colour Bar Bill. They are better touched materially through their trade and through restriction of residential rights. And this is sought to be accomplished by the Class Areas Bill which is to be considered by the Round Table Conference. The Colour Bar Bill shows the mentality of the Union Government and as The Times of India correspondent very properly says in effect the acceptance by the Union Government of the proposal for a Round Table Confe- rence is a mere courteous gesture. It is not to be interpreted to mean a change in the Union Government’s angle of vision. And this deduc- tion is further strengthened by the later information that in adumbrat- ing his native policy, General Hertzog has made it clear that, whilst he is prepared to allow limited representation in the Union Parlia- ment to the Natives and to the Coloured people, he will not allow any whatsoever to the Indian. The result which The Times of India correspondent rightly deduces is that the Indian, in the estimation of General Hertzog, stands infinitely lower than the Native. In fact, he is  to be tolerated till he can be effaced from South Africa as a necessary evil. The Colour Bar Bill therefore cannot be isolated from the different Acts of the Union Government. It forms part of its settled policy and furnishes the key to it.
 Nor is the second assurance given by the Union Government of the slightest value. Is it any new right that they have conceded when they say that when the scope of the regulations is extended every reasonable opportunity will be given to all parties in the Union, interested in the matter, to make representations specially when it is known to them that representations of Indians carry no voting force behind them? And, if the qualifying phrase in  the  communique means that parties outside the Union, that is, the Government of India or the Imperial Government will not be allowed even to make representations, surely the assurance is worse than useless, because, it is a restriction of which the announcement has been made and not a concession.

  WHAT IS PRAYER? 
A medical graduate asks :
 What is the best form of prayer? How much time should be spent at it?  In my opinion to do justice is the best form of prayer and one who is sincere about doing justice to all does not need to do any more praying.  Some people
 1
 spend a long time over  Sandhya  and 95% of them do not understand the
 meaning of what they say. In my opinion prayer should be said in one’s mother tongue. It alone can affect the soul best. I should say that a sincere prayer for one minute is enough. It should suffice to promise God not to sin.
Prayer means asking God for something in a reverent attitude.	But
 the word is used also to denote any devotional act. Worship is a better term to use for what the correspondent has in mind. But definition apart, what is it that millions of Hindus, Mussalmans, Christians and Jews and others do every day during the time set apart for the  adoration of the Maker? It seems to me that it is a yearning of the heart to be one with the Maker, an invocation for His blessing. It is in this case the attitute that matters, not words uttered or muttered. And often the association of words that have been handed down from ancient times has an effect which in their rendering into one’s mother tongue they will lose altogether. Thus the Gayatri translated and recited in, say, Gujarati, will not have the same effect as the original. The utterance of the word ‘Rama’ will instantaneoulsy affect millions of Hindus, when the word ‘God’, although they may
 
 
 understand the meaning, will leave them untouched. Words after all acquire a power by long usage and sacredness associated with their use. There is much therefore to be said for the retention of the old Sanskrit formulae for the most prevalent mantras or verses. That the meaning of them should be properly understood goes without saying.
 There can be no fixed rule laid down as to the time these devotional acts should take. It depends upon individual temperament. These are precious moments in one’s daily life. The exercises are intended to sober and humble us and enable us to realize that nothing happens without His will and that we are but ‘clay in the hands of the Potter’. These are moments when one reviews one’s immediate past, confesses one’s weakness, asks for forgiveness and strength to be and do better. One minute may be enough for some, twenty-four hours may be too little for others. For those who are filled with the presence of God in them, to labour is to pray. Their life is one continuous prayer or act of worship. For us ordinary mortals there must be a middle path between these two extremes. We are not so exalted as to be able to say that all our acts are a dedication, nor perhaps are we so for gone as to be living purely for self. Hence have all religions set apart times for general devotion. Unfortunately these have nowadays become merely mechanical and formal, where they are not hypocritical. What is necessary therefore is the correct attitude to accompany these devotions.
 For definte personal prayer in the sense of asking God for something, it should certainly be in one’s own tongue. Nothing can be grander than to ask God to make us act justly towards everything that lives.

  CO-OPERATION IN SPINNING 
 A dear friend asks me to answer the question that has occurred to him and his other friends.
 Is there co-operation in spinning? Does it not rather make people purely individualistic, self-centred and keep them separate from one another even as so many pebbles?
 The briefest and the most decisive answer I can give is : “Go,
 watch any well-organized spinning centre and test the thing for yourself. You will then discover that spinning cannot succeed without co-operation.”
 But brief though this answer is, it is, I know, useless for those (and they are the majority) who cannot or will not make the time for paying such a visit. I must therefore try to convince by describing such a centre in the best way I can.
 In speaking to a co-operative society in Madras last year, I said that through hand-spinning I was trying to found the largest co- operative society known to the world. This is not an untrue claim. It may be ambitious. It is not untrue because hand-spinning cannot serve the purpose for which it is intended unless millions actually co- operate in it.
 The purpose is to drive away enforced idleness and pauperism which is the result mainly of that idleness in India. This purpose, it will be admitted, is grand enough. The effort must be correspondinlgy great.
 There must be co-operation from the very commencement. If spinning makes one self-reliant it also enables one to understand the necessity of interdependence almost at every step.  An  ordinary spinner must find a ready market for her surplus yarn. She cannot weave it. There can be no market for her yarn without the co- operation of a large number of people. Just as our agriculture is possible only because there is co-operation, be it ever so little, of millions in regard to the cultivation and disposal of the produce, so will spinning be successful only if there is co-operation on an equally large scale.
 Take the working of any typical centre. At the central office is collected seed cootton for spinners. The cotton is ginned by ginners perhaps at the centre. It is distributed then among carders who re- deliver it in the shape of slivers. These are now ready to be distributed among the spinners who bring their yarn from week to week and take away fresh slivers and their wages in return. The yarn thus received is given to weavers to weave and received back for sale in the shape of khaddar. This latter must now be sold to the wearers—the general public. Thus the centre office has to be in constant living human touch with a very large number of people irrespective of caste, colour or creed. For the centre has no dividends to make, has no exclusive
 care but the care of the most needy. The centre to be useful must keep itself clean in every sense of the term. The bond between it and the component parts of the vast organization is purely spiritual or moral. A spinning centre therefore is a co-operative society whose members are ginners, carders, spinners, weavers and buyers—all tied together by  a common bond, mutual goodwill and service. In this society the course of every piece can be traced almost with certainty as it floats to and fro. And as these centres grow and draw the youth of the country who have the fire of patriotism burning brightly in their hearts and whose purity will stand the strain of all temptation, they will, they must, become centres for radiating elementary knowledge in hygiene, sanitation, domestic treatment of simple diseases among the villagers and education among their children suited to their needs. That time is not yet. The begin-ning indeed has been made. But the movement can grow only slowly. It is not possible to show substantial results till khadi has become a salable article in the bazaar like ghee or, better still, postage stamp. For the present a vast amount of energy has to be spent in educating the people to buy khadi in the place of any other cloth even as a child would eat and bless the rice cooked by its mother without stopping to think of the quality or the price of the rice so cooked. If it did, it would find that the rice cooked by the mother was far too dear for the labour and the love spent upon the working. And so will it be with khadi one day, when the children of mother Hind wake from their deep sleep and realize that yarn spun and worked by the hands of her daughters and sons can never be too dear for her crores of children. When this simple truth dawns upon us, spinning centres will multiply a hundredfold, a ray of hope will penetrate the dark Indian cottages and that hope will be the surest foundation for the freedom we want but do not know how to achieve.

 CHI. JAMNALAL,
 Your Letter. I wish you could make a long stay there and build up your body getting away from it all. There must be no more fits of giddiness. The real remedy for it is, mainly, open air and exercise. You must take a ten-mile walk daily. I should not think that is at all too much. The Charkha Sangh committee meets on the 26th; you do not therefore have to come here till then. It would be better if you resisted the temptation to stay in Delhi and at the Rampura Ashram for the present. I want you to spend as much time in Mussoorie as possible. Ask Lakshmidas to write to me from time to time. He should improve his health a lot. Velabehn will arrive here this evening along with Mani.

 The meeting is postponed to the 26th instant to enable everyone to be in his place on the 21st instant which is the Id day. I shall expect you on or before 26th.
 You must have received my letter about a travelling charkha for Mr. Muhammad Hassan Chaman of Kera, Cutch. If not, please send one to him by V.P.P.
 Mr. Birla has written to me of what he has done. It is good that you have enlisted his interest. I have written to him at length and asked him to give all the help he can to the Pratishthan.

 DEAR FRIEND,
 I have your circular letter. You might have noticed a paragraph in the current number of Young India about the Society’s loss. I am thinking out to whom I should make the appeal. Is Malaviyaji approaching anybody to your knowledge? There are monied men whom both he and I can approach. But, I know that he can approach them with greater confidence and greater effect. Has anyone approached Mr. Ambalal Sarabhai? To Jamnalalji I shall be writing. He is in a somewhat peculiar position just now. He has ceased to multiply his earnings and has almost ear-marked the profits he is making. I know that there is still a reserve. I fancy that he will send something, but nothing like what I would like him or ask him to send if he was his former self.

 DEAR FRIEND,
 I have your letter. I was simply wondering whether my letter had miscarried. I now understand the sad reasons for the delay in acknowledging my letter. You have not yet mentioned to me the calamity that has befallen you. How can I help you to find peace? It can only come from within and by waiting upon God and trusting Him with implicit faith. No man need ever feel lonely who feels the living presence of God near him and in him. Whatever peace I have found, has been found by increasing faith in the hand of God being in everything. Calamities then cease to be calamities. They test our faith and steadfastness. May you also find your peace in the midst of seeming strife.

  	I have your letter. The idea of making any money out of my writings 	even for a charitable purpose is quite foreign to me. Up to now I 	have avoided all such temptation. This time the temptation has come 	in a double manner. Mr. Holmes was the first tempter and he 	suggested that unless some notable publisher had the copyright, it 	would not be possible to circulate the Experiments with Truth as 	much as it is desirable and he added that the copyright would bring 	me a respectable sum for many of my public undertakings. I have 	therefore allowed Mr. Holmes to deal with the Macmillans. I have 	heard nothing further from him. I have really no terms. I can only 	give you this assurance that I shall not close with the Macmillans 	till I have corresponded with you. I shall endeavour also at least 	to give you the 
 rights over the German translation. You may let me know what terms it is possible for you to offer consistently with all your obligations.

You may perhaps like to file Jamnadas’s postcard; 	hence I am returning it to you. I have written to him that he should 	have asked me for money. Because of our difficult [financial] 	position you do not have the means to offer the  money.  Most 	probably I have written to you that my going to Finland has been 	cancelled. I have also replied to Devchandbhai. Today there is a 	letter from the Dewan. I have sent that also to Devchandbhai. In 	reply he writes that he would come by the end of the month. I have 	received the report and shall go through it. Fixing the date of the 	conference has been delayed and that troubles me too. But I am a 	bird with my wings clipped; so in every such case my inclination is 	to wait. It is perfectly true that Manilal has deposited a sum of 	Rs. 32,000 with Revashankerbhai, but we are not in a position to use 	it yet.    
 A letter of authority for Manilal is still to come. He told me on his return from Rajkot that it would come in a short time. On receiving this amount, whether my finances allow it or not, I shall definitely pay off the sums for which I have committed myself. I have talked to Vallabhbhai about the school at Rajkot. Whenever you need anything, please do ask for it. I am prepared to provide the cotton for the training of Antyaja teachers at Rajkot, Jetpur and other places. Bhai Balwantrai has arrived. I have asked him to keep Rs. 100 for the sale of khadi. And for making payments to the weavers he may ask for more as the need arises. I am having a talk about Gariyadhar with Bhai Shambhushanker who is here today. I have found that he is getting the work done very economically. It seems to me Gariyadhar work is the least expensive of all. Bhai Balwantrai said that Mulchandbhai needed Rs. 500 for the Antyaja Ashram, which has been paid to him on his personal security. All your queries have now been answered.

  LETTER TO KANTILAL H. PAREKH 
 ASHRAM,   SABARMATI,
 June 11, 1926
 BHAISHRI KANTILAL,
 I have your letter and it is quite to the point. You did well in writing. If you still have anything to ask do write to me without hesitation. The responsibility concerning khadi that rests on you and on others like you cannot be taken away, until we get men who will put less responsibility on others or who have the same capacity as yourself and until they are able to carry on khadi work by themselves. Along with the spread of the khadi movement we also exhort people to lead a simple life. Until we give up some of our undesirable habits khadi work cannot gain momentum.
 If to make khadi a practical proposition is interpreted to mean that it should compete with mill-made cloth, I think that is almost impossible. Dharma need never enter into such competition. Millow- ners may give away their cloth gratis just to kill khadi, but can we do the same with khadi? There certainly is competition in trade when commodities are offered, [virtually] for nothing. I am willing to listen to all critism of the work there. And I am eager to remove all recognizable faults. If it is said that since the workers are my own men the demands of that centre are readily conceded, the complaint is entirely baseless. I know it, because it is contrary to my nature to do so. Of course, one thing is certain I am entirely useless where I cannot trust people. I shall be glad if you let me know why you regard the complaint as reasonable.
 I am not at all perturbed by the way Ramdas has now been selling khadi. It cannot be said that he compels people to buy khadi. But one can certainly say that they buy it owing to a sense of shame
 or out of a desire to help others. I see nothing wrong in it. Only thus can the spread of khadi be initiated. The over-all expense on khadi is much more than the artisans’ wages, hence it is our duty to effect as much economy as possible. That depends on the spirit of sacrifice and the efficiency of the workers. I believe this improvement  is coming gradually. But please make whatever suggestions you can in this regard. We shall certainly implement as many  of them as possible.
 Now about you. If I know why you have lost faith in the khadi movement, I can find a remedy. We must promote the desire to work without remuneration. But how many people will do that? Before you do what you like, there is need to assume a big responsibility, you may certainly stay in the Ashram as long as you consider it necessary. The Ashram made you what you are and its reward therefore is your character. Always guard it. Make it nobler every day. That itself is the return. How long you can serve by living in the Ashram depends perhaps on your own convenience. One can free oneself of worries on one’s own. If freedom from worry depended upon another’s convenience, it could never be had. When the season there is over, do come here. Before that if you have anything particular to say, do write to me. If the answer I have given is not complete, please let me know.

 I have your letter. You will have misfortune. But there is as much connection between your being in Tiruchengodu and the water scarcity as there is between Z—a newcomer—being in  the  same district and the scarcity. Those who charge you with rivalry unconsciously give your presence an importance you did not deserve. But as there is not much danger of your becoming inflated, let those good people who so charge you have all the pleasure they can derive from their belief.
 The Finland idea is dead and decently buried. Dr. Dalal has suspected Hydrocele in Devdas. Even if it requires an operation it would be a minor thing. I certainly don’t worry about it, perhaps,
 
 because I don’t dread the knife so much as I dread drug-taking.
 Poor Santanam! It almost appears as if we in India have more than our share of domestic troubles. And in India the Southern Presidency seems to take the first place.

 I wish the Conference every success. The fact of its being held on the Pinakini Satyagraha Ashram grounds is a  tribute  to  the memory of the late Hanumantha Rao who devoted his life selflessly to the national cause. I hope that the various conferences, being held there will emphasize the necessity of hand-spinning and khaddar and that the black taint of untouchability that I discovered when I was in that district will be removed as a result of the effort of the Conference.

 BHAISHRI JAGJIVANDAS,
 Bhai Shambhushanker has arrived here. I discussed everything with him. Just now he has asked for Rs. 300.  A hundi for the amount  is sent herewith. Some of the debts are small, which he says he would pay off. I have found a debt of Rs. 1,300 from you. Bhai Shambh- ushanker has also told me that you intend to take interest on that amount. I feel that you cannot charge interest on money [lent for]
 public causes. Bhai Shambhushanker says that you constantly compl- ain that you get no money from me, and you have to spend your own money. I remember no occasion of with holding money without reason. Some delay might have been caused in understanding things; but for that, there was no delay whatever. Even if I have unreasonably delayed payment, you must never give your money and, if you do, you should not charge interest. I am prepared to pay off the money on behalf of the Parishad, when the question of interest is sorted out. Bhai Shambhushanker’s salary was also discussed. He should take Rs. 50 up to July and then Rs. 25. Bhai Shambhu-shanker would think it over and write to me. He deserves much more but he has told me of his desire to lead a selfless life and his resolve to take nothing for public service as far as possible. Hence I suggested Rs. 25.

  WHAT  IS  NATURAL?libtech_371_footnote 
 No word seems to be more abused today than the  word ‘natural’. For instance, a correspondent writes, “as eating  and drinking are natural to man, even so is anger.” Another seems to argue : “The sexual function is as natural as the other functions of the body. Were it not so, God would not have endowed it to man. If it was not our duty to curse the wicked and to bless the good, why should we have been endowed with the faculty of cursing and blessing? May it not be our duty to develop all our faculties to perfection? And thus himsa would appear to be as much one’s dharma as ahimsa. In short virtue and vice are figments of our imagination. Your ahimsa is a sign of weakness, inasmuch as it expresses only one side of our nature. Rather than regard it as the highest religion, why should we not regard it as the highest irreligion? Ahimsa Paramo Dharmah was orginally Ahimsa Paramo Adharmah- the negative prefix a (not) having somehow dropped out, or been rubbed out by some enemy of mankind. For on many occasions, ahimsa can be demonstrated to be the highest irreligion.” This is not one man’s argument, I have boiled down and put together the arguments of many. The theoryabout the negative a in ahimsa being
 
 dropped was propounded by an old barrister friend, and he did so in all seriousness. Indeed if we were to put man in the same category as the brute, many things could be proved to come under the description ‘natural’. But if they belong to two different species, not everything that is natural to the brute is natural to man. “Progress is man’s distinction, man’s alone, not beast’s.” Man has discrimination and reason. Man does not live by bread alone, as the brute does. He uses his reason to worship God and to know Him, and regards the attainment of that knowledge as the summum bonum of life. The desire to worship God is inconceivable in the brute, while man can voluntarily worship even Satan. It must therefore be, and is, man’s nature to know and find God. When he worships Satan, he  acts contrary to his nature. Of course, I will not carry conviction to one who makes no distinction bet-ween man and the brute. To him virtue and vice are convertible terms. While to the man whose end and aim  is realization of God, even the functions of eating and drinking can be natural only within certain limits. For having knowledge of God as his end, he will not eat or drink for the sake of enjoyment but solely for sustaining the body. Restraint and renunciation will therefore always be his watchwords even in respect of these functions.
 And if it is man’s nature to know and find God, sexual indulgence should be contrary to his nature, and complete renunci- ation of it will accord best with his mission. For realization of God is impossible with-out complete renunciation of the sexual desire. It is not man’s duty to develop all his faculties to perfection; his duty is to develop all his Godward faculties to perfection and to suppress completely those of a contrary tendency.
 Anyone blessed with choice or free will to accept and reject cannot but distinguish between good and evil, virtue and vice. For these mean in other words nothing but things to be accepted and things to be rejected. Thus robbing someone of his property is a thing to be rejected, hence bad or sinful. We have within us both good and bad desires. It is our duty to cultivate the former and to suppress or eradicate the latter, and if we fail therein we should remain brutes though born men. Birth as a human being is therefore declared by all religions as a rare privilege—a state of probation. And Hinduism says that if we are weighed and found wanting we should have to be reborn as beasts.
 The world is full of himsa and nature does appear to be ‘red in tooth and claw’. But if we bear in mind that man is higher than the brute, then is man superior to that Nature. If man has a divine mission to fulfil, a mission that becomes him, it is that of ahimsa. Standing as he does in the midst of himsa, he can retire into the innermost depths of his heart and declare to the world around him that his mission in this world of himsa is ahimsa, and only to the extent that he practises it does he adorn his kind. Man’s nature then is not himsa, but ahimsa, for he can speak from experience, his innermost convi- ction, that he is not the body but atman, and that he may use the body only with a view to expressing the atman, only with a view to self-realization. And from that experience he evolves the ethics of subduing desire, anger, ignorance, malice and other passions,  puts forth his best effort to achieve the end and finally attains complete success. Only when his efforts reach that consummation can be said to have fulfilled himself, to have acted according to his nature. Conquest of one’s passions therefore is not superhuman, but human, and observance of ahimsa is heroism of the highest type, with no room therein for cowardice or weakness.

  MAHUDHA KHADI CENTRE 
 I give below some facts from the report of this Centre which Shri Mohanlal Pandya has sent to me.
 The Centre provides spinning work to 261 women, of whom 236 are Muslims. The rest belong to the Brahmin, Vania and Barot communities. The number of spinners is increasing day by day. This work is a great help to them, as they would not go out of their homes to do any other work. The Muslim women call the spinning-wheel the glory of the housewife.
 As a result of this activity, three persons are employed  in carding and five women in making slivers. Eight looms are operating. The quantity of yarn produced is 20 maunds a month.
 Previously, they spun yarn of 6 counts, but now the Centre does not
 want them to spin yarn of less than 10 counts and does not, therefore,
  	pay less than 5 annas per pound. That comes to Rs. 12libtech_372_footnote 2 per 	maund, 
  	the total for 20 maunds being Rs. 246. This means an average earning 	of less than a rupee for every woman who spins. Shri Mohanlal, 
 however, tells me that it is probably one and a half rupees. If he is right, then either the number of spinners is smaller or the yarn spun is of a higher count.
 From this quantity of yarn they weave every month 65 pieces of khadi, each of 18 yds. length and 27 inches width. They make from
 
  	these pieces towels of 1libtech_373_footnote 2 yds. 	length and 22 inches width, and small 
  	square hand-kerchiefs. Most of this khadi is sold in Bombay. From 	Magashar to Vaishakh , khadi worth Rs. 1,294 was sold locally. The 	Centre now has stocks of khadi brought from  other  sources  too. 	Their sale during the last three months amounted to Rs. 842. The 	selling price of the khadi is fixed at 20 per cent less than the 	cost price. The Centre has a staff of six persons.  	I commend to this Centre and others like it the example of Bengal. 	There all khadi is produced for local consumption and, therefore, 	every effort is made to meet local needs. The result is that a large 	quantity of fine khadi with greater width is produced, and the 	production of such khadi is increasing day by day. If, in this 	manner, we work to meet local needs, we get opportunities of coming 	into contact with people belonging to all classes of society and are 	able to serve them, and at the same time the consumption of khadi 	will also spread to larger numbers. If we adopt this method of 	promoting the use of khadi, a good many problems will be solved 	automatically and by and by we shall advance not in arithmetical 	progression but in geometrical progression.  	If the same attention were paid to improving the strength of the 	yarn as is paid to its fineness, every weaver would agree to weave 	that yarn. Experience tells us that if we wish to improve the 	quality of yarn, the spinner should himself or herself prepare the 	slivers. It need not be pointed out that this will add to the 	earnings of the spinners.  	Another suggestion which I should like to make to workers is that 	they should go to villages in the interior and acquaint themselves 	with the conditions there. They should study the conditions of the 	poor in those villages and examine the possibility of introducing 	the spinning-wheel among them. I know that it is very  difficult  	for  people like us, brought up in modern conditions, to go and live 	in     
 places far removed from any railway station. Once we are there, we cannot leave as often as we might want. However, it is in these villages that real work awaits us, and eventually we shall be forced to go to them. There are more than 7,000 railway stations to serve seven lakh villages, and, if the Government’s tax collectors can reach them, why should not servants of the country go there to give the people a return for the taxes which they pay? It should not be forgotten that the people who collect the taxes as also those who benefit from them directly or indirectly are from among our own middle class.

  WHAT PROVISION SHOULD BE MADE FOR DISABLED CATTLE? 
A gentleman devoted to cow-protection writes :
 Those who have read my articles [on the subject of cow- protection] cannot be in doubt about my views on this point, for I cannot even for a moment entertain the idea  that  disabled  cattle should be left uncared for. I believe it to be the duty of all of us to look after such cattle. But I have often pointed out that kindness to animals does not mean merely this. Cow-protection has a wide connotation, and we do not discharge our duty to cows and buffaloes fully by merely looking after disabled cattle. Cow-protection means preventing, in a manner consistent with dharma, that is, without doing anyone harm, the unnecessary slaughter of cattle which is going on at present. Today, either through ignorance or fanaticism, we have given cow-protection an extremely narrow meaning. That is why we helplessly witness or tolerate the unnecessary slaughter of cows before our very eyes. With a little intelligence, some self-sacrifice and a measure of practical knowledge, we can save countless cows and buffaloes and thereby preserve the wealth of the country. An attempt is being made in these pages to explain this. This way of protecting cattle will necessarily ensure the protection of disabled and infirm cattle. At present, such cattle are a burden on us, and therefore, one might even say that they are not protected in the right manner. I am
 
 convinced that, when we have solved the problem of cow-protection in an intelligent manner, we shall be able to take excellent care of infirm and disabled cattle.

  LETTER TO N. S. VARADACHARI 
 THE  ASHRAM,  SABARMATI,
 June 13, 1926
 MY DEAR VARADACHARI,
 Your letter stuns me. Unless you have lost faith in the virtue of khadi how can you possibly want to leave khadi work? I had hoped that you were the last person in the world to think of deserting khadi.  I can understand your difficulties. But does not success in any enterprise mean capacity for overcoming difficulties no  matter however great they may be? If you cannot possibly do with the salary you are getting, you must let me know what you need. If the salary cannot be paid out of the Charkha Fund, some extra work might be found for you. “Where there is a will there is a way”. The only thing needful is that there should be a determination not to desert khadi no matter what it costs. But, if your faith in  khadi  has slackened, you should tell me so. I have warned friends repeatedly that if in their experience they find khadi to be an impracticable proposition, they must not hesitate to say so first to me if they will and then to the public. I have no desire to bolster up a wrong cause no matter what grief it may give to me personally. As a matter of fact it will be no grief to me but unmixed joy to discover my error. No friend therefore need spare me when he finds that my faith in khadi is like building castles in the air. But, if your faith is as green as when you wrote your essay then you dare not desert khadi. If necessary, you can come and discuss things personally with me.
 Yours sincerely,
 SJT. N. S. VARADACHARI ERODE

 MY DEAR LAWRENCE,
 I was delighted to receive your full letter after so many months or is it years? I did know that one of your sons was in Jaffna. How strange however that he should never write to me? I suppose you are now rich enough to let him even pay a visit to me. Let him come. I will give him some lessons in spinning and he will also see something of real Indian life.
 Yes. I would love to listen to the music of your daughters. Ramdas is just now with me. He is engaged in doing khaddar work. He will be leaving me for his headquarters in a few days. Devdas had an operation for appendicitis and he is now taking his convalescence with a friend at a hill station. Chhaganlal and Maganlal are here with their families. Jamnadas, the third brother whom you know, is in charge of a national school at Rajkot. Mrs. Naidu is touring through India. Mr. Andrews has gone to his friend Mr. Stokes who is living near Simla. This finishes the news of those whom you know. I am keeping well and passing my time principally in editing the two newspapers.
With love to you all.

 CHI. KISHORELAL,
 I got your letter. As for my message, it was on these lines : If you can free yourself occasionally for short intervals, you may be able to do some work as a supervisor and earn something. This suggestion was made in the belief that Balubhai would not be willing
 at present to allow you to come to the Ashram. I knew well that you would not like the suggestion and even said so to Nanabhai. But I thought you might perhaps accept a supervisor’s job for a short time as the work is, I think, lighter and while doing it you can stay in Bombay. I would certainly like your coming, if you can, to the Ashram and, if your health permits, your taking up lessons  in  weaving. What you say about the students is right. I would recommend it to them and would talk about women occasionally.

 BHAISHRI KASAMALI,
 Your letter. God is one. I do not understand your difficulty in conceivign Him as formless. That which has a form cannot be all- pervading, it needs must be the subtlest. It can therefore be only formless. All must admit the need for a guru but one may not hastily accept someone as a guru. In this age to seek a guru is to believe in one, because to acquire a perfect guide one must perfectly qualify oneslef. Moreover if we regard all faiths as true there is no need for us to relinquish our faith or make others change theirs, since all can adopt whatever satisfies them from all the religions.

  MESSAGE TO THE STUDENTS 
 The Gujarati Mahavidyalaya opened, after the last summer vacation, on June 14th, with an address from Gandhiji which, it being his day of silence, was read for him. The following is the translation :
1921 and 1926—What a difference?
 Please do not think that I am striking a melancholy note. We are not going back, our country is not going back. We have gone five years nearer swaraj and there can be no doubt about it. If someone says that it was very nearly achieved in 1921 and today it is far away—no one knows how far—do not believe it. Prayerful, well- meaning effort never goes in vain, and man’s success lies only in such an effort. The result is in His hands.
 Strength of numbers is the delight of the timid. The valiant of spirit glory in fighting alone. And you are all here to cultivate that valour of the spirit. Be you one or many, this valour is the only true valour, all else is false. And the valour of the spirit cannot be achieved without Sacrifice, Determination, Faith and Humility.
 We have built our Vidyalaya on the foundation of self- purification. Non-violent non-co-operation is one aspect of it. The ‘non’ means renunciation of violence and all that stands for it, i.e., all Government control. But so long as we do not co-operate with our ‘untouchable’ brethren, so long as there is no heart-unity between men of different faiths, so long as we do not co-operate with the millions of our countrymen by according to the spinning-wheel and khaddar the sacred place they deserve, the negative prefix is entirely nugatory. That non-co-operation will not be based on ahimsa, but himsa, i.e., hatred. A negative injunction without a positive obligation is like body without soul, worthy to be consigned to the flames. There are 7,000 railway station for the 7,00,000 villages of India. We do not even claim to know these 7,000 villages. We know only through  history the condition of villages not within easy reach of railway stations. The only loving tie of service that can bind the villagers to us is the spinning-wheel. Those who have not yet understood this basic truth are in this institution to no purpose. The education is not ‘national’ that takes no count of the starving millions of India and that devises no means for their relief. Government contact with the villages ends with the collection of revenue. Our contact with them begins with their service through the spinning-wheel, but it does not
 
 end there. The spinning-wheel is the centre of that service. If you spend your next vacation in some far-off village in the interior you will see the truth of my remark. You will find the people cheerless and fear-stricken. You will find houses in ruins. You will look in vain for any sanitary or hygienic conditions. You will find the cattle in a miserable way, and yet you will see idleness stalking  there. The people will tell you of the spinning-wheel having been in their homes long ago, but today they will entertain no talk of it or of any other cottage industry. They have no hope left in them. They live, for they cannot die at will. They will spin only if you spin. Even if a hundred out of a population of 300 in a village spin, you assure them of an additional income of Rs. 1,800 a year. You can lay the foundation of solid reform on this income in every village. It is easy I know to say this, but difficult to do.  Faith can make it easy. ‘I am alone, how can   I reach seven hundred thousand villages?’—This is the argument that pride whispers to us. Start with the faith that if you fix yourself up in one single village and succeed, the rest will follow. Progress is then assured. The Vidyalaya wants to make you workers of that type.  If it  is a cheerless job, the Vidyalaya is indeed cheerless and fit to be deserted.
 You will see that we open this term with a few changes in our staff. Acharya Gidwani whose sacrifice rendered the opening of this College possible, and who won the affection of students, has at my instance accepted the office of Principalship of Prem Maha Vidyalaya, Brindaban. I know that students were agitated over this. I congratulate them on their devotion to their Principal. I give you today the consolation that I gave the students that saw me the other day. We have to put up with these partings. We can but treasure the good things of our loved ones and follow them. Rest assured that we have done everything in the interests of the College. Fortunately we have Sjt. Nrisinhaprasad to serve us as Vice-Chancellor. He has lived with students for years and he often comes in contact with you. Trust yourselves to him.  My doors are always open for every one of you.  It has been a constant source of sorrow to me that I have not been able to come as closely in contact with you as I have wished.
 Professors Athavale, Dalal, Mazumdar and Shah have left the College. Their resignations were unavoidable. It is to be regretted that we shall no more have the benefit of their scholarship. But in their stead we have as Professors Sjts. Kikubhai, Jinabhai Desai, Nagindas, Gopaldas and Gandhi.They are all ex-students of the Vidyalaya and
 well may we take a pardonable pride in the fact. Let their industrious scholarship be a source of honour to us. May God bless you with long life for the selfless service of the country.

 BHAISHRI MULCHAND,
 I have your letter. I have made a minor change in your draft. In case the Ashram is closed down, it is not clear what would happen to the buildings. Would the buildings lapse to the Durbar along with the land? If there is any such idea, it should be removed. In such a contingency, the value of the buildings should be assessed by an arbitrator and we should get back half of it. The names of the trustees are all right, I return the drafts sent by you.

 DEAR FRIEND,
 I have your letterlibtech_378_footnotefor which I thank you. Hakim Saheblibtech_379_footnotehas not yet written to me. There is a letter due from him to me apart from his promise to you to write to me. You are quite right in saying that I should be bored by any discussion on political matters, for there is nothing new to be said upon them. I cannot possibly enthuse over Councils. My politics are confined to the spinning-wheel, the removal of untouchability and the prayers for Hindu-Muslim unity,  etc.  These three absorb the whole of my time and attention. What is the use of my interesting [myself] in things which I cannot appreciate, which I do not understand and which even repel me? So you will see, it is not you who bore me. Come and talk to me on the usefulness of the spinning-wheel, on the ways of spreading its message of hope, instruct me on the technique of the art and you  will  never  weary  me with your talk. If you ask me to listen to the respective merits
 of different Council parties or candidates, then, I should be aslittle eager to discuss those things as I would to discuss the claims of rival jockeys.

The points raised in your letter: By all means try to bridge the 	gulf that at the present moment seems to be widening between the two 	parties— Hindus and Mussalmans. But I adhere to my opinion that no 	real solution is to come at the present moment out of any effort. I 	see distrust everywhere. Some more fighting is unfortunately in 	store for us before a peaceful atmosphere is created. When each 	party expects to humble the other, peace is impossible. It is more 	over my firm conviction that this exaggerated importance we are 	giving to the Councils out of all proportion to their usefulness, if 	there ever was any, is keeping us apart. Everyone who remains 	outside the Councils thinks that he is losing something. And, what 	is true of individuals is true of communities and, therefore, there 	is a mad rush over getting as much representation as possible and 	then getting in as many men as possible with a communal taint.

  NOTES 
 DESHBANDHU
 Todaylibtech_388_footnoteis the first anniversary of Deshbandhu’s death. He died in harness, full of glory because full of faith. He believed in himself, in his country, because he believed in God; Up to the very last day he thought not of himself but of his country. He died for an ideal and he lives today through his ideal because it survives him. The dissensions in Bengal and the fratricidal war that is going on in India are indeed a negation of his ideal. But this aberration I hold to be merely a passing phase in working out the ideal. In the course of self-purification, we are bound to come upon steep rocks and deep ravines. We must bridge our way over the ravines and cut it through the rocks. And I have full faith that we shall overcome our difficulties. They  are  costing us dear. They may cost us dearer still. But no price will be greater for working out our own salvation for which Lokamanya, Deshbandhu and their predecessors lived and died.
 THE POSITION OF NON-CO-OPERATORS
A friend asks:
 In the midst of so many parties in the country we hardly see where to set our feet. When so many parties are being formed, is it not desirable that those few who still believe in the boycott of Councils, Hindu-Muslim unity, etc., should consolidate their forces and re-declare their ideals? We are being accused of having turned our backs on swaraj and our creed of non-violence is being openly sneered at. At every step we are being taunted that we are wasting our time and energy. I admit that one need not be disturbed by taunts, but it does appear desirable to organize ourselves and call upon those who are of our way of thinking to join us. How long are we to have patience? How long must our faith be tried?
If patience is worth anything, it must endure to the end of time.
 
 And a living faith will last in the midst of the blackest storm. Non-violence acts in a manner contrary to violence. I cannot advise the formation of an additional party. Non-violent non-co-operation can and must stand without an organized party. Non-violent non-co-operation is on its trial. Let each one who has faith in boycott of Councils, law-courts, etc., stand firm even though he may be alone in his own district. Khaddar and national schools should satisfy everyone who wants an occupation. The facts and figures I am reproducing from week to week from reports received from various khadi centres must convince the most sceptical of the progress that khadi is making, surely though slowly. And the progress that is now being made is not due to any momentary enthusiasm but it is due to a reasoned faith in khadi. If non-co-operators have faith in non-violent non-co-operation they will know that it is not dead but it is very much alive and that it will give a good account of itself when the darkest cloud threatens the horizon. It will be found then to be the one sheet-anchor of India’s hope.
 
IN SEARCH OF GURU
 As a result of my statement in Chapter I, Part II of My Experiments with Truthlibtech_389_footnote, that I was still in search of a guru, numerous correspondents, Hindus, Mussalmans and Christians, have favoured me with long letters telling me how to find a guru. More letters are still coming in. Some tell me actually where to go and whom to see. Some refer me to certain literature. I am grateful to all these correspondents for their solicitude for my welfare. But let them and others realize that my difficulty is fundamental. Nor does it trouble me. It is fundamental because my conception of a guru is perhaps not of the ordinary. Nothing but perfection will satisfy me. I am in search of one who, though in the flesh, is incorruptible and unmoved by passion, free from the pairs of opposites, who is truth and ahimsa incarnate and who will therefore fear none and be feared by none. Everyone gets the guru he deserves and strives for. The difficulty of finding the guru  I want is thus obvious. But it does not worry me; for it follows from what I have said, that I must try to perfect myself before I meet the guru in theflesh. Till then I must contemplate him in the spirit. My success lies in my continuous, humble, truthful striving. I know the
 
 path. It is straight and narrow. It is like the edge of a sword. I rejoice to walk on it. I weep when I slip. God’s word is: ‘He who strives never perishes.’ I have implicit faith in that promise. Though therefore from my weakness I fail a thousand times, I will not lose faith but hope that I shall see the Light when the flesh has been brought under perfect subjection as some day it must. I wonder if the kind correspondents will now understand my position and cease to worry about me but join me in the search, unless they are satisfied that they have found Him.
 FOR MANAGERS OF “GAUSHALAS”
 The Secretary of the All-India Cow-Protection Association circulated some time ago among the managers of all  known gaushalas and pinjrapoles a set of questions asking for information. Very poor response has been made to the request hitherto. Lists have been printed and they can now be supplied on application to the Secretary, All-India Cow-Protection Association, Sabarmati. Chaunde Maharaj has undertaken to visit the majority of gaushalas in Maharashtra and get the information personally from the managers on behalf of the Association. I trust that the managers in these places will give him all the information required. I need hardly say that the
 A.I.C.P.A. has no desire whatsoever to acquire ownership  of  or  control over any of these gaushalas. The desire is merely to collect information, tabulate and publish it for the guidance of all trustees and managers of such institutions and to assist them with advice. It is open to them, if they so wish, to be affiliated to the Association and receive its guidance and the benefit of the assistance of experts whose services the Association hopes to be able to secure at an early date. But whether any of these institutions is affiliated or not, it will be the duty of the Association to give all, the information in its possession to these societies. It is hardly necessary to state that co-ordination of effort on the part of nearly 1,500 gaushalas and their efficient management must result in the saving of many more cattle than are now saved. Affiliation would no doubt carry some responsibility on the part of those who seek affiliation. In their own interest they will be bound by rules made for their management and they will have to give a percentage of their income to the central Association. But it is entirely optional for every institution to seek or not to seek affiliation. The object of this note is merely to seek information.
 SOUTH AFRICAN LEGISLATION
 If anything is needed to emphasize the meaning of the warning issued by Mr. Andrews and myself, here is an extract from a South African letter:
 I feel that through the passage of the Colour Bar Bill the Government is not keeping its word with the Indian Government and the community, especially when on the top of this comes the Natal Educational Ordinance which, if passed, will mean the negation of educational rights we have, little as they are at present. In the direction of economics we see joint Councils raised under the Union Conciliation Act of 1921 in industries like furniture, printing, building, etc.—in which thousands of Indians are involved, without the Indian employees and employers being allowed to become members of the Trade Unions or Masters’ Union who negotiate on behalf of the employees and employers and who go to make up the joint Councils who prepare the  schedules or wages and other benefits; or, either allowed a voice in the joint Councils. Of course we have no objection to legislation aimed at bettering the conditions of workers, but at the same time what we do object to is that it is not fair to Indian employees and employers that schedules of wages  be prepared which they have to abide by in which they have had no voice and the effect of it all is the annihilation of both the Indian employer and employees.  It shows as clearly as day-light which way the wind is blowing.
The Class Areas Bill, because so much opposition was raised against it,
 has been postponed hut the policy underlying it is being pursued by the Union Government in a thousand other ways as instanced by the correspondent. It is impossible therefore to be too watchful about the way things are shaping in South Africa.

  SOME KNOTTY POINTS 
A medical friend from far-off Burma writes:
 Why do you emphasize khaddar and not swadeshi? Is not swadeshi the principle and khaddar a mere detail?
I do not regard khaddar to be a detail. Swadeshi is a theoretical
 term. Khaddar is the concrete and central fact of swadeshi. Swadeshi without khaddar is like the body without life, fit only to receive a decent burial or cremation. The only swadeshi cloth is khaddar. If one is to interpret swadeshi in the language of and in terms of the millions of this country, khaddar is a substantial thing in swadeshi like the air we breathe. The test of swadeshi is not the universality of the use of an article which goes under the name of swadeshi, but the universality of participation in the production or manufacture of such article. Thus considered, mill-made cloth is swadeshi only in a restricted sense. For, in its manufacture only an infinitesimal number of India’s millions can take part. But in the manufacture of khaddar millions can take part. The more the merrier. Khaddar, in my opinion, is bound up the welfare of millions of human beings. Khaddar is, therefore, the largest part of swadeshi and it is the only true demonstration of it. All else follows from it. India can live even if we do not use brass buttons or tooth-picks made in India. But India cannot live if we refuse to manufacture and wear khaddar. Khaddar will cease to have this paramount importance when a more profitable employment is discovered for the idle hours of India’s millions.
But says the Doctor:
 Good khaddar is costly and the ordinary variety is ugly.
 I deny that any khaddar is ugly. Want of the dead-sameness of a machine-made article is not a sign of ugliness, but it is a  sign  of  life, even as absence of sameness in the millions of leaves of a tree  is no sign of its ugliness. As a matter of fact, it is the variety about the leaves which gives a tree its life-like beauty. I can picture a machine-made tree whose every leaf would be absolutely the same
 size. It would look a ghastly thing, because we have not yet ceased to love the living tree. And, why should the cost of khaddar, good or bad, worry us if every penny we pay for it goes directly into the pockets of the starving millions? My experience is that in the majority of cases where people have taken to khaddar they have revised their tastes about dress. Though khaddar may be dearer yard per yard than the same quality of Manchester calico, the rejection of superfluous clothing more than balances the extra cost. Those who wish to wear fine khaddar can now obtain it at all the principal khadi centres.
The medical friend next questions the desirability of spinning
 and gravely suggests that if everybody would spin, the poor people who depend upon spinning for their livelihood would be losers. He forgets that those who are called upon to spin by way of sacrifice promote the khaddar atmosphere and make it possible to render spinning easier and by small inventions and discoveries make it more profitable. The wages of professional spinners cannot suffer in any way whatsoever by sacrificial spinning.
The friend then asks:
 Should doctors cease to prescribe foreign drugs and instead learn the use of Ayurvedic and Unani drugs?
 I have never considered the exclusion of everything foreign under every conceivable circumstance as part of swadeshi. The broad definition of swadeshi is the use of all home-made things to the exclusion of foreign things in so far as such use is necessary for the protection of home-industry more especially those industries without which India will become pauperized. In my opinion, therefore, swadeshi which excludes the use of everything foreign, because it is foreign, no matter how beneficial it may be, and irrespective of the fact that it impoverishes nobody, is a narrow interpretation of  swadeshi. Foreign drugs therefore, where they are highly efficacious and not otherwise objectionable, I should use without the slightest hesitation; that is, if I did not object to drugs altogether. But there is no doubt that there is among many medical men with Western diplomas a fashion, altogether harmful, of decrying Ayurvedic and Unani drugs, some of which are indeed of great potency and cheap withal. Any movement therefore on the part of those who  have received a training in Western medicine to explore the possibilities of Ayurvedic and Unani systems would be most welcome and desirable.
The last question that this friend asks has been repeatedly
 answered in these pages: “Are  you against all  machinery?” Myanswer is emphatically, “No”. But, I am against its indiscriminate multiplication. I refuse to be dazzled by the seeming triumph of machinery. I am uncompromisingly against all destructive machinery. But simple tools and instruments and such machinery as save individual labour and lighten the burden of the millions of cottagers I should welcome.

  FOR MANAGERS OF KHADI CENTRES 
 Readers must have noticed the interesting information I have been recently publishing about different khadi centres. I am now tempted to ask all khadi centres to send me the following particulars:
  Number 	of spinners 	supported, with 	sex, religion and, 	if possible, age. 	Wages paid to them. 	Their average monthly earnings 	from spinning. 	Count spun. 	Monthly output  of 	 yarn  received. 	Number of villages served.  If 	the cotton 	is hand-ginned, 	the quantity 	ginned and the 	rate paid. 	The number 	of ginners 	employed. Their total earnings.  If 	carding is 	done by 	professional carders, 	the number 	of carders 	and sliver-makers 	employed. The rate of 	wages paid to 	each. The 	total amount paid 	to them 	per month.  Number 	of weavers 	employed. The rate 	paid to them 	and total 	earned by them. 	The total 	output of khadi 	in yards, 	with width and 	in weight.  Cost 	of khadi 	up to weaving. 	Sale price. The 	total of 	local sales. 	Other sales.  Establishment 	charges. Number of men 	and women, paid 	or volunteers, 	working in connection 	with the centre. 
 I hope that all the superintendents who see this paragraph will kindly send me their returns. I would also add that these managers would add any further any new particulars that they may consider to be of interest to the movement.

  KHADDAR IN NILGIRI DISTRICT 
 Khaddar is being hawked in the Nilgiri District, a wealthy landlord having placed at the disposal of the khaddar workers his bungalow for storing khadi and for their residence during their tour. It appears that there was an exhibition at the Government Botanical Gardens under the aegis of the Nilgiri Agri-Horticultural Society. An application was made for exhibiting khaddar and spinning-wheels there. The Secretary replied that the exhibits could not be allowed for want of space although it is stated that the Secretary assured the public that exhibits of any kind, although not for competition, were invited for giving added strength to the show.
 I publish this information as it is received though it seemed difficult to believe that any Secretary would be guilty of such childishness as to refuse khadi exhibits in spite of the open invitation referred to. I shall be glad to publish any explanation  that  the Secretary may have to offer, if he cares to, for the conduct ascribed to him.

  CATTLE WEALTH 
 The reader who has been following Sjt. V. G. Desai’s writings about the cow could not have failed to notice the fact that in no other country in the world save India are cattle a burden on the land or its people. It may be said that the slaughter of cattle is not only not repugnant to the vast majority of people in other lands but they deliberately kill out superfluous cattle. One may even go further and say that in such countries there is no such thing as superfluous cattle, because cattle are actually bred for slaughter. In this argument there is no doubt considerable force. But all the writings in these pages are devoted to showing that, although the vast majority of people in India will not slaughter cattle for food, by judicious management, her cattle need not become a burden on the land and that their slaughter can be made so dear as to enable only those people to slaughter who will do so for luxury or in the name of religion. The aim of Young India writings is to show that cattle at thepresent moment go to the slaughter-houses because of our criminal negligence and want of proper knowledge. It is further to show that the saving of an  enormous number of cattle is more a problem of economics than
 
 religion; or rather to show that there is no conflict between religion and economics. Indeed, I have myself gone further and stated that a religion which is in conflict with fundamental economics is bad, and that, in the reverse way, economics that are in conflict  with fundamental religion are also equally bad.
 From the Western countries we can learn a great deal about cattle economics apart from their slaughter for food. If the nation, or say Hindus, would forego profits from cattle-keeping, the self-denial would be enough to keep cattle during the natural term of their lives even after they cease to give us a return in the shape of milk or labour. The following passageslibtech_390_footnotefrom the introduction to Henry and Morrisson’s treatise on Feeds and Feeding show how they regard cattle wealth in America.

  LETTER TO BIRENDRANATH SEN GUPTA

 June 19, 1926
 
DEAR FRIEND,
 I have your letter. In my opinion, attainment of divine knowledge is impossible so long as there is any lustfulness in man. A partner who is absolutely sure of his ground is not obliged to yield to another. I hold mutual consent to be absolutely necessary. I do recommend complete abstention for national workers. But I know that this is a counsel of perfection and each one must decide for himself and according to his ability.
 Where one is doing  one’s  best  even  in  the  midst  of chaos and confusion, there is no cause for disappointment. If boys want technical training, they should have either carpentry or smithy, not an elaborate workshop fashioned after the European style but  they  should work under an ordinary carpenter or smith and when they have mastered their art, they will take up to European developments and assimilate what is necessary. This becomes cheap and effective.
 I think that you should confine yourself to  the  work immediately before us. Mass education will come naturally out of any honest and concentrated activity.
 There is no trouble in the Gujarat Vidyapith except that some professors who are really no non-co-operators even so far as educational work is concerned had to resign.
 I am sorry to hear about what you say of Babu Ramdas Gour. By every kindly act we should all discourage him from his explorations.

I am  	receiving bitter complaints about deterioration of the quality of 	Tamil Nad khadi. This deterioration must be stopped at any cost and 	I think that a public statement is necessary to admit and explain 	the existing deterioration if you accept the verdict pronounced by  	so  many people. I translate for your benefit a paragraph from 	Jerajani’slibtech_401_footnoteletter 	to me whom I referred the complaint for my guidance. He says:  	The goodness that one noticed in Tirupur Khadi before is certainly 	not to be found now. But during the current year there is a little 	improvement. The khadi organization in Tirupur has     
 endeavoured to remedy the glaring defects this year. But there is room for more improvements. They have standardized ten strands to a quarter of an inch for the warp. But they have not set a standard for the woof. And, therefore, the weavers put as many or as few strands in the woof as they like. The tendency, therefore, is for the khadi to be loose and weak.
 Please investigate and let me know accurately if you admit deterioration. If so, how far has it gone, what steps can be taken to remedy the evil and how did the deterioration set in and who is responsible for it?

 Of course you know about the loss incurred by the Servants of India Society. In this connection Srinivasa Sastri has asked me also to go round with a begging bowl. He has a right to ask me. I have already written in Young India, but Sastriji desires that I should write to my friends also. Although I do not approve of the  political activities of the Society, I cannot forget the honesty, patriotism and sacrifice of its members and therefore I look upon it as a duty of every patriot to support and sustain it. If you hold the same opinion, do send some donation and, if possible, ask your other friends also to give something.

  MISCELLANEOUS 
 COMMUNITY DINNER AFTER A DEATH
 A gentleman writes as follows, expressing his feelings about my describing the custom of giving a community dinner after a death as uncivilized:libtech_405_footnote
I have stated so often that all that is written in Sanskrit should
 not be regarded as holy scriptures. Nor should everything which we find written in the Manusmriti and other authoritative works be  accepted as coming from the pen of the original authors of the works, or, even if that is so, as having literal authority at the present day. I do nothing of the sort. Certain principles aresanatanalibtech_406_footnote, and people who
 
 calling himself a sanatani Hindu, he could denounce the practice of community dinners after a death, which was enjoined by the Shastras.
 
 believe in them are sanatanis; but we need not believe that  the  practices which were enjoined in certain ages on the basis of those principles are valid in other ages too. Customs and practices change with place, time and circumstances. The practice of giving a  community dinner after someone’s death may have had  some meaning in old days, but in modern times our reason cannot accept it. Faith has no place in a sphere in which we can exercise our reason. Faith has meaning only in relation to what is above reason. In this case, our reason tells us that giving a community dinner after a death is not a part of dharma. Our experience of the world also tells us that no other religion enjoins or sanctions such a practice. We should therefore, have much stronger reason than the authority of Sanskrit verses to accept such dinners as enjoined in Hinduism. They are not at all consistent with the principles taught by the holy  books  of Hinduism or, for that matter, by the holy books of any other religion. We can see with our own eyes the harm they do. Against this evidence of direct observation, what weight can we attach to Sanskrit verses. Neither our reason nor our heart nor our  knowledge  of  other countries of the world justifies the practice of giving community dinners after a death. I have no better reason than this, and no one need be expected to have, for believing that such dinners are uncivilized. As those who believe that everything old is bad are wrong, so also are those who believe that it is good. Whether old or new, everything should be tested on the anvil of reason,  and  anything which does not stand the test should be rejected.
 LIQUOR SHOPS AND PARSIS
A Parsi gentleman writes to say:libtech_407_footnote
 This correspondent has provided me a double opportunity, for though I write very little these days against the evil of drink my conviction has not become less strong. I have now an opportunity of showing this, and I can also, at the same time, remove a misundersta-nding. Let us deal with the second point first. I have never said that only Parsis should stop running liquor-booths. My view is that all communities should forgo the financial benefit which the liquor trade may bring. There are many other means of honest livelihood, against which no
 
 one can raise any objection. I cannot but feel sorry when I see anyone leaving these and taking up liquor trade. If I had power in my hands, not a single liquor shop would remain in the country. There is no such thing as the right of drinking and, therefore, there would be no question of depriving people of a legitimate right. Selling liquor  should be as much a crime as stealing. If I have addressed my appeal to Parsis, that is because they are more enlightened than others and I expect more from them. I cannot, however, approve of anyone, whether he is a high-caste Hindu or a low-caste Hindu or belongs to some other community, carrying on liquor trade. Let us take up the first question. I still hold, in their entirety, the views about the evil of drinking which I expressed in 1920-21. The more I think and  observe, the more terrible the harm done by the evil of drinking appears to me. Some crimes are wholly the result of drinking. I am, therefore, impatient to take every possible legitimate  measure  to abolish this evil. But our helplessness is so great that we cannot quickly carry out even such a beneficial programme as prohibition. If I could teach people to adhere to non-violence, I would once again start the movement of picketing liquor shops. But it seems today that we worship only the power of the sword. In such circumst-ances, I do not have the courage to advocate any strong measure.

  KHADI IN SURAT 
 Tours for the sale of khadi, wherever they were undertaken, seem to have been successful. Shri Bharucha writes to say:libtech_408_footnote
 I am quite sure that such tours would succeed in other places as this one has done in Surat. All that is required is hard work and tact.

  THE WHEEL OF “ YAJNA” 	IN NEPAL 
 If the spinning-wheel is a means of yajna in this age and this country, and if yajna (sacrifice) has a place among all people and all religions, there is no harm in describing it as the wheel of yajna. This name occurred to me without any effort on my part when I read the following letter. Its authorlibtech_409_footnote, who comes from Nepal, is an inmate of the Ashram. He had to go through much suffering to be able to join the Ashram. He decided to master the science of the spinning-wheel and popularize it among the poor in Nepal. It is now three months since he returned to Nepal, and he has written a letter in Hindi giving an account of his work there during this period. The following is a translation of it:libtech_410_footnote
 This is an example of work worth emulating by every lover of the spinning-wheel. This khadi-worker has the capacity for self-sacrifice, determination, knowledge of the science of spinning, discrimination and humility. Anyone who has these virtues will come by other wealth easily enough.

   LETTER TO KRISHNADAS          MY 	DEAR KRISHNADAS,      THE 	ASHRAM, 	SABARMATI, 	June 20, 1926 
  	I have  your  letter  at  last  after  having  waited  for  it  for  	a long time. The decision not  to  go  to  Finland  has  certainly  	given me immense relief and satisfaction.libtech_411_footnoteThe temptation to go was strong but I felt that the 	invitation was  not  of  the  character  that  would  move me from 	India. If I had gone at all, I would have gone not to      
 deliver any political message but to come in contact with the student world and talk to them about the purity of personal life. It was that aspect of it which first tempted me. But when I discovered that the invitation was prompted and not spontaneous I felt that there was no call. I entirely endorse Guruji’s opinion that if one has no influence in one’s own surroundings, one cannot gain it by going out of them but by success without, gain influence within.
 For personal reasons I am certainly sorry that you are not returning to me for the time being. But I approve your decision to remain there to serve Guruji and to be at your mother’s call whenever she requires your presence. You will send for more money without hesitation whenever you require it.
 I am keeping good health. Devdas is taking his convalescence with Lalji in Mussoorie. Jamnalalji and Laxmidasbhai are also there. Jamnalalji probably returns here on the 26th. I had seen the Indian Review verse. Are you now much stronger than you were? I suppose you know that Tulsi Maher is doing extremely well in Nepal. Pyarelal is still with Mathuradas who has gone to Panchgani on  Doctor  Mehta’s advice.
 Yours,

 Girdhari writes that he, too, has now been discharged [from the hospital]. So I feel like writing something to you. Shall I thank you? I know that none of us deserved the affection you have shown to my friends. How can I repay such affection? It would be some sort of compensation if these youths and myself devote our whole life to the

Not that he need not know it; but we all remain so busy that, when we do talk, we talk only about things necessary. And as I have nothing to consult him about in the matter of Keshu’s education, I have not discussed with him the plans I am maturing. However, he does know that Keshu wants to increase his knowledge of mechanical engineering. Is there a technical institute in the Mysore State? And, if there is, do you know anything about it? And do you claim yours to be the best in India?

You will not be alarmed at the manner in which  I  have 	discussed the problem arising from letters like yours. There has 	been a crop of such letters recently from several parts of India.

 therefore, that I would gently discuss the problem in the pages of
 Young India.
 I have seen C.R.’slibtech_414_footnoteletter to you. I saw it only yesterday, Shankerlal being in Bombay. The thought never grasped my mind that Ramanathan’s case and the increase given to him had anything to do with you. On the contrary, Shankerlal told me that your pecuniary difficulty arose, or at least came to his notice, earlier than Ramanathan’s. And in any case, I have too great regard for you even to suspect that you would want to take an improper advantage of any situation.

  LETTER TO SATIS CHANDRA DAS GUPTA 
 THE ASHRAM, SABARMATI , June 22, 1926
 DEAR SATIS BABU,
 There are two things in which I want your help outside the khadi work. Keshu, as you are aware, is a born mechanic. He wants to make further progress. That he thinks he can only do by being in some mechanical engineering institution or shop. I would like to satisfy his ambition. But I do not know where he could be put. I have sent for the syllabus from the Andhra National Institute  at  Masulipatam,libtech_418_footnotewhich I have got. But I know that you can give me the best advice in this matter. That is one thing.
 The second is the soap question. As the colony here is growing in extent, the expense of soap increases. A cake of soap for the body costs 4 to 6 annas. Washing soap a cake two annas. Is there not a cheaper way of cleaning our bodies and our clothes if one wants to use something more than water? If you give me a simple recipe, I shall certainly make the soap at the Ashram if that proves cheaper. Having manufactured so much soap, you can perhaps tell me what to do. I want a prescription something after Dr. Ray’s style. You may remember what he said about tooth powders. He said: “the Bengal Chemical Works tooth powder was for fools, but chalk or powdered coal was the best powder for wise men like himself.” Is there any such simple soap prescription for wise men?
 I observe Hemaprabhadevi has ordered 12 copies of Ashram Bhajanavali. The last edition is almost all exhausted and I have discovered many typographical errors in it. It is the most popular publication of the Navajivan Printing Press. The edition is now being carefully revised by a committee and I hope that in a short time a faultless edition will be published when she can have as many copies as she likes.
 I do not mind your not coming if you are wanted for your work there. I shan’t strive with you about your personal finance. I am
 
 satisfied so long as both of you keep perfect health  and  perfect temper.

DEAR FRIEND,
 
 I have your letter for which I thank you. I suppose not much skill is required for the use of foreign dyes. Is it not a fact that one cause of their popularity and superiority is the facility with which foreign dyes can be handled? Those, therefore, who want to use  foreign dyes are using them. But a body like the All-India Spinners’ Association can make researches only in indigenous dyes. The utmost it can do is not to boycott foreign dyes.
 I agree with you that for hand-spinning to become more widespread, the quality of yarn should be improved both in strength and evenness. About the comparative merits of hand-weaving, I am afraid hand-weaving will not work among millions, if only because it is not available for millions. And it is too complicated for millions to learn. Hand-spinning is the only thing that everybody can do. Therefore, our concentration must be on that and that alone.
 Your sincerely,

 DEAR FRIEND,
 I have your letter. I am glad you are going back to Arambagh, You must develop the power of resisting malaria. I know nothing about the resignation of Tarini Babu. I shall enquire. But supposing that he accepts the inspectorship and you do something else, who will do the actual work in Arambagh? It seems to me to be a  wrong method of going about the work, if it is a matter of finding maintenance, otherwise why not belong to the Khadi Pratishthan and work Arambagh under Khadi Pratishthan? And if you do not care for Khadi Pratishthan, why not belong to the Abhoy Ashram? And if you are to take a course of medicine, the question again arises who will work Arambagh? My impression is that you should be where your work is or else you will make no headway. It may be however that I have not yet grasped the meaning of what you have described in your letter. You will then explain.
 I hope Profulla has now got rid of his eye trouble. I have not a shadow of doubt that the time is coming when the country will learn that there is no work but the work of construction. It opens up such illimitable scope for solid work. What does it matter whether along those lines we get swaraj today or tomorrow? I know that it is the shortest cut,
 I must not be tempted to move out of Sabarmati during this year. God will open a way for me next year.

I write this letter to express the hope I have in you. I hear that Chi. Ratilal is extravagant with his money. Now he has asked for money from me. I have written to him saying that I can give him nothing without Doctor’s permission. I don’t know whether you get a chance to read the letters I write to him. I take it that you do. What I expect you to do is not to let Ratilal spend money unnecessarily. Keep a proper account or make him do it. I expect you to gain a hold over Ratilal by your self-control and strength of character so that he might mend. This work, I think, is not beyond the capacity of a virtuous woman. No one can deal with the mental infirmity of Ratilal but you, if you wish, can certainly do that. You have given me that hope.

But I feel that we should not keep it too long. It is good that you intend to go to Matheran. But if you notice strikingly good results in Panchgani, I think, you should not move from there. One prefers Panchgani because of its altitude. In
 
 Matheran you can get cool air but you cannot have the height—that is its defect. But why talk now about what would arise after September? In Bombay you won’t need the help of anyone—would you? After going to Panchgani if you need Mahadev, write to me. Panchgani is a big town. Facilities for shopping, etc., are as good as at Deolali. So Pyarelal would have no difficulties there.

 I am asking the manager of the Satyagraha Ashram to send you some Ashram   photographs   if   there   are   any   available.   You    need not worry about paying for them. All the recent photographs of mine that you may have seen are snapshots taken unawares, for, for the last ten years, I have not given a sitting to any photographer.
 I shall see to it that you get a complimentary copy of Young India regularly. My articles are always written on almost the last day possible for going to print and the date of publication is so arranged as to catch the European mail of the same week.

 BHAISHRI SHAMBHUSHANKERlibtech_424_footnote,
 I had your letter. I accept and applaud your decision about salary. You will draw Rs. 50 p.m. up to the month of July, so the change will take effect from August onwards. I have not yet received Bhai Jagjivandas’s letter. You have not sent me the copy of the agreement which has been sent to you for your signature; but from what you write I can see no objection to including the immovable property if you wish to bind yourself. As I see it, the responsibility for paying the damages will arise only for losses caused by your carelessness; not for other losses. I also agree with you that there should be a worker to help you. We should think over the conditions on which such a man should be engaged. Let us hope that by the grace of God it would rain. Think about and write to me of all the jobs that are usually done during the rainy season and others that could be done. It is better if you have a talk about  khadi  with Maneklal and Chhaganlal. How much of such khadi could they have with them? We have to think about it if it is much. The khadi that Bhai Vajeshanker sells, in whose name does he get it made? How much khadi has he got woven? Isn’t he in Hanod on behalf of the State? There is only one principle underlying the khadi activity. In India crores of people do not have any occupation except agriculture. Sufficient livelihood for the crores cannot be obtained  from agriculture alone. Similarly, agriculture can’t take  up  their  whole time. They must have some other occupation and that  is hand-spinning. So we are propagating it everywhere. Khadi produced
 
 from hand-spun yarn is thus a means of propagating spinning. We endure the various fraudulent practices of [some] spinners, ginners and weavers, etc., but when we come to a stage when we can’t bear such practices, we stop taking work from them. The way you have suggested is the only way to make them guileless. That is, we should ourselves become guileless, pure, selfless and hardworking.

 I send herewith Bhai Gokulbhai’s letter. I understand nothing in it. When Vallabhbhai comes, I will talk about it. Let me know what is your opinion. Can we, even if we want to, give our permission without a meeting of the committee?

  CHARKHA IN OTHER LANDS 
 Sjt. C. Balaji Rao of Coimbatore has circulated printed extracts collected with much labour from ‘Peoples of All Nations’ showing what place the ancient wheel occupies in the homes of other peoples. I reproduce them below slightly abridged:libtech_425_footnote
 Only those who are obsessed with prejudice will refuse to see the potency of the wheel in the foregoing extracts, assuming, ofcourse, that the statements made in the original compilation are true. The greatest obsession is the poor wage earned by the spinner. If we would but get out of ourselves for a while and step into the shoes of the famishing millions, we would at once discover that what appears trifling to us is a fortune for them. We would further discover that millions can add only a few pice to their daily income which, as it is, is
 
 
 no more than a few pice. It is at the most Rs. 40 per year, i.e., say 7 pice per day.

  SERVANTS OF INDIA SOCIETY’S RELIEF FUND 
 I gladly publish the following appeal to the public made by Sjt. Sastri:
 The Servants of India Society have sustained a terrible loss by the fire which brought to ruin the Arya Bhushan Press and the Dnyan Prakash Press. These had been built up with great patience and foresight by Mr. Gokhale, who knew the mutations of public support and desired to provide for the Society a constant source of income. Deprived of their mainstay, the members of the Society cannot but turn in their distress to their countrymen for that prompt and generous help in money which alone can put them back in their former position and enable them to resume their career of service to the public. I have already appealed to personal friends through private letters, and I wish by this means to reach the wider pubic who are interested in the Society and its work. Sympathy and help are flowing in from all sides, and our hearts have been gladdened beyond measure by the spontaneous expressions of goodwill received from those who are not in habitual agreement with us on public matters. As I said on another occasion, it seems as though the essential kindliness of human nature, being so often forced out of its natural current by conflict of interests, were only waiting for a pretext to come back to its own channel.
 We calculate that two lakhs of rupees would be required to enable us to make a fresh start. The sum is large, and there is depression all round. Still my colleague and I have every confidence that in a few months’ time we shall get what we want. Our members will go round to various places, but they are not many and cannot be everywhere. We look to our associates and sympathizers in all parts of the country for active help. We beg them to respond to this appeal as though it had been made to them individually and in person. No amount is so small but it will be welcome; in fact small reflection that we are known and appreciated by a wide circle of those whom we seek to serve.
The total amount  collected  at  the   time   of  circulation  of  the
 appeal amounted to over Rs. 26,000. I hope that the whole of the two lacs required to set the two presses and the papers going will have been subscribed by the time  these   lines  appear  in   print.  The  true
 insurance for public concerns like the Servants of India Society is public goodwill reduced to concrete terms.

  SACRIFICE 
 I have before me several letters from young men complaining that they have so many family burdens that the poor salary they get from public work is totally inadequate for their wants. One therefore says he must give up public work and go to Europe by raising a loan or securing a gift and increase his earning capacity; another is in search of a paying job; yet another wants a capital to start a paying business. Everyone of these young men is a sound, honest and self-sacrificing worker. But a reaction has set in. Family requirements have increased. Khadi or national education does not satisfy them. They do not desire to be a burden upon public service by asking for an increase. But the logical outcome of this attitude of mind must mean, if it becomes at all general, either stoppage of the public service which depends upon the labours of such men and  women,  or  a general indefinite increase which in its turn must bring about the same undesirable result.
 It was because this process of multiplication of wants out of proportion to our surroundings was discovered to be going on with increasing velocity that non-co-operation was conceived. And thus conceived it was not non-co-operation with persons, but with an attitude that was responsible for the system which had seized us in its serpentine coils and which was reducing us to dust. The system had raised the standard of living among us, its creatures, wholly unwarranted by the general condition of the country. And since India did not live upon exploitation of other peoples, the expansion of the middle class who were also the middle-men meant extinction of the lowest strata. Hence the smallest villages were dying out through sheer exhaustion. This was all plain to many of us in 1920. The arresting movement is yet in its infancy. Let us not hinder it by any hasty action.
 This artificial increase in our wants has been felt more severely than it otherwise would have been, because of the persistence of the family system which the Western method is ill-designed to support. The joint system having become wooden, its evils have become
 
 accentuated, its sweet graces have disappeared. Thus, evil has been added to evil.
 Our self-sacrifice must, therefore, be in terms of the require- ments of the country. The reforms required are more from within than from without. A perfect constitution superimposed upon a rotten internal condition will be like a whited sepulchre.
 The process of self-purification must therefore be completed. The spirit of self-sacrifice must be extended. Great as the sacrifice has been, it is nothing compared to the demands made upon us by the country. We dare not support able-bodied members of the family— men or women—who will not work. We may not contribute a single pice towards the expenses of conforming to meaningless or superstitious customs, such as caste-dinners, or towards forming expensive marriage connections. Every marriage and every death brings an unnecessary, cruel burden upon the head of the family. We must refuse to regard such acts of self-denial as self-sacrifice. They are evils to be counteracted with courage and resolution.
 There is too, for us, the inordinately expensive education. When it is difficult for millions even to make the two ends meet, when millions are dying of starvation, it is monstrous to think of giving our relatives a costly education. Expansion of the mind will come from hard experience, not necessarily in the college or the school-room. When some of us deny ourselves and ours the so-called higher education, we shall find true means of giving and receiving a really high education. Is there not, may there not be, a way of each boy paying for his own education? There may be no such way. Whether there is or there is not such a way is irrelevant. But there is no doubt that when we deny ourselves the way of expensive education seeing that aspiration after higher education is a laudable end, we shall find out a way of fulfilling it more in accord with our surroundings. The golden rule to apply in all such cases is resolutely to refuse to have what millions cannot. This ability to refuse will not descend upon us all of a sudden. The first thing is to cultivate the mental attitude that will not have possessions or facilities denied to millions, and the next immediate thing is to re-arrange our lives as fast as possible in accordance with that mentality.
 Without a large, very large, army of such self-sacrificing and determined workers, real progress of the masses, I hold, to be an impossibility. And without that progress, there is no such thing as
 swaraj. Progress towards swaraj will be in exact proportion to the increase in the number of workers who will dare to sacrifice their all for the cause of the poor.

  	‘MAHATMAJI’S ORDER’ 
A teacher writes:
 There is a small group of boys of our school in . . . who have been regularly sending 1,000 yards of self-spun yarn to the A.I.S.A. for some months, and they have been doing this little service merely on account of intense love for you. If anyone asks them the reason for their spinning, they reply: ‘It is Mahatmaji’s order. It has got to be obeyed.’ I think such mentality on the part of little boys is to be encouraged in every way. Slave mentality is something quite different from the spirit of hero-worship or implicit obedience. These boys are now anxious to get some message from you in your own handwriting for their inspiration. I am sure their request will be complied with.
 I do not know whether the mentality betrayed by this letter is hero-worship or blind worship. I can conceive occasions when implicit obedience without waiting for reasoning out causes is a necessity. It is essentially the quality of a soldier. And no nation can make  substantial progress without the possession of that quality by a vast number of its people. But occasions for such obedience are and must be rare in any well-ordered society. The worst thing that can happen to boys in a school is to have to render blind obedience to everything that the teacher says. On the contrary, if teachers are to stimulate the reasoning faculty of boys and girls under their care, they would continuously tax their reason and make them think for themselves. Faith only begins where reason stops. But there are very few actions in the world for which reasonable justification cannot be found.  A  teacher would not tolerate from his pupils, who were asked to account for drinking boiled and filtered water in a locality where the quality of well-water was suspected, an answer to the effect that such were the orders of a mahatma. And if it be wrong to admit such an answer, in the supposed case, it is surely wrong to approve of the justification for spinning that the boys of the school in question have given for their spinning. When I am dislodged from my mahatmaship in that school, as I have certainly been dislodged in several homes to my
 knowledge (for some of my correspondents have been gracious enough to inform me of their lost love), I am afraid the spinning-wheel will be destroyed. Surely, a cause is often greater than the man. Certainly, the spinning-wheel is greater than myself. I should be exceedingly sorry to find, when the hero-worship of me is destroyed, because of some fatuous mistakes that I may commit or because people are enraged against me for some cause or other, that the good cause of the spinning-wheel had to suffer. It is therefore infinitely better that the pupils should reason out for themselves all the things that are capable of being so treated. The spinning-wheel is essentially a thing for reasoning out. With it, in my opinion, is mixed up the well-being of the whole mass of Indian humanity.  Pupils  should, therefore, learn something about the deep poverty of the masses. They should have an ocular demonstration of some villages that are crumbling down to pieces. They should know the population of India. They should know the vast extent of this peninsula and they should know what it is that all the many millions can do to add to their scanty resources. They should learn to identify themselves with the poor and the downtrodden in the land. They should be taught to deny themselves, so far as possible, things that the poorest cannot have. Then they will understand the virtue of spinning. It will then survive any shock including disillusionment about myself. The cause of the spinning-wheel is too great and too good to have to rest on mere hero-worship. It lends itself to scientific economic treatment.
 I know that there is among us a great deal of blind hero-worship such as this correspondent has described, and I hope that the teachers of national schools will take note of the warning I have uttered and prevent their pupils from lazily basing their actions upon statements, without testing, of men reputed to be great.

  FOR A.I.S.A. MEMBERS 
 The managers of Khadi Bhandar, Princess Street, Bombay, and of The A.I. Charkha Sangh Khadi Bhandar, 14, Dadi Sheth, Agyari Lane, Kalbadevi Road, Bombay, inform me that on sending them their certificates of memberships the members of the A.I.S.A. can become members without payment of these Bhandars and get all  the concessions allowed to the paying members including  all  their circulars and a rebate on purchases. They further announce that,
 during the month of July there will be sales in both the stores at reduced rates. The prices will be invariably reduced by 6_ per cent but on some special goods the reduction will be 25 per cent and in some cases even 50 per cent. The reduced rates will last till the end of the next month.

  NOTES 
 VILLAGE ORGANIZATION
 Professor Narayandas Malkani’s notes on his recent tour in Bardoli Taluka are both interesting and instructive. The reader will find there a brief account of an experiment in village work that has been going on in that Taluka amongst the backward classes since 1921 when the wave of temperance reform swept through the land. Here in this small tract the introduction of the wheel is bringing about a slow but steady revolution in the life of the simple dwellers. But for the charkha, temperance workers could not have had any footing in these villages. Nor could they have produced any impression whatsoever upon the villagers, if they had not come in touch with the people in many other ways and found a profitable employment for occupying every idle moment of theirs. The workers have been able to divert the minds of villagers from drink and interest them in spinning. Effort is being made to educate the children  of these  people. The education that is being given them is by no means of the orthodox type. It fits in with their surroundings and is intended to draw out all their faculties. The idea being not to manufacture clerks but to make citizens of the children, well able to take care of themselves and well able to preserve intact their hereditary occupation, namely, agriculture, spinning, weaving, etc. But the experiment is still in its infancy. The child is father to the man. And even in this infant stage of the experiment everything that has gone on hitherto gives promise of a brilliant future. For, with the introduction of hand-spinning, the trades necessary for sustaining it are also being gradually revived amongst the people. It is not too much to hope that this revolution that is going on amongst the people may enable them to get rid of, what Professor Malkani calls, ‘the native bureaucracy’ and that not by violent but by strictly non-violent means, means that are calculated to convert not to coerce ‘the native bureaucracy’. For,
 the people simply need to be independent of both the money-lender and the publican, of the first by ceasing to want credit and of the second by ceasing to drink.
 A TRAVESTY
 ‘The voluntary repatriation’ described by Dr. Malan, the Union Ministerlibtech_426_footnote, is anything but voluntary. It is stimulated, aided or induced. And if the process continues unchecked, it may presently become compulsory. A large number of men repatriated are said to be colonial-born. No colonial-born Indian to whom India is only a geographical expression will voluntarily repatriate himself. Again it is not voluntary repatriation when an agency is set up, probably paid by results, to collect repatriation recruits and when these recruits are detained in compounds pending repatriation. It seems to me that this detention in compounds is likely to be declared illegal if it is tested in  a court of law. For detention without a guard would be useless. And placing a guard over free and innocent men would  amount  to wrongful confinement. I know of no regulation in 1914  that permitted the Government to detain such men in guarded camps. If repatriation is to be voluntary it must be free from the pestering attention of recruiting agents and there should be no detention in depots or camps.
 THE TRUE GURU
 In confirmation of my note on the definition of a guru, a correspondent sends the following interesting information:
 In connection with your definition of a guru, I am reminded of the beautiful lines of the poet-saint Ramadas. He said:
 
 ‘You cannot find a better guru than viveka or the power of discriminating from untruth, right from wrong or good from evil. There is no better disciple than chitta or mind, and no nobler friend than one’s jeeva or soul.’ In fact, Ramadas points out that man need not go outside himself in search of a guru. ‘Be guided by your power of discrimination, derived from your implicit faith in God, keep your mind under control of such a power and nobly sacrifice the self.’ This in essence is the advice of the Maharashtrian saint.

  TO READERS OF “ HINDI NAVAJIVAN” 
 It has ever been a matter of sorrow to me that I am not able to write for Hindi Navajivan or look after it. After Shri Haribhau Upadhyaya was posted for khadi work, I have received several complaints regarding the language of Hindi Navajivan. It is said that the quality of the language has deteriorated, that there are grammatical errors and that the idiom has a foreign ring. It is also said that sometimes the meaning conveyed is just the opposite of what is intended. All this may be true. Although the translators do their work with devotion and industry, it may well be that they, being Gujaratis, make mistakes. I am looking for a person who knows Hindi. I hope, when I find one, the chances of error will be fewer. At the same time, it may be appropriate to point out that, after all, Hindi Navajivan carries only translations. Of course, I shall do my best to see that the meaning is not distorted. The truth, however, remains that I have not the ability to bring out Navajivan in Hindi. I have neither the time to manage its affairs nor the requisite knowledge of Hindi. I agreed to bring out Hindi Navajivan on the insistence of friends and out of a desire that those who know only Hindi should not remain unacquainted with my ideas. This work can be continued if readers will help. They can help in two ways: (1) they can point out the errors, and (2) they can refuse to buy the paper when the errors become too many to put up with. Navajivan is not published out of any financial motive. It is brought out solely to advance the general good. If, owing to faults of language or some other reason, it cannot serve the purpose for which it is intended, it will be our duty to close it down.
 All the translations carried in this issue are by persons whose mother tongue is Hindi.
Readers will oblige me by pointing out errors in this issue.

  LETTER TO DEVI WEST 
 THE ASHRAM, SABARMATI, June 24, 1926
 
 MY DEAR DEVIlibtech_427_footnote,
 So you are an orphan now. And yet, why an orphan! Father had died full of years and contentment that he lived a life of godliness and was liked by those who knew him. I hope, therefore, that you and other members of the family have not given way to grief. What a beautiful motto on the tomb-stone: To live in hearts we leave behind is not to die.
 Yes. Indeed, India is today cut up into two owing to these mad riots. God’s ways are inscrutable. I am hoping that the fighters will be soon exhausted. It is simple madness that gives rise to these fights.
 We are keeping fairly well. I say fairly well because Radha and Rukhi are just now ill. They have malaria. Devdas has undergone an operation for appendicitis. He is convalescing now. Manilal is still in phoenix. Ramdas is doing khadi work. Have not seen Bhai Kotwal for many months now.
 Did I tell you that I had an English friend living in the Ashram? Her name is Miss Slade. We have given her an Indian name, Mirabai. A German lady is coming probably this week.
 Yours,

  	Absence of any letter from you except the one you wrote from Simla 	means, I hope, that you are enjoying your stay with Stokes. I hope 	that the visit has given you rest and peace.  	Shankerlal told me that you were grieved over my chafing you about 	your Christian partiality. But I hope that you have got over the 	grief and turned the incident to one of joy. Is it not a matter of 	joy that you should have friends who will not always be serious with 	you?  	I am so glad I had not gone to Finland. I have received several 	letters of congratulations on my decision not to go. Amongst these 
 was a Punjabi Christian friend who came here and passed a night before going to Helsingfors. He has gone as a delegate.
 Happenings in South Africa do not give one much hope of a satisfactory conclusion to the deliberations of the Round Table Conference.libtech_428_footnote

 I have your letter. I have written to you about Anandilibtech_430_footnote. Dr. Kanuga was called in. He wanted to administer quinine. He had said that he would himself send the medicine. She remains very restless these days; so I have not insisted on getting the medicine from him. Chhaganlal went to his place once, but could not find him. So quinine is being given regularly from here. At the moment the fever has subsided. Quinine will be continued for some time. What you write about a bath is right. I will see that she remains particularly careful about it. There has not been a drop of rain here. Its failure is causing apprehension.

CHI. PRABHALAKSHMI,
 Your letter. In accordance with your wishes, I would not use your letter without your permission. If people gossip, how can we muzzle them? We should be amused if we are accused when we are innocent. When we are in the wrong, however harsh others may be towards us, we ought to be more severe with ourselves; then we won’t find their harshness unbearable. Since God is all-pervading, without attributes and without form, we should instal Him in our hearts and meditate on Him. All of us—whether great or small, good or bad, intelligent or dull and so on—are what we are by virtue of our past deeds. To enquire who have done worthy deeds and why we have become as noble as we are, and so on, is to lay claim to godlike perfection and, in all this arrogance, the question is never answered. Thus, faith comes when reason fails. Your duty just now is to become tranquil, forget all that has happened and fulfil your  function  in radiant perfection.

 I have your telegram. It surprised me. I learnt about the matter when Mahadev told me. In his letter to Pyarelal he wrote a sentence in jest. Mahadev thinks your telegram is the result of that. Please do not think that Pyarelal is particularly needed for the work. It is true that, as is my nature, I do make use of people who are there, according to their qualifications. But that does not mean that Pyarelal should come here. I have made arrangements here for the Hindi Navajivan. If I need more help, I shall have Pyarelal send translations from there.

  POSSESSED BY GHOST OF SUSPICION 
 “A Passenger” has written the following letter without giving his name.libtech_440_footnoteSuch letters do not deserve any notice. One does not know, however, how many workers may be victims of such suspicions. The issues raised in the letter are worthy of attention. I made inquiries immediately on receiving the letter, and discovered that the facts of the case are quite different from what they are represented to be by “A Passenger”. The person against whom these allegations are made is engaged in work which he simply could not have carried on if he travelled without paying proper fare as he is stated in this letter to havedone. He is, moreover, being watched by railway officials. If he were even once caught travelling without a proper ticket, his career of public service would come to an immediate end. He generally travels third class, but a friend had bought for him a second-class ticket from Morbi and so he had taken a seat in that compartment. From Muli, he changed into a third-class compartment for a short distance because he wanted to be with a friend who was travelling in that compartment.
 
 The worker has still with him the number on the second-class ticket which he held. Normally, no one preserves the number on a railway ticket but, as mentioned above, railway officials are a little too kindly disposed to him and ask him frequently to show his ticket. He also, therefore, has made it a practice to note down the number on his ticket. It does not appear that “A Passenger” had taken the trouble to examine the ticket himself or ask the worker for his explanation. So much about the facts of this case.
 The complaint made in this letter should give every public worker reason for pride, and also teach him to be vigilant. It should give reason for pride because it shows that people expect to see perfection in workers who wear khadi, and it teaches him the need for vigilance because a worker wearing khadi must avoid any lapse. It should, however, be admitted that many self-seeking “workers” have exploited the khadi dress. Wearing khadi and having made people believe that they were men of self-sacrifice, such workers deceive society and refuse to make any amends. Such khadi-wearers disgrace khadi.
 It is a perfectly legitimate assumption that anyone who cheats the railway company in the matter of fare will ultimately plunder the country, too, for his own gain. And yet many people think that it is not wrong to cheat the railway company and to travel by a higher class on a lower-class ticket. It is desirable that people who wear khadi and others engaged in national work keep away from such dishonesty. People, too, should understand that all persons who wear khadi are not saints, and those who do not wear it are not wicked men. Anybody, irrespective of whether he is a good man or a bad man, is free to adopt khadi as his dress. If others look upon khadi as sacred and feel themselves sanctified by wearing it, that is their special faith and does them honour. But this special faith of theirs does not concern the world. It is but right that people in the world should trust a person only after he has been put to the test.
 In conclusion,  I  should  like  everyone  to  know  that  I  have no disciple, or rather that I have only one, myself. All my time is taken up in teaching myself, and so I need no other disciple.

 SPINNING IN SANSOLIlibtech_441_footnote
 Sansoli is a village in the Kalol taluka of Panch Mahals district. Shri Ranchhoddas Shah has sent some interesting information about the spinning activity there, which I reproduce below:libtech_442_footnote
 The number of spinning-wheels is not large enough to be remarkable, but the quantity of yarn produced on each wheel is quite good. But the most interesting particular mentioned in this report is that the spinner himself or herself cards the cotton and makes the slivers. It is essential that this improvement in the method of work should, wherever possible, be adopted forthwith. Carding is an easy operation, and those who card their own cotton can spin better and finer yarn and produce more of it in the same time, whereas it is difficult to spin to one’s satisfaction if the carding has been done by a hired carder. Another point worth noting here is that the cultivator who gins the cotton grown by himself increases his earning considerably. The practice of ginning cotton at home can be revived only if the spinning is also done at home. Thus the revival of hand-spinning will automatically bring about the revival of  many other industries which have disappeared, and enable an intelligent cultivator to add considerably to his income.
 
 SELF-PURIFICATION AMONG CHODHRASlibtech_443_footnote
 Shri Narayan Malkani, a professor in the Gujarat Mahavi- dyalaya, had recently been to the parts around Vedchhi in Bardoli taluka and saw the work being done among the Chodhras there. He has sent a report of his observations for Young India of which I give here only the gist, since many points mentioned in the original are meant for readers outside Gujarat. In 1921 a good many villages had got rid of the evil of drink. Afterwards, a good number had started drinking again. The enduring work which is now being done there, thanks to some workers having settled for good in the area, is interesting to observe. Shri Narayan Malkani is reporting only about the “clean” villages, clean in respect of drinking.
 
 Navajivan, 11-7-1926.
 The Chodhras rank high among the Kaliparajlibtech_444_footnotecommunities. They till their own land; but, thanks to their addiction to drinking, the owners of liquor shops and money lenders in the area have become their masters and function as the “local” Government of the area. Those among them who succeed in freeing themselves from the grip of this “local” Government may be said to have won swaraj.
 The Vedchhi Ashramlibtech_445_footnotehas strengthened the anti-drink movement through sound work in the field of khadi. Four hundred spinning-wheels are in commission at present, which means that 800 persons spin on them daily. There are more men than women among them. In the firstlibtech_446_footnoteyear 500 lbs. of yarn was spun; lastlibtech_447_footnoteyear, the quantity rose to 16,000 lbs. This gave about 4,000 square yards of khadi. The people stock the required cotton from what they grow in their own fields, card it themselves and then spin. The yarn is woven into cloth in Vedchhi itself by Chodhra boys. The charge for weaving is only two annas a yard but the weaver gets some other help in addition to his wages. In some villages, this activity has provided work to carpenters too, and as a result people can have a fairly good spinning-wheel for Rs. 2. In this way, the people who wear khadi spend only two annas for every yard they use; and, where previously no supplementary occupation existed, two such occupations, weaving and carpentry, have come into existence.
When I  visited the area two years ago, I  asked the people how
 much they got through the spinning-wheel every year. An old man replied with evident pleasure that they got ten rupees. Shri Narayan Malkani gives detailed figures now. A Chodhra family requires 34 yds. of cloth in a year—10 yds. for children and 24 yds. for the husband and the wife. The family gets these 34 yards for Rs. 4_, whereas previously when they bought their requirements in the market they had to pay Rs. 22 for the same quantity. Thus a family producing its own cloth saves Rs. 17_. It is true, of course, that this does not take into account the cost of cotton. What would a poor Chodhra get for that cotton if he sold it in the market? Seven rupees for 14 lbs. The net saving, therefore, comes to Rs. 11. To them this is
 
 a big enough saving. It is not as if all the families keep back the 14 lbs. of cotton which they would require and spin it into yarn, but we may say that a movement in the direction has started.
 REFORMING VILLAGE LIFE
 We saw above that with the help of the spinning-wheel a slow but steady change is being brought about in the lives of the poor Chodhras. Without the aid of the spinning-wheel, the workers could not have come into contact with the village people merely by making speeches against the evil of drinking. If, moreover, they had  not shown to the latter a profitable way of spending the whole of their spare time, what effect could they have produced by their propaganda work? The workers stopped the village people from drinking and placed the spinning-wheel in their hands. They started schools for children, schools, moreover, in which the pupils do not receive the kind of clerk-making education which other schools impart but get education which will help them to be good farmers, spinners and weavers and live as useful members of society. The experiment is still in its initial stage; but the present ways of a child can tell us a little what he will be like when he grows up, and we can, therefore, hope from what has been achieved so far that we shall get excellent results in course of time. For, along with spinning, other occupations connected with it are also being revived. We may hope that, as a result of the work which is being done, the people will become free from the grip of what Prof. Malkani calls the “local” Government of the area, and that not by throwing off its yoke through force but by awakening the conscience of the present masters and bringing about a change of heart in them. This will happen because, once people learn to give all their time to work and stop borrowing money from professional money-lenders and patronizing the liquor shops, they are bound to become free from the grip of either.
 
 A CORRECTION
 Referring to the “Note” in the Navajivan of June 13, about the Mahudha khadi centre, a gentleman writes as follows:libtech_448_footnote
If  we  had many more such readers who read their  Navajivan
carefully and drew attention to errors, in a short time the paperwould
 
 
 be free from errors. It is certainly my own ambition that the paper should contain no error of fact, should use no improper word or be faulty in language. I know, however, that faults of language occur. Errors of fact creep in sometimes through inadvertence. The only claim I can make is that the language of the paper is restrained. As regards errors of fact, we need the help of readers. To prevent faults of language, the press should have more efficient workers and those who write for Navajivan should be studious of their language. I am not well equipped in regard to any of these, but despite these handicaps the desire to continue Navajivan is strong. Those readers of the paper, therefore, who love it have no option but to bear for the present with the errors which occur.
 The correspondent is certainly right in regard to the error in multiplication pointed out by him. Asked about the quantity of yarn produced from 20 maunds of yarn, Shri Mohanlal Pandya explains:
 The statements that 20 maunds of yarn was produced and 65 pieces of khadi were woven in [the month of] Vaishakh does not mean that all the 20 maunds of yarn was used for producing the 65 pieces. For 65 pieces, at the most 11 maunds of yarn would be required. The rest remained in balance. The quantity of yarn left in balance varies from month to month, depending on the number of weavers who work during the month.
 I need not suggest to friends who send reports that they should bear in mind that Navajivan has readers who read the paper with attention and, therefore, should work out their figures carefully and supply full details.
 TRUE GURU
 A gentleman writes as follows in support of my note explaining the qualities of a true guru:libtech_449_footnote
 Ramdas Swami has actually said in so many words that man need not search for any guru outside of himself; that one should follow the path indicated by one’s own sense of discrimination born of one’s faith in God, be guided by that sense of discrimination and always work in a spirit of sacrifice. That saint of Maharashtra has said in these few words all that needs to be said.

  	I have your letter. I still think that you ought not to leave your 	job and come to me. It is much better that you follow out in Bombay 	the rules of life at the Ashram. Surely there should be no 	difficulty about your learning Hindi and Sanskrit in Bombay. There 	are so many classes. There is a free Sanskrit class conducted in 	Kalbadevi Roadlibtech_453_footnoteby 	Narahari Shastri. It should be easier for you to go to some one to 	teach you Hindi.  	If you will go to the untouchable quarters in Madugaum, you will 	have no difficulty in knowing untouchables from touchables. There is 	in Matungalibtech_454_footnotea 	school conducted for untouchables. You can devote some time to that 	school if you choose to do so. And where you cannot do any personal 	work for them, and if you have even a few pice to spare, you may set 	aside that amount and give to those who are working for the 	so-called untouchables.

                DEAR 	FRIEND,   LETTER TO D. N. BAHADURJI       THE 	ASHRAM, 	SABARMATI, 	June 27, 1926 
  	I have your letter. 50 strength means half of what it should be. And 	strength means the quality of twist. A properly twisted thread will 	stand the strain of a standard weight and still not break and that 	standard means 100 marks. But if it stands only half of that weight, 	it would be 50 marks. But 50 strength is really not good enough for 	the weaver. Mill yarn too rarely attains 100 marks. But 70 marks 	would be creditable and it will offer no difficulty to the weaver in 	weaving. 50 is the standard mark for evenness of thread. When a 	well-twisted thread is not even, it snaps as it passes through the 	apparatus which is meant for receiving hundreds of threads called 	warp which give us the width of cloth. If the thread is uneven, it 	breaks from time to time. The more even the yarn, therefore, the 	better it is for weaving; hence the necessity for obtaining at least 	45 marks for evenness. Constant looking at the strand after the 	spinning is finished enables one to gauge the evenness, and the 	actual breaking of the yarn in order to gauge the strength enables 	one to arrive roughly at the possible strength. And when you get 	your yarn tested from time to time, you are in a position to make 	the necessary improvements which come by careful progress. I hope I 	am now clear. I felt so thankful and delighted that you are taking 	so much interest in this poor man’s work. What a silent revolution 	it would mean in our life if we could identify ourselves with the 	poorest of our people in a practical manner such as the 	spinning-wheel presents!  Your 	sincerely,  D. N.

  LETTER TO BHAGWANJI MEHTA

 Jeth Vad 2, 1982 [June 27,  1926]
 
BHAISHRI BHAGWANJI,
 I have your letter. Why do you suppose that I am prejudiced against you? Because I cannot accept your argument it does not mean that I am prejudiced against you. It is not my experience that I could refrain from sensual pleasures because I am married. How can I then accept this position? Among my friends there are a number of life-long celebates, men as well as women. Then how can I entertain any doubt?
 About God I shall write in Navajivan when I have the time. I say when I have the time because the question you ask has been asked often and there will be nothing new in my reply; but I shall try to take it up for your sake. I have never had any doubts about your honesty.

It has  	also been decided that before implementing this resolution the views 	of all the agents should be ascertained. It is very good that you do 	a lot of walking. Do not be in the least hurry to come over here. I 
 wouldnot be satisfied even with 83 p.c. strength in the yarn. My intention is to get 100 p.c. but I do not know where the difficulty lies. If the strength is 100 p.c. the evenness of the yarn also, I am sure, would be 100 p.c. I believe it is so because I find that the evenness of my yarn improves with the strength.

ASHRAM,

BHAISHRI PRABHUDAS,
 
 Your letter. You should write without reserve whatever you wish to and I shall answer as far as I can. Whatever the Gita says about the practice of yoga is only commendatory. It does not propose to teach any of the exercises. These should be learnt from a proper person. I myself do not know their sequence. I cited the example of friends who have practised pranayamalibtech_455_footnote. If one could attain brahmacharya merely through pranayama, a great problem would be solved but thereby brahmacharya would come to lose much of its importance. I do hold that pranayama and such other exercises  make  the observance of brahmacharya easier for the aspirant. I may even put someone from amongst the brahmacharis staying with  me  under those who have experience. You must not interpret what I say to mean that I want you to give up your studies. Indeed I wish you all success in them.

Being  free 	from faults and passions does not mean being absolutely perfect. It 	is only modest to feel the need for a guru. A guru need not 	necessarily be a living person. Even today I regard as my guides 	some who, though not yet perfect, have reached a high stage [of 	spiritual development]. There is no point in trying to know the 	difference between a perfect man and God. Since it is impossible to 	get a perfect answer, one must find a reply through one’s own 	experience.

 I have your letterlibtech_458_footnote. Since then I have also learnt about Bhomble’s death. Though it is a very severe blow, perhaps, it is well that he has passed out of the present body. I do not know how Sujata is bearing her grief. You will tell me all about the last moments of the boy. He had many faults, but he had also a nobility about him which was most charming. But he had lost the power of struggling against the devil within him.
 The Bengal politics make me sad and miserable when I think of them.libtech_459_footnoteIt is difficult to follow the intricacies from this distance. How is it that Das’s most trusted men have seceded? I almost feel that it would have been better if you had stood aloof from the quarrel. But, of course, you being on the spot should know best.
 The death of Deghapatialibtech_460_footnoteis also a sad business. I remember having met him at Darjeeling. You know when. Having such a slight acquaintance, I have not written to his family. But you will please convey my condolence if you think fit. And, the son, what about him?libtech_461_footnoteA terrible tragedy. One feels absolutely helpless when one contemplates such things over which there is no control.
 Yes, Devdas is quite all right and he is at Mussoorie, convalescing with Jamnalalji’s friends. We have now a German lady as an addition to the Ashram. I do not know how she will fare; it is yet too early to say.

  	I have your letter and the book. Please thank your friend on my 	behalf for having sent the book. I am returning it to you as I have 	read the book and I have also a copy of it. I read it in the Yeravda 	jail and a copy was presented to me by a well-known Catholic friend, 	I think, in Dehra Dun. I like the book for the charming simplicity 	with which the saintly girl has described her life, her hopes and 	her aspirations. The supernatural part of it had no appeal for me. 	The persistency with which she secured admission to the Convent 	commanded my respect and admiration. The purity of her character was 	worthy of adoration. Her rigorous self-examination was inspiring. 	The canonization, etc., did not interest me.  Yours 	sincerely,  From 	a microfilm: S.N. 11198     LETTER TO C. RAJAGOPALACHARI   THE 	ASHRAM, 	SABARMATI, 	June 30, 1926  MY 	DEAR C. R.,  	I have your letter about Tirupur khadi. The complaint is not about 	seasonal khadi. The comparison has been set up between last year’s 	and this year’s production. And the correspondent, who was himself 	a lover of khadi and an admirer of Tirupur khadi, contends that it 	has been progressively deteriorating. And as you see, Jerajani 	endorses the verdict up to a point. Whether a public statement is 	made or not, I think a more thorough investigation is necessary. If 	the hot season causes deterioration, we must either find out ways 	and means of combating the evils of heat or we must frankly tell the 	public that they must expect two qualities according to the seasons 	and, therefore, also two prices. 
 With reference to your tour, I have well-nigh despaired of any tour coming forth during the year through no fault of anybody. It is difficult to get you all ready at the same time. And you will insist upon having some unavoidable thing at the last moment and postpone your departure which is the conjuction of your stars. I would suggest complete cancellation of touring unless you have courage enough to go out even single. Manilal is not available till the first of September. He has been postponing the work of his Railway Association from time to time and I cannot put any pressure upon him when he pleads the cause of his association. Jamnalalji never cancels a programme, he accepts, but it is unjust to him and unjust to the cause to bind him to a programme which is not irrevocable. I have therefore freed him from all obligations. He will join you when you are ready if he at all can. Nobody wants to tour without you. You are therefore the central figure. Seeing that your own movements are erratic and beyond your control, the only thing to do is for you to say when you will move out and such men as can be got together will form the company. And if you have not the heart to undertake the job on these conditions, by all means give up the idea of touring this year, only remember this much that the Maharashtra tour has been fixed up after your definite instructions. But if these instructions were conditional upon Manilal Kothari and Jamnalalji joining you, let the Maharashtra tour also be cancelled. Please wire to me your decision. And do not hesitate to say no if the touring is really beyond you, whether on account of your difficulties at Tiruchengodu or any other. It is no use trusting to chance.
 Devdas is still at Mussoorie. He is gathering strength  and helping Punditjilibtech_462_footnote. In what way, he does not state. Laxmidas and Lalji are with him. Jamnalalji was here. He has gone for a few days to Ranpur to examine Amritlal Seth’s undertaking. Rajendra Babu left yesterday. Pyarelal is still with Mathuradas who, as you know, has gone to Panchgani, and is rendering invaluable help to Mathuradas. I have now a German lady. She came here on Saturday. Thus the Ashram is fairly full. Chhotalal has now calmed down and is trying to specialize in spinning and weaving, etc. There is no question therefore now of his travelling with you or coming to you.

  COLOUR BAR v. SWADESHI 
Thus writes Mr. Spender:
 Gandhi would  keep  out  European  goods;  the  South  Africans  would go a step further and keep out the Indians. Swadeshi and Colour Bar Bills are the obverse and reverse of the same idea; both follow from the despairing thought that East and West cannot intermingle without destroying  each  other’s characteristic ways of life. Gandhi, the saint, is full of benevolence, and I listened to him while he earnestly disclaimed all sympathy with violent or anarchical ways of changing any existing order. Yet, as he discoursed on the ravages which Western industrialism had wrought in the Indian village, I had the feeling that, if he were Emperor of India invested with plenary powers the regulations that he would make for the admission of Europeans and their settlement in India might not greatly differ from those which the South Africans are attempting to impose on Indians in South Africa today. I have a very real respect for Mr. Gandhi, and I am, of course, aware that the last thing that he desires is to afford excuses for either form of intolerance. It is nevertheless true that ‘Swadeshi’ and ‘Colour Bar’ belong to the same spiritual family.libtech_466_footnote
 This paragraph from Mr. Spender’s article furnishes an extraordinary study in what Tolstoy would call hypnotism. Under the hypnotic influence of the standardized thought of the English official in India, Mr. Spender is unable to see any difference between the Colour Bar Bills of South Africa and the Indian swadeshi in terms of
 
 khaddar. Mr. Spender is an honest Liberal. He has some sympathy for Indian aspirations. But he cannot escape the influence  of his immediate surroundings. What is true of him is no doubt true of every one of us. Hence the necessity for non-co-operation. When the surroundings are vicious, we must cut ourselves off from contact with those surroundings, in so far at least as our contact is voluntary.
 But whether Mr. Spender’s extraordinary proposition is an outcome of the hypnotic influence of his surroundings or whether it is really his own original idea, let us examine it. The Colour Bar Bill is aimed at men, not at measures. Swadeshi is aimed at measures only.Colour Bar is indiscriminately against a man’s race or colour. Swadeshi knows no such distinction. The upholders of the Colour Bar would carry out their purpose even violently, if necessary. Swadeshi eschews all form of violence, even mental. The Colour Bar has no reason behind it. Swadeshi, in the form of khaddar, is a scientific formula supported by reason all along the line. Under the Colour Bar every Indian, no matter what educational qualifications he  may possess, even though he may be thoroughly Westernized, is an undesirable person in the estimation of the Europeans of South Africa. The Colour Bar Bills are violent in purpose, for, they would keep the natives of the soil and the Asiatic settlers for ever as unskilled labourers and will not allow them to rise above that status. The Colour Bar Bills are intended to do, under the name of civilization and for its protection, perhaps, in a more virulent form, what has been done in the name of Hinduism by Hindus to the so-called untouchables. But it is worthy of note that untouchability, whatever may be said to the contrary, is fast dying in India. Those who are devoting themselves to the removal of untouchability are also those who are enthusiastically advocating the universalization of the spinning-wheel. Untouchability is admitted to be an evil. The Colour Bar is being raised almost to the status of a religion in South Africa. The Colour Bar Bills would harm, and deprive of their possessions innocent men and women without any just cause. Whereas swadeshi is intended to harm not one single soul, it seeks to return to the poorest of the land what has been taken away from them almost by force. The Colour Bar Bills are exclusive. Swadeshi is never exclusive in the sense in which the colour Bar Bills are. Swadeshi has no sympathy with the formula that East and West can never intermingle. Swadeshi does not banish all foreign or European goods, nor all machine-made goods, nor for that matter does swadeshi tolerate all home-made goods. Swadeshi admits of and
 welcomes the introduction of all foreign goods that cannot or need not be manufactured in India and that would benefit her people. Thus swadeshi admits all foreign books containing pure literature,  all foreign watches, foreign needles, foreign sewing machines, foreign pins. But swadeshi excludes all intoxicating drinks and drugs even though they may be manufactured in India. Swadeshi concentrates itself upon the spinning-wheel and khaddar, to the exclusion of all foreign cloth and even cloth manufactured in the mills of India, for the very simple, sufficient, satisfying and moral reason that the destruction of the spinning-wheel has meant the destruction of the only supplementary industry of India for the millions of its peasants without furnishing any substitute. Thus, swadeshi in the form of khaddar and the spinning-wheel is a paramount necessity for the very existence of the millions of her paupers. Whereas the Colour Bar Bills are a response to the greed of a handful of Europeans who are, after all, exploiting the resources of a land which belongs not to them, but to the original inhabitants of South Africa. The Colour Bar Bills have, therefore, no moral foundation whatsoever so far as I can see. The exclusion or the extinction of the Asiatic settlers of South Africa is in no way required, can in no way be proved to be necessary, for the existence of the South African Europeans. Still less can  the suppression of the original inhabitants of South Africa be defended on any single moral ground. It is, therefore, painfully surprising to find a person of Mr. Spender’s experience and attainments putting the highly moral swadeshi in the form of khaddar in the same category as the Colour Bar Bills. They do not belong to one family, let alone spiritual, but they belong to absolutely different families as different as the North Pole is from the South.
 Mr. Spender speculates upon what I would do if I  were  ‘Emperor of India invested with plenary powers’. Perhaps I can speculate with greater authority. If I were Emperor of India, I would extend the hand of fellowship to the whole of the world irrespective of caste, colour or creed, for, I claim the whole of mankind to be the children of one God, having absolutely the same capacity for self-realization as the tallest amongst them. I would  disband practically the whole of the army of occupation in India, retaining only such police as may be necessary for the protection of her citizens against thieves and robbers. I would not bribe the Frontier tribes as they are being bribed today. But I would cultivate the friendliest relations with them and to that end send out reformers amongst them
 in order to find out the ways or means of providing useful occupation for them. I would guarantee the fullest protection for every European living in India and all honest European enterprises. I would impose a prohibitive tariff on all foreign cloth so as to exclude it entirely from India and bring khaddar under State control, so as to enable every villager who chooses to spin, feel that the products of his or her spinning-wheel would be taken up. I would prohibit the importation of intoxicating liquors and close down every distillery, confining the manufacture of alcohol and opium for proved medical necessity. I would guarantee full protection to all forms of religious worship, save what is repugnant to the moral sense of mankind. I would throw open to the so-called untouchables every public temple and public school to which all other Hindus have right of admission. I would summon the representative of both the Hindus and Mussalmans, search their pockets and deprive them of all eatables and of all lethal weapons, if they have any, and lock them together in one room and open it only after they have settled their quarrels. There are of course many other things that I would do if I were Emperor of India. But since there is little chance of my being one, the foregoing is enough as a  fair sample of what one who is mis-called a visionary, but whoconsiders himself a practical man, understanding the wants of the  poorest people, would do if he had the power.

  	‘TOWARDS MORAL BANKRUPTCY’-I 
 Kind friends continue to send me cuttings from Indian newspapers approvingly dealing with the question of birth-control by the use of contraceptives. My correspondence with young men on their private conduct is increasing. I am able to discuss in these pages only an infinitesimal portion of the questions raised by my correspondents. American friends send me literature on the subject and some are even angry with me for having expressed an opinion against the use of contraceptives. They deplore that, an advanced reformer in many ways, I should be medieval in my views about birth-control. I find too that the advocates of the use of contraceptives number among them some of the soberest of men and women of all lands.
I therefore thought that there must be something very decisive
 in favour of the methods advocated and felt too that I should say on the subject more than I have done. Whilst I was thinking of  the problem and of the question of reading the literature on the subject, a book called Towards Moral Bankruptcy was placed in my hands for reading. It deals with this very subject and, as it appears to me, in a perfectly scientific manner. The original is in French by M. Paul Bureau and is entitled L’ Indiscipline des Moeurslibtech_467_footnotewhich  literally means “the indiscipline of morals”. The translation is published by Constable Company and has an introduction by Dr. Mary Scharlieb, C.B.E., M.D., M.S. (Lond.). It covers 538 pages in 15 chapters.
 Having read the book, I felt that, before I summarized the author’s views, I must in justice to the cause read  the  standard literature in favour of the methods advocated. I consequently borrowed from the Servants of India Society such literature as they had on the subject. They have very kindly lent me some of the books in their possession. Kaka Kalelkar who is studying the subject has
 given me Havelock Ellis’s volume specially bearing on the subject and a friend has sent me the special number of The Practitioner in which is collected some valuable medical opinion from well-known practitioners.
 My purpose in collecting literature on the subject was to test the accuracy, so far as a layman could, of M. Bureau’s conclusions. One often finds that there are two sides to questions even when scientists discuss them and that there is much to be said for either side. I was anxious, therefore, to know the viewpoints, of the advocates of contraceptives before I introduced to the reader M. Bureau’s volume.  I have come to the deliberate conclusion that so far at least as India is concerned, there is no case for the use of contraceptives. Those who advocate their use for Indian conditions either do not know them or choose to ignore them. But if it can be proved that the methods advocated are harmful even in the West, it would be unnecessary to examine the special Indian conditions.
 Let us therefore see what M. Bureau has to say. His studies are confined to France. But France means much. It is considered to be [one of] the most advanced countries in the world and, if the methods have failed in France, they are not likely to succeed elsewhere.
 Opinions may differ as to the meaning of the word ‘failure’. I must therefore define the word as it is here meant. The methods must be proved to have failed if it can be shown that moral bonds have
 loosened, licentiousness has increased, and, instead of  the  check  having been exercised by men and women for purposes of health and economic limitation of families only, it has been used principally for feeding animal passions. This is the moderate position. The extreme moral position condemns the use of contraceptives under every conceivable circumstance, it being contended that it is not necessary for man or woman to satisfy the sexual instinct except when the act is meant for race reproduction, even as it is not necessary for man or woman to eat except for sustaining the body. There is also the third position. There is a class of men who contend that there is no such thing as morality or that if there is, it consists not in exercising restraint but in indulgence of every form of animal appetite, so long as it does not so impair the constitution as to render it unfit for the very indulgence which is its object. For this extreme position, I do not suppose, M. Bureau has written his volume. For, M. Bureau concludes his books by quoting Tom Mann’s saying: ‘The future is for the nations who are chaste’.
 In the first part of his book, M. Bureau has collected facts which make most dismal reading. It shows how vast organizations have sprung up in France which merely pander to man’s basest tastes. Even the one claim of advocates of contraceptives that abortions must disappear with the use of these methods cannot be sustained. ‘It is certain’, says M. Bureau, ‘that during the twenty-five years that have especially seen the increase in France of anti-conceptionist methods, the number of criminal abortions has not become less.’ M. Bureau is of opinion that abortions are on the increase. He puts down the figure at anything between 2,75,000 and 3,25,000 per year. Public opinion does not look upon them with the horror that it did years ago.

  NOTES 
 KHADDAR EXHIBITIONS IN BIHAR
 I have before me a fairly long report of  the  Khaddar Exhibitions that have been recently held in Bihar. The inspiration to hold these exhibitions was derived by Babu Rajendra Prasad from such an exhibition held by the All-India Agrawala Maha Sabha at Delhi during the year. The first such exhibition in Bihar was opened by Babu Satis Chandra Das Gupta of Khadi Pratishthan, Calcutta. And
 as it proved successful, similar exhibitions were continued to be held in various parts of Bihar. The first exhibition was held on the grounds of Bihar Vidyapith on the banks of the Ganges, some three miles from Patna. The second was held in the Bihar Young Men’s Institute and it was opened by Sadhu Vaswani of Sind. The third was held at Arrah and the fourth at Muzaffarpur and was opened by Maulvi Saheb Muhammad Shaffee. The fifth was held at Chupralibtech_468_footnoteand was opened by Maulana Mazhar-ul-Haque. The sixth was held at Mairnea, a small village in the district of Chupra and the seventh and the last mentioned in the report was held at Gaya on the 11th instant. The highest attendance was at Gaya, in spite of terrible heat. It totalled 7,000. There was a large number of ladies included in the number. The least attendance was 2,000. The report goes on to state:
 These exhibitions are being visited by Congressmen, non-Congressmen, Government officials, Zamindars, lawyers, big and small merchants, and in some cases even Europeans. The exhibition at Mairnea was visited by crowds of simple villagers, rather than middle-class men.
The khadi sales averaged over a thousand each, the lowest being
 Rs. 400 at Mairnea, and the highest being Rs. 2,000 at Gaya. The report says:
 In these exhibitions all discord and disunion between Hindus and Mussalmans or political leaders holding different views was absent.
The methods adopted are:
 We approach at every place some prominent person and request him to organize a khadi exhibition. We secure an influential man to open it. Invitation cards are issued to prominent people. The exhibition is advertised by means of notices, placards, etc. In the evenings, during the exhibition time, magic lantern lectures are given illustrating the khadi movement.  Crowds are attracted to these lectures. After the exhibition is over, khadi is hawked in the places where it is held. We propose to continue to hold these exhibitions and expect to clear off our stock which amounts to Rs. 80,000.
 I observe from this report that noted men conducted the sales and hawking at these exhibitions.
 PROFESSOR PRESENTED WITH KHADDAR
 Quite recently, the students of the economic department of the Patna College presented Professor Hamilton on his retirement with a
 
 piece of khaddar of local manufacture with the following remarks by their spokesman as quoted in The Searchlight:
 Sir, I know you to be a devout follower of the late Prof. Marshall who lays down the basic concept of all his works on economics: ‘It is on the one side a study of wealth, on the other and more important side, a part of the study of man.’ And for you we cannot choose a better present than a piece of khadi, from start to finish, a Bihar product, made of the indigenous Kukti cotton. It lays bare to you, Sir, not only the economic endeavours of our country but the very heart of our nation. On the side of wealth-production it represents that part of it which goes to increase the poor man’s mite, and on its human side, represents the country’s struggle to provide food for the famished and to clothe the shame of the naked.
It is to be wished that all the students whether of Government
 college or other will appreciate the economics of khaddar as the Patna College students have done and will follow their example whenever they have any occasion to make presentations.
 KHADDAR IN MYSORE
A  correspondent writes:
 Some khaddar lovers of Mysore have started a co-operative society in Mysore town since July 1925. Not much khaddar is yet locally produced. The organizers therefore secure khaddar from Andhra, Tamil Nadu and Karnatak. The Society intends to increase its capital. At present they have 365 shares of Rs. 10 each. The shareholders are required to pay Re. 1 per month on each allotted share. But some have paid the whole amount. There are 103 members of the society. The shop purchases locally spun yarn at the rate of Rs. 12 per pound. It is then locally woven. The society is spending only Rs. 32 per month for the establishment and other charges. The paid-up capital between July 1925 and May last was Rs. 2,036. Khaddar purchased was Rs. 8,365. Khaddar sold was Rs. 8,088.
This is no doubt an unpretentious beginning for a town like
 Mysore. But if the example is copied by other towns and if the management is able and honest there is no doubt that there is a great future for khaddar in Mysore.
 WHO CAN AFFILIATE?
 A question has been asked what are the terms of affiliation for goshalas to All-India Cow-Protection Association. No rules have yet been passed by the Committee. But I adopt the  suggestions  of Chaunde Maharaj that it should be one per cent of the net income of
 
 the society seeking affiliation. Full particulars should be supplied at the time of affiliation and the applicant society should be prepared to endorse the objects of the Association and submit to inspection and audit by the Association. The affiliated institution or society shall have the right to have the advice of the experts of the Association and free use of the literature at its disposal and such other guidance as may be in its power to render. These rules will naturally be subject to the sanction of the Committee of the A.-I. Cow-Protection Association. I would welcome suggestions before the rules are placed before the Committee.

  ALL-INDIA DESHBANDHU MEMORIAL 
 A correspondent draws my attention to the fact that the acknowledgments of amounts received on behalf of the All-India Deshbandhu Memorial Fund have been loosely dealt with in Young India in that there has been no continuity. This is true because as intimations were received either from the Secretary or the Treasurer I passed on the memoranda without checking and without examining the last totals. The correspondent is therefore unable to know whether the monies paid by himself have been actually credited to the All-India Deshbandhu Memorial Fund or not. Upon receipt of this letter, I correspondedlibtech_469_footnotewith the Treasurer and secured a copy of the full list of subscribers to date. In order to avoid any confusion and error and so as to enable every subscriber to find out for himself whether his subscription has or has not been received, I am publishing the full listlibtech_470_footnote. I am unable to give the whole list in one issue, if only because the second part of the list is still under examination.
 I need hardly assure the reader that the funds at the Treasurer’s office are most jealously kept and they are banked as soon as they are received. The confusion has arisen not owing to faulty or careless book-keeping, but owing to omission to publish all lists received at the Young India office. I shall be thankful if subscribers will look up the list that is being now published and call my attention to any omission they may discover.

  LETTER TO SHEWAKRAM KARAMCHAND 
 THE ASHRAM, SABARMATI, July 2, 1926
 DEAR FRIEND,
 
 I have your letter. It is perfectly possible to completely stop involuntary night discharges. I have not entirely succeeded,  but  I know that it is perfectly possible. I have been free often for months and months. And I recall even a time when I was free for over a year. Why that long spell of freedom was broken is a long story. The discharges are neither natural nor beneficial for health. They are an interruption to the full development of health and, when one’s mind has become absolutely free from passion of every kind, night discharges are an impossibility. It is a state attainable by all. But it is attained by sustained and even painful effort.
 I  have  your  second letter  also  which  I  might  deal   with later in the pages of Young India.libtech_471_footnoteI have always wanted to give yourboys a letter in my own handwriting, but something or other has come in the way. Here are a few lines now.libtech_472_footnote

              BHAISHRI 	KAKA,   LETTER TO D. B. KALELKAR       THE ASHRAM,  July 	2, 1926 
  	Both your letters to hand. Much of what you write is due, I see, to 	your misunderstanding. I am not backing out at all. Only I would not 	be on the committee which I do regard as right. All the rules are 	framed by the committee. Even in the matter of selecting a name, do 	not accept my suggestion only. I do not think there are more men on 	the committee than are needed. Nowadays Mamalibtech_474_footnoteand Naraharilibtech_475_footnotedo not come here at all. There is at present such an 	understanding with Vinoba that every three months he should come and 	stay here for quite some time. I have asked for a copy of the rules 	being sent to Mama, Narahari and Appalibtech_476_footnote.  	As the principles were laid down at the time of the founding of the 	Ashramlibtech_477_footnotethey 	are not mentioned in these rules. Panditjilibtech_478_footnoteand Chhaganlal Joshilibtech_479_footnotecan both be on the committee. They do not wish to be 	there I rather liked their plea. They are neither particularly 	enthusiastic nor indifferent about the committee. I regard  the 	committee as absolutely necessary. It is indeed my aim not to tie 	down the committee here and now with too many rules.  	I believe we cannot yet interest ourselves in the affairs of the 	families. One who has lived in the Ashram for five years and  	studiously endeavours to observe its rules can become a member of 	the managing committee. The committee of course has overall control 	of all the departments.  	If your interpretation of the rules is correct they will have to be 	amended.  	I have conceived of the school as an autonomous body within the 	Ashram itself. The managing committee is not intended to acquire 	some prerogatives for its members. Living in the Ashram and leading         
 a similar life [elsewhere] I regard as one and the same.
 I did know your opinion on the question of prayer, but I did not send you my comments. All the aspects had been discussed here, so I presumed you must have inferred my opinion from it. There was an open discussion and I had discussed the matter specially  with Mahadev. Had I found a difference of principle in the opinion you held, I would have joined issue with you.
 From my standpoint, I do not agree that there is any divergence between us in regard to the ideals of the Ashram school. The reason why you think there is, is that you do not fully understand that I am an anekantavadinlibtech_480_footnote. I am quite convinced that we are at present in no position to take pupils from outside; besides we are trying new experiments every day. It is certainly desirable to make experiments, but we cannot involve outsiders even if we try to. Fortunately they are not so simple-minded as to get themselves readily involved. People all over the world act in accordance with current traditions and that is only right. We are either too advanced or too backward for many to keep us company. I believe, nowhere else in India is the educational field so wide as ours, because we deal with children and also with their parents. We may not perhaps be in a position to cope with that field, but what I say is true. What does it matter if people from outside compare our school with Ambalalbhai’s? Should we not be guided by our own conscience? Certainly we have no wish to boycott anyone. Tulsidas, the Antyaja, would have a place right here.
 The object in having you on the committee is clear enough, viz., that all may feel the need to consult you while you are at the Ashram. Let us assume that perhaps Maganlal may not feel that way. Is that any reason why you should hesitate? If my idea of the committee is correct, Mahadev, Kishorelal and Maganlal cannot by  themselves  carry the burden.
 The ideal before the school would be to discover through experiments what national education is and for the  teachers  to consider themselves as pupils because they are seekers, too, groping for their ideal. I place you and myself in the same category. The idea you have in regard to khadi is equally true in regard to education.
 What you have  yet  to  do  is  this.  Return  the  rules  after adding to or deleting from them. There may possibly be an error in
 
 incorporating into the rules that part of your criticism which all accept. Therefore I want you to translate your own criticism into the rules, so that it will be easy for everyone to understand it. Else we would all be trying to interpret them in our own way.
 You write nothing about your health. Let me know about the weather there. Shanker has written many letters to you. Now what about his complaint that you have not replied to them?

  	I have your letter.libtech_483_footnoteJamnalalji  is  now  here.  I  have  discussed the 	thing with him. His opinion is that your institution is good so far 	as it goes. It is an ordinary type of boarding house looking after 	about 25 boys belonging to the depressed classes. The funds which 	friends place at my disposal for this work are limited. Several 	institutions, some better carrying out the purpose I and those who 	are associated with me have in view, are being supported. To pay you 	Rs. 10,000/- would be to pay practically the whole of the expense of 	the building. When you embarked upon the scheme, you had not any 	help through me in view. It seems to me that you  should  exert 	yourself to approach others who are also interested in such work and 	enlist their support. It is not right for me to burden the trust at 	my disposal with a single heavy item. It seems to me that Rs. 	5,000/- can be more usefully employed for the same cause by 	distributing the same amongst several equally needy and equally 	efficient institutions. I have shownthis letter to Jamnalalji who is 	as much interested in the welfare of the depressed classes as I am 	and who helps me in raising funds for such purpose.libtech_484_footnote  Yours 	sincerely,  SJT.

  	Your letter to hand. Also received your telegram. You must have got 	my telegram informing you that Harihar Sharma was going back and 	that you might fix any date after August 16. I  can  well  	understand the reason for your not coming at this time.  	I send you a copy of the scheme which Pandit Harihar Sharma has 	drawn up in consultation with the local workers. Please study it and 	place it before the committee if necessary, and  obtain  their 	opinion also on this.  From 	a microfilm of the Hindi: S.N. 19650     KHADI WORK IN GARIADHAR   	Shri Shambhushanker has been working in Gariadhar on behalf of the 	Conferencelibtech_485_footnote. 	His record of work is noteworthy. He persuaded 1,l00 families in 41 	villages around Gariadhar to stock cotton and helped them with all 	facilities up to the stage of weaving. Approximately 3,000 maunds of 	cotton has been stocked, out  of which 800 maunds was ginned on 	hand-wheels. There is a cess on carding in this region, but those 	who carded this cotton for being turned into slivers were exempted 	from this cess. Out of all these families, only 112 families availed 	themselves of the assistance offered by the conference in terms of 	its resolutions on the subject, namely, one-half the expenditure 	incurred oncarding and weaving. Till now, only Rs. 164 have been 	spent on this account. As near-famine conditions prevailed in this 	area, cheap slivers were also supplied. About 8 maunds of slivers 	were sold to nearly 50 families, at the rate of 6 annas a pound, and 	most of this was used for making women’s garments. It is estimated 	that no more than Rs. 50 would have to be set aside for this 	purpose. In addition to this, because of the famine conditions, 	cotton was also purchased from the market and got spun    
 into yarn on payment, with a view to having it woven into cloth. So far, 295 maunds of cotton have been ginned, and made into slivers in the Centre itself. The quantity is in the process of being spun and woven into cloth. The cost of ginning came to Rs. 110. The cotton-pods yielded 93_ maunds of cottonwool and 190 maunds of cotton-seeds. The yarn being spun is of 4 to 8 counts. The rate of payment for spinning is five pies per count. The rate for carding and making slivers is Rs. 2-12-0 per pound, and for weaving it is Rs. 8. The khadi woven is of 24 inches to 27 inches width, and one maund of khadi measures between 110 and 115 yards in length. Shri Shambhushanker tries to get all the khadi produced sold locally. He has so far sold 962 yards of khadi at the rate of 17 annas for 3_ yards, which comes nearly to 5 annas a yard. A maund of yarn is woven into cloth every day. Moreover khadi is woven in this area for the Amreli Khadi Centre too. This khadi measures 30 inches in width. The work in this centre is being done efficiently and economically, and the chief reason for this seems to be that Shri Shambhushankerbhai mixes with and maintains close contacts with each spinner, carder and weaver. My object in publishing the figures which I receive from the various centres is that they may learn and derive inspiration from one another. Healthy and pleasant competition amongst the various centres should be welcome. The field of work is so large that it offers scope for sacrifice for thousands of voluntary workers and can help thousands of others to make a living. Those, moreover, who become interested in this work and realize that village life can have the beauty of poetry can derive the utmost happiness from it.

  RESTRICTIONS ON WOMEN IN MENSES 
A widow writes as follows:
 I am told that a woman in menses should not touch books, paper, pencil, slate and such other things connected with learning. Do you also believe in this?
Such a  question can be asked only in a  wretched country  like
 India which is disgraced by foolish notions about touching and not touching things. Some of the rules forbidding such a woman to touch  a particular thing can be justified on grounds of health and morality. During that period, the woman is  unfit to  do  hard work. It  is very
 necessary that she should remain undisturbed by  sex  desire.  A married woman should altogether avoid the company of her husband, and rest is very necessary for her, but it is not only not improper for her to read good books or to study but, on the contrary, I believe that it is desirable and necessary that she should do so. We can think of a number of household chores which such a woman can  do  with comfort and with little exertion.

  GUJARAT KHADI PRACHARAK MANDAL 
 According to the accounts for  the  second  Chaitralibtech_486_footnotereceived from the Gujarat Khadi Mandal, 3,854 square yards of khadi was woven in fifteen different centres out of yarn spun personally by people who got it woven. One of the centres wove 410 square yards of khadi from ready yarn and 3,348 sq. yards of khadi for sale was woven in ten centres. A subsidy of Rs. 1,433 at the rate of _ an anna a vishilibtech_487_footnoteper yard was given to fifteen centres. Khadi worth Rs. 7,580 was sold through eleven stores. The total number of workers  in  the various centres was 41. Besides, there were 15 carders, 117 weavers, 172 persons spinning for themselves and 683 spinning for wages. The figures of work for a period of eleven months are as follows: Khadi woven out of yarn spun by the persons who had it woven, 35,033 sq. yards; khadi made from ready-made yarn, 7,756 sq. yards; khadi for sale, both spinning and weaving done through the centres, 20,595 sq. yards; a subsidy of Rs. 10,584 at the rate of half an anna; the sale of khadi through the various stores, Rs. 80,063. These figures do not include those relating to centres in Kathiawar. During the second Chaitra, the Mandal sold 19 spinning-wheels, 50 taklislibtech_488_footnote, 32 spindles, 105 Ib. of slivers, 40 lb. of yarn, 60 bows for carding, 29 charkhas and 56 ateranslibtech_489_footnote. In the figures above, annas and fractions have been left out. These statistic may seem ludicrous in the context of our aim of bringing about boycott of foreign cloth, but, as a
 
 
 measure of the progress of khadi itself, of the help given to the poor and from the standpoint of middle-class men and women who wish to earn their living through voluntary service, they are not ludicrous but heartening. As our capacity for work improves and workers acquire self-confidence, khadi will make even faster progress. Anyone who takes the trouble to think cannot but see that, if there is any work which can become universal in the country, it is that connected with the production of khadi.

  	Your letters to hand. I expect there would be no hitch in arranging 	your marriage when you come here. Certainly nothing can be finalized 	before your arrival. If you must marry, you must restrain your 	extravagance. Everyone coming from there complains of this.  	I find your explanation inadequate. But you will always be what you 	are. I do not want to control you. I shall be content with whatever    
 you let me know.
 The books you ordered have been dispatched. Please remit their cost immediately. The Ashram can grant no credit, because it has no private sources of income. I hope this is quite clear.
 I learn now for the first time that Shanti does not satisfy you. I am glad however to learn that Dahyo does.
 Please send me the old book of newspaper cuttings maintained by me. There are also a number of books which are of no use there; you had better send them here or bring them with you.
Devdas is quite well. He is enjoying the climate of Mussoorie.
Ramdas is in Amreli.
What is one to write about Harilallibtech_492_footnote? Ramilibtech_493_footnoteis in the Ashram.
 You do not seem to have made use of the many articles which Mahadevbhai sent you. Of course, that does not matter. An editor ought to have the right to decide what he will accept and what he will not. But should he not write even a letter of thanks or an acknowledgment?
 When you come, be armed with a notice to me: ‘Marry me off in fifteen days’ time; I must take the next steamer.’

You know that he had an operation for appendicitis. He is quite all right now. You must be thoroughly restored before you return.
 Mr. Bahadurji’s yarn that you sent me for testing was not bad at all. His test gave nearly 50 per cent. 60 per cent is really required for weaving purposes. We are at present concentrating upon increasing the strength of the yarn instead of the speed and the same has reached up to 90 per cent. Probably, at the end of the month someone may reach 100 per cent.

 APPENDICES
 APPENDIX I
 VITHALBHAI PATEL’S LETTER TO GANDHIJI
 
 
 
DEAR MAHATMAJI,
 
 
 
 
BOMBAY ,
 May 10, 1926
 
  When 	I accepted the office of President of the Legislative Assembly I had 	made   a resolution 	within myself that I 	would devote the 	savings from my 	salary towards the 	furtherance of 	some object calculated 	to promote 	the national 	welfare. It was 	not possible 	for me 	for various 	reasons to save 	anything worth the 	name within the 	first six 	months. Since the 	last month, however, I 	am glad to 	say that I 	am quite out 	of the woods, 	and can, and do, save a substantial amount. I find that, on an 	average, I require Rs. 	2,000 per 	month for 	my expenses. 	The amount 	of my net 	salary, excluding 	income-tax, is 	Rs. 3,625. 	I propose, 	therefore, to 	set apart 	Rs. 1,625 	per month, 	beginning from 	the last month, to 	be utilized hereafter in 	such manner 	and for such 	purpose as 	you may approve. I 	have, of 	course, some ideas in 	the matter, and 	I will in 	due course discuss them 	with you. But whether you 	agree with 	me in those 	ideas or not, 	the amount 	is at your disposal.  I 	enclose herewith a 	cheque for 	Rs. 1,625 for 	the month of 	April. I trust you will not decline to take this responsibility.  I 	am,  Yours 	sincerely,  V. J. PATEL  Vithalbhai 	Patel—Life and Times—II. 	P. 669    APPENDIX II   THE 			SABARMATI PACT1    The 	conference convened at the instance of Pandit Motilal Nehru was held 	at Sabarmati Ashram, Ahmedabad, on the 20th and 21st. . . Telegrams 	and letters were received. . . including one from Pandit Madan Mohan 	Malaviya which contained suggestions about bringing all Indian 	political parties on a common platform in a united Congress.  The 	conference adopted the following agreement, as embodying its 	decision on points specifically discussed :    
 It is hereby agreed between the undersigned, subject to the confirmation of the All-India Congress Committee, that the response made by the Government shall for purposes of Clauses (a) and (b) of the resolution II-B (4) of the All-India Congress Committee, dated March 6 and 7, 1926, be considered satisfactory in the provinces, if the power, responsibility and initiative necessary for the effective discharge of their duties are secured to ministers and the sufficiency of such power, responsibility and initiative, in each province, shall be decided in the first instance by Congress members of the Legislative Council of the Province, subject to confirmation by a Committee consisting of Pandit Motilal Nehru and Mr. M. R. Jayakar.
 It is further agreed that the said Committee will decide all disputes in the Congress provinces of the Bombay Maharashtra, Bihar and the C.P. Marathi. This agreement has been subscribed to by the undersigned in their individual capacities, and it will be submitted for ratification to the executive of the Swaraj and Responsive Co-operation Parties. It will be placed for ratification before the All-India Congress Committee at a meeting which is being convened on May 5 and 6 next, at Sabarmati.
 The compormise is signed by Sarojini Naidu, Motilal Nehru, Lajpat Rai, M. R. Jayakar, N. C. Kelkar, B. S. Moonje, M. S. Aney, D. V. Gokhale, G. A. Ogale at Sabarmati, April 21, 1926.
  A. 		I. C. C.’S DELHI RESOLUTION  
 The Clauses of Resolution II-B(4) of the A.I.C.C. meeting at Delhi referred to in the agreement state that Congressmen shall
  refuse 	to accept 	offices in the 	gift of 	the Government 	until, in 	the opinion of the Congress, a satisfactory response is made by the Government;  refuse 	supplies and throw 	out budgets 	until such response is 	made by 	the Government, except 	when the Working 	Committee instructs otherwise. 
  RESPONSIVISTS’ 		AKOLA MANIFESTO  
 The Responsive Co-operationist Party manifesto, issued at the Akola Conference in February last, declared regarding their Council programme :
 We believe that no programme of bringing about constitutional dead-lock by resorting to the policy of uniform, continuous and consistent obstruction can be successful unless tried on a large scale, and backed by some sanctions behind the same.
 We  believe  that  the  best  course  under  the  present  circumstances  is   that  of Responsive Co-operation, which means working the Reforms, unsatisfactory, disappointing  and  inadequate  as  they are,  for  all   they   are  worth;   and  using   the  same  for  accelerating  the  grant of  full   responsible   Government   and   also for creating, in the meanwhile, opportunities for the people for advancing their interests and strenghtening their power and resistance to injustice and misrule.
 The policy of working the Reforms necessarily includes the capture of all places of power, responsibility and initative which are open to election by, or are otherwise responsible to, the party within the legislature, subject to such conditions with regard to policy, programme and kindred matters as may seem desirable to impose from time to time.1
  THE 		  BREAKDOWN   OF   THE PACT  
 At the meeting of the All-India Congress Committee at Ahmedabad on the 4th May, Pandit Motilal announced that, owing to irreconcilable differences between the signatories of the Sabarmati Pact regarding the interpretation of its terms, the negotiations that he had been for the past few days carrying on with the Responsivists had broken down, and the Pact had, therefore, fallen through and was non-existent. A letter from the Responsivists was read by the Secretary confirming  in the main Pandit Motilal’s statement.
  MOTILAL’S 		SUBSTITUTE FORMULA  
 The following is the text of the substitute formula which was handed to the Responsivists leaders on the 4th morning :
 Having regard to the fact that doubts and differences have arisen as to the true interpretation of the agreement arrived at between Mrs. Sarojini Naidu, Messrs Lajpat Rai, M. S. Aney, M. R. Jayakar, N. C. Kelkar, G. A. Ogale and Pandit Motilal Nehru  at Sabarmati on the 21st April, 1926, this meeting of the All-India Congress Committee, while fully agreeing with the principles, policy and programme laid down in resolution 7 of the Cawnpore Congress and resolution 2(b) of the All-India Congress Committee passed at Delhi on 6th and 7th March, 1926, and fully believing that dyarchy in any form or shape is wholly unworkable in the best of conditions, is of opinion that with a view to remove all doubts and differences and to put the true issue before the country, it is expedient to state clearly what shall constitute the statisfactory response referred to in the said resolution.
 It is, therefore, hereby resolved :
 That the acceptance by the Government of the principle underlying the resolution passed by the Assembly on the 8th February, 1925, shall constitute a satisfactory response by the Government to the national demand for full responsible Government, and the immediate adoption by the Government of the various steps mentioned in the resolution of the Assembly passed on the 8th September, 1925, shall for the present be taken to be a sufficient compliance with the said principle.
  That 	if Responsible 	Government in the fullest 	sense is guaranteed 	by the 	Government to come automatically in the near future by the adoption of steps other 
 
 
 than those mentioned in the resolution of the Assembly passed on the 8th September, 1925, and if, in the meantime, substantially full Responsible Government in the provinces is granted, the response so made by the Government shall be considered sufficient in the provinces for the purpose of accepting  ministerships  and  considering the provincial budgets on their merits, provided that no such response shall be considered adequate unless it includes :
  The 	release or 	trial according to 	law of 	all political 	prisoners who are at 	present datained without 	being convicted by a duly 	constituted court. The 	repeal of all repressive laws.  The 	removal of 	all disqualifications 	now imposed 	on persons 	who have 	served the 	sentences passed on 	them, from 	standing for 	election to 	elected bodies in 	the country.  The 	abolition of 	non-official nominations 	to membership 	of Council 	and throwing 	open the 	seats of 	nominated non-official 	members to election 	by the 	general electorate. 
  That 	the adequacy 	of any action 	by the Government 	in any province 	as is 	referred to 	in resolution 2 	shall on 	the recommendation 	of the 	Congress members of 	the Legislative Council of that province be decided by the Working Committee. 
  RESPONSIVISTS’ DISAPPROVAL  
 In their reply, Mr. Jayakar and his colleagues pointed out :
 We have carefully considered the draft which we regarded as a travesty of the Pact and a complete repudiation of the same. We think that the draft furnishes no common ground on which we could profitably meet and discuss. Under the circumstances, we are of opinion that no useful purpose will be served by our attending the Working Committee’s meeting this morning, and we have, therefore, decided not to attend the same. We feel that we need not have been dragged all the way to Ahmedabad from our distant homes to be made sport of in the manner the draft proposes to do.
