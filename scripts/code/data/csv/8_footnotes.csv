They could be refused licences, placed in prison (about 9,500 of them) which would not be very effectual, or put over the border. The Indians had been misled by their leaders and the Government had arrested these. If they came forward not as individuals but as a whole to be registered then the opportunity would be given them.

The sufferings of the prisoners have been acute. In one little yard in the Johannesburg Prison, the capacity of which is 45, over 150 men had  to pass their days during this trying weather. Two of the Indians dropped down in the ranks, fainting on account of the heat. The Asiatics complain bitterly that the room at the Johannesburg Prison, in which they were taken to have their clothing changed on entering the prison, had its roof and sides so full of vermin that it was impossible  to keep their clothes or hair free from the pest—a state of things due to the age and rottenness of the wood....” This news-item appeared in The Transvaal Leader, 31-1-1908 and this interview therefore took place on February 1, 1908."

On cross-examination of the Licensing Officer by Colonel Greene, it transpired that (a) he had renewed the appellant's licence the previous year although the books had been kept in an identical manner and (b) he had not given any notice to the applicant that they were to be kept any differently in the future. The alleged errors in accounting, it was also discovered, were those of G.R. Beattie, a European accountant employed by the appellant. Appearing as a witness, Beattie, the Accountant, testified that Hellet, a European shopkeeper, also employed him as book-keeper and that he kept books for him in much the same manner. By a majority of five to one the Board, however, decided that after a notice period of six months Patel was to liquidate his business."

According to reports in Indian Opinion of that time, the conditions of work were trying. There was no fresh water and only small quantities of foul and oily water were available for drinking. They were given white rice and bad dhal, with the result that about half the number of labourers died within three months of their arrival. After about 11 months they started leaving the place in batches—500 arriving in Natal in March, and 429 in April, 1908. The latter were put in quarantine at Bluff before being sent back to India and their condition was miserable indeed. Dawad Mahomed of the Natal Indian Congress visited them at the Bluff Quarantine Camp and in April, the Congress telegraphed the Colonial Secretary at Maritzburg to inquire what arrangements had been made for them in India. Congress officials attempted to see them again but permission was refused. Vide also “Indians Going to Lobito Bay”, 30-3-1907 and “Lobito Bay”, 20-7-1907"

A deputation to the Administrator at Salisbury failed to secure relief.

In his judgment the Chief justice ruled that Mr. Carter had no such interest that disqualified him from sitting on the Board. As for Mr. Whittaker, who was only an employee in a store and who had appealed before the Board against the renewal of Kazi’s licence at the Board hearing, the Chief Justice observed that his interest was not sufficient to justify his opposing the grant of a licence.

The Colonial Secretary was willing to meet the Indian community and repeal Act 2 of 1907 and to treat Indians in future coming into the Transvaal as prohibited Indians under the Immigrants’Restriction Act if the leaders of the Asiatic community would agree to the amendment of the Act which the Colonial Secretary proposed. These proposed amendments were submitted to Mr. Gandhi, and they did not at all satisfy him for various reasons, which he advanced, and therefore he was informed that nothing remained to be done but to abide by the agreed terms of the compromise, as the Colonial Secretary was unwilling to repeal Act 2 of 1907 and then to find an agitation started afresh against the Immigrants’Act.

libtech_534_footnote,"1In effect, the points made by Gandhiji in his letter to Smuts of June 13 were not acceded to. Addressing the mass meeting of June 24, Essop Mia, Chairman, made the following points: (a) the evidence about the claims to domicile in the Transvaal should be taken from voluntary registrants in a public and judicial manner, so that the reasons for any official decision could not be kept secret; and (b) they would not sell the rights of would-be educated Indian immigrants in return for some questionable advantages given to Indians already in the Colony."

libtech_542_footnote,"1The Chairman again: “We went to prison to buy liberty of conscience and freedom from molestation and restraint, and we did not come out of the prison gates in order to submit to a law, or a revised edition of it, which was calculated to take away those priceless possessions. We want to no bandying of legal phrases and subtleties of lawyers. We, as common-sense men, want our honour to be respected, and it is for that this great meeting has come to plead.”"
