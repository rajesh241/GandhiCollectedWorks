libtech_96_footnote,"1The letter is not translated here. The correspondent had argued that the activities for promoting the welfare of Harijans would do more harm than good to the Harijans, since the temples were not the dwelling places of God but breeding grounds for vice. The sanatanist Hindus, while ill-treating the Harijans, had done one good thing indirectly by keeping the Harijans out of these temples. Gandhiji, therefore, was ill-advised in seeking the help of law to win temple-entry for Harijans."
libtech_97_footnote,2This was written to a worker bewildered by difficulties.
libtech_98_footnote,"1Not translated here. The question was how Gandhiji could say that he wanted, not abolition, but only reform of the varna system, even though he wanted feelings of high and low among the castes to go and approved of inter-varna marriages.
