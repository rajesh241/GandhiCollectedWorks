2,"February 	23, 1938",STATEMENT TO THE PRESS libtech_2_footnote,"
       February 	23, 1938  	I have read the Governor-General’s statementlibtech_3_footnotelibtech_4_footnotewith 	the respect and attention it deserves. I had hoped that it would 	give some satis- faction, as was given at least to me and, if I may 	say so, a large number of Congressmen when he made a pronouncement 	upon the Congress demand for certain assurances as a condition 	precedent to the accep- tance of ministerial responsibility by 	Congress members of the pro- vincial Legislatures. It reads like a 	special pleading unworthy of a personage possessing unheard-of 	powers.  	No one has questioned the propriety of examining the cases of 	prisoners to be discharged; but what I have questioned, and the Con- 	gress most emphatically questions, is the propriety of such exami- 	nation by provincial Governors in provinces said to be enjoying com- 	plete provincial autonomy. That duty and the right of examination 	belong solely to responsible Ministers as I understand the 	Government of India Act and the convention in responsibly governed 	Colonies. The Governors’ duty and right are to advise their 	Ministers on the question of broad policy and warn them of danger in 	their exercise of certain powers, but having done so to leave their 	Ministers free to exercise their unfettered judgment. If such were 	not the case, the responsibility would become a perfectly 	meaningless term, and the Ministers responsible to their electors 	would have as their share      
 nothing but odium and disgrace, if their responsibility had to  be shared with Governors in the daily administration of affairs by law entrusted to them. It is hardly graceful for His Excellency to quote against the poor Ministers their non-exercise of their undoubted powers to prevent Governors from examining individual cases. The Congress   Resolutionlibtech_5_footnotelibtech_6_footnotedescribes   their   forbearance   as   exemplary patience. I would venture to add that probably it was also the inexperi- ence of the Ministers who were totally new to their task. I am afraid, therefore, that unless this crucial question is decided in favour of the Ministers, it will be difficult for them to shoulder the grave responsi- bility that the Congress has permitted them to take over.
 I am glad that His Excellency has drawn public attention to the method I adopted in Bengal. He might have noted also the difference between Bengal on the one hand and the U.P. and Bihar on the other. In Bengal I was dealing with a Government which was not bound by the Congress manifesto in any shape or form. The Ministers there rightly or wrongly would not listen to a wholesale discharge of convi- cted prisoners. I was treading upon very delicate ground in pursuance of my promise to the prisoners. My motive was purely humanitarian, and the only weapon that I had at my disposal was an appeal to the human in the Bengal Ministers. And I am glad to be able to testify that I was not speaking to hearts of stone. The situation in the U. P. and Bihar is totally different. The Ministers there are bound by the manifesto which gave them victory at the polls. They had not only examined the cases of all prisoners whose release they were seeking but, being fully aware of their responsibility for the due preservation of peace in their provinces, had personally secured assurances from the prisoners in question that they no longer believed in the cult of violence.
 One thing in His Excellency’s statement gives me hope that the impending crisis might be prevented. He has still left the door open for negotiations between the Governors and the Ministers. I recognize that the notices were sudden, because in the nature of things they had to be so.libtech_7_footnoteAll the parties have now had ample time for considering the
 
 situation.
 In my opinion the crisis can be avoided if the Governors are left free to give an assurance that their examination of cases was not intended to be usurpation of the powers of the Ministers, and that since they had armed themselves with assurances from prisoners they were free to release them on their own responsibility. And I hope that the Working Committee will leave the Ministers free, if they are sum- moned by the Governors; to judge for themselves whether they are satisfied by the assurances they may receive.
 One thing I must say in connection with the exercise by His Excellency of his powers under Section 126 (5) in the light of his argument justifying the use of sub-section 5 of Section 126. I have read the whole of it. It is entitled “Control of the Federation over Provinces in Certain Cases”. Unless the sub-sections have no conne- ction with one another and they are to be read independently of one another, my reading is that in the present case the exercise of powers under sub-section 5 of Section 126 is a manifest misapplication. But here I am treading on dangerous ground. Let lawyers decide the point. My purpose in making this long statement is to assist a peaceful solution of the crisis that has suddenly appeared.

 WARDHA, SEGAON,
 February 24, 1938
 DEAR DR. HARDIKAR,
 I retain the same view that I held in 1920 as to volunteers. You know  that  at   Ahmedabad   the   Congress   had   passed   a   resolutionlibtech_9_footnoteembodying a pledge for volunteers and certain instructions to be followed by them. Experience has proved for me the correctness of the position I then took. It is true that there has not been the response that I wanted. The causes of the inadequacy of response I need not go into at the present moment. Our volunteers for me are, and should be, our non-violent army, irresistible and invincible. Therefore I would expect every adult person to undergo a practical volunteer training for at least three months. I would expect them to give at least one month every year to practical service. Now that in seven provinces the Congress runs the Government the thing should be easy. The first thing, therefore, is to prepare a textbook, giving in minute detail the course of instructions to be imparted to candidate volunteers and then begin the work of instruction not in cities but in villages. I would concentrate all effort on villiages. Whilst I note the marvellous mass awakening that has taken place, I am painfully conscious of the fact that a far greater and a far more solid awakening has to take place before we can confidently say that swaraj is ours for the asking. Any extraneous event may put power into our hands. I would not call that swaraj of the people.
 If what I have said appeals to your head and to your heart, you should show this letter to Jawaharlal and if he approves, and only if he approves, you should take the next step. I say this with deliberation. I do not want to take a new step in life of a political nature unless I can secure his approval and co-operation. Secondly, there is not that meeting of our hearts which is necessary for me to give guidance. You
 
 know the reason why. I know that there is no such barrier between you and Jawaharlal. Therefore even though I may say something which appeals to your head and heart, in my opinion I should have Jawaharlal’s hearty endorsement before you take any step on the strength of what I say.
I hope you are now keeping perfect health.
 Yours sincerely,
 M. K. GANDHI

  	I thank you for your letter. I have read your letter to Jawaharlal 	also. I observe that both the letters invite, not written replies 	but a personal discussion. I do not know whether it will take place 	in the first instance between you and Jawaharlal or, now that Subhas 	Bose succeeds him, between you and the latter. If you desire that 	before this there should be a talk between you and me, I would be 	delighted to see you in Segaon any time which is convenient to you 	before the 10th of March after which, if health permits, I might 	have to go to Bengal. So far as I am concerned, just as on the 	Hindu- Muslim question I was guided by Dr. Ansari, now that he is no 	more in our midst, I have accepted Maulana Abul Kalam Azad as my 	guide. My suggestion, therefore, to you is that conversation should 	be opened in the first instance as between you and Maulana Saheb.

9,"March 4, 1938","INTERVIEW TO REPRESENTATIVES OF SCINDIA STEAM
	NAVIGATION COMPANYlibtech_14_footnote","
  
 [March 4, 1938]libtech_15_footnote
 Three representatives of the Scindia Steam Navigation Company had an interview with Gandhiji at Segaon.	They seemed to be worried by the following
among a number of things:
 The 	discrimination clauses.libtech_16_footnoteThey cited from 	Gandhiji’s article in 
 Young India entitled “The Giant and the Dwarf”libtech_17_footnotethe following statements:
 “To talk of no discrimination between Indian interests and English or European is to perpetuate Indian helotage. What is equality of rights between a giant and a dwarf? ” And again: “In almost every walk of life the Englishman by reason
 of his belonging to the ruling class occupies  a  privileged position.	The cottage
 industries of India had to perish in order that Lancashire might flourish. The Indian shipping had to perish, so that British shipping might flourish.”
 Is the shipping not to revive and rise to its full height in a free India?
  What 	are Indian or swadeshi companies? It has become a fashion nowadays  	to bamboozle 	the unwary 	public by adding 	“(India) Limited” to 	full-blooded British 	concerns. Lever Brothers 	“(India) Limited” have their factories here now. They claim 	to produce swadeshi soap, 	and have 	already ruined 	several large 	and small soap 	factories in 	Bengal. Then 	there is 	the Imperial 	Chemicals (India) 	Ltd. which 	has received 	valuable concessions. This is 	dumping foreign 	industries instead 	of foreign 
 
 Discrimination”.
 goods on us!
  Then 	there are 	companies with 	Indian Directorate with 	British Managing 	Agents who 	direct the 	Directorate. Would you 	call a 	company with a 	large percentage 	of Indian 	capital and a 	large number of 	Indian Directors 	on the 	Board, but 	with a 	non-Indian Managing 	Director or non-lndian 	firm as 	Managing Agents, a 	swadeshi concern? 
 Gandhiji dealt with these points fairly exhaustively in his reply which may be summarized below in his own words:
  On 	this point 	I am 	glad you have reminded 	me of my article 	written in 1931. 	I still 	hold the same views, and 	have no doubt 	that a free 	India will 	have the right to 	discriminate—if that 	word must be 	used—against foreign interests, wherever Indian interests need it.  As 	regards the 	definition of 	a swadeshi company I 	would say 	that only those concerns 	can be 	regarded as 	swadeshi whose 	control, direction 	and management either 	by a 	Managing Director 	or by 	Managing Agents 	are in 	Indian hands. I 	should have no 	objection to 	the use of foreign 	capital, or to the 	employment of 	foreign talent, when 	such are not available 	in India, 	or when 	we need 	them, but 	only on 	condition that 	such capital and 	such talents 	are exclusively 	under the 	control, direction and 	management of 	Indians and 	are used in the 	interests of India. 
 But the use of foreign capital or talent is one thing, and the dumping of foreign industrial concerns is totally another thing. The concerns you have named cannot in the remotest sense of the term be called swadeshi. Rather than countenance these ventures, I  would prefer the development of the industries in question to be delayed by a few years in order to permit national capital and enterprise to grow up and build such industries in future under the actual control, direc- tion and management of Indians themselves.
  Answer 	to this 	is contained 	in my answer 	on the 	second point.

10,"March 5, 1938",TALK WITH A FRIENDlibtech_18_footnote,"
  
 [Before March 5, 1938] [GANDHIJI:] The States resolutionlibtech_19_footnoteis a call to the States people
not to go to sleep but to start work in right earnest. The Congress is
 deeply concerned about the welfare of Indian States, as the Congress resolutionlibtech_20_footnotelibtech_21_footnoteon the Federation should clearly show. We want the States people to carry on ceaseless work in the States, but not in the name of the Congress. The use of the name of the Congress may expose the Congress to insult. If insult could result in good to the States people, I would court it. But it is far from being so. The Congress cannot in the nature of things step into each and every Indian State and protect those who agitate there. It is better able to protect them by not allow- ing them to use its name. If the States people have begun to understand and respect the Congress it is a good thing, but then let them work with the moral support of the Congress but avoid the Congress name. Whenever the Congress can effectively help the States people it would do so not by actively meddling with their affairs but by acting as an intermediary. Co-operation from within the States is an impossible proposition, and therefore I have been deliberately advising the States people to refrain from having  Congress  Committees within the States. Some say: ‘We would end the States.’ Now this cry does neither these friends nor the Indian States any harm. But it would harm them if they were actively interesting them- selves in States affairs and trying to work there in the Congress name. The prestige of the Congress would suffer and not gain by the use of the Congress name. Mysore is a case in point. It had a bona fide Congress organization but it could not prevent the Congress flag from being insulted.
 “But,” said the friend from the States, “all these things have happened in British India?”
 
 They have, and the Congress has always stood up to the insult. That is because in British India we can adopt civil disobedience for any good cause, but in the States it is impossible. The Congress Committees will have always to be at the mercy of the States and would be in no better case than, for instance, a Committee in Afgha- nistan, which would entirely exist on the mercy of the Government of Afghanistan. But of course this is my personal view and interpretation.
 When I came to India, I had an offer from three Indian States to settle and carry on my work from there. I had to decline the offer.
 But we do not ask for active help from the Congress. We want to organize under the aegis of the Congress. The onus of helping us would be upon the Congress, but we do not ask for the help.
 There it is, whether you ask for it or not, the onus would be upon the Congress, and it is not able to discharge it. Without being able to render any active support, the aegis of the Congress would be a superfluous affair. A big organization like the Congress cannot allow itself to be stultified. This is all as plain as a pikestaff to me. I do not know how the States people fail to understand this. The best help that the Congress can render today is to destroy the delusion that it can actively help the Indian States. That will automatically mean that the States people must learn to rely on themselves for all internal reforms.
 I understand this very well. But look at the resolution as finally passed. The new rider that has been added is absurd. We are allowed to have Committees in States but they will be allowed to do nothing. The position is anomalous.
 It is, I am afraid. It was a concession to the States people, but a useless concession in terms of my interpretation.
 Then, what shall be our position? Shall we stop enrolling Congress members and begin to organize a separate national organization which will join the Congress under the present restrictions?
 The real job is to build up your own organization. But you may continue to be members of the Congress, attend it and keep in touch with it. But your real work will lie in the States. The resolution is permissive. You need not set up a Congress Committee in the States. But my advice is of no value. You must seek authoritative instructions from the Working Committee

       March 6, [1938]libtech_23_footnote  SUBHAS BOSE: 	Bapu, may I 	ask you a 	question? What is 	the future 	programme of 	the Board?libtech_24_footnote  	[GANDHIJI:] The most 	immediate piece of work  before  the Board is the preparation of 	textbooks for teachers.  	Next, the Board must approach the different Congress ministers and 	chalk out the plan of work for each province, with due consi- 	deration for the present limitations and capacity of work.  	Thirdly, the Board must itself conduct an experimental centre to 	test the syllabus it has drawn up, and must revise its own recommen- 	dations at every step in the light of the experience thus gained.  	Fourthly, the Board must organize and conduct as many train- ing 	schools as possible. Every training school serves a double pur- 	pose. It may not only train future teachers, but every training 	school also means a demonstration school of basic education.  SUBHAS BOSE: 	What about the expenses of the Board?  	[G.] We shall have to beg 	for it. I do not think it right to expect any financial 	contributions from the Congress governments, because that would 	provide an opportunity for the criticisms of the opposition party.  SUBHAS BOSE: 	Bapu, this is as regards the problem of rural basic education. What 	is your suggestion as regards the problem of basic education in 	urban areas?        
 Some municipalities, e. g., the municipalities of Calcutta and Bombay, are doing some work in this direction and would like to extend their work in progressive primary education. What is your suggestion as regards the problem of primary education in cities?
 [G.] According to my educational philosophy, there is no fundamental difference between the basic education in a rural and an urban area. The aim in both is the same—the development of the intelligence through a vocation. The system of training that is evolved for rural areas will also be applicable to urban areas.
 I know from personal experience that the products of primary education in urban areas are good-for-nothing, but, for the present, I do not wish to divide the energies of the Board. If it succeeds in solving the problem of rural education, the other problem will also be solved. If ten years of work are devoted to rural education, you may consider that the whole problem of primary education whether rural or urban has been grappled with.
 Subhas Bose next asked whether a representative of a city municipality with some experience of municipal education could not be a member of the Board, so that he could attempt, if he liked, to adapt the findings of the A. I. E. B. for the purpose of urban basic education.
[G.] Certainly. The Board will be a representative body. All the
 members of the Board are representatives of the city. Where shall I find real villagers as members?

 Two questions arising from your letter demand a reply. You ask me whether I have now seen the light. Much to my regret I have to say “no”. If I had, I would proclaim the news from the housetops. But that limitation does not debar me from taking advantage of  the slightest opportunity of finding a way out of the present difficulty.
 You expect me to be able to speak on behalf of ‘the Congress and other Hindus throughout the country’. I am afraid I cannot fulfil the test. I cannot represent either the Congress or the Hindus in the sense you mean.

19,"March 12, 1938",TALK WITH A PACIFISTlibtech_30_footnote,"
  
 [Before March 12, 1938] [GANDHIJI:] For non-violence to permeate as we should have a living faith in God. Non-violence comes to us through doing good
continually  without   the   slightest   expectation  of   return.   It simply
 spends itself and it is its own reward, and done in that spirit it is done not merely for friends but certainly for adversaries. That is the indispensable lesson in non-violence. It was thrown my way by God in South Africa in an atmosphere which was as adverse as it well could be. I was in a country where I knew no European or Indian. I had gone there to make a career as a lawyer. But I succeeded in learning the eternal law of suffering as the only remedy for undoing wrong and injustice. It means positively the law of non-violence. You have to be prepared to suffer cheerfully at the hands of all and sundry, and you will wish ill to no one, not even to those who may have wronged you.
 Just now a good many people are talking of world peace,
 
 
 promoting peace societies and passing resolutions. This is good as far as it goes. But it may not be non-violence. An army of non-violence exposes itself to all the risks that an army of violence does. Only the latter expects to retaliate even when it is not the aggressor. An army of non-violence runs risks without the wish to retaliate.
 [THE PACIFIST:] But the war spirit is creeping slowly over us. How are we to combat it?
 I know how difficult it is for you to combat it in England. You have to approach the problem with faith and determination even though you may be very few. I would recommend the study of Richard  Gregg’s   booklibtech_31_footnoteon   the   practice   of   non-violence.   A   true pacifist refuses to use the fruit of arms—peace and order. So long as we eat a single grain of wheat grown under the protection of arms we participate in violence. When one realizes this one has to be an exile in one’s own country and a rebel. But everything has to be done accor- ding to the measure of one’s strength. A few people with the courage of their convictions can become perfect nuisances to the whole State. How far it is possible to reduce the whole thing to practice is for each individual to judge.
 Our English movement for peace is growing. But shall we simply go on enrolling more and more members?
 I am not enamoured of numbers. A peace army does not rely upon numbers unless they understand the implications of non-vio- lence. I would, therefore, concentrate on a few becoming saturated with the spirit of non-violence and disciplining themselves for the utmost suffering.
 How exactly to act in particular situations is a matter of waiting on God. The answer comes straight in response to prayer from the heart. Such prayer carries with it the anguish of the soul.

  	I have practically stopped writing these days. I sometimes write a 	couple of lines to someone like you. I have since long been meaning    
 to write to you and I satisfy that desire today. As regards A. S., you have swung from one extreme to the other. This is violence. I can understand your unwillingness to keep up your relations with her. But why should it be that you cannot go to any place where she is? Why this cowardice? I do not see in her the faults that you see. She gives me no trouble. She has a number of good qualities. How can I send her away? When asked, Ramachandran told me that he could not see any defect in her. You should cultivate patience and generosity. She cannot ask me anything about you. Nor do I tell her anything. That does not mean that she doesn’t keep thinking of you. Saraswati also seems to live in fear. Trust me, be calm and give up your unnatu- ralness. Do come to Orissa.
 Prabha cannot go there. I will explain when we meet. The rest you will hear from Mahadev.

 [On or before March 15, 1938]libtech_35_footnoteGandhiji was discussing with a friend and co-worker his reactions to the Haripura Congress. He said he would make these views known as early as possible for
 the information and benefit of those who would be responsible for the session in
 Mahakoshal.
 The Congress is a striking testimony to the great organizing ability of the Sardar and his lieutenants as also his ability to command financial help from moneyed friends. But the scale cannot be, must not be, repeated. It is wrong to make lavish use of money even when it is plentiful. I am partly responsible for the use of electricity and motors and motor lorries. For Dev and Dastane’s libtech_36_footnoteimportunity had weakened me at Faizpur. Sardar’s thoroughness showed me  the glaring absurdity of the use of these things for a village Congress. They made the Congress camp look like a bit of Bombay instead of the multiplied village it should have looked and was intended to look like.
 Classes were retained at Faizpur. At Haripura the classification was intensified. There were the leaders, ministers, delegates visitors and the villagers. The division was not horizontal but vertical. The Congress is our political Mecca. The annual function is not a tamasha or a fair, but a Haj, a pilgrimage, at which all distinctions as between rich and poor, learned and illiterate, city-dweller and villager disap- pear. Why should Working Committee members have more conveni- ences than others? Why should they have food other than the villa- gers? Should a villager eat different food and be differently housed when he becomes a member of the Working Committee? Or why should a delegate who happens to be a Minister have a much multi- plied hut? It is a wholly different thing when one is ill or is used to special food. Such persons should make their own arrangements or have them made by the Reception Committee by previous appoint- ment. Indeed those who have frail bodies should abstainfrom atten- dance, unless their presence is urgently required in the interest of the
 
 Congress. Vertical division of the camps into different classes sets a pernicious example to the vast number of villagers who attend the Con-gress. The Congress management has to go out of its way to show the villagers that before it there is no prince and no pauper and that all are equal. If these artificial differences disappear next year, much expense will be saved.
 Electric lights are in no way necessary. Visitors should be ex- pected to bring their own lanterns. The Reception Committee will confine itself to the lighting that may be required for the despatch of Congress work and for the safety of the camp. Much work must not be expected to be done after dark.
 Motors and motor lorries are a nuisance, bad education for the villagers, disturbing of peace, a hindrance to the proper despatch of work, and conducive to the raising of dust. The distance of ten miles or less from a railway station must be negotiated on foot or in bullock-carts. None but pedestrian traffic should be permitted inside the camp.
 The site selected for the Congress should be a solid square block as far as possible. This will ensure a compact camp avoiding long distance between one end of the camp and the other. The layout can be round the quadrangle where the open session is to take place.
 There should be one common kitchen from where food should be served at stated prices per course, not to be eaten on the spot but to be taken to the place of residence of the diner.
 If these precautions are not observed, the whole idea of villagers’ Congress for their education and for establishing a living and national contact between the city-dweller and the villager is likely to be frustrated.

 In the course of the discussion the members of the Krishak Party are reported to have intimated to Mahatmaji their desire to see the political situation in Bengal changed and their readiness to work in co-operation with the Congress Party in the Legislature if the administration of the Province was run on purely national lines and on an economic basis.
 Mahatma Gandhi wanted it to be realized that the main object of his visit to Bengal was the release of political prisoners and he would rather not be drawn into local politics. He, however, informed them that he intended returning to Calcutta by the 1st April next from Delang where he would have to attend the annual meeting of the Gandhi Seva Sangh. He proposed to concentrate all his attention during his present trip to Calcutta on tackling the problem of the release of detenus and political prisoners. But on return from Delang he would be free to devote his time and energy to the political problems peculiar to Bengal to which his attention had already been drawn.

30,"March 22, 1938",OUR FAILURE,"
  
 [Before March 22, 1938]libtech_39_footnotelibtech_40_footnoteThe communal riots in Allahabad—the headquarters of the Congress—and  the   necessity   of  summoning   the   assistance   of the
police  and  even  the   military  show  that   the   Congress  has   not yet
 become fit to substitute the British authority. It is best to face this naked truth, however unpleasant it may be.
 The Congress claims to represent the whole of India, not merely those few who are on the Congress register. It should represent even those who are hostile to it and who will even crush it, if they could. Not until we make good that claim, shall we be in a position to
 
 displace the British Government and function as an independent nation.
 This proposition holds good whether we seek to displace British rule by violent action or non-violent.
 Most probably by the time these lines appear in print, peace would have been established in Allahabad and the other parts. That, however, will not take us further in our examination of the fitness of the Congress as an organization ready to displace British authority in its entirety.
 No Congressman will seriously doubt that the Congress is not at the present moment capable of delivering the goods if it was called upon to do so. If it was capable, it would not wait for the call. But every Congressman believes that the Congress is fast becoming such a body. The brilliant success at Haripura will be cited as the most conclusive proof of the fact.
 The riots and certain other things I can mention should make us pause and ask ourselves whether the Congress is really growing from strength to strength. I must own that I have been guilty of laying that claim. Have I been overhasty in doing so?
 It is my conviction that the phenomenal growth of the Congress is due to its ‘acceptance and enforcement, however imperfect, of the policy of non-violence. Time has arrived to consider the nature of Congress non-violence. Is it non-violence of the weak and the helpless or of the strong and the powerful? If it is the former, it will never take us to our goal and, if long practised, may even render us for ever unfit for self-government. The weak and helpless are non-violent in action because they must be. But in reality they harbour violence in their breasts and simply await opportunity for its display. It is necessary for Congressmen individually and collectively to examine the quality of their non-violence. If it does not come out of real strength, it would be best and honest for the Congress to make such a declaration and make the necessary changes in its behaviour.
 By this time, i. e., after seventeen years’ practice of non- violence, the Congress should be able to put forth a non-violent army of volunteers numbering not a few thousands but lacs who would be equal to every occasion where the police and the military are required. Thus, instead of  one  brave  Pashupatinath  Gupta  who  diedlibtech_41_footnotelibtech_42_footnotein  the
 
 attempt to secure peace, we should be able to produce hundreds.  And  a non-violent army acts unlike armed men, as well in times of peace as of disturbances. They would be constantly engaged in constructive activities that make riots impossible. Theirs will be the duty of seeking occasions for bringing warring communities together, carrying on peace propaganda, engaging in activities that would bring and keep them in touch with every single person, male and female, adult and child, in their parish or division. Such an army should be ready to cope with any emergency, and in order to still the frenzy of mobs, should risk their lives in numbers sufficient for the purpose. A few hundred, maybe a few thousand, such spotless deaths will once for all put an end to the riots. Surely a few hundred young men and women giving themselves deliberately to mob fury will be any day a cheap and braver method of dealing with such madness than the display and use of the police and the military.
 It has been suggested that when we have our independence riots and the like will not occur. This seems to me to be an empty hope, if in the course of the struggle for freedom we do not understand and use the technique of non-violent action in every conceivable circumstance. To the extent that the Congress Ministers have been obliged to make use of the police and the military, to that extent, in my opinion, we must admit our failure. That the Ministers could not have done otherwise is unfortunately only too true. I should like every Congressman, I should like the Working Committee, to ask themselves why we have failed, if they think with me that we have.

       BIRBOI,  March 25, 1938 Can my 	voice reach where you are? If it does, please raise your hands. Can  	those  standing  over   there  hear  me?   (Many  hands  are raised.) 	Good. Now please be silent for a few minutes. I do not have     
 the strength to speak to you at any great length. You know that in the whole of our country the land of Orissa is the dearest to me. As soon as I returned to India I began to hear of Orissa’s poverty and famine. We raised an amount and sent over Thakkar Bapa in the capacity of a servant of this afflicted province and organized famine relief. I also realized that if I could serve Orissa somewhat I would by so doing serve India. Thus Orissa became for me a place of pilgrimage—not because the temple of Lord Jagannath was there—for it was not open to me, as it was not open to the Harijans—but because I thought of a novel way of touring the country for the sacred mission of  the abolition of untouchability. I had heard that the so-called sanatanists were enraged at my mission of removing untouchability and would even try to frustrate it with violence. If they were really so minded, I said to myself, I should make their work easy by discarding the rail- way train and motor-car and trekking through the country. Moreover, people don’t go on a pilgrimage in cars and trains. They walk to the sacred place, with the name of God on their lips. Meditating on Him; they proceed along their way, forgetful of the fitful fever of the world, and mindful only of offering their homage to the Lord— the homage of service. At least for me it is not possible to be so engrossed in meditation while on a rail journey. And if there was trouble in Puri because of the anger of the sanatanists, we could not flee from their wrath. It does not behove a satyagrahi to run away. We must face it. I could not do all this in a car or a railway train, and so I decided to perform the rest of the Harijan pilgrimage on foot.libtech_58_footnotelibtech_59_footnoteThe temple of Lord Jagannath has the reputation of being the most famous in India, for there all human distinctions are supposed to vanish, and all sorts of people, Brahmin and pariah, brush shoulders with one another vying for the darshan of the Lord and even eat His prasad out of one another’s hands. But evidently it had outlived that reputation and the description had become a fiction, for the priests would not admit Harijans, but throw them out of the doors of the Lord of the World. I said to myself that so long as these distinctions of high and low endured before the very eyes of the Lord of the World, that Lord was not my Lord, that He was the Lord of the Brahmins and the Kshatriyas who exploited his name and kept Harijans out, but certainly not the Lord of the World. My ambition of restoring its old reputation to the temple is yet unfulfilled, and you have to help me in fulfilling it. So
 
 long as the doors of the Jagannath temple are closed to the Harijans, they are closed to me as well. Ever since my tour along with the local workers and Thakkar Bapa, my contact with the province has been very close.
 The people of Orissa have the doubtful reputation of being opium addicts, even learned men not being free from the vice, as I found ten years ago. They are also indolent and lethargic. I know you will not mind my using this language, for you know the spirit in which it is being used. You know what great love I have for you. The people of Orissa are responsible for its poverty. Orissa is the land of poverty because of its opium, indolence and bigotry. The Exhibition gives me the hope that Orissa can rid itself of all these evils and be once again a land of happiness and plenty. After a round of the Exhibition the predominant thought in my mind is that if Oriyas can throw off their indolence they can get rid of poverty. The Exhibition is bound to be a revelation to the villagers attending it of the great capacities and potentialities of the province. All those who have come here should see the Exhibition not once but several times. When it was decided to hold the Exhibition in this place, no one had any idea that the Government might offer help. The workers’ co-operation was taken for granted, for after all they are our own people. But the local Government is also ours. There is nothing surprising if they extended their co-operation. Yes, thanks certainly are due to them. The workers with the co-operation of the Government have been able to bring into being an exhibition which is well worth a close study by men and women, young and old. There are so many young people around who, if they chose to pick up a thing and make a study of it so as to learn how it was done, could earn their livelihood without great effort.
 Man differs from the beast in several ways. As the late Madhusudan Das used to say, one of the distinctions is the differing anatomy of both. Man has feet and hands with fingers that he can use intelligently and artistically. If man therefore depended wholly and solely on agriculture, he would not be using the fingers that God has specially endowed him with. We will be worthy of being called human beings if we utilize our fingers. Moreover, mere agriculture cannot support us, unless it is supplemented by the work of the hands and the fingers. We see in the Exhibition what man’s hands and fingers can produce and how they can supplement the income of the land. I would therefore ask every one of you to go to the Exhibition over and
 over again, pick up a handicraft of your choice and help in casting off the poverty of the land.
 The A. I. V. I. A. has come into being to turn every home into a workshop. You should visit the Exhibition with the aim of acquiring knowledge and, having learnt one or the other thing that serves your own purpose, serve the province at large.

Then my voice drops and when I realize the fact I raise it again. When I was physically fit, I did not have to make use of a microphone. Today also, if you cannot hear me because my voice is too low, let me say that it is not my fault but that of the microphone. I have been told that the microphone has such power that the lower the voice the greater the number of people it reaches. Hence one should speak in a low voice into a microphone. The people who operate it are also our own people. They do this work in order to earn their livelihood. Please inform me if my voice is not audible to you.
 Today, I am in a pitiable position. Although I have come here, I can take part neither in the Executive Committee nor in the conven- tion. I have become a  dharmadhyakshalibtech_61_footnoteand am delivering a speech. This is contrary to my nature. I do not regard myself as a religious head. I am a votary of truth and I seek after truth. In this, you are my
 
 fellow-seekers. The proper thing is to compare notes. If, after delibe- rations, we can arrive at a conclusion, well and good, if not, it matters little. Although today I have become crippled, so long as God keeps me on the earth I do learn something. And I do long to pass on to you what I possess, whatever knowledge I have acquired. I would like to pass it on to you first of all. But sometimes I become impatient. You will find in Harijan what I wanted to say in this regard.libtech_62_footnotelibtech_63_footnotelibtech_64_footnoteThere is nothing new in it, but it has been presented in a new form. There is not a trace of arrogance in what I am saying to you—I am impatient to pass on to you whatever occurs to me but does not occur to you. I am a worshipper of non-violence and so are you. Many amongst you have faith in it. I have been a worshipper and ser-vant of non-violence for fifty years. There is no exaggeration here. I shall complete seventy soon. My faith in non-violence and my conscious effort to achieve it has been there since I was fourteen or fifteen. Since then I have had my faith in non-violence, based on reason. And my worship of truth dates even further back. For more than fifty years I have, in all my dealings, been relying on truth alone. Only such dedicated conduct results in knowledge and wisdom. If a person who has always acted in accordance with truth and non-violence for more than fifty years makes the claim that he has this one thing, it cannot be called arro- gance. Under this belief I also wrote out a brief article.
 Although the doctors have forbidden me, I could not restrain myself because of what happened in Bihar and the U. P. This time, too, I wish to tell you many things, but only if I get an opportunity and, if the blood-pressure does not rise. Today I wish to put before you only that which is weighing heavily on me. You should give deep thought to it.
 Before that I wish to tell you something about what Kishorelallibtech_65_footnoteis going to read out to you. I have gone through his speech. Although weak in body, he has produced a hundred and twenty-three pages. It is in four parts. His idea is to deliver the speech in four instalments on four evenings. In one of these he has generally described our short- comings and failings. I told him to deliver three of these. At my request, the fourth has been omitted. I shall put before you that which has touched my heart.
Truth and non-violence are the objectives of the Gandhi Seva
 
 Sangh. But if we practise these only in our struggle against the Government and not in our private dealings or in inter-provincial relationships, what would we gain? This would imply that even members of the Gandhi Seva Sangh are not consciously truthful and non-violent in their dealings with one another. I am giving you a summary of his speech. He says that there are but a few persons in the Gandhi Seva Sangh, and yet there are differences of opinion resulting in mutual bickering. Quarrels as such are to be found throughout the world. But we should be careful about their consequences. Our duty is to keep up our efforts. If anyone says that formerly Mahadev was bad-tempered and arrogant but now he is not what he was a year ago, that now he is changed, has become somewhat humble, and if it is something which not only Mahadev but Durga and their son also feel, then it means the influence of non-violence is growing. But if he thinks that he has now attained perfection, and if he no longer has the thoughtfulness and vigilance which he formerly had, he would be making a grave error. A unique feature of  truth  and  non-violence is that one must daily take some spiritual food. Have not the Upanishads said that this is like walking on the edge of a sword? I claimed that my spiritual striving extended beyond fifty years. If from this I conclude that there is no further need for me to be on my guard, it must be said that my downfall has started from that very moment. If  I am lecturing to you, I am also doing it to myself. I do not say this only to impress you. I do not deliver speeches merely for the pleasure of it. I do what the atman bids me do. What I am saying to you will have its effect on me too. If that were not so, I would become as insignificant as a blade of grass. Nor should you conclude that I am using these words only to get my work done while sitting with friends. If in our dealings with friends we are not on our guard and do not practise truth and non-violence, but make use of them only in politics, it would amount to practising diplomacy. Truth can also be uttered diplomatically. I do not  approve  of  the  English  saying  “Honesty is the best policy”. I do not wish to use truth and non-violence for diplomatic purposes. I am talking of ultimate values. If I am truthful and non-violent in my worldly dealings and if the world responds to me with contempt and if as a result I lose my faith in them, my non-violence is worthless. Then it is merely the best form of diplo- macy. You should not take it for an ultimate value. If it is not such a worthless thing, there ought to be love between friends.
Kishorelal and I are sitting side by side. Should Kishorelal have
 affection for me only if love is returned with love? I have become old, I lose my temper, I am not prepared to listen to anything; should he then forsake me? On the contrary, he should not be displeased, he should remain non-violent, he should have compassion for me. Non-violence, by increasing one’s forbearance and love, teaches one truth. Love is not a matter of bargain or conditions. One who remains non-violent towards a non-violent person can hardly be called non- violent ! In this case, man follows his own nature. The world will call me courageous if I die in an encounter with a murderer. But I should not take this course in order to get such acclamation.
 Kishorelal has also given some instances in his speech. But I have omitted them. What use have we for names? I was afraid that the mention of names and personalities might even have an adverse effect. Hence I have left these out. Now understand this. We should also put an end to provincialism. If the Andhras claimed that Andhra is for them alone, if the people of Orissa claimed that Orissa is only theirs, it will give rise to provincialism. The right thing for both Andhra and Orissa is to be prepared to sacrifice themselves for the country and the world. And India must offer herself at the altar of the world. That will be her true test. I am not advancing a new idea, I am only reminding you of it on a suitable occasion. The recent incidents in Kanpur and Allahabad have deeply affected me. Such incidents are not going to bring us swaraj. I have discussed the matter with Subhas Babu, Maulana Azad and others. The conclusion I have arrived at after Haripura is that if matters are as we saw them there, despite all our failings we may be able to see purna swaraj within my lifetime. If we can accomplish our task intelligently, the British will have to admit defeat at our hands. There will be only one power in India with whom they can discuss matters, and that power will be the Congress. There will be nothing left for them to do. They will be prepared to help if the people so desire. They will ask us what we expect from them. This strength can be generated within us through truth and non-violence alone. If we can develop this strength within us in a year, the Viceroy will have to invite Subhas Babu and ask him what the latter wanted from him. Even the British Government may send for Subhas Babu because the British are losing in power and prestige in Europe. But that is not what I have in mind. A non-violent person has no enemies. But if one who calls himself an enemy loses his strength, a non-violent person feels compassion for him. He does not wish to take advantage of the former’s predicament to mount on his back. He resumes his
 fight only when the former is out of his troubles. This is how I worked in South Africa. I found that it happened not only in the U. P. and in Allahabad, but in the Central Provinces and in other places also. Police and even military assistance had to be sought to put down the riots. I do not wish to say that the Ministers were to blame. What could poor Govind Ballabh Pant do? I am not criticizing him. He had to act in his capacity as a Minister. Whatever he did was correct. The fault lies with me. The conclusion which I drew from what I saw in Haripura was erroneous. I felt that we could  accomplish  whatever  we  wanted within a year and that we had developed the strength for it. But I now realize that I had made a mistake. I believe that if today the Viceroy sent for Subhas Babu, or Jawaharlal or me and asked us what we wanted, I would reply that I was not equal to the task. Today, we do not have the strength to respond. If we tell the Viceroy that we do not need the police or the army and that we can defend ourselves, that we have the weapon of non-violence, that the Muslims are our friends and so are the Pathans, that we shall ourselves tackle the Princes, that we shall bear with the Sikhs, he would conclude that I was out of my wits. This was not the state of affairs in 1920. When we are ready, we shall have within us the strength to come to a reasonable understanding with the Muslims, the Princes and the zamindars. Today, we have power neither over the Princes nor over the zamindars, neither over the Muslims nor over the Sikhs. Leaving aside others, do we have con- trol even over those who are within the Congress? Not at all. I have seen that there were internal fights to acquire control over the Con- gress office. I find in the Congress names of persons who were not in the organization at all. But let it be.
 I only wanted to say that if this state of affairs continued, we would not win swaraj in thirty years, let alone one. I feel that we can- not truthfully say that we can come to an understanding with all these people. And then again, if we have true non-violence in us we should have the strength to say these things and to act accordingly.
 Hence I ask you, is our non-violence the non-violence of the coward, the weak, the helpless, the timid? In that case, it is of no value. A weakling is a born saint. A weak person is obliged to become a saint. But we are soldiers of non-violence, who, if the occasion demands, will lay down their lives for it. Our non-violence is not a mere policy of the coward. But I doubt this. I am afraid that the non-violence we boast of might really be only a policy. It is true that, to some extent, non-violence works even in the hands of the weak.
 And, in this manner, this weapon has been useful to us. But, if one makes use of non-violence in order to disguise one’s weakness or through helplessness, it makes a coward of one. Such a person is defeated on both the fronts. Such a one cannot live like a man and the Devil he surely cannot become. It is a thousand times better that we die trying to acquire the strength of the arm. Using physical force with courage is far superior to cowardice. At least we would have attempted to act like men. That was the way of our forefathers. That is because some people hold the view that the ancestors of the human race were animals. I do not wish to enter into the controversy whether Darwin’s theory is tenable or not. However, from one standpoint we must all have originally been animals. And I am ready to believe that we are evolved from the animal into the human state. That is why physical strength is called brute force. We are born with such strength, hence if we used it we could be, to say the least, courageous. But we are born as human beings in order that we may realize God who dwells within our hearts. This is the basic distinction between us and the beasts. It is not that the serpent crawls on its belly, whereas we walk on our legs. The bullock has four legs, I have two. We have attained the human form. We are evolved gradually from such species as the serpent, etc., to the human state. Along with the human form, we also have human power—that is the power of non-violence. We can have an insight into the mystery of soul-force. In that consists our huma- nity. Man is by nature non-violent. But he does not owe his origin to non-violence. We fulfil our human life when we see the atman, and when we do so we pass the test. Now is the time for our test. God-realization means seeing Him in all beings. Or, in other words, we should learn to become one with every creature. This is man’s privilege and that distinguishes him from the beasts. This can happen only when we voluntarily give up the use of physical force and when we develop the non-violence which lies dormant in our hearts. It can be awakened only through real strength. Do we really have this non-violence of the strong? If not, we are in the sorry plight of Trishankulibtech_66_footnotelibtech_67_footnote. The better thing would be to admit that ahimsadharma is an impracticable ideal and then to give it up and adopt violence. But now we are unable to advance even a step farther than the non-viol- ence of the weak. Now we have no alternative but to choose between the two. If you do not decide this issue, who will? If you regard
 
 non-violence as a principle and not a policy and if you live for it, it becomes your responsibility, although your number may be small, to give proof of true non-violence in your own lives. If your non-viol- ence is genuine and not assumed just to disguise your weakness, the faults pointed out by Kishorelal will not arise at all. I have been saying this since 1920.
 You will ask me—what then should we do? You should under- stand well what I tell you. There are several things you can do. I wish to take up one of these. That is the misunderstanding or hostility between Hindus and Muslims. Our mutual ill will is on the increase. What happened in Allahabad, what took place in the U. P. today, may happen tomorrow in Bombay and Calcutta. In Calcutta, it may even be worse than in Allahabad. This is not something new in our country. If this is solved, other issues will soon be resolved. In this lies our test. You, can ask me what you should have done in Allahabad had you been true followers of non-violence. I would say that Govind Ballabh Pant was not needed there. That issue should have been tackled by the Allahabad Congress Committee. It could have mustered ten thousand volunteers. I had presented a draft of their pledge in  1921libtech_68_footnotelibtech_69_footnoteI  had prepared it myself. The Congress approved of it and I had also put it before the Khilafat Committee. Hakim Saheb was in the chair. Hasrat Mohani opposed the motion. He said that I wanted to make slaves of the Muslims. They may well remain non-violent in word and deed but Islam does not ordain them to remain non-violent in thought. He accused me of wanting to dominate Muslim minds as well. The ulemaslibtech_70_footnotelibtech_71_footnotewho were present there understood what I wanted to convey. Maulana Azad is a very intelliigent person. He had understood me right at the beginning I told them that I did not wish to make myself or any other person the master. But I wished to give this status to non-violence. Finally, they adopted the draft pledge. This pledge is seventeen years old. Despite this, even today we have not formed such a band of volunteers. The pledge has not been annulled by the Congress. Our resolution is in the records of the Congress office. It must be lying with Kripalani. But it lies buried in files. In my opinion, not a word from it needs to be eliminated. If we had such bands of volunteers at Allahabad or the other places, Hindu-Muslim riots would not take place. If we had a batch of a thousand volunteers, they could
 
 go over to a thousand such localities. They would carry the sword of truth and the shield of non-violence. If there are a thousand goondas and if we are alone or only ten, we would go there and die, get killed. We are pledged to non-violence, Hitler’s soldiers go to kill, we go to get killed, as Guptalibtech_72_footnotedid. I would have preferred him to have died alone. Why did he go to find out a Muslim comrade? This is not to criticize him. This is just a point I am putting before you. This is because I claim to be an artist working with non-violence. I say that Gupta had no need to take along a Muslim with him. But then there was only one Gupta. The picture that I am painting before you is something far grander. Imagine that Sarup moves up in the Allahabad riots and I come to hear that she gets killed while trying to restore peace and that she gets killed without a trace of anger against the people—I would then dance with joy. I would say people have lost their sanity, Sarup has fulfilled her life. She got killed. If we had ten or twenty thousand such persons, would they not do anything? And what if we do not have ten or twenty thousand? Even if there is a single person, he should get killed. Even if there is only one person who has the faith, he should allow himself to be killed, but should not bow down to the fanatics, the goondas. Take the example of Sparta. Though they were an armed people and also few, they laid down their lives but would not leave their places. We should have much more courage than they had. If we think that we cannot accomplish this task without a thousand men, our non-violence is not worth the name. If we do not have such courage, let us not talk of non-violence; let us not defile it. Non-violence is a weapon against which neither the sword nor any other power can avail. Even if there are a crore of people on one side and a single votary of non-violence on the other, even then the latter would not say that he would surrender to the might of arms. He will demonstrate the fact that poisonous gases and other weapons are futile against non-violence. He will not bend as did Austria against Hitler. It is for this reason that I wish to place before you this [principle]. It is of primary importance. You should understand it and also discuss it here. If we put this non-violence into practice, Kishore- lal’s task would be lightened. First we shall examine our conduct towards one another and see whether we are indeed followers of such non-violence. And, on the strength of this non-violence, we shall also win over the Muslims.
 
 This is one point I have mentioned to you. I have many more in my mind. This programme has been with us for the past seventeen years, and we have been sleeping over it with total indifference. I have reminded you of it. If I am as strong as I am today, I shall appear before you and you can ask questions about it. For me this is a very grave matter; my heart is full of it. I have direct experience of this kind of non-violence. If we have been unable to fulfil it during these seventeen long years, the fault lies with me. It is my belief that even in politics non-violence can work. In 1920 I had stated that through non-violence we could win swaraj within a year. I repeat that had it been an experiment with unadulterated truth and non-violence, I am sure a year would have been more than enough. If the country and the Congress feel that swaraj cannot be won through non-violence, they may well give me up. This does not imply that they are ready for violence right now. They will make use of truth or untruth, violence or non-violence, whatever is possible under the circumstances. That, however, will not be my programme. If there is truthfulness in you, and if we come to the conclusion that non-violence is a weapon of the weak, we ought to throw it away. If you are of the opinion that putting down riots by a non-violent army is an empty dream, you must also come to the conclusion that swaraj cannot be won through non-viol- ence.

41,"March 26, 1938",DISCUSSION AT GANDHI SEVA SANGH,"
  
 DELANG,
 March 26, 1938 BAPU: I have not come to tell you anything. If anyone of you wants to raise any questions about the point that was made yesterday
or  about anything else, he  may do  so.   Hence  I shall  not  begin  a
discussion.
 PRESIDENT: Kripalaniji wants to say something about what was discussed yesterday. I call upon him to start.
 KRIPALANI: I would like to say something about the riots in Allahabad where two groups were engaged in a clash. Together with the police, the Congressmen also rushed to the scene. How could the Congressmen or the satyagrahis go where one man was blindly stabbing another? How would they know in advance who was going to pull out a knife and at which moment? In former days the Hindus at any rate used to listen to the Congress workers. As for the Muslims, their hatred of Congressmen exceeds their hatred of Hindus. Now when the Congressmen, impelled by sentiments, are risking their lives and getting killed, even the Hindus have started abusing them. What I want to know is: have we weighed our policy at all? We want to give our lives for the sake of Hindu-Muslim unity. But, if the Muslims slay our great leaders, will the Hindus have more hatred for them or less? If a great man sacrifices his life, will the consequences not be exactly the opposite? Supposing Bapu sacrifices his life tomorrow, I am sure the Hindus will never forgive the Muslims for the ghastly murder. And there will be no Hindu-Muslim unity for the next two thousand years. What happened to the Jews? Even today Christians all over the world despise them for crucifying Christ and persecute them. I urge Bapu to consider whether or not one should have a sense of proportion in sacrificing one’s life. We shall never fulfil our purpose if we act without any thought of the Congressmen.
BAPU: Kripalani has raised very good points and they deserve
 your best consideration. If we do not or cannot have satisfactory answers to his questions, we must give up non-violence as I said yesterday. There certainly are solutions to Kripalani’s problems even if he or you may not be satisfied with them. There is nothing new about the methods adopted in these riots. The same thing has been going on for years. What is new is that people are stabbed in the streets or under cover of darkness. I do not know how the riots started in Allahabad. But if they began with two groups of fifty men facing each other, we  can  certainly  do  something.  We  can   go  and  stand
 between them and allow ourselves to be killed. But when the riots give rise to widespread fear in the city, people confine themselves to their own localities. This is as good as an invitation to those so inclined to indulge in secret assaults. What can we do in the face of such secret assaults? This is Kripalani’s problem. When this method of secret killing is adopted, shops are closed and people do not stir out. They avoid going into each other’s localities. Will the poor creatures go there to be killed? It is a different thing if one goes out for some very urgent work or inadvertently, or if a Muslim disguises himself to go into a Hindu locality. In this case they may get killed. But no one goes out in order to get killed. No one wants to die. My conscience tells me that every Congressman should be trained to go into localities where people run away after stabbing. In countries like France and Germany, everyone is required to join the army. In these countries the law ordains that people should be prepared to die. If we too have such  a band [of volunteers] who would be ready to sacrifice their lives during such riots, something could be done about these stabbings, although secret.
 KRIPALANI: Bapuji, it may be so. The Congress workers should go into both the localities, and they do go. They have done it in Allahabad also. But they are not as safe as a Christian can be. The question is whether the Congress has developed such strength. We have got the courage to die. We are not cowards. But we are few in number. Did not the people who went to the Muslim localities in Allahabad die? The goondas did not spare them out of any consideration for the Congress. My question is whether the Hindus’ hatred of Muslims will increase or decrease if Congress workers are killed in this manner.
BAPU:  I  merely wanted to show that we have a  solution to the
 problem. If a few of our men or many of them are killed that way, it will ultimately serve the purpose. My opinion is not baseless. I am well aware of the difficulties involved. But we must know whether or not we have any solution. What do the British, German, French, Italian peoples do? They prepare for war in the same manner. They keep themselves well equipped to face any new power that may emerge. Should we be less alert than these countries? Should we not prepare ourselves fully for our non-violent struggle? Should we sit back and say that we are not strong enough? This is not a matter about which we can remain silent. It is a new experiment. Non-violence has not been tried in politics so far. Non-violence was practised in the olden days too. But it always remained a matter of individual pursuit. Such
 people, later on, either fled into the mountains or lived in solitude in the villages. They took no interest in the public weal. I have started a new trend. Non-violence, if confined to an individual, cannot be the supreme dharma. I at any rate shall not worship a man who practises non-violence in a cave. Such non-violence has no use for me. I  believe in that non-violence which can be practised in the world of practical realities. I am not interested in the liberation a man may get by practising non-violence after renouncing the world. I do not care for individual liberation which would leave others out. One can find liberation by serving others. That is why I have to come here and explain things to you. Now let us have a full understanding of our policy. Let us put ourselves to a test. We may describe our policy by any other name, but let us at least know what it is. If we have come to the conclusion that non-violence was useful to us at one time but that it is no longer so, we must make a public declaration of it. Let us at any rate not exhibit our inertia and ignorance. If we do not decide our policy in all seriousness we would be only betraying ignorance and fear. For, in such a situation we would not increase our strength even if we had an army of millions. And here, too, what really troubles me is that we would be doing harm to our millions. When the real time comes, the people will flee to their villages instead of fighting the danger. What worse can happen to our millions?
 Those others who have no faith in non-violence will accuse me. They accuse me even today. They are blaming non-violence; they are blaming you. They exaggerate so much and say such things as I could not have thought of even in my dreams. They say that I have formed a sect. They think that the training I am giving in non-vio- lence has proved very harmful for India. And some of them even go to the extent of saying that our real strength does not lie in non-violence. They say that this passive policy of non-violence has ruined us. In their view, the man who has done so much harm is as good as a thorn. And it would not at all be inconsistent with their policy to remove this thorn. I may be exaggerating, but is this not the gist of what they say? It is not that I am paying them a compliment. My thoughts are the same in public and in private. In their place, I would be probably more fiery than they are. But I  never  for  a moment think that I am going along the wrong path. On the contrary, my faith is confirmed day by day. This is no small matter. We have a solution for this [problem]. We have not tried it in full measure. The solution is no doubt correct. But we have tried it on a very small scale.
 We are not practising non-violence with conscious understanding. Right now, it is our duty to give it a fair trial once again. But we at any rate must be confident of our success. The test of our success is that no trouble should start from our camp. If it does we must admit that we cannot attain swaraj through non-violence. For us, the freedom struggle consists in the confrontation between the non-violent and the violent camps. This does not mean that the people on the other side are taking up arms right now. They too are brave and are willing to adopt non-violent means, as the Communists are. They are no less ready to get beaten up by the police. But our paths are not the same. They might say that they can remain peaceful while fighting with the Government but not in mutual quarrels. There are others who may say that they can adopt peaceful methods in the field of politics but not in Hindu-Muslim clashes. But we cannot talk in such terms. For us this problem is as important as the problem of achieving swaraj. If non-violence can serve no purpose during such riots, we must put it completely out of our minds. But I am certain that it can definitely work. We are unable to solve the problem because of the third power in the country. Hence, [it is said], let us first defeat the third power. Let us come to terms till then. After that the Hindus and the Muslims will confront each other and decide the issue. I have been hearing this since the year 1920. From that time on I have been thinking over the problem. I will never accept such a situation. It is true that  the presence of the third power is one reason for the Hindu-Muslim differences. But I do not believe that these differences would be resolved merely by eliminating the third power. If we have not been able to extinguish [that fire] so far, it is time we searched some new way of doing it. I have only one way of attaining independence as well as Hindu-Muslim unity, and that is satyagraha. We adopted the path of satyagraha against the Government for the attainment  of swaraj. And we did succeed to some extent. We offered the Salt Satyagrahalibtech_73_footnoteand refused to pay taxes to the Government. But we have done almost nothing with regard to this (Hindu-Muslim question). Whatever we have done is not particularly non-violent. We have had the Unity Conference. We had parleys with Mr. Jinnah. We had talks with the Ali Brothers. We arrived at a couple of agreements. But all these do not go to make the path of non-violence. All these are political methods. And then, they did not even make much headway.
 
 For they were not backed by any real strength. We had the Lucknow Pact of 1916. But there has been no agreement of any consequence after that. I wrote to Jinnah that I would even go and meet him.libtech_74_footnotelibtech_75_footnoteBut what should I do even if I did so? Both the Hindus and the Muslims have in their hearts scant respect for the Congress. Under the circumstances, how can the agreement be successful? If in the event of a riot the goondas on both the sides declare that they would not attack those with white caps, if we ourselves have confidence that the Congress workers would not be attacked, then we may say that we have achieved something. This task would be accomplished if we can have a band of one or two thousand workers wedded to non-violence. And what if we cannot? Our success is not solely dependent on numbers.
 Let us now come to the practical side. I never do anything without practical considerations, for I am a practical visionary. True, there is something in laying down one’s life out of sheer devotion to duty. But that can be done even by a soldier pledged to violence. The reason why I think in practical terms is different. It is quite likely that if I go there, or Kishorelal and Kripalani go, or if I am killed, the goondas might get converted. I may not even go where this is not likely to happen. But those who lay store by faith will say that I am thinking in practical terms, and that I lack faith. But one practical consideration is always before us. For instance, Vallabhbhai is doing so much work that l would certainly not allow him to go and get killed. If I send Manilal, the poor chap will be killed. But I will not send Vallabhbhai as long as I can help it. I would send others. Let us thus carry on work while bearing in mind the practical aspect of it. I have some such practical consideration before me. If some two thousand outstanding Congress workers have to sacrifice their lives, I shall not think that we were not practical. History will not say that we had indulged in madness. I would only feel that we had fulfilled our vow. I am sure history will testify that non-violence is a weapon of the strong, and that we laid down our lives for our cherished principles. Such is my undying faith. We have been somewhat slack and off our guard. That is why we did not recognize the power of non-violence. For we have not had enough faith in it.
 MATHURA BABU: What will you say in reply  to  the  remark  about  Jesus Christ?
 
 
 
 
saults?
BAPU: Kripalani has put it upside-down.
 SWAMI :   What   measures    can    we   take    to    put    a    stop    to    secret   as-
 
BAPU: I agree this is a very complex problem. Since we cannot
  	save others from such assaults, we should get ourselves killed in 	such cases. These assaults do not stop when some people are killed 	because those people do not deliberately go there to get killed. And 	it is mostly the poor people who are killed. How is it that rich and 	respectable people do not go and get killed? It is a different 	matter if some of them are killed that way without their knowledge. 	We must visit the Muslim localities in the event of such secret 	assaults and killings. We must make it a point particularly to visit 	the houses of the suspects. We may go to Shaukat Ali. If he puts the 	blame on the goondas, we should ask him to accompany us and take out 	posters against the goondas. In the same way I had approached 	Chhotanilibtech_76_footnotelibtech_77_footnote. The leaders of these goondas are supposed to be 	powerful, are they not? From this point of view, mass contact with 	the Muslim commu- nity acquires a new meaning altogether. The real 	way of making mass contact with the Muslims is that we should seek 	opportunities to know them and serve them. Serving the Muslim masses 	without any expec- tations is the only honourable and effective way 	of winning their hearts. I would like to give it priority even if I 	have to suspend  political work. But it is not necessary to stop 	political work. We find easy opportunities of serving and knowing 	the Muslims. For instance, Mahadev and I often travel by trains. 	Often there are Muslim passen- gers in the compartment. But our 	people do not talk to them sponta- neously. We do not offer them our 	food and other things. This is just one instance. There are so many 	other things. After hearing this some even amongst you might say 	that I am talking utter nonsense. Those who talk in this manner 	consider the Muslims as people of a different community. But I want 	to accept them as our own people. This is a question of a change of 	heart on our part. How can we express the love and respect that fill 	our hearts? I know there are quite a few Muslims who regard the 	Hindus as infidels and do not wish to asso- ciate with them. But all 	Muslims do not harbour such hatred in their hearts. There are enough 	Muslims who consider the Hindus as their compatriots and believe 	that it is only by living in amity that both these communities can 	look after their interests and make progress.    
 But we should not be frightened even by those Muslims whose hands hold knives and whose hearts are filled with hatred. We must win their hearts too, so that even they find it impossible to kill us. After all, is it that we alone are human beings and they are not? Even they are bound to appreciate human qualities some time. They are sure to understand our way some day or the other. This is a question of union of hearts. Communal trouble may be halted temporarily by means of some political compromise, but that will not bring about unity of hearts. I would like to tell each one of you that if there is any such trouble in the villages where you have settled down, you must sacrifice your lives there. There is this great difference between me and the socialists. They believe in first converting the whole world to their view and then taking up these things. Individual action is not part of their programme. This is not the way of non-violence. It can begin with individual action. I do not say that my work can start only when I have an army of a thousand workers. I live in Segaon. Should any such incident happen there, I must plunge into it. Wardha is at a distance of five miles from Segaon and quite a large number of Muslims live there. If something happens there and suppose Jamna- lalji is unmoved, I must go there and jump into it. Now, if Kripalani asks me if I have given any practical thought to the matter, I would say that this was my practical consideration. Under these circum- stances it would be my duty to die even if I were all alone. Similarly, this would be the duty of each individual. He has to be prepared to die. We should not ask whether we shall achieve swaraj by thus allowing ourselves to be killed in communal clashes. For us, there is no other way of achieving freedom except through non-violence. And it is my hope that we are developing that power, unless whatever has been done during these twenty years has been in vain.
 KRIPALANI: To you, non-violence may be a matter of individual action and may bring liberation to your own self. But you are not content merely with that. You consider non-violence a means of social service as well. Not only this, you consider it also a social force. Under such circumstances, you have no right to miscalculate. You must understand that you may not do anything from which society cannot benefit. You say you should go and allow yourself to be killed. But you must remember that if the Muslims so completely lose their heads that they kill you, the Hindus will not forget this thing for the next two thousand years. They will regard the Muslims as the enemies of all mankind. They may forget this thing after two thousand years and unite, but as far as you are concerned, it cannot be gainsaid that from the point of view of society, you will have done a wrong calculation in thus
 throwing away your life. Thus, in all matters we shall have to think out what is going to be our gain or loss.
 KAKASAHEB: When there was trouble in Bombay during the visit of the Prince of Waleslibtech_78_footnote, you did take a practical view. You did not go to persuade the Parsis because you thought that your action would not produce any good results.
 BAPU: I agree that I took a practical view. And, like that, I do make such calculations. But my calculations too can sometimes go wrong. Do I not have a right to commit blunders?
 KRIPALANI: It is not only your right, it is your nature. You want to go against nature. You have no patience. I know that many people will hide their cowardice behind my argument. But, for that reason, why should we be foolish enough to sacrifice needlessly so many gallant lives? We must think about it from the national point of view.
 KAKASAHEB: But who will decide this matter—you, society or Bapu?
 JAMNALAL: Neither we nor Bapu. The nation, that is, the Working Committee will do it.
 KRIPALANL: What I wish to say is that you have written to Jinnah that you do not find the atmosphere [favourable]. Under such circumstances, if you find yourself alone in the midst of a riot and if it becomes your duty to plunge into it, my only request is that you should not sacrifice your life.
 BAPU: This consideration is irrelevant. Please forget me and Jawaharlal. You think of your own self and of the country. We claim to represent the entire country. Millions of Congressmen are ready to die for the country. What is their duty? The leaders will look after themselves. But I am talking to you about the duty of Congressmen in general. The instance of Jesus Christ will not be applicable in this case. The death of Jesus had no untoward effect on the world. Yet another difference is that Jesus did not go to die on his own. He was crucified. Yet, by his death, his teaching spread far and wide. Leave aside all these things. Think of it from the individual point of view. Social force is something that follows it. I have given my example only from that point of view. I have not done so with the idea that I am a leader or a general. When the occasion arose, I demonstrated my quality of leadership too. What I then did was but calculations. People were shouting why I was not coming out. They were probably calling me a coward too. I listened to everything in silence. The leader does not think of what other people may be saying. I was shouldering at that time the responsibility of leading a movement. But now we have to
 
 experiment in sacrificing our lives on a larger scale. I have not tried such an experiment so far. Whatever happens, cowardice must be discarded. Non-violence is not for the helpless and the timid. That was the reason why I wrote to an Andhra friend that if he could  not remain non-violent and would die a gallant death, he should fight with physical force. Running away is cowardice. Even today I feel that I had suggested the correct way to him. I have still not tried and seen the result of sacrificing lives on a large scale. I wanted to tell him that it was quite plain that battles in the past were fought with the sword. What I mean is that I have not tried and tested remedy to prevent this. My understanding and my experiences in other fields suggest a remedy which I think will be successful. I am not ashamed to acknow- ledge my imperfections. But I am not so shameless that I would stop with mere acknowledgement. I make constant efforts to do away with my imperfections. What I am placing before you today is the result of this very effort. If your conscience does not accept what I am saying, just forget it. You need not hesitate out of respectfor me. In the matter of the Hindu-Muslim problem, our love will not be proved by argument or physical force. If our love proceeds from the heart, ours cannot be the way of the sword. We cannot answer abuse with abuse and fists with fists. The real test of love lies in sacrificing ourselves and thus answering the lack of love in others. The time has now come to try this experiment. I have givenlibtech_79_footnotelibtech_80_footnoteyou a call through  Harijan and now personally. Consider this from the individual point of view. You can discuss it with me if you want and then present it in your own words. It is not as if I had tried this experiment and was now presenting it as an infallible remedy.
 JAMNALAL: We must have more discussion on this point. The thing is not as simple as Bapuji thinks it to be. It must be considered from various points of view. Every man cannot be used everywhere. We have to have a certain sense of proportion here also. Take me, for instance. I was present at Banaras when communal violence raged there. I had to go into a troubled area for some personal work. But my friends prevented me and held me back. I was convinced by their arguments. And I did not go. Now you and I will have to decide whether what I did was right or wrong.

 "
42,"March 27, 1938",SPEECH AT GANDHI SEVA SANGH MEETING,"
  
 DELANG,
 March 27, 1938
 You have just heard the resolutionlibtech_81_footnote. I suppose no one will have any objection to it. My task is to caution you on this issue and to explain its implications. Am I audible to all of you? If you ask me to interpret the resolution, I shall do so.
 This resolution is not for the whole of India. It is also not meant for the Working Committee. It is meant only for those who have come here. And to them I wish to say that wherever they happen to be when  a riot breaks out, whether they happen to be alone or in a group, whether they find a co-worker or not, they should be prepared to lay down their lives in order to put down the riots wherever they might have started. This does not mean that they should simply go and get killed. No doubt they should lay down their lives. But they must also think whether they are doing so in anger or out of love. If they do not have love in their hearts, their laying down their lives is pointless. You should try to understand this well. I would like to admit before you in all humility that what I say to you is meant also to myself. This is because I also keep thinking about what I say to others, what I have done, what its possible implications are, what my duty in the matter is. Even while having my meals, while discussing other matters, this issue weighs on my mind. Only yesterday, such matters came up before me, which I cannot mention now; and this is not the occasion for it. I shall speak of them on some other occasion. Today, I cannot even say what we should do in any given situation. We should of course be prepared to lay down our lives. But our task is not complete with that. Our desires and our actions should be based on understanding. What is it that inspires us to act? What will be its outcome? Is this the best
 
 possible path? Or can there be an even better path? That should be our line of thinking. It is thus that we can find the right path. We should engage ourselves in our work intelligently. As I was thinking along these lines, I found that there were many hurdles in our way. If you ask me how we can overcome all of these, I can give neither you nor myself a satisfactory answer. I would only say that if you believed in these principles you too should experiment with me. In that case, we shall certainly find the way. This resolution is before you. You should give much thought to it and then be prepared to discuss it. Because, if we do not wish to give up our tenet of non-violence, we should think over what we should do in such a situation and start preparing for it now. You do not have merely to pass this resolution, you have also to implement it. You have also to create a favourable climate for it. You should find a Muslim locality within your field of service and there create such an atmosphere. If anything untoward happens in this locality, you should accept the responsibility. Every individual cannot make the entire country his field of work. After all we have to know our limitations. In a city like Bombay you cannot take the responsibility even for the whole city. You should find out how many Muslims live in the locality where you happen to reside, get yourself acquainted with them, serve them, and do whatever you can. There should not be a single Muslim child whom you do not know. We should take each individual Muslim in our locality and build in his mind trust for us. If we resolved this issue fully, we shall develop the strength to solve other problems as well, for this is the biggest hurdle in our way. A satyagrahi alone can render such service. He should specially keep himself in the forefront of such service. You may ask what special service he can render. If you render sincere service there will be no such incidents in your locality. And if such a situation does arise in another locality and if you prepare to go there  alone  to resolve the dispute, the Muslim’s in your locality will co-operate with you. At least they will take care of their own locality. You will be able to go to the other localities, and that too with greater courage and confidence. Today, I myself do not know how I am going to do all this work. I have explained the resolution all right but whom shall I invite to implement it? Those whose help is to be sought in this work will have to be trained in self-confidence. And that by itself will, again, not be sufficient. We shall also have to prepare them for the time when they will be tested.
It is for this reason that I explained to you how we could put this
 resolution into practice. The second part of my speech deals with a question of the greatest magnitude. Let me caution you. Think well before you answer. I shall put the question to you in brief.
 The question is whether your non-violence is that of the brave or of the coward? Is it the result of your weakness? If it is the result of your lack of strength, I insist you discard it. It will cripple and weaken us. That certainly is not the aim of non-violence. This does not mean that I am asking you to take up the sword right now. There is a place for non-violence in the war strategy of the weak also. But  such unarmed opposition is not my non-violence. You may adopt even that. But before doing so you will have to renounce the non-violence in which I believe. Today, you and I bear the burden of this non- violence [of the strong]. If we openly renounce it, we shall relieve ourselves of that burden.
 It is not because we are unarmed that we have adopted this non-violence. Ours is the non-violence of the brave. Although I have been experimenting with it for fifty years, I have no cut-and-dry answers to all the questions. When I start thinking what I would have done if I had been in Spain now or in China or Austria, and if Hitler had attacked these countries and I found men and money being drained away, my head starts reeling. You may well argue how much the non-violence that has made only this much progress even after fifty years’ experience can help us in our struggle. If you think like this, you may give it up. For me, there is no question of giving it up. My faith in it is unwavering. I shall however ever regret that the Lord has not favoured me with such clarity of expression that I could explain my ideas to others.
 I mean ours should not be the non-violence of the cowards who are afraid of war, of bloodshed, whose hearts ‘tremble at the shouts of killers. Our non-violence should be the non-violence of the Pathans. I have lived with them. They are not afraid of killing or getting killed. I have cited this example so that I may compare myself to a Pathan boy. A Pathan boy is fearless. If there is bloodshed he does not hide himself in his house. He finds pleasure in fighting. He does not stop to think that he might be injured or even killed. He is never afraid of being hurt. I have seen one standing unmoved in the midst of blood gushing from his many wounds. I do not mean to say that all Pathans are like this. But I have seen such Pathans with my own eyes. What I wish to say is that experimenting with non-violence is the work of
 such brave persons. I myself have not yet reached this stage. There is lot of cowardice in me. I talk of satyagraha, no doubt. But in the face of killings I cannot have the fearlessness of the Pathans. If I have to go and face such a situation, my heart’s one wish would be to escape alive. If per force I do go, my heartbeats would quicken. And, in my heart of hearts I would be afraid lest a bullet or a stone should hit me.  I reached Bombay (in 1921) when the riots were raging. Stones were being hurled. I wanted to save myself from the melee, but what could  I do? I was the leader of the non-co-operation movement. I went in most unwillingly. At heart, I wished someone asked me to stay at home; that would have indeed been welcome. When I reached there the people were in a frenzy. Anasuyabehn was with me. She is a brave woman. Who was I to protect her? People had lost their heads. I saw mounted policemen advancing towards us. At the most, there must have been forty of them, but they were advancing with such uncon- cern as though there was not a man on the road. They were followed by officers in their cars. My heart trembled. We wanted to go to the Fort area. We reached Abdul Rehman Street via Pydhonie. There was heavy fighting in the area. My heart was thumping. I do not know how high the blood-pressure rose. As soon as the mounted police and army officers arrived the people who were till now in a riotous mood ran helter-skelter. I do not wish to take up your time narrating the whole incident. My idea is to tell you that you should give some thought to this. I have spoken of my own cowardice. But those who were brandishing knives and sticks turned out to be no braver. I have compared my own courage with a Pathan’s. Non-violence is the weapon of such fearless persons full of courage.
 This will show clearly how I should experiment. If there is real love in my heart and a feeling of oneness, why should I feel nervous to go there? Why did my heart thump so? This clearly implies that even in me the feeling of non-violence has not grown to the extent that would make me fearless and free of doubts. Fearlessness born of love is the general characteristic of non-violence. If it is not yet born in our hearts, this experiment is for that very purpose. While carrying on this experiment, we shall acquire the strength to face death smilingly. But we have fallen into complacency. When there is peace on all fronts we do not prepare ourselves for such eventualities. And when the occasion arises we do not know what to do. If we do not wish to try this experiment whole-heartedly and in all seriousness, I humbly request you to give it up. I also wish to point out to you that mere
 debating will not resolve the issue. Open discussions do clear up our reasoning to some extent. It is true that on the question of non-violence also we shall have to exercise our reasoning till the last. But I must tell you that non-violence is not a matter solely of the intellect. It is a matter of faith and devotion. If you have no faith in the atman or in God and prayer, non-violence is not going to prove useful to you. If it is in fact the supreme dharma, as we believe it is, then it must work on every occasion and at every place. It has so much potentiality. If we cannot recognize it the fault lies with us. Realizing the whole range of the power of non-violence or having a vision of its whole power depends on our spiritual effort. If you are convinced of it and, after striving for 17 years, if you have developed this faith that whether or not we win swaraj, that irrespective of what happens to the world, we have achieved this one thing, you should try it intelligently. Your knowledge will grow with your sadhana. But you will not become omniscient. God alone is omniscient. He is not so stupid as to let all become omniscient and omnipotent. Thanks to our imperfections we can still aspire to it. God has assured us that when we realize our weakness and take refuge in Him, He is with us. The bhajan “Rama is the strength of the weak’, is not a versification of some music teacher; it is a factual statement by someone who had experienced it.
 If you have any doubts or hesitation you should not pass this resolution. Take at least one night to think over it. Pray to God to enlighten your intellect. This is not a resolution to be passed by a majority. Even if a single member amongst you stands up and says that he does not have this faith, he still has the right to tread the path of non-violence. You should certainly not pass it by a majority.
 Now let us come to Jamnalalji’s question. If we, who are mem- bers of the Gandhi Seva Sangh, accept ministerships, can we order firing? Today, in Allahabad Govind Ballabh Pant is a Minister. He is not a member of our Sangh. But is he for that reason less non-violent than we? I know him very well. But what could the poor man do? I want to tell you that had I been in his place I would have acted similarly. When I accept ministership, I take the responsibility for peace and honest administration. Of course, I could think this matter over before accepting the ministership. But I cannot ask any member of the Gandhi Seva Sangh not to accept ministership solely on this account. I am aware that this would mean lowering of my standard.
 But after all my non-violence cannot deviate from what is practical. I wish to work through non-violence while yet solving the problems of everyday life. If while I am a Minister Hindus and Muslims start fighting amongst themselves, and if I realize that I can stop this vio- lence and bloodshed by calling in the army and having a handful of men shot, I would have to resort to this course for  the  sake  of restoring order. I will have to give orders to stop the massacre with the least violence.
 I am opening my heart to you in order to explain all this to you. If outsiders hear what I am saying, I cannot say what interpretations they will put on it. There must be journalists present here, but they do not know their profession. They should not be cross with me, I too have been a journalist, and I too have experience of reporting. But these people do not wait to discriminate between fact and fiction since they must fill up a page and create a sensation. Hence I wish to state rather plainly that not a word from what I say shall go out.
 Well, this was a digression. Now visualize Pant’s position. The Hindus and Muslims of his city have lost their heads. They are butchering each other. Life and property are not safe. What then shall he say? Should he say to himself that although he is a votary of non-violence he sees no non-violent way of facing this situation? He examines the doctrine of non-violence, but finds it silent over the point—but he does have in his hands brute force; hence he should take recourse to it. He does not lack manliness, so he will not remain passive. He would again seek the help of non-violence and not use brute force. But if such an occasion arises again and he does not find a non-violent way, he should again act in the same manner. Pant should publicly declare that non-violence did not avail; the people did not help him and all the same they have made him a Minister. He should therefore do whatever suggests itself to him. You must have understood my point. It is now needless to discuss the issue any further. If you wish to ask any other questions please do so.libtech_82_footnote
 Seven minutes are left. Let me answer Rajendra Babu’s question in the mean time.
 His point, as far as I can understand, is this: I now know all of you. Knowing you as you are, I should put something before you
 
 which you can do. Even if you thought for the whole night or, for that matter, for ten nights, you cannot know yourselves better than I know you. Hence I should put before you the minimum that I want. This is his question.
 I have already shown the remedy. Rajendra Babu has said that even if we thought for ten nights we shall make no progress. Yet I would again ask you to think all night. Tell me tomorrow if you can. For this I may start my silence earlier today and break it earlier tomorrow, so that after thinking it over all night you can discuss it tomorrow. My point about cautioning you is to be found  in  the second part of my speech. In the first part I mentioned the minimum that you can do. I have said that we should increase our contacts with the Muslims in our village or locality in a spirit of service. We should widen our circle of Muslim friends. We should serve them with sincerity and not by flattering them. If they ask us to get this or that for them we should refuse to do so. We should apply our reasoning, cast off our fears and without flattering them go on doing what we regard as our duty. For instance, we should gather Muslim boys and give them milk; even if their parents have suspicions, I should like to prove through my conduct that I was not doing this in  order  to convert them to Hinduism. Gradually their suspicion will be removed. At least we shall come to know the boys. Now suppose a riot breaks out in the mean time. In that case after this experience we can go into that locality without fear. I have in this matter less experience but more faith. And now I have also lost my strength. Had it not been for this reason I would not be sitting like a fool doing nothing. Take up one locality and try the experiment. Nevertheless I must  say  one thing. If you carry out this experiment your self-confidence will grow a hundred fold. You will know your strength. We have only one weapon and that is non-violence. It. will be applied extensively and in many ways you will think of putting this remedy to many other uses. As you tread the path of non-violence, new weapons will come into your hands of which I am not aware.

She seemed at one time to 	be satisfied with what had happened. Sharifflibtech_84_footnotehas certainly put up a good defence. It 	is very hot here. Melting.

 CHI. AMRITLAL,
 I have already sent the answers to your questions. Try to  discover why you keep good health in Bombay without any effort while you barely manage to do so in Segaon. Is the cause psycho- logical or external? If it is external, is it the food and water or the climate, or both? If it is food, you can eat the same food in Segaon as you do in Bombay. If the reason is psychological, [the cure] is in your own hands. If it is the climate and water, we are helpless. But I don’t think that they count so much.
The date of my return will be decided in Calcutta.

50,"March 28, 1938",SPEECH AT GANDHI SEVA SANGH MEETING,"
  
 DELANG,
 March 28, 1938
 Having heard the discussion we have had now and Kishorelal’s brief report of the discussion in the afternoon—having heard it all I have come to the conclusion that this proposal should not be put before you. You should not conclude that this is a result of the argument advanced by a few friends. The discussion I heard here has also left the same impression on me. This does not mean that those who have faith in this may not act upon it. It only means that in this matter I do not wish to force anyone. But I certainly insist upon the principle underlying this proposal. It is not something unnatural. If you have understood my point it will gain weight when you act upon it and carry it out according to your capacity. [Passing] a resolution will not by itself suffice. Take [for instance] Jamnalalji’s suggestion. He says that so long as Muslims do not become members of our Gandhi Seva Sangh, it will be futile to make efforts in this direction. What he says is true but we shall find the correct remedy after we have served them and our action has borne fruit in the form of a closer contact with the Muslims. Of what good will it be if one or  two persons become members reluctantly? We shall achieve something only when our relationship with the Muslims becomes that of the servant and those whom he serves. So far the Congress has been doing what Jamnalalji suggests. What it did was good, no doubt. They got many Muslims enrolled as members. But they had to be coaxed into becoming members. This is a kind of flattery, or you may call it a politically motivated policy. What I have said today is not for political reasons, although it may well have a welcome political  outcome. Today I place it before you solely from the standpoint of non-vio- lence. If we are really experimenting with the non-violence of the strong, we ought to make an effort to bring about friendship between Hindus and Muslims. So far there has been no friendship. It was only an attempt to win them over through flattery. There was a policy behind all that. We maintained friendly relations merely from a practical point of view; it was like a businessman’s practical policy. So far we have not put our non-violence to the test in regard to this issue. If today we can take this test in non-violence and pass it, we shall move a  thousand steps   forward  on  the   path  of  winning  freedom
 through non-violent means. If you really believe that swaraj cannot be won without non-violence, you will also have to admit that our non-violent means will not be effective without Hindu-Muslim unity. As I delve deeper into this question many things come up before me. After all I am being guided by my intellect, am I not? Nowadays, I am relying solely on my intellect. But mere intellect makes one insane or unmanly. That is its function. In such a situation Rama is the strength of the weak. My innermost urge is for pure non-violence. My weakness is that I do not know how to make it work. I use my intellect to overcome that weakness. If this intellectual cleverness loses the support of truth, it will blur my vision of non-violence, for is not non- violence the same as truth? Mere practical sense is but a covering for truth. “The face of truth is hidden by a golden lid.”libtech_91_footnotelibtech_92_footnoteThe reasoning faculty will raise a thousand issues. Only one thing will save us from these and that is faith. Hence Gangadharrao said that he did not feel weak. For him, the argument of weakness is hollow. But others have doubts whether non-violence can accomplish this.  Kripalani  had raised the doubt about what policy we could adopt where there are secret attacks on individuals. This is a kind of guerilla warfare as Prabhudas called it. There was in Banaras nothing but peace. In Sarnath however four Hindus were done to death. Now how can our non-violence help in such a situation? I say, think a little deeper. This is but a part of our war strategy. You despair that no friendship will help there. I tell you it certainly will. It is not that a handful of persons have lost their sanity. Its root lies in the fact that the atmosphere is vitiated. But then I cannot say right now how far it can be purified through our service. You must not reduce your service to a bargain. Non-violence cannot work in this way. In the case of non-violence we on our part start acting without any doubts. Take the instance of April 6, 1919libtech_93_footnotelibtech_94_footnoteWhere were the Congress Committees then? We announced a proposal. Millions responded to our call. Tell me how this could have happened. Everyone felt as if a miracle had occurred. People thought that at the bottom of all this there must have been a mighty scheme, but there had been no such thing. However, it was certainly supported by a lot of prayer. The same thing happened in the case of the Dandi March. Who had organized and planned it? I myself was not aware of
 
 anything. There was faith and nothing else. I too did not know what God would do. I had only the faith that it would all turn out as it did. You have evidence that I had no clear idea of it. I do not know how it all really happened. This is how non-violence works. Today, we think of our weakness. Actually, it is not our weakness. The fact is that we have no faith in non-violence. This lack of faith makes us doubt whether non-violence can solve the problem. Millions have this faith in the matter of swaraj. But with regard to Hindu-Muslim unity we find not even a thousand such persons. What we need is that we should have faith in non-violence not merely as a means to swaraj, but independently as well. Whether we win swaraj through non-violence or not, we must achieve Hindu-Muslim unity. For us, it is not a means to swaraj. I have not been able even to create the climate for it. Not even a thousand persons share my views on this question. Just as I say that I do not want swaraj if it is to be won through untruth and violence, today I would also say that I do not want swaraj without Hindu- Muslim unity. I say this because I want that in independent India Hindus should not suppress Muslims, nor Muslims Hindus. I want to see that all are equal. You may perhaps find this aspect of the problem rather new. If this is something new for you, so is it for me. I can see no straight way in front of me. There is total darkness ahead. Despite this, I have. the confidence that if I go forward with faith, I shall certainly reach my destination. If you realize this, you should start working on this even without a resolution. In a way this problem is even more difficult than that of swaraj. Millions of  people  today aspire for swaraj. Not even a handful of people care for  Hindu- Muslim unity. We will have to solve this problem  independently. There are many difficulties because we seek the welfare  of the Muslims while serving them. We do not want to encourage their selfishness by pampering them. Take for instance the incident cited by Prabhudas. I totally disapprove of what he did. If a Muslim zamindar insists that the Hindus should not celebrate Holi, should I ask the Hindus to agree to it simply because these poor people listen to me? I will certainly not do it. You may say that to celebrate Holi would be suicidal. I would tell the Hindus that they should not give up their religious practice on this account. I would myself ask the zamindar to come forward and kill me, for I would light the Holi fire right in front of him. I would ask the Hindus not to break the heads of Muslims, but rather to sacrifice their own. We shall give up nothing through fear. I shall certainly do what I have a right to do and what I
 may. If I have to fight for this, I shall do so in a non-violent manner. I went to make friends with Jinnah Saheb. But if for this reason I allow myself to be suppressed and do not fulfil my duty, it is no friendship. This is not a new approach. The important thing is that service should be the basis of friendship, and no other motive or self-interest as was the case with my childhood friendship. The friendship which I had then formed with the Muslim boylibtech_95_footnotewas for the sake of meat-eating and ended with it. But today, I am asking you —you who make friends with the idea of service and who with your mature intellect believe in atman and Paramatman—to serve them. Such friendship will result in unity.
 Now the question of girls. What should they do? Should they be scared at the sight of Muslims? That ought not to be. But it does not follow that they should enter the fray at the time of riots or become the victims of secret attacks as a matter of dharma. Of course, if there is a girl like Mridula it is another matter. She is not afraid of anyone. She does not care even if the Muslims kill her. Girls who are self-confident should go in. But those who are afraid, who lack this self-confidence, who do not have a strong heart should not go there. “But the man of doubt is lost.”libtech_96_footnotelibtech_97_footnoteIf I am overcome by doubt I will hardly touch a serpent. Women who have doubts must never come out before Muslims. I know of many such instances. I tried to tell you about this in a way you would understand. You should not feel that the whole discussion has been futile. My mind too has become clear. You have drawn my attention to several difficulties. In spite of them, after this discussion, I am even more strongly convinced that this is what we should do and shall have to do. Let us not form  any committee and so on. Each one is a committee by himself. Each is his own leader and his own soldier. The servant is himself the master. Where the climate does not exist, what is the use of forming committees? When the time comes we will lose our heads. The real thing is to keep our heads—our reasoning—clear. There is  no question of any confrontation. Dastane asks me to appoint someone for the task. This is not a matter to be dealt with in this way. In the same matter what may be dharma for one person may be its opposite for another. Let us not betray our souls. Let us not corrupt our
 
 intellect. If we wish to strive for non-violence we should follow the yamas   and  niyamaslibtech_98_footnotelibtech_99_footnote.  This  advice  of  our  forefathers  is  absolutely correct. I am not placing anything new before you. I shall show what strength underlies our forefathers’ advice. I have derived this from their own books. We cannot observe ahimsa without fulfilling the vows. This does not mean that whoever is morally depraved and given to drinking commits violence. But then it is certain that he does not sincerely observe non-violence. We must examine everything from this standpoint, viz., whether it helps or hinders non-violence. I too can drink alcohol but as medicine, provided a vaidya prescribes it for me. If this movement of ours is conducive to non-violence, let us at least demonstrate unity amongst all Hindus.
 Why did I stretch this point? Because the other point that I wish to make follows from this. You must never forget one more fact regarding Hindu-Muslim unity. It is a test for every religion. Even if there be nothing special about Hinduism it must have something distinct about it. Otherwise how could it come to have the  name Hindu? [Now] does this distinctiveness consist in playing Holi? Does the distinctiveness of Islam consist in hit-and-run tactics? Does Hindu- ism teach animality? And did the Prophet’s religion teach lawlessness? My point is that you should first become a true Hindu and then go to the Muslims. Till then no unity is possible. I know there are many Muslims who believe that so long as Hindus do not recite the kalmah they will not be saved. But if we prove through purity in our life and perfection of conduct that one can be saved even without reciting the kalmah, the Muslims too will be impelled to have respect for the Hindus. Such true unity will not be achieved through any political agreement. Such business pacts are futile. What is needed is an understanding based on dharma, where there is no question of a bar- gain. For this, friendship between brave people and the non-violence of  the  strong  are  required.  Even  if  a  frightening  smashanlibtech_100_footnotelibtech_101_footnoteinter- poses—such non-violence will fearlessly make its way through it. I do not claim that I have attained such non-violence. I am afraid of every [little] thing. Perhaps I am the weakest and the most cowardly of all. But I am all the same a devotee of true non-violence. I tell you that so long as we do not attain the non-violence of the strong and  our conduct is not truly religious, the Muslims will have no respect for our
 
 religion and love for us.
 GANGADHARRAO: If the resolution is withdrawn the consequence will not be
  good.   BAPU: 	I don’t agree.  JAMNALAL: 	I had a special reason when I said that we should have Muslim 
  members. 	Only a 	Muslim can 	persuade another Muslim 	if the 	latter misbehaves, and 	the same 	applies to Hindus. 	But I 	find that even the 	most respectable Muslim 	seldom raises 	his voice against 	the misdeeds 	of his 	community. On 	the other hand one can 	keep them in 	good humour 	only by 	justifying their 	every action, good or 	bad. I 	cannot tolerate this 	state of affairs. 	I cannot 	uphold what Prabhudas did. Must we 	stop our 	music for 	fear of 	losing the 	Muslims’ friendship? 	Friendship does not imply 	that we 	give up 	resistance to 	injustice. But 	this, more or 	less, has 	till now 	been the 	policy of 	the Congress 	as well 	as the 	Gandhi Seva 	Sangh. In 	my opinion appeasement 	cannot bring about unity 	or love. BAPU: 	If we have formed the notion that we should suffer the  	atrocities of the Muslims in mute submissiveness it is  absolutely  	wrong. If until today I have not said that we must also resist 	injustice inflicted by them, here I say it now. We should now tell 	the Muslims also that they have been unjust and, if they beat us up 	for saying it, we should get beaten up. As for the resolution, we 	should have it after making some efforts and gaining experience in 	the matter. It is likely that experimenting on these lines someone 	may get some new inspi- ration. In that case we can call a special 	session of the Sangh before the end of the year.  DASTANE: 	If not this resolution, let us have another commensurate with our 	faith and strength.  BAPU: Yes, we can do it 	if you like. But in my opinion, it would be proper to do so only 	after making an experiment and gaining experience.

  March 	29, 1938  Gandhiji 	proposed that efforts should be made to give eight annas as minimum 	wages to spinners working for eight hours a day, thus allowing at 	least fifteen rupees per month. Mahatmaji also said that the price 	of khadi should be so fixed as to bring more money from the rich and 	less from the poor. Gandhiji asked members seriously to ponder over 	his proposals.  The 	Bombay Chronicle, 	30-3-1938       DELANG,  March 	30, 1938  	This is the last day of the present session. I myself was not aware 	that I was going to speak today. Kishorelal told me that I was 	expected to speak. Later I also felt like it. Before I say what I 	wish to, I shall answer a question.  	It has been asked whether every member of the Working Committee is 	not expected to put in 1500 hours of  work  in  the Gandhi Seva 	Sangh every year. The question has been posed by Jethalal. Although 	the idea is very good it cannot be put into practice. Today, we must 	give up our insistence on this. Everyone should put in as much 	physical labour—not mental or intellectual—as possible.    
 However, we cannot go so far as to expect daily four or five hours’ work from the members. This is not an association of labourers. If it can become one, well and good. But today it is an association of educated people. If we wish to take five hours work daily from the Working Committee, we should ourselves do it first. How can those people find the time for all this at present? In this country the trouble is that those who are supposed to be big men get very little time. Where can Vallabhbhai find so much time? In that case we should ask him to quit. But then we cannot do without him. We ought to realize our limitations.
 Yesterday I had decided to remain silent on what I am now going to say. But I changed my mind this morning. I am glad that Mahadev has told you something about what has happened, and now that he has said something I feel like speaking out all that is in me. The various items of constructive activity that you are doing are only outward expressions of truth and ahimsa. They only reveal how far they can carry you on the road of ahimsa and truth, and ultimately to freedom. The removal of untouchability is one of the highest expre- ssions of ahimsa. It is my daily prayer, as it should be the prayer of you all, that  if  untouchability  does  not perish  it  were  far  better that Hinduism perished. This prayer found its most poignant expre- ssion during my Harijan tour of which the principal objective was the opening of the temples to Harijans. They tell me that the untouchables do not wish to enter the temples. Even if this is true, the reason behind this is that we have made such monsters of them that they no longer have any need for temples. Even if they do not care to go into the temples it should be our concern to permit their entry. And I have declared day in and day out that whoever believed in the removal of untouchability should shun temples which were not open to Harijans. Now, how could I bear the thought of my wife or my daughters having gone to such temples? I would plead with them, would go on bended knees to dissuade them from going to these temples, and might have to deny myself personal ties with them if my entreaties failed. I have tried to live up to this principle all these years, and I felt humbled and humiliated when I knew that my wife and two ashram inmateslibtech_103_footnotelibtech_104_footnotewhom  I   regard  as  my  daughters  had  gone  into  the  Puri temple. The agony was enough to precipitate a collapse. The machine recorded an alarmingly high blood-pressure, but I knew better than
 
 the machine. I was in a worse condition than the machine could show. The Gita teaches us the lesson of detachment, but that detachment does not mean indifference to shocks of this kind—failure in duty on the part of one’s dearest ones. The three who went were the least to blame. They went in ignorance. But I was to blame, and Mahadev was more to blame in that he did not tell them what their dharma was and how any breach would shake me. He ought to have thought also of its social repercussions. We should understand our individual as well as our social dharma. How did it affect me? I turned pale. My grandson says that the Amrita Bazar Patrika reports that Kasutrbai did not go in but waited outside. If that was so I would have leapt high. But how could she at all go there after having lived with me for fifty years? And why did the two other women go? Are they not my daughters? That too is my fault. This act of theirs has depleted our soul force. We ought to be more vigilant. By looking upon women as [mere] women we overlook such matters. That is not the way of non-violence. This is a matter of awakening. It was Mahadev’s task to have reasoned with them. And, if they were not convinced, he should have brought them to me. I would have told them that I was their spiritual father and not opposed to their religion. I could be their spiritual father only if they and I belonged to one faith. If their faith could be identified with mine I could reason also with the people: “What is the use of [going to] such temples?” They were ignorant, I know, but we are respon- sible for their ignorance, and it is the reverse of ahimsa not to dispel their ignorance. I sent them to Puri not to go into the temple, but to stand just where the Harijans were allowed to go and refuse in protest to go beyond that limit. That would have been the right kind of propaganda, and they would that way have done Harijan service. To do scavenging work or to eat with Harijans or to feed them is not enough, if we do not deny ourselves the going to temples and the like so long as our kith and kin, the Harijans, are denied their use.
 If we do not go even to the temples which have been regarded as sacred for hundreds and thousands of years, where such great men as Chaitanyalibtech_105_footnotehave gone in to offer worship, where we long to go, simply because our Harijan brothers are not allowed, it would be a great act of dharma and, if God really is in the temples, as we believe, it will
 
 certainly have its effect. The pandaslibtech_106_footnotehad come there and said that the Harijans could go along with us. Quite correct. For a panda the silver coin is God. I therefore prevented Rajendra Babu’s sister from going in. Some may say that I exercised undue pressure. I would say I saved her from adharma. If I intruded it was in the name of religion. Like these three women many others must have gone and must be inten- ding to go. I have expressed my feelings for the sake of these people. What can I say to those who cannot restrain themselves even after this?
 There is another aspect of the case. The sanatanists believe that untouchability is part of Hinduism, and so do the Mussalmans and the Christians who think that Hinduism is nothing if not don’t touchism. But the virus of untouchability has infected them too. They shun the Bhangis. You cannot finally solve the Hindu-Muslim problem until you have removed the stain of untouchability by non-violent means. The Muslims will then cease to regard us as unbelievers.
 They will then say that we might be idolators but God is in the idols too. Hence, I have asked the idol-worshippers to befriend the Muslims. That is the path of courageous non-violence. Perhaps Mau- lana Saheb also believes that Gandhi is what he says he is, but the other Hindus are steeped in untouchability. It is our responsibility to change his opinion of us.
 Then there are the Harijans themselves. How are we to carry to them the conviction that we are with them through thick and thin, that we are completely identifying ourselves with them, unless we can carry our families—our wives, our children, brothers, sisters, relatives—with us in our programme of the removal of untouchability?
 Is it possible that a member of the Gandhi Seva Sangh might claim that his dharma is different from his wife’s and sister’s? This is neither religious tolerance nor is it non-violence. People will think we are hypocrites. Intense faith is what is called dharma. The essence of dharma is non-violence; it is another name for it. Its power is such that the sword would drop from the Englishman’s hand. The Muslim’s lawlessness would be held back. Patanjali has said that violence becomes ineffective when confronted by non-violence. If this has not happened till this day it is because our non-violence has been that of the weak and timid.

 DELANG,
 [On or before March 31, 1938]libtech_110_footnoteGandhiji was asked in Delang what the Ministers’ attitude should be over the appointment  of   Acting  Governors  in   the   Provinces.  .   .   .   He  said   that  acting
 appointments should not be made from among the services in the Provinces.
 Ministers will not relish the idea of a subordinate official suddenly becoming Governor to whom they have often to refer for guidance and who may even preside over their deliberations. Such a Governor cannot act with detachment nor can he command the res- pect and confidence of the Ministers. I should think that the Viceroy or the Secretary of State would think twice before making such appointments. Ministers would be right, indeed it might be their duty, to protest against such an appointment. I do not know that such an appointment might not be, casus belli. In the Colonies generally I have known the practice of Chief Justices of Supreme Courts acting as Governors in the absence of permanent ones.

 March 31, 1938
  	What a gift so early in the morning! But if even one mistake is not 	corrected immediately, it will lead to a succession of others. All 	the same I will tolerate thousands of mistakes, but I can never part 	with you. Even death at the hands of a bhakta is preferable 	to salvation at the hands of those who have no love for one. There 	is, therefore, no question of your leaving. Now 	I will list your mistakes.  	I don’t blame Durga or Velanbehn at all. Ba has already made 	atonement; not by fasting but by confessing her lapse to me with 	utter simplicity. She thus made holier yesterday our holy 	relationship of over fifty-five years.  	But what did you do? Either your negligence or your blind love for 	Durga let her do a wrong thing. And afterwards when you came to know 	of my pain, you started a fast without thinking. Fasting is no 	remedy for thoughtlessness or wrong-thinking. The remedy lies in 	right-thinking. When I came to know about your fast, I tried to dis- 	suade you, but to no avail. I advised you to think carefully instead 	of fasting. You did not do that. You did not even try to understand 	my point of view. Yesterday I asked you very tenderly whether you 	had understood what I said. The reply you gave then was not proper. 	Your behaviour was still worse. Instead of attending Maulana’s 	speech, which it was your duty to do, you went away to cry. And as a 	result you threw a silly poem at me. Last night also you should 	have. given some time to Maulana, which you did not do. You did not, 	thus, fully avail yourself of the opportunity of serving a 	Mussalman. Had my words yesterday had their intended effect, you 	would have gone today to Puri with a band of workers and would have 	shaken up Puri. But perhaps I myself was not sufficiently serious, 	otherwise I should have thought of this right in the beginning. If 	your duty is as clear to you as daylight, I would even grant a day’s 	leave and also let you take along with you anybody who might be 	ready to go. This may be done even today if it is possible.  	You say that you ‘interpret’ me, but may I ask to whom? Is it 	not to Velanbehn? 
 Your poetic imagination sometimes blinds you to reality. There is nothing but cowardice in your letter. If you decide to leave me, will Pyarelal stay on? And if Pyarelal leaves, will Sushila stay? Of what use to me is her extraordinary intelligence? She has such intelligence that it sometimes pains me to think that it will rust if she stays with me. Why does it not occur to you that I could let all of them go if I let you go? They will all run away. Lilavati will simply go mad. I will suffer even that, if such be my lot. But I will never send away you or any- body else. And yet how can I prevent anybody from running away? Let this incident inspire poetry in your heart. Correct your error if you see hat you have made one. If you cannot see it, ask me to explain it to you. If you think that I have committed any error, correct me. This is no time for crying or fasting. You should read less, but think more. Study carefully all that has been done here. You yourself should utilize Sushila’s and Pyarelal’s talents and  thus  lighten the burden on you. Take work from Lilavati too. This incident shows me that being crushed under the weight of external activities, you think less. Thereby you will be able to do much less by way of ‘interpreting’ me.
How much more shall I go on writing?

  	I am sorry that I will not be able to speak today. But it is as well 	that it is so. I have already written to Ba and made my suggestion 	regarding Kanam. If she permits you to take charge of him, do so. If 	you do, you should give up the kitchen work. You may give some help 	if necessary. Mix well with Nanavati. Talk less. Don’t speak 	thoughtlessly. Never shout at anybody. Our servants are not mere 	servants. Treat them as your own little brothers and sisters. 	Cultivate 
 cordial relations with Mirabehn. She is doing very good work at present.
Continue to write to me.

       April 	  3, 1938  	My attention has been drawn to the press report purporting to give 	the gist of the conversations that took place between Sir Nazi- 	muddinlibtech_119_footnoteand 	me on April 2. The conversations were strictly confi- dential and, 	therefore, the report can only come from a fertile journalistic 	brain. Ever since I have entered upon this self -imposed mission on 	behalf of political prisoners  and  detenus,   I   have  made     
 known the terms upon which I have intervened. But the giving of assurances by prisoners or detenus as a price of freedom has never crossed my mind. As a civil resister, I would not be guilty of inducing any political prisoner to give such assurances. And I can also add that during my talks with the prisoners at Alipore and Howrah jails and the Regulation III prisoners at Hijli, they made it absolutely clear to me that they would give no assurance to anyone for the purpose of purchasing their freedom. I wish for the sake of the cause that the news papers will not anticipate events. Every unauthentic report adds to my difficulties which are already formidable.

 With a smiling face Mahatma Gandhi came  out   of   the   Presidency   Jail  at 5 p. m. after having been closeted with 14 state and four women political prisoners for about three hours. While leaving the jail gate, Mahatmaji was approached by the Associated Press. He said he had a long talk with the prisoners, but that was all he could say at this stage. Asked if he was going to see the prisoners again, Mahatmaji said:
I may, but not this time.
 Further questioned, he said he might have one or two more meetings with Sir Nazimuddin, the Home Minister, to complete his negotiations, but there is no possibility of his meeting the Governor again now.

80,,THE CHOICE,"
  
 My remarks arising out of the recent riots in U.P.libtech_132_footnotehave attracted much attention. Friends have sent me cuttings from the Press. This is some of the criticism printed or spoken :
 My 	writing betrayed hysteria. I 	wrote without sufficient data.  I 	had recanted 	my views 	on non-co-operation 	and civil 	resistance. I 	had been 	driven to the 	policy of the Liberals.  Congressmen 	had never 	adopted non-violence 	as between themselves. I 	was expecting 	the impossible 	from human nature.  If 	my position was 	accepted swaraj 	would never be obtained, 	for all India 	could never become non-violent. 
 There is much more I could cull from the criticism. I have only taken the relevant parts.
  If 	my article 	betrayed hysteria, 	the symptoms still 	persist, for in spite of the criticism which I have studied with the 	care it demanded, I see nothing to change the position I have taken up. The 
 
 critics should remember that my proposition was specific and narrow. Swaraj could not be obtained through non-violent means unless our non-violence was of the brave and such as to be able to deal effec- tively with violence. I have not maintained that it could not  be  obtained by other means. But if it could be so obtained we were not ready to deliver the goods, for we were not ready for matching our force against the British.
  All 	the data required were 	that there were riots, 	no matter 	on how 	small a 	scale, that 	Congressmen were 	not able to deal 	with them non-violently, 	and that the aid of 	the police 	and the military 	had to 	be summoned. 	There was no 	dispute about these 	three broad facts. They 	were enough to enable 	me to draw 	the conclusion 	I did. 	In this 	there was 	no reflection 	on the 	Ministers. I 	have admitted that they 	could not have 	acted otherwise. The 	fact, however, 	remains that the 	Congress non-violence 	was not able 	to cope 	with the emergency.  There 	is nothing 	in my article 	to warrant 	the infe-rence 	that I 	had lost my 	faith in 	non-co-operation and 	civil resistance. All 	I need say is 	that it 	is brighter than 	ever. The two are quite 	enough to bring 	swaraj, provided that 	non-violence practised is of the bravest.  I 	wish I 	could be 	drawn towards 	the policy 	of the 	Liberals. I 	have many personal 	friends among them. But 	they have no 	sanction. I 	claim that I 	have an 	infallible sanction. My 	article was 	written to 	show that during 	the riots 	it was 	not the sanction that 	had failed, the 	failure was 	of the 	organization which 	had accepted 	the sanction, namely, 	active, constructive non-violence.  I 	can only 	refer the critics 	to the 	many resolutions 	of the 	Congress which 	do not 	confine the 	use of non-violence 	only towards 	Englishmen. Indeed 	I remember 	having many 	discusions at the 	Working Committee 	meetings at which 	the necessity 	of non-vio-lence 	among ourselves was emphasized.  Well, 	human nature has 	hitherto responded nobly 	to the 	call of 	non-violence. But I am 	concerned with 	the Congress nature. 	Congressmen have 	to sign 	a pledge 	which commits 	them to 	non- violence. 	libtech_133_footnoteMy 	question was 	and is—have they 	non-violence in 	them? If 	they have, is 	it of the brave? 	My thesis 	is that 	if it is of the 	brave, it 	should be 	enough for 	dealing with 	the riots 	and for delivering 	the goods. 
 
  This 	is answered 	in the foregoing. 
 But I have the fear that our non-violence is not of the kind required. Congressmen may not treat my warning lightly. After all I am supposed to be the Congress expert, however inefficient, on non- violence. I have confidence in my readings and my remedies. I cite Ahmedabad and Viramgam violenceslibtech_134_footnotelibtech_135_footnote, Bombay violence during the Prince’s visit,libtech_136_footnotelibtech_137_footnoteand Chauri Chauralibtech_138_footnotelibtech_139_footnoteon the eve of Bardoli. The results have amply justified the remedies applied at my instance, though on these occassions critics were not wanting who had expressed their strong disapproval of the suspensions. I have no doubt about my present diagnosis [or] about the remedies. The remedies are  not beyond our ability if we have a living conviction about non-violence and its nature. Here are some of the remedies :
  We 	must discover 	a solution 	for the Hindu-Muslim 	tension. I use 	that expression 	deliberately instead of 	‘communal’—for if 	we find this, the other will follow as a matter of course.  There 	must be 	a purging 	of the 	Congress registers so 	as to make 	them proof against bogus voters. From all 	accounts I 	receive, our 	registers contain 	too many bogus 	names to 	be called at  all  accurate.  Congressmen 	must not 	be afraid 	to find 	themselves in a 	minority.  Without 	delay every Provincial 	Congress Committee should 	raise a proper 	corps of volunteers 	pledged to non-violence 	in thought, 	word and 	deed. And 	there should be 	a manual 	of instructions 	as to 	training, etc., prepared 	for universal use. 
 There is nothing heroic or impracticable in these suggestions. But they are impracticable if those who lead have no living faith in non-violence. If they have not, the sooner non-violence is removed from the Congress vocabulary the better it is for the Congress and the nation. The alternative is certainly not unadulterated violence. The Congress is the only political organization in the world which has, at my instance, adopted unadulterated non-violence for the attainment of swaraj. It is its only sanction. I dare say that if its quality is not what it
 
 should be, it will do great harm to the nation. In the last heat we may be found to be cowards instead of brave men and women. And there is no disgrace greater than cowardice for fighters for freedom. Surely there is nothing to be ashamed of in retracing our steps. If we feel that we shall not be able to displace the British power without a violent struggle, the Congress must say so to the nation and prepare accordingly. We must do what is being done all the world over— ‘forbear when we can, hit when we must’. If that is to be our creed or policy, we have lost precious seventeen years. But it is never too late to learn and mend. Seventeen years in the life of a nation is nothing. It will go hard with Congressmen if having received the warning they do not make the choice.

He found it difficult to express in words his love for the Ashram and the Ashramites, and urged them to carry on their mission of spreading the use of khadi amongst the masses.
 Through Sodepur, he added, they were serving the entire Hindustan. Mahatma Gandhi hoped that their services would be more and more appreciated all over the country.libtech_140_footnote

  April 10, 1938 Mahatmaji intimated his good wishes to Mr. Thakur and desired that he should  follow in 	 the footsteps 	of  his 	noble grandfather, 	  Sree Guru  Chand  Thakur, who  devoted 	his life 	to the 	cause of 	the   Scheduled 	 Castes.   He 	 further   added  that 	  the  Congress 	would try its level 	best to stamp 	out the sin of 	untouchability from the 	soil  of 	Bengal. He 	asked Mr. 	Thakur to 	visit the 	different Congress 	Provinces and study 	for himself 	the Congress 	work and activities 	for the uplift 	of the Scheduled 	Castes and make 	a propaganda 	in Bengal 	so that 	the Bengal Scheduled 	Castes might respond to 	the clarion call of the Congress for achieving India’s political end.

  April 	  13, 1938  	I regret to inform the public that the negotiations that I have been 	conducting with the Government of Bengal through Sir Nazim- uddin 	have not yet been concluded. I must confess that my arrival in 	Calcutta was ill-timed, as the Ministers were all busy with the 	assembly work and as it was known that I should come back before the 	end of March, I felt it was unnecessary to ascertain Sir 	Nazimuddin’s wishes about the time of my arrival. Had I taken the 	precaution of writing to him, I would not have found myself in 	Calcutta at an inauspicious moment. I have now to write a letterlibtech_154_footnotelibtech_155_footnoteto 	Sir Nazimuddin, summarizing my suggestions which, I am assured, will 	be considered by the Government as speedily as possible and definite 	decisions taken—a process which, it is expected, will be completed 	within one month. It is        
 hoped, however, that the decisions may be taken much earlier, and if it becomes necessary for me to return to Calcutta, I shall do so without hesitation, provided, of course, that my health permits it.
 Meanwhile I must repeat that all agitation for the release of detenus and prisoners should be suspended while negotiations con- tinue. I must also state that it is not conducive to the success of the negotiations if public demonstrations are held in honour of those who may be discharged. In my opinion, it is more dignified for Congress- men to exercise restraint. I have seen extracts of speeches and  addresses as reported in the papers which do not betray any spirit of non-violence.
 I may add that whilst I  have  been  seeing  the  convicted prisoners and  discussing  with  them their  attitude  to  non-violence for my own guidance, the Government have made it plain to me that whatever the prisoners might state to me will not be allowed to determine their policy. They think that it will be improper for them to base their action on such assurances as I may issue. I fully appreciate the Government view. My talks with political prisoners therefore are purely for my own personal satisfaction.
 In so far as the 14 Regulation prisoners are concerned, they gave me at the interview I had with them the following letter :
 During your last visit you expressed your desire to be acquainted with our definite views on certain things. After giving full consideration to the matter we can only reaffirm what we said then. As long as we are in detention we are unable to discuss our past and future and our political opinion. Particularly when the talk of release is in the air it affects our sense of self- respect to say anything that may have some bearing on the question of our own release. We hope you will appreciate our standpoint and readily concede that we mean no personal disrespect.
 It was signed by nine. Four other prisoners had not signed the letter but they associated themselves with the sentiments expressed therein, and the fifth gave a letter very similar to the foregoing.

 [April  13, 1938]libtech_156_footnote
 DEAR SIR NAZIMUDDIN,
 In accordance with the understanding of yesterday, I submit herewith my suggestions :
  I 	understand that 	the detenus, including 	the Regulation 	III prisoners, 	will be discharged 	and all restrictions 	upon their liberty will 	be removed 	inside of one 	month from this date. 
 I can only hope that I shall not have to return to Calcutta in that connection. Should my presence, however, be required, I shall gladly come whenever wanted.
  With 	regard to 	the convicted 	political prisoners I 	suggest that—   the 		ailing prisoners 		should be 		discharged forthwith 		irrespective of 		their terms of imprisonment;  those 		who have 		less than 6 months 		to serve 		should be discharged forthwith;  those 		who have 18 		months or 		less, but 		over 6 months 		to serve, 		should be discharged 		within 3 months;  those 		who have 		longer terms than 18 		months to 		serve should 		be discharged 		within one year 		at the most.   Those 	releases should 	be contingent 	upon  a 	public understanding 	between the 	Government and 	the Opposition, that 	is, the 	Congress Party, to the effect that—   there 		shall be no 		public demonstrations 		or processions 		in honour 		of those 		detenus or prisoners 		who may 		be discharged;  there 		should be no agitation, 		directly or 		indirectly, initiated 		or countenanced 		by the 		Congress Party to 		depart from 		or improve 		upon the settlement 		that may be arrived 		at. In other 		words, so far 		as Bengal 		at any 		rate is 		concerned, the 		question of 		the release 		of detenus and political prisoners shall cease to be a Party question or a  
 
 matter of public controversy.
 I have purposely refrained from entering into any argument in favour of the suggestions made herein. I have discussed them threadbare with you and you have very patiently listened to me.
 Whatever the fate of the negotiations and suggestions, it  is  agreed between us that a final decision will be taken by the Bengal Government within a few days, certainly within one month from today.
 You have told me that any assurances the prisoners or detenus may give me about non-violence could not or would not be allowed by the Government to influence their decision. But, as you know, I have interested myself in their cases on the strength of their disavowal of violence for the attainment of India’s freedom. Therefore, for my own satisfaction, I discussed the question with them and whilst they did not want to make any statement for the sake of furthering their release, they assured me that they had no faith in violence for securing India’s freedom. I believe in their assurance and it would be a pity if such men could not be discharged.
 I forgot to mention one thing during our conversations of yesterday. The prisoners at Dum Dum asked me whether I had  received the many messages they had sent me through the usual channels. I cannot recall having received any, except the messages from the Midnapur girl prisoners. Whatever may have happened in the past, I trust that in future you will kindly issue instructions so as to ensure the delivery of their messages to me, assuming, of course, that they are not objectionable.libtech_157_footnote

CONGRESSMENlibtech_164_footnote","
    
 CALCUTTA,
 [April 13, 1938]libtech_165_footnote
 The difference between your view and mine is based on the question whether the Zemindari system is to be mended or ended. I say it should be mended, and if it cannot be mended, it would end itself. You say that it is incapable of being mended.
 In these words Gandhiji summed up the difference between the Socialist school and what may be called the Satyagrahi school, before an informal meeting of Calcutta Congressmen.
 Q. The zemindars and mahajans are the instruments of the bureaucracy. They have always sided with it and are an obstacle to our progress and freedom. Why should not the obstacle be removed ?
A. They are indeed part and parcel of the bureaucracy. But they
 are its helpless tools. Must they for ever remain so? We may do nothing to put them away from us. If they change their mentality, their services can be utilized for the nation. If they will not change, they will die a natural death. If we have non-violence in us, we will not frighten them. We have to be doubly careful when the Congress has power.
 Q. But can’t we say the system of zemindari is an anachronism and should go, by non-violent means of course?
 A. Of course we can. The question is: ‘must we ?’ Why can we not say to the zemindars, ‘These are the evils which we ask you to remove yourselves’? I admit that this presumes trust in human nature.
 Q. Would you say that the Permanent Settlementlibtech_166_footnoteshould remain ?
 A. No, it has to go. The way to make the kisans happy and prosperous is to educate them to know the reason of their present condition and how to mend it. We may show them the non-violent way or the violent. The latter may look tempting, but it is the way to perdition in the long run.
 
 Q. But don’t you agree that the land belongs to him who tills it ?
 A. I do. But that need not mean that the zemindar should be wiped out. The man who supplies brains and metal is as much a tiller as the one who labours with his hands. What we aim at, or should, is to remove the present terrible inequality between them.
 Q. But the mending process may be very long.
A. Seemingly the longest process is often the shortest.
 Q. But why not parcel out the land among the tillers ?
 A. That is a hasty thought. The land is today in their hands. But they know neither their rights nor how to exercise them. Supposing they were told neither to move out of the land nor to pay the dues to the zemindars, do you think their misery would be over? Surely much will still remain to be done. I suggest that that should be undertaken now and the rest will follow as day follows night.
 That led up to the question of the Kisan Sabhas, their relations with the Congress, their scope and their function.
 My opinion is clear-cut, having worked among the kisans and labour all my life. There is nothing constitutionally wrong in the Congress allowing the Kisan Sabhas to work independently nor in allowing the office-bearers of the Kisan Sabhas to be office-bearers of the Congress, for they will come in the usual way. But my study of separate kisan organizations has led me definitely to the conclusion that they are not working for the interests of the kisans but are organized only with a view to capturing the Congress organization. They can do even this by leading the kisans along the right channels, but I am afraid they are misleading them. If the kisans and their leaders will capture the Congress by doing nothing but authorized Congress work, there is no harm. But if they do so by making false registers, storming meetings and so on, it would be something like Fascism.
 But the main question is whether you want the Kisan Sabhas to strengthen the Congress or to weaken it, to use the kisan organization to capture the Congress or to serve the kisans, whether the Sabha is to be a rival organization working apparently in the name of the Congress or one carrying out the Congress programme and policy. If it is really a rival organization and Congress organization only in name, its strength and energy will be utilized in resisting the Congress and those of the Congress will be utilized in resiting the Kisan Sabha,
 with the result that the poor kisans will be ground between the two mill-stones.

  	You have done something  really  excellent.libtech_174_footnotelibtech_175_footnoteAct 	 in  the  same manner in future also. And now the answers to your  	questionslibtech_176_footnotelibtech_177_footnote.     It 				has not been my experience that  in  daily life  it  is untruth 				and dishonesty 				that always triumph. 				We of 				 course come 				across instances of 				these sometimes 				winning, but  if 				 we  look  deep 				into the 				matter we 				shall see that the real triumph 				goes to truth.              Would 					it not 					have been proper for 					the ticketless 					passenger to evade 					the ticket-examiner? 					Didn’t dishonesty often pay ?      How far was it proper for the addressee to advise him to be honest ? What right had the ticket-examiner to let the passenger off ?  Not 		himself having any 		money to 		pay, how 		could the 		addressee have 		appealed to other passengers to pay the ticketless passenger’s fare ?  If 		the passenger could complete his journey to Madras, would it have 		been right for the addressee to see him out of the platform on a platform ticket ?  
 If, however, the victory of truth was always self-evident, what would be its value, and what would be the merit of adhering to it? Is not this the reason why the Ishopanishad, which is regarded as authoritative as the Vedas has this mantra, that the face of truth is covered with a golden lid? We are dazzled by the splendour of that lid.
    Now 			the second question. 			It may 			not be our 			lot always to 			suffer, but 			that doesn’t mean 			that we should’t 			advise other people 			to follow 			the seemingly 			strait and 			narrow path of 			truth. Even if 			the old 			man had been 			able to hide 			himself and 			reach Madras, 			what would it 			have availed? 			Where was 			the guarantee that 			he would 			not have 			got caught 			somewhere? And why 			should we 			assume that 			he had 			to suffer 			because finally he had 			to get 			down? We 			don’t always know 			what is for 			our good. We 			should, there-fore, 			proceed blindly on 			the asump- 			tion that the path of truth cannot but lead to our good.  It 			 was  certainly  			within  the  right 			 of the 			  ticket-examiner  to 			let that 			man go. If, 			however, he  did  not  			think  he 			 had  such 			 a right, 			he could 			not have neglected 			his duty out of 			false pity. But 			even in 			that case he 			could have issued the 			man a ticket 			and paid 			for it 			from his 			own pocket or 			could have collected 			the money 			from other passen- 			gers.  Supposing 			 the  examiner 			 did   not   let 			  the   man   travel, 			nor issued 			 him  a 			 ticket  with  his  own  money, 			 and  the 			 old  man 			 had therefore to 			miss the 			train or 			go to 			jail, why should he 			have minded that? 			If he was 			a lover 			of truth, 			he should 			have faced that cheerfully. And 			we are 			thinking here 			about the 			duty of 			a lover 			of truth. 			Even though 			you are 			not maintaining 			yourself with money 			earned by 			yourself, on 			an occasion like this, 			which arises  only once in 			 a while, 			you could 			have paid something 			yourself and 			collected the 			balance from 			the other passengers. 			If the 			latter had 			paid anything, so 			far so 			good; but 			even if they 			hadn’t, you 			would have 			done your duty. But I didn’t feel, either, that even the little you did was not enough.  Had 			 the  examiner  let 			 the  man  travel 			 to  Madras,  he  could 			have informed 			the ticket 			collector there that 			he had 			used his 			discretion in 			letting him 			go. But supposing he 			had refused 			to do  that, 			it would 			not have been right 			for the old man to 			get out of 			the station 			with the help of a platform ticket. However, the way out of that 			situation would 			have been easy. You 			yourself could 			have explained his 			condition to 			the ticket 			collector and if 			the latter 			had not been 			con- vinced he could have kept the man in custody. These days, however,   
 they don’t follow that practice since it puts the railway company to a loss; the ticket collector merely shouts angrily at such persons and lets them go.
 If you have any doubts even after reading  these  answers  to your questions, ask me again.

  	Lately you have been figuring in my dreams. Shall I call it 	attachment or love? Be that as it may, you have become a big 	question-mark for me. “You have already taken one; you want to 	take the other one too ?” These words of Mother still echo in my 	ears. Her concern was justified. My duty is clear. At least today 	your place is not with me. If Pyarelal finds his moorings, it will 	be well. But if that does not happen I shall consider myself 	worthless. And what can a girl like you do by living with a 	worthless person? There is no strong reason for you to leave your 	mother’s lap. I failed in my duty when I let you ignore the letter 	from Delhi. You should have accepted one of the jobs offered.

If 	he has anything else to say, I shall write again.  	Stop worrying about me. The night passed well. In the morning the 	blood-pressure was 164/102. Even otherwise I am feeling fine.  	How can I forget the service I had from you? How can I reward it? 	How and why should a father reward a daughter? God will reward you. 	It will be reward enough if Pyarelal’s mind becomes quiet.

108,"April 	16, 1938",LETTER TO PYARELAL,"
        CHI. 	PYARELAL,         April 	16, 1938 
  	Now you may know the reason why I feel light at heart. If I want to 	act on your letter, who is there to stop me? But you should know my 	decision. Sushila’s pure love has showed me the way. For your sake 	she is starving herself. I was overawed when I learnt about it. 	There is no pretence, no outward show. I was terribly perturbed. If 	Sushila has to starve herself as she is doing, is my love so only in 	name or does it serve any purpose? Mother’s tears made me resolve 	that if Pyarelal’s life could be put on the rails then I  would  	be qualified to keep Sushila. If that does not happen, I would stand 	disqualified in my own eyes. If my non-violence is not capable of 	melting your heart, how would it help in winning swaraj? You have 	become part of me. If I cannot keep you, I am worthless. Mother’s 	words were not the words of an ignorant woman. Her candid words 	emanated from her great anguish. They went direct to my heart, and 	she was fully entitled to tell me all she did. When others hear such 	words of truth, it will only benefit them. Hence, at that time I 	lightened my heart by taking the decision that if Pyarelal cannot 	convince me of the justice of the step he wishes to take, he should 	give up his fast, whether complete or partial. If in his innermost 	heart he cannot be persuaded, he can by all means abide by his 	decision and then I will eat when he eats and starve when he 	starves. When he fasts I will fast too. If he should leave, my fast 	will commence from that very moment. This thought occurred to me 	after I heard about Sushila. I made my resolve after seeing Mother’s 	anguish. She will tell you everything on reaching home. God has 	willed otherwise. If you go from here, you will be breaking your 	vow. I cannot quietly sit at Segaon till the visit to the Frontier 	Province materializes. And (at Segaon), you should start nothing 	until I am settled there (Segaon).  	But this is making a mountain  out  of a  mole-hill.  A  new phase 	has begun for me. My love for you will be as much asfor swaraj. If 	the spark that Sushila has kindled is enough, God will grant me the 	strength to quietly adhere to my resolve.  	If you have become part of me, then your duty is clear. You must do 	as I say. By doing so, you will benefit yourself, me, Sushila and 	Mother, who is like a cow. Then all of us will strive together for 
 swaraj. The happiness and peace of many others like Mahadev, for instance depend on your peace of mind. If you can believe it, do this much in good faith. Nothing should be given up for fear that I may resort to fasting. Duty should never be forgotten. If you think that it is clearly your duty to go, who am I to stand in the way? If there is any room for the slightest doubt, give the benefit of it to me whom you have accepted as father.

 Second letter [On or after April 16, 1938]libtech_186_footnote
 CHI. PYARELAL,
 I had finished writing the enclosedlibtech_187_footnotelibtech_188_footnotewhen Sushila gave me your letter. You did not quite understand. What I had decided is mentioned in the enclosed letter. Even if deep down Sushila has any misgivings as to what may be good for her, she must submit to Mother’s love. But if she feels that it is to her good to be here she must remain firm and put up with Mother’s lamentations. I wanted to take back the letter today. In my opinion, from all points of view, Sushila’s good lies in being here. But even you may not agree on that point. I am not enamoured of medical degrees nor for that matter [education] in England. Those who learn do so after getting their degrees. But this is my position. I have written this to show how myviews about someone’s good can appear distorted and short-sighted. Hence if  there is any need for thinking, it has to be done only by Sushila.

 What you say is correct from the economic point of view; but I look at it, and I ought to look at it, as a purely political issue.libtech_190_footnoteWe cannot enter into any agreement with Lancashire which will bind us to buy their cloth. The argument that Lancashire cloth is bound to come here anyway is irrelevant.

 April 21, 1938 Today the students of the Vidyamandir have taken a solemn pledge. It is a momentous pledge. Its fulfilment would seem well-nigh
impossible. This pledge binds one to serve without a break for twenty-
 five years on a monthly salary of Rs. 15. The fact that more than five thousand applicationslibtech_197_footnotewere received is proof that  unemploment  in our country has reached the extreme limit. Some persons, while working for high ideals cannot get even dal and rice; many persons cannot obtain work to fill their bellies.libtech_198_footnoteIt is also proof of the glamour that surrounds Government employment. I know that people apply for constableships or teacherships in the hope of adding to their legal pay in illegal ways. I hope that no one of you entertains any such hope. I do not know that with all my patriotism I could bind myself to serve as a teacher for Rs. 15 per month. You must dismiss from your minds the thought that there may be profits left over in your schools to be divided amongst you. If, therefore, there is anyone among you who repents of the contract, you will ask the Minister to relieve you. I promise to plead for you. Having said this, I tender my congratu- lations to those who hold to their contract. I hope that God will give you strength to abide by your pledge.
 Yours is a self-sacrificing pledge. If you prove true to your pledge you will set a noble example before the world. If you do not succeed, both Ravishankar Shukla and I will be condemed by the world. So the weaklings had better withdraw now.
 This scheme is wholly Indian. Its ideal was born in Segaon. Real India is enshrined in the seven lakhs of villages, whose plight is even worse than Segaon’s. I want you to drive away illiteracy from these villages, find out means whereby villagers can obtain food and cloth- ing, and take the message of winning swaraj through truth and non- violence to the villages. This responsibility rests on you. It is your
 
 Hindustani Talimi Sangh.
 dharma to work with this ideal in view. I have presented my scheme after mature deliberation. If it fails, the teachers would be to blame. It is through handicrafts that instruction in geometry, history, geography and arithmetic will be given and an attempt will be made to meet the expenses of the school through the students’ manual labour.libtech_199_footnote
 You know that the scheme of this education has been drawn up in pursuance of the Congress programme. Now the Congress is pledged to win swaraj by non-violent and truthful means. Therefore the cultivation of these cardinal virtues is the foundation of the scheme. And if you do not show these in your daily contact with yourpupils and a character in keeping with them, you will fail and so will your school. You know what Hitler is doing in Germany. His creed is violence, of which he makes no secret. The other day we were told that the sword was their soul. The boys and girls there are taught the science of violence from the beginning. They are taught to hate the enemy even in their arithmetic, and you will find that the examples have been chosen with a view to inculcate the military spirit. If we endorse their creed, we must recognize the necessity of inculcating the spirit of violence from infancy. The same thing is happening in Italy. We must be honest even as they are honest. I have no doubt that if the scheme is worked with all its implications and becomes popular throughout India, a silent revolution will have taken place and swaraj will be a certainty.
 Herr Hitler is achieving his goal through the sword, I through soul. Cast off the cloak of foreign thoughts and ideals, identify yourselves with the villagers. The Western world is giving us destru- ctive knowledge; we want to impart constructive education through non-violence. May God give you the strength to reach your cherished goal and to fulfil the pledge which you have taken today.

121,"April 22, 1938",STATEMENT TO THE PRESS,"
    
 April 22, 1938
 I observe that the forthcoming interview between Shri Jinnah and myself is not only attracting very wide attention, but is also inducing high hopes in some. Then there are friends who gravely warn me against this visit and against building any hope on the interview. It is better, therefore, for me to take the public into my confidence and tell them why and how I am waiting upon Shri Jinnah on April 28.
 He has himself published my first letterlibtech_200_footnotelibtech_201_footnoteto him, showing my attitude on the question of communal unity, which is as dear to me as life itself. In that letter I clearly stated that all before me was darkness and that I was praying for light. If anything, the darkness  has deepened and the prayer become more intense. Add to this the fact that for causes some of which I know and some of which I do not, for the first time in my public and private life I seem to have lost self- confidence. I seem to have detected a flaw in me which is unworthy of  a votary of truth and ahimsa. I am going through a process of self- introspection, the results of which I cannot foresee. I find myself for the first time during the past 50 years in a Slough of Despond. I do not consider myself fit for negotiations or any such thing for the moment.
 There is no need for any speculation as to the cause of my despondency. It is purely internal. It comes from within. It must be now clear that, if I regarded the forthcoming interview as between two politicians, I should not entertain it in my present depression. But I approach it in no political spirit. I approach it in a prayerful and religious spirit, using the adjective in its broadest sense.
 My Hinduism is not sectarian. It includes all that I know to be best in Islam, Christianity, Buddhism and Zoroastrianism. I approach politics as everything else in a religious spirit. Truth is my religion and ahimsa is the only way of its realization. I have rejected once and for all the doctrine of the sword. The secret stabbings of innocent persons and the speeches I read in the papers are hardly the thing leading to peace or an honourable settlement.
 
 Again, I am not approaching the forthcoming interview in any representative capacity. I have purposely divested myself of any such. It there are to be any formal negotiations, they will be between the President of the Congress and the President of the Muslim League. I go as a lifelong worker in the cause of Hindu-Muslim unity. It has been my passion from early youth. I count some of the noblest of Muslims as my friends. I have a devout daughter of Islam as more than a daughter to me. She lives for that unity and would cheerfully die for it. I had the sonlibtech_202_footnoteof the late Muazzin of the Juma Masjid of Bombay as a staunch inmate of the Ashram. I have not met a nobler man. His morning  azanlibtech_203_footnotelibtech_204_footnotein the Ashram rings in my ears as I write these lines during midnight. It is for such  reasons  that  I  wait  on  Shri Jinnah.
 I may not leave a single stone unturned to achieve Hindu- Muslim  unity.  God  fulfils himself in strange ways. He may, in a manner least known to us, both fulfil himself through the interview and open a way to an honourable understanding between the two communities. It is in that hope that I am looking forward to the forthcoming talk. We are friends, not strangers. It does not matter to me that we see things from different angles of vision. I ask the public not to attach any exaggerated importance to the interview. But I ask all lovers of communal peace to pray that the God of truth and love may give us both the right spirit and the right word and use us for the good of the dumb millions of India.

 [Before  April  23, 1938]libtech_206_footnoteEveryone who cares to study what is happening at the present moment in our country can see that what we want can be attained if we
 will but achieve the  mantra  of peace, the creed of non-violence. You
 cannot breed peace out of  no-peace. The attempt is  like  gathering
 
 grapes of thorns or figs of thistles. The more I go into the question, the more forcibly the conclusion is borne in upon me that our first duty is to grasp this fundamental fact. There was a day when I used to flatter myself with the belief that I had mastered the key to learning that lesson. Today I am filled with doubt. I do not know that I have in me purification enough to realize true peace or non-violence. In that frame of mind I cannot think of any other thing, talk of any other thing. But whatever may be my condition, I have no doubt in my mind that there is no swaraj without non-violence, nothing that goes by the name of constructive work. Constructive work is a mild aspect of non-violence, but the true test of non-violence lies in acquiring the capacity to meet an innocent and unflinching death in the service of our cause. How to achieve it is the question. I want you to apply your minds to it.

123,,MARTIAL V. MORAL,"
    
 It is often forgotten that the Congress has only moral authority to back it. The ruling power has the martial, though it often dilutes the martial with the moral. This vital difference has come to the fore since the assumption of office by the Congress in seven provinces. This office-holding is either a step towards greater prestige or its total loss. If it is not to be a total loss, the ministers and the legislators have to be watchful of their own personal and public conduct. They have to be, like Caesar’s wife, above suspicion in  everything. They  may  not make private gains either for themselves or for their relatives  or friends. If the relatives or friends get any appointment, it must be only because they are the best among the candidates, and their market value is always greater than what they get under the Government. The ministers and the legislators of the Congress ticket have to be fearless in the performance of their duty. They must always be ready to risk the loss of their seats or offices. Offices and seats in the legislatures have no merit outside their ability to raise the prestige and power of the Congress. And since both depend wholly upon the possession of morals, both public and private, any moral lapse means a blow to the Congress. This is the necessary implication of non-violence. If the Congress non-violence is merely confined to abstention from causing physical hurt to the British officials and their dependants, such non- violence can never bring us independence. It is bound to be worsted
 in the final heat. Indeed we shall find it to be worthless, if  not positively harmful, long before the final heat is reached.
 There is considerable force in the argument of those who have conceived Congress non-violence in that narrow light when they say that it is a broken reed.
 If on the other hand non-violence, with all the implications, is the Congress policy, let every Congressman examine himself and reconstruct himself accordingly. Let him not wait  for  instructions from the Working Committee. After all the Working Committee can act only in so far as it interprets the public mind. And non-violence is not a quality to be evolved or expressed to order. It is an inward growth depending for sustenance upon intense individual effort.
 I have received several letters offering the writers’ names for enrolment as volunteers ready to immolate themselves at times of rioting and the like. To these writers I would suggest that they enlist co-workers themselves, form local corps, and begin training in accor- dance with the suggestion I have made. Let them not confine themselves merely to preparedness for emergencies, but for the daily walk of like in all its departments, personal, domestic, social, econo- mic, political, religious. Only thus will they find themselves more than ready for dealing with emergencies in their own localities or beats. They may not aim, except indirectly, at influencing events happening hundreds of miles away from their scene of activity. That ability will come, if the right beginning is made in the first instance.

Sir Mirza had 			been writing 			to me about 			developments, but 			I was 			loath to 			intervene unless I 			had heard 			from the State Congress.    	I must also admit that  my preoccupation  in  Bengal  would  have 	most probably prevented my doing anything even if you or any member 	had written to me. Today I had a full discussion with the friends 	above named. I feel that there has been some misunderstand-       
 ing or some haste on the part of overzealous workers. Thus I had clearly advised at Delang that the confining of membership of the Mysore State Congress only to primary members of the Indian National Congress was wholly wrong and that in effect it made the State Congress an Indian National Congress organization even though it might be unaffiliated. In my opinion that is contrary to the spirit of the Haripura  resolutionlibtech_223_footnotelibtech_224_footnoteon the subject and, what is more, calculated to defeat the end you have in view. And as Sir Mirza was in possession of my opinion, the action of the State Congress in spite of my advice was evidently the first cause of misunderstanding and the hoisting of the flag was evidently interpreted as a challenge to the State and the State Flag. I am quite clear in my mind that such was not the intention of the authors of the demonstration but we may not expect the State authorities to go behind our action and interpret it in terms of our intention expressed or implied. On the contrary they would infer intention from action. I, therefore, suggest that necessary change is immediately made in the State Congress constitution and an unequivocal declaration is made to the effect that the hoisting of the National Congress flag is in no way intended as a hostile demons- tration or insult to the State flag. If Mysore is an integral part of India, as it is, it should be equally proud of the All-India national flag as it must be of its own.
 It will also be necessary for you to make it clear that you will not hoist the national flag on ceremonial occasions where persons other than registered Congress members are admitted, unless you also at the same time hoist the Mysore flag. Remember, you are not in a state of rebellion against the Maharaja. So far as I understand you do not aim at the destruction of the Principality of Mysore. You aim at
 
 “In view of the different conditions prevailing in the States and the rest of India, the general policy of the Congress is often unsuited to the States and may result in preventing or hampering the natural growth of a freedom movement in a State. Such movements are likely to develop more rapidly and to have a broader basis, if they draw their strength from the people of the State, produce self-reliance in them, and are in tune with the conditions prevailing there, and do not rely on extraneous help and assistance or on the prestige of the Congress name. The Congress welcomes such movements, but, in the nature of things and under present conditions, the burden of carrying on the struggle for freedom must fall on the people of the States. The Congress will always extend its goodwill and support to such struggles carried on in a peaceful and legitimate manner, but that organizational help will inevitably be, under existing conditions, moral support and sympathy.”
 radical reforms. If such is the case, you may not ignore the Mysore flag on ceremonial occasions, if you have also the all-India flag.
 If, therefore, you could see your way to adopt my advice I should think that the State authorities will release the prisoners as they should. When the operating cause ceases there is no meaning in keeping political prisoners in jail. Please remember that satyagraha has to be full in thought, word and deed. If I have understood the situation correctly, I must confess that albeit entirely unconscious, from both truth and non-violence. Truth demanded the carrying out of what I had understood would be done and I had conveyed to Sir Mirza. I know it was open to the State Congress to reject my advice.
 But in that case I should have been told so that I would have informed Sir Mirza accordingly. There was a flavour of violence because any hasty or thoughtless action is a breach of non-violence. I am well aware that such meticulous observance of non-violence and truth is not to be expected from the rank and file. But then satyagraha cannot be launched by the rank and file. It has to be launched by responsible persons who are versed in the law of satyagraha.
 I understand there is to be a black-flag demonstration. It savours of violence. I hope if there has been any such idea, it will be abandoned.
 I need hardly say that my letter carries no authority save what it may possess on account of my supposed expert knowledge of satya- graha. You are at perfect liberty to reject the whole of my advice if it does not commend itself to you and other members of the State Congress.
 If you can get permission, you should see Siddhalingaiya and other prisoners and if it is at all possible arrive at a unanimous decision.libtech_225_footnote

 WARDHA,
 April  24, 1938libtech_227_footnoteWe have to make of this training school a school for winning freedom and for the solution of all our ills, of which the chief one is
our communal troubles. For this purpose we shall have to concentrate
 on non-violence. Hitler’s and Mussolini’s schools accept as their fundamental principle violence. Ours is non-violence according to the Congress. All our problems have therefore to be solved non-violently. Our arithmetic, our science, our history will have a non-violent approach, and the problems in these subjects will be coloured by non- violence. When Madame Halide Edib Hanum delivered her address to the Jamia Millia Islamia on Turkey I remarked that whereas generally history is a chronicle of kings and their wars, the future history will be the history of man.libtech_228_footnoteThat can be or is only non-violent. Then we shall have to concentrate not on city industries but on rural industries, that is to say, if we want to keep all the 700,000 of villages alive,and not only a fraction of them, we have to revive our village handicrafts. And you may be sure that if we can impart scholastic training through those crafts we can bring about a revolution. Our text-books will have also to be prepared with the same end.
 I want you to give your close consideration to what I am saying and reject what does not appeal to you. If what I say does not appeal to our Mussalman brethren, they may reject it summarily. The non- violence I want is not non-violence limited to the fight with the British but is to be applied to all our internal affairs and problems—true active non-violence from which will issue live Hindu-Muslim unity and not a unity based on mutual fear like the pact, for instance, between Hitler and Mussolini.
 When the New Education Scheme was launched I was full of self-confidence in which I now feel I am lacking. My words had power of which they seem to be bereft today. This lack of confidence is due not to things without but to things within. It is not that my senses are paralysed. My intellect gives me good work for my age.
 
 Nor is it that I have lost faith in non-violence. That faith is burning brighter than ever. But I have for the moment lost self-confidence. I would therefore ask you not to accept anything from me implicitly. Accept only what carries conviction to you. But I am sure that if we could conduct even two schools on the right lines I should dance with joy.

 April 29, 1938
 The appointment of Mr. Dain, a subordinate of the Orissa Government, to be the acting Governor threatens to precipitate a crisis of the first magnitude. The matter looked small on the surface. The fact that he is to retire after the termination of the acting appointment has been regarded as sufficient atonement for an admitted mistake. In my opinion it is no atonement. If he is reverted to his original permanent post, not only would there not be anything wrong but if the Ministers wanted to be churlish, they might take a secret delight in their quondam acting Governor becoming their subordinate. The whole of the sting lies in a subordinate official becoming an acting Governor of his Province with whom the Ministers are expected to work and almost daily submit documents for his signature and have him to preside at their meetings.
 It is incongruous and unbecoming and reduces autonomy to a farce. If this autonomy is real, and is to blossom forth into full freedom, nothing should be done by superior powers after the  previous style. Every one of their acts must conform to a rule or convention. It must not depend upon the caprice of the Governor- General or even the Secretary of state for India. Wherever the prestige of autocracy depended upon its exacting obedience, willing or unwilling, from the ruled, the prestige of the superior authority that has voluntarily divested itself of autocracy and conferred autonomy should consist in always carrying the majority party with it. There is no other way that I can think of for the healthy growth of autonomy and the avoidance of friction.
 The Viceroy and the Governors have bestowed unstinted praise upon all the Ministers of India. They have given no cause for the exercise of the more than ample powers reserved under the Govern- ment of India Act. The prestige of the majority party depends upon never sleeping over the rights of the people, never allowing a single error on the part of the superior authority to escape their vigilant eyes. Looked at in this light, the Congress, it seems to me, cannot allow the appointment to pass unchallenged.
I hear that the Orissa Ministry has threatened to resign as soon
 
 
 as Mr. Dain occupies the gubernatorial chair. I understand too that an interim Ministry will be appointed to carry on the Government. I suppose that as soon as the acting appointment is over and the Gover- nor returns from leave, by some arrangement the present Ministry will be reinstated. That won’t be fair play. The Congress will stultify itself to submit to any such arrangement. The governance of a province is not like a play of children. The Congress is discovering what a thankless task it is, how serious it is. The real Ministers, who represent the real majority of the Orissa legislators, cannot look unconcerned on the administration of their province passing into the hands of new irresponsible persons appointed at the will of the Governor or acting Governor as the case may be. I do hope, therefore, that the mistake will be undone before it is too late. There are many ways of doing it gracefully. But there must be a will before a graceful way is found. I hope it will be.libtech_246_footnote

143,"April 29, 1938",STATEMENT  TO  THE  PRESSlibtech_247_footnote,"
  
 April 29, 1938
 I enjoy the privilege of friendship with Sir Mirza Ismail. I know that he is anxious to liberalize the administration of Mysore. I have found him to be willing to listen to the advice and suggestions of friends. And I know  that  the  tragedylibtech_248_footnotewhich  has  been  enacted  in Mysore has filled him with distress.
 I have read the communique issued by the Mysore Government. It does not read convincing to me. But for the advice that I am about to tender, I do not need an accurate knowledge of all the facts surrounding the tragedy. Seeing that I receive pressing letters, depu- tations and wires from representative people of Mysore for guidance, and seeing that I know so many workers of Mysore who look to me
 
 for a solution of their difficulties, it would be wrong on my part at this critical juncture to content myself merely with sending letters or even telegrams of advice.
 One or two facts stand out prominently. There has been firing upon an unarmed crowd, resulting in several deaths and many more being injured. I will assume, though the information received by me on behalf of the public is to the contrary, that there was some provo- cation. We can never know with absolute certainty whether the firing was justified. There is no code which can give an exact definition of justification. It must always be a matter of opinion, and opinions always have a knack of varying.
 What I, therefore, venture to suggest to the Mysore Government is that they should not be satisfied with making an inquiry, however impartial it may be. The demonstration that is going on in Mysore about the national flag is a symptom of the time.
 I must confess that I was not aware of a popular awakening in Mysore on a wide scale, as there undoubtedly is. It gladdens me, as I hope it gladdens the Mysore authorities. I suggest, therefore, that the best and only remedy for the Maharaja and his Adviser, Sir Mirza Ismail, is to divest the Government of its autocracy and to make popular representatives responsible for the administration of Mysore. The responsibility must be on the broadest scale possible if it is to ensure peace in Mysore. It has been suggested that the state being backward, responsibility can only be a plant of slow growth. I have never subscribed to that doctrine. It is not a compliment to the States. One would expect them, with all the natural advantages in their favour, to show much greater progress than in unwieldy British India.
 To the leaders of the people of Mysore I will say:These tragic deaths and injuries inflicted upon innocent persons would be a small price paid for the liberty of the people. They may make an enquiry and the injured and the heirs to the deceased may receive compen- sation. But if I were a Mysorean, I would not lay stress on personal gains; I would use these sacrifices for gaining the liberty for which they had been made voluntarily or involuntarily. They should also remember that one condition of success is the retention of a truly non-violent spirit and atmosphere under every conceivable circumst- ance. I have been told that the people have been behaving with exemplary non-violence and that the crowd bravely suffered the
 firing. If that is proved to be the case, I for one will rejoice over the loss of life. It is the necessary price paid for gaining liberty.

PATELlibtech_249_footnote","
  
 April 29, 1938
 Sardar Vallabhbhai raised the question of the Lancashire Delegation coming out and asked Mahatmaji as to the lines on which the Congress is likely to approve of an agreement with U.K. Mahatmaji said that he could not see under  what  circumstances the Congress could be a party to agreeing to take cloth from Lancashire in return for cotton from India. He said that would be definitely against the whole creed of the Congress.
 Sardar Vallabhbhai pointed out that the Advisory Committee was appointed on a recommendation of the Assembly and the report of the Advisory Committee and the recommendation of the Government of India thereon were, without division, demanded by the Assembly to be put before them. He, therefore, inferred that the Congress party in the Assembly were committed to negotiations with Lancashire, and he said that it would not be right for the Congress to go back on it. Mahatmaji said that he was not a party to these requests and demands, but he said that as far as the Advisory Committee were concerned, he would say to them as under :
   The 		Advisory Committee may 		examine the 		trade pact from a purely 		economic point of view.

 ON  THE TRAIN  TO PESHAWAR,
 April  30, 1938
 MY DEAR JAWAHARLAL,
 Here, is a copy of the brief notes I have jotted down of the 3libtech_251_footnotelibtech_252_footnotehours’ talks with Jinnah. It may be that you and the other members may not like the basis. Personally I see no escape from it. My handi-
cap today is that I do not move about the country, as you do, and a
 still more serious handicap is the inner despondency that  has overtaken me. I am carrying on, but it is galling to me to think that I have lost the self-confidence that I possessed only a month ago. I hope that this is but a temporary phase in my life. I have mentioned this to help you to examine the proposals on their merits. I do not suppose the first will present any difficulty. The second is novel, with all its implications. You will not hesitate summarily to reject it if it does not commend itself to you. In this matter you will have to give the lead.
 I expect to return on the 11th. Subhas in reply to my telegram suggesting that he should open formal negotiations with Jinnah telegraphs that he will be in Bombay on the 10th. I wish that you could also go there early. I am writing to Maulana Saheb in the same strain sending him a copy of this letter.
Love.

 [April, 1938]libtech_253_footnote
 I had a fairly long talk with Pyarelal last evening. He has agreed to shoulder the responsibility for dealing with all the letters that you may entrust to him. What I said was that Pyarelal and Kanu should open the letters, arrange them, pass on to you those that are for you alone to deal with and advise you as to the disposal of the rest. He should not take upon himself the responsibility of tearing up the letters; he should just write on them ‘may be torn up’, ‘may be kept’, etc. Only when something like this is done can your burden be made lighter, enabling you to work the way I want you to work. I do not know to what extent you have been able to assimilate the idea of non-violence. I am anxious to know this because it is necessary. That will be only when you have a variety of problems to tackle. More and more occasions present themselves each day. What can be done about the case of fanatical Muslims? How can we cope with it? I do not have a ready answer. But it is a thing to which you should give thought. In regard to N. W. F. P. your responsibility is of course great.

 CHI. AMRITLAL,
 May you always remain a youth of eighteen or twenty-two. How could that be my condition? You don’t know passion, but I was a slave of passion for thirty years and tried to satisfy it. Moreover, I recently discovered that I have not been able to subdue it at all. I don’t remember having had an emission while awake at any time during the last fifty years. I am not referring here to the emission in dreams or those brought on by desire. But I was in such a wretched and pitiable condition that in spite of my utmost efforts I could not stop the discharge though I was  fully  awake.libtech_256_footnotelibtech_257_footnoteI  feel  now  that  the despondency that I had been feeling deep down in me only foresh adowed this occurrence. After the event, restlessness has become acute beyond words. Where am I, where is my place, and how can a person subject to passion represent non-violence and truth? This turmoil goes on in my heart. I keep asking myself:am I worthy of you all who follow me, am I fit to lead you all? God will answer the question when He pleases. Is it not said that Rama is the strength of the weak?
 There must be some place where you can settle down. We will think over the matter when I return. Think over what you would like to suggest.
 A wire was sent to Vijaya. Now let us await her reply. Mahadev will write about Surat.
 
 If you have in mind an indigenous machine, you needn’t ask anybody.

Your interpreting it as ‘natural’ is correct. All  vikaraslibtech_264_footnoteneed not be rejected. Even pitying a man is a 	vikara.

Of course vital fluid is discharged 	also when man and wife come together to procreate; but then it does 	not go waste. It may be a fall. The fall leads to new creation as a 	rise often does. It cannot be said that procreation is always 	harmful. Saying this would amount to finding fault with God.

 I have become a member of the Khyber Union without reading its constitution. It is the Pathan’s trick. Our people tremble at the mention of the Pathan’s name.
 Continuing, Mahatma Gandhi said that he had been unable to participate in active discussion for the last two or three years.
 I cannot speak standing. Even when I talk at length sitting, I get dizzy in the head. It is the Khan Brothers’ love of me that has brought me here.libtech_266_footnote
 It is well that you referred to the problem of Hindu-Muslim unity, and I would ask you to consider what you can do in furtherance of that great cause. There is no doubt that the work belongs essentially to you of the younger generation. We are now getting old and will soon be gathered to our fathers. You have therefore to shoulder the burden. How you can help in achieving the great object, you have yourselves shown in your address by your appreciative preference to non-violence and to Khan Saheb’s work. I do not know if your reference was deliberate and if you knew the full implication of what you were saying. I do hope you knew what you were saying and that you fully weighed your words. If you have, then I should like to take you a step further.
 After explaining the circumstances which had delayed  his visiting the Frontier, Mahatma Gandhi said that when it was  first known that he was to visit the Frontier people said that this man (Mahatma Gandhi) was going to make the people cowards. If non- violence means that, you should despise it.libtech_267_footnote
 An Urdu newspaper has said that my mission in the Frontier Province is the emasculation of the Pathans, Whereas  Khan  Saheb has invited me here in order that the Pathans might hear the message of non-violence from my own lips and in order that I might see the Khudai Khidmatgars at close quarters and find out to what extent
 
 
 non-violence has permeated them.libtech_268_footnotelibtech_269_footnoteThat means that the Khan Saheb at any rate has no such fear as has been expressed by that Urdu paper. For he knows that true non-violence is mightier than the mightiest violence. If therefore you really know the essential nature of non- violence and appreciate Khan Saheb’s work, you will have to pledge yourselves to non-violence, and that in spite of the fact that violence is so much in the air and we are talking day in and day out of military manoeuvres and aerial action, armaments and naval strength.  You have to realize that the power of unarmed non-violence is any day far superior to that of armed force. With me acceptance of non-violence was instinctive, it was part of my training and home influence in childhood. I have been preaching the creed of non-violence for 50 years.libtech_270_footnotelibtech_271_footnoteIts superior strength I came to realize in South Africa where I had to pit it against organized violence and racial prejudice. I  practised it in South Africa, where everybody, like the Pathans, is armed and the Government has introduced conscription.libtech_272_footnotelibtech_273_footnoteThe people said how a handful of Indians could fight the African Government with that weapon. I returned from South Africa with a clear conviction of the superiority of the method of non-violence to that of violence. In India also, we have used it for gaining our rights and we have achieved some measure of success.libtech_274_footnote
 If the method of violence takes plenty of training, the method of non-violence takes even more training, and that  training  is  much more difficult than the training for violence. The first essential of that training is a living faith in God. He who has a living faith in God will not do evil deeds with the name of God on his lips. He will not rely on the sword but will rely solely on God. Lakhs of Muslims  commit sins in the name of God and lakhs of Hindus who say “Rama” do likewise.libtech_275_footnotelibtech_276_footnoteA genuine believer in God need not have a stick in his hand. One who repeats God’s name and recites the kalmah may not be Allah’s devotee. He alone is a man of God who sees God in every soul. Such a man would not be prepared to kill another. But you may say that a coward may also pass off as a believer in God saying he
 
 does not use the sword. Cowardice is no sign of belief in God. The true man of God has the strength to use the sword, but will not use it knowing that every man is the image of God.
 Islam, it is said, believes in the brotherhood of man. But you will permit me to point out that it is not the brotherhood of Mussalmans only but it is universal brotherhood, and that brings me to the second essential of the training for non-violence. We must not believe in non- violence as a policy, but as an article of faith.libtech_277_footnotelibtech_278_footnoteThe Allah of Islam is the same as the God of Christians and the Ishwara of Hindus. Even as there are numerous names of God in Hinduism there are as many names of God in Islam. The names do not indicate individuality but attributes, and little man has tried in his humble way to describe the mighty God by giving Him attributes, though He is above  all  attributes, Indescribable, inconceivable, Immeasurable. Living faith in this God means acceptance of the brotherhood of mankind. It also means equal respect for all religions. If Islam is dear to you, Hindusim is dear to me and Christianity is dear to the Christians. It would be the height of intolerance—and intolerance is a species of violence—to believe that your religion is superior to other religions and that you would be justified in wanting others to change over to your faith.
 The third essential is the acceptance of truth and purity, for one claiming to have an active faith in God cannot but be pure and truth- ful.
 Now let me tell you that your appreciation of Khan Saheb’s services and of non-violence carries all these implications if the appreciation is genuine.
 If you want to preach non-violence in India and the world at large, you must accept my advice in the matter based on long ex- perience. If you forsake non-violence, you will have to forsake Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan. He cannot go a step without your assistance. God also helps through people by moving their hearts.  I  have travelled throughout the world and seen that people do not realize and appreciate the full implications of the non-violence creed. We have to defend India’s wealth with non-violence. Millions of our people will have to fully realize the implications of this creed. Non-violence is meant for all irrespective of faith.libtech_279_footnote
 
 As votaries of non-violence we will forget violence. If Islam is dear to you and Hindusim is dear to me, sheer logic will force you to the conclusion that we must have equal respect for each other’s religion.
 Those who claim to lead have to live up to all the implications and express them in their daily life. Now, you will not be the rank and file, but you will be leaders of your people. As generals of non- violence you need special training than ordinary people, who can at best be soldiers.libtech_280_footnoteYour non-violence will not be of the lunatic or the coward. It will be stronger than of one with the sword. If you can live up to the ideal, you may be sure that no one will have any excuse for saying that non-violence is going to emasculate you. Yours will be the non-violence of the bravest.

 Mahatma Gandhi replied that the Socialists believing in the Congress creed could not be excluded from the Congress on account of their socialistic ideas. Gandhiji is reported to have pointed out that Pandit Nehru and Mr. Subhas Chandra Bose were Socialists. So long as the Socialists accepted the Congress creed and carried out the Congress programme he could not see there was any objection to their being admitted into the Congress organization. This, however, was his interpretation of the existing Congress practice. Whether different courses were warranted under particular local conditions in the Frontier Province, he was unable to say.

 Replying to the address in Hindustani, Mahama Gandhi said that his heart rebelled against speaking in English for the sake of a few Englishmen in the audi- ence. He took strong exception to addresses being presented in English when he could well read Urdu and, if he felt any difficulty anywhere, he could consult Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan. Continuing, Gandhiji said:libtech_283_footnote
 Your address is one  paean  of  praise  of me. Well,  I  have never found it easy to appropriate such praise, but let me tell you that there was no time in my life when I was less able to appropriate such praise than I am today. For a curious sense of despondency has possessed me and I cannot yet get over it. Well, I came here not to make a speech, and I was told that I need not give more than five minutes. But a sentence in your  addresslibtech_284_footnotelibtech_285_footnotecompels me to devote a few minutes more than I had anticipated. The sentence about non-violent passive resistance at once took my memory back to Germiston in South Africa in  1907libtech_286_footnotelibtech_287_footnote. A meeting of European friends was convened to hear me speak on passive resistance, as the movement was then known. The Chairman of the meeting there expressed practically the same statement as you have made in the address, viz., that passive resistance was a weapon of the weak. The reference jarred on  me  and  I  immediately  corrected  the  speaker.  It  is   curious,   if   not also surprising, that you should have made the same  mistake  after  all these years of satyagraha in India. We may be weak and oppressed, but non-violence in not a weapon of the weak.libtech_288_footnotelibtech_289_footnoteIt is a wea- pon of strongest and the bravest. Non-violence has greaterpower than Hitler’s or Mussolini’s force.libtech_290_footnoteViolence may well be the weapon of
 
 the weak and the oppressed. Being strangers to non-violence nothing else is open to them. It is, however, true that passive resistance has been regarded as a weapon of the weak. That was why the name ‘satyagraha’ was coined in South Africa to distinguish the movement there from passive resistance.
 Passive resistance is a negative thing, and has nothing to do with the active principle of Love. Satyagraha proceeds on the active principle of Love which says, ‘Love those that despitefully use you. It is easy for you to love your friends. But I say unto you, love your enemies.’libtech_291_footnotelibtech_292_footnoteIf  satyagraha  was  a  weapon  of  the  weak,  I   should   be deceiving Khan Saheb, for no Pathan has yet confessed his weakness. It was Khan Saheb who told me that he never felt so strong and brave as when he, out of a free will, renounced the lathi and the rifle. If it was not the Supreme weapon of the brave, I should certainly have hesitated to place it before a brave community like the Pathans. It is with that weapon that Khan Saheb can bid fair to befriend and convert the brave Afridis and the other tribesmen. You know the Afridi does not fear death.libtech_293_footnotelibtech_294_footnoteI have to make him braver, not a weakling. Otherwise Khan Saheb will despise me.
 I am glad to have had this opportunity of correcting you. For the moment you realize it, you will enlist yourself as workers in the cause for which Khan Saheb and I are working. That it is difficult to carry conviction I agree. I find it difficult in spite of my conscious practice of it for the last 50 years. But it presupposes purity of the highest type. Infinite patience is required—even the patience of emptying the ocean with a blade of grass. If we want complete independence for India, it can be through non-violence alone.libtech_295_footnote

  	I really wanted to make the acquaintance of those of whom I had 	heard so much. I wanted to see with my own eyes how the Khudai        
 Khidmatgars live, move and work. The Khan Saheb was also keen that  I must see all these and testify to what extent they had assimilated non-violence. That examination I am afraid cannot be carried on during this brief tour. But let me tell you that my desire to live in your midst has increased. To-night I am thankful that I have been able even to come to Utmanzai and Charsadda and to see you all. Khan Saheb and Dr. Khan Saheb I had seen much of even in Wardha, but I wanted to see you and make your acquaintance. A great responsibility rests on your and Khan Saheb’s shoulders. You have deliberately chosen a name that carries mighty implications. You might have called yourselves Servants of the people, or of the Pathans, or of Islam; but you chose instead the name Khudai Khidmatgars—Servants of God, i.e., Servants of humanity which includes, Hindus, Mussalmans, Chris- tians [of the] Punjab, Gujarat and other parts of India, and also other parts of the world. This very ambitious title implies the acceptance of non-violence. How can a man in the name of God serve humanity by means of the sword? It can be only done by means of a force that God has given us and which is superior to any other force that we can think of. If you do not understand this, you may be sure that the world will laugh at the Khan Saheb and me as vain hypocrites. Whilst therefore I am delighted at the sight of the Khudai Khidmatgars, I am also seized with a kind of fright. Many people have warned me against you, but that warning does not matter if you are true to your creed. Remember that you outnumber volunteers in the whole of India, and that you are more disciplined than volunteers in other parts of India. But unless the discipline is rooted in non-violence the discipline might prove a source of infinite mischief. I have rarely in my tours seen more orderly and quieter meetings. I congratulate you and expressmy gratefulness for all the affection you have showered on me. I shall conclude with the prayer that the Frontier Pathans may make not only India free, but teach the world, through an India made non-violently free, the priceless lesson of non-violence.libtech_298_footnote

  	If what you have told me is a solemn promise, and if you can keep 	it, you may be sure that we will win not only the freedom of India 	but something more. When we can be ready to sacrifice any number of 	men in the cause of non-violence, we can easily bid fair to be 	spared the ghastly spectre of war that is now threatening Europe. We 	talk of doing everything in the name of God. We call ourselves 	Khudai Khidmatgars, we profess to have given up the sword, and yet 	if we have not put the sword and the dagger out of our hearts, we 	are sure to be disgraced and the name ‘Khudai Khidmatgar’ will 	be a term of reproach.      
 I have not yet recovered from the shock of the storylibtech_303_footnotelibtech_304_footnoteI  heard this afternoon. The Sikhs from Mayar told me of the tragedy that happened there in broad daylight. So far as I know the victims had done nothing to provoke the ire of the assassins. The assassins did the deed in broad daylight and bolted away without anyone trying to apprehend them. It is worth pondering over how such a thing could happen when we are all talking of non-violence. There were in the village Khudai Khidmatgars and others believing in the creed of non- violence. It was their duty to catch the culprits. It is their duty to prevent the recurrence of the deed. It is also your duty to befriend the bereaved and to assure the fear-stricken of your sympathy and succour. So long as things of this kind countinue to happen in our midst, our non-violence must be in doubt.

SPEECH AT KALUKHAN libtech_305_footnote","
 May 7, 1938libtech_306_footnote
 Your address is made up of two parts—one devoted to my praise and the other to non-violence. The first part may be ignored for I am sure that that is going to do good to nobody. In fact I am quite sure that if someone offered to sing my praises for twenty-four hours, he would get tired and I should fall fast asleep. What God may have enabled me to do is but a repayment of debt, and he who repays a debt deserves no praise. In fact if he fails to do so, he may be liable to prosecution.
 What interests me more is what you have said about non- violence. Let me tell you that I should not have been able to sum up better the characteristics of a non-violent man. But let me tell you what you have not said in your address, and that is the implications of non-violence. You must  have   heard of the riotslibtech_307_footnoteI n  Allahabad and
 
 
 Lucknow. These would be impossible if there was really non-violence amongst us. There are thousands of members on the  Congress  register. If they were really non-violent, these riots would not have occurred. But we not only failed to prevent them, but even sought the aid of the military and the police to quell them. Some of our Con- gressmen argued with me that our non-violence was limited to our dealings with the Englishmen. Then I say that non-violence was not the weapon of the strong, but of the weak. Active non-violence of the brave puts to flight thieves, dacoits, murderers, and prepares an army of volunteers ready to sacrifice themselves in quelling riots, in extin- guishing fires and feuds, and so on. you have said that non- violence automatically solves unemployment. You are right, for it rules out exploitation. The non-violent man automatically becomes a servant of God. He should be ready to render account to God of every minute of his time. May you all be true servants of God and true practisers of non-violence.

 I  hope  you  got  my  letterlibtech_308_footnotein  reply   to   yours   on   my   bitter experience. My search still continues. It gives me joy. I rejoice in the pain that sometimes accompanies the labour. God who has never for- saken me is not going to do so now. I am therefore indifferent what comes out of the search. But you must continue to warn me so long as you think that I go astray in action.
 Your brother-in-law’s letter is very fine. Evidently your sister was a very superior woman—a rare type. I can understand your grief over such a loss. But such losses are a test of our faith. Nothing but a fixed faith that death for the good is a translation to a better state, and for the evil a beneficent escape, can reconcile us to the mystery of death.

 May  8, 1938
 In all your three addresseslibtech_310_footnoteyou have told me that you made a triumphant  and  unique  demonstration  of  non-violence  during   the
   D. 		campaign, but 		I have 		to find 		out whether 		you have 		assimilated non-violence 		with all 		its implications. The 		principal purpose 		of my 		visit was 		to find 		out whether 		all that 		I had 		heard from the 		Khan Saheb 		about the 		Khudai Khidmatgars 		was true, 		and I 		am very 		sorry that 		I could 		not give all the time 		that was needed in 		order to 		find out the 		truth. One 		conviction I 		am carrying 		back with me, viz., 		the wonderful 		and affectionate 		allegiance of the 		people to 		the Khan 		Saheb as their 		general. Not 		only the 		Khudai Khidmatgars 		but I 		noticed wherever 		I went 		that every man, woman and 		child knew him 		and loved him. They 		greeted him 		most familiarly. 		His touch 		seemed to soothe 		them. And Khan 		Saheb was most gentle 		to whoever approached 		him. The 		obedience of 		the Khudai 		Khidmatgars was 		unquestioned. All 		this has filled 		me with 		boundless joy.  
 A general merits such obedience. Khan Saheb has it by right of love unlike the ordinary general who exacts obedience through fear. The question now is what use will Khan Saheb make of the tremen- dous power of which he finds himself in possession? I cannot answer the question now. Nor can the Khan Saheb. Hence it is that, if God wills it, I should like to revisit this wonderful Province about October, make a prolonged stay and study in detail the working of non- violence.

INTERVIEW TO A PROFESSOR libtech_311_footnote","
 PESHAWAR,
 [Before  May  9, 1938]libtech_312_footnote
 A professor of Islamia College came with a question that was troubling him and is troubling many of the present generation—belief in God. What was the basis
 
 of his belief if Gandhiji had it, as he knew he had it? What was his experience?
 [GANDHIJI:] It can never be a matter for argument. If you would have me convince others by argument I am floored. But I can tell you this that I am surer of His existence than of the fact that you and I are sitting in this room. Then I can also testify that I may live without air and water but not without Him. You may pluck out my eyes, but that cannot kill me. You may chop off my nose, but that will not kill me. But blast my belief in God and I am dead. You may call this a superstition, but I confess it is a superstition that I hug, even as I used to hug the name of Rama in my childhood when there was any cause of danger or alarm. That was what an old nurse had taught me.libtech_313_footnote
 But you think that superstition was necessary for you?
Yes, necessary to sustain me.
 That is all right. May I now ask if you had anything like a prophetic vision?
 I do not know what you call a vision and what you will call prophetic. But let me give you an experience in my life. When I announcedlibtech_314_footnotelibtech_315_footnotemy fast of 21 days in jail I had not reasoned about it. On retiring to bed the previous night I had no notion that I was going to announce the next morning a fast of 21 days. But in the middle of the night a Voice woke me up and said: ‘Go through a fast.’ ‘How many?’ I asked. ‘21 days,’ was the answer. Now let me tell you that my mind was unprepared for it, disinclined for it. But the thing came to me as clearly as anything could be. Let me tell you one thing more and I have done. Whatever striking things I have done in life I have not done prompted by reason but prompted by the instinct, I would say God. Take the Dandi Salt March of 1930. I had not the ghost of a suspicion how the breach of Salt Law would work itself out. Pandit Motilalji and other friends were fretting and did not know what I would do; and I could tell them nothing, as I myself knew nothing about it. But like a flash it came, and as you know it was enough to shake the country from one end to the other. One last thing. Until the last day I knew nothing about announcing the 6th of April 1919 as a day of fasting and prayer. But I dreamt about it—there was no Voice or Vision as in 1930—and I felt it was just the thing to do. In the morning I shared it with C.R. and announced it to the country, you know with what a wonderfully spontaneous response.libtech_316_footnote

PESHAWAR,
  [Before 	 May  9, 	1938]libtech_318_footnote[PROFESSOR:] 	How is it that many of 	the English Pacifists are talking of defence and elaborate plans of 	defence?. . . May it not be possible to carry pacifism too far? Supposing 	Abyssinia had simply non-resisted and said to Italy, ‘Do your 	worst’, would the Italians have been ashamed and desisted from 	their design?  Lansbury 	said they would.  	[GANDHIJI:] I shall take 	up the Abyssinian question first. I can answer it only in terms of 	active resistant non-violence. Now non- violence is the activest 	force on earth, and it is my conviction that it never fails. But if 	the Abyssinians had adopted the attitude of non- violence of the 	strong, i.e, the non-violence which breaks to pieces but never 	bends, Mussolini would have had no interest in Abyssinia. Thus if 	they had simply said: ‘You are welcome to reduce us to dust or 	ashes but you will not find one Abyssinian ready to co-operate with 	you’, what would Mussolini have done? He did not want a desert. 	Mussolini wanted submission and not defiance, and if he had met with 	the quiet, dignified and non-violent defiance that I have described, 	he would certainly have been obliged to retire. Of course it is open 	to anyone to say that human nature has not been known to rise to 	such heights. But if we have made unexpected progress in  physical 	sciences, why may we do less in the science of the soul?  	Now about the English Pacifists. I know there are some great and 	sincere men amongst them, but they are thinking in terms of pacifism 	as distinguished from unadulterated non-violence. I am essentially a 	non-violent man, and I believe in war bereft of every trace of 	violence. An essentially non-violent man does not calculate the 	consequences. The English Pacifists you are talking of calculate, 	and when they speak of pacifism they do so with the mental 	reservation that when pacifism fails, arms might be used. With them 	not non-violence but arms are the ultimate sanction, as was the case 	with Woodrow Wilson’s Fourteen Pointslibtech_319_footnotelibtech_320_footnote. No, someone has to arise in      
 England with the living faith to say that England, whatever happens, shall not use arms. They are a nation fully armed, and if they having the power deliberately refuse to use arms, theirs will be the first  example of Christianity in active practice on a mass scale. That will be a real miracle.

            CHI. 	SUSHILA,        BOMBAY,  May 	10, 1938 
  	I had been awaiting your letter. I had it yesterday. I found nothing 	in it that would do any harm if Mahadev read it. Mahadev read all 	the letters. What was there in it to add fuel to the fire?  	Stupid girl! You are indeed stupid. For that reason I love you all 	the more. Your obstinacy does not hurt me. I will not let you remain 	stupid forever. You are not a goddess, nor is Mahadev a god. The 	future is bright if this illusion has been dispelled. I consider 	both of you simple-hearted. The only difference is that you have not 	expe- rienced lust. Mahadev has done so in full measure. He is a 	married man after all. But the god of love is subtle. You were both 	unaware of his attack. You needlessly blame yourself. Desire had 	certainly taken possession of you. But you were not aware of it at 	all. For that matter even Mahadev was not aware of it. Mahadev was 	not careful. But he was not aware even of that.  	Neither you nor Mahadev has given me any unhappiness. So long as 	your reason does not accept something, you must never accept it, 	however much it may hurt me or anybody else.  	My advice is that you should now forget the past, and remaining 	cheerful by doing your present duty, free my mind from anxiety. Let 	me know your programme.  	Dr. Gilder was here. The blood-pressure was 180/108. The climate is 	lovely. We expect to go to Wardha from here on the 17th.  	I return your letter to Mahadev. I shall tear up the remaining 	letters. There is a churning going on in my heart. I am happy. God 
 alone knows what the outcome will be. Massages, etc., have been stopped. I bathe alone.

Courtesy : Dr. Sushila Nayyar       NEW DELHI,  May 	 10, 1938  The 	Associated Press sought the opinion of Mahatma Gandhi regarding the 	terms of the settlement arrived at between the Mysore Government and 	the Mysore Congress over the flag trouble,libtech_323_footnoteannounced by Sardar 	Vallabhbhai Patel, when he arrived here this morning by the Frontier 	Mail on his way to Bombay.  Mahatma 	Gandhi said that he fully concurred with the terms of the settlement 	as he thought that it was the proper decision in the circumstances. 	When he was told that some Socialists objected to Sardar Patel’s 	decision to allow the State flag to be hoisted by the side of the 	Congess flag, Mahatma Gandhi said that their objection was 	nevertheless not without reason; because they wanted to abolish the 	States, which was only possible by armed revolution to which creed 	he did not subscribe.  When 	questioned as to what should be the attitude of the general public 	towards the Congress flag and the Red (Socialist) flag in the case 	of the Congress sponsoring the labour cause in a strike, Gandhiji 	thought that with him the only flag that counted was the Congress 	flag. A labour union which had faith in the Congress should, in all 	circumstances, work under the Congress flag. If there were many 	flags, he feared that a clash was bound to occur.  
 Regarding the release of the Delhi political prisoners, Mahatma Gandhi said that the question of their release was before him. He would do his utmost to secure it, but at the moment he could not say as to when he would take up the matter.

  NOTE TO D. B. 	KALELKARlibtech_325_footnote 
 [Before  May  14, 1938]libtech_326_footnoteMy silence should not in any case stand between us. I have nothing to say about Nanavati. I only wanted to know all that might
be said about him. I have organized myself in such a way that his or
 anyone else’s going will not inconvenience me. It is not necessary for Nanavati to stay here whenever I am here. When he serves you I consider it as service to me. Nanavati is staying here to know what village life is and to find out what part he can play in it. He is mainly useful as a musician and when everyone leaves Segaon he would stay on and die here. It is quite difficult to explain the usefulness of such a man. But it is enough if, even while staying with you, he remembers that he has to pass his life in Segaon. In this way he can retain his self- respect and keep his word too. So I think it is his dharma to go from here so long as you need him. But if deep down in his heart he has lost interest in Segaon, he should unhesitatingly take his mind off Segaon. His aim in life would then be to follow in your footsteps and take up Hindi. This is the proper age for him to fix his aim. I have very little use for him when I am in Segaon because for the most part Kanu takes up the responsibility for music. At present his main job in Segaon is to propagate weaving and to think of and experiment on village sanitation. These two tasks are very important. The result may not be visible today but eventually it will grow into a big tree. This aspect may however be ignored for the present. It is good I am observing silence, so that you can ponder over this note. Yet if you want to discuss something I am prepared to talk. Today’s silence leaves room for such violations.

184,"May 	14, 1938",LETTER TO PYARELAL,"
           CHI. 	PYARELAL,        JUHU  May 	14, 1938 
  	I have received your letters. I have had Mahadev read them all. You 	will learn more from Sushila’s letter. It is a good thing for me 	that Sushila seems to be coming out of her stupor. A great burden 	will be off my mind if she returns to her original self and devotes 	herself to whatever she considers her duty.  	After I had written the above, I got another letter from you. I can 	bear this distance because you are with Sushila. I would not have 	been able to stand it had she been alone in Delhi. I have compared 	her to a tender plant and the comparison is very apt. It was not in 	the least difficult for me to understand the purpose of Sushila’s 	letter. I have never believed that she would deliberately resort to 	a lie in speech or action. Sushila acted as if in a stupor. With the 	exception of going to the toilet, every action of hers was in my 	view a lie. Once we accept the state of stupor, it is unnecessary to 	impute to her any other fault. The incident of that night only 	supports this contention. It has no other relevance.  	Sushila is unnecessarily being angry with herself. There will be no 	time to write separately to her about it. Plead with her on my 	behalf and console her. Is she cheerful? Does she laugh? If she does 
 not laugh, how can she be stupid? If she accepts the adjective I have used for her, she must forget her unhappiness and prove her stupidity. Do not the foolish and the wise have some common characteristics?
 If your understanding of [the incidents of] the 14th in day- time and of the 9th night is different, what is there in it  to  make  you shudder or render you unhappy? Am I omniscient? My under- standing has not always been correct. And on this occasion, I see myself distressed and senile; so what wonder if I act like a jaundiced man who sees everything yellow? Hence, have no fear about my being firm. Right now, I am beginning to give more importance to the view of the other party rather than to my own.Please therefore let me know your interpretation in clear terms and without any fear. If I find it acceptable, it will not take me long to change my view.
 When would you prepare rotis for me? Sushila is  confused. Only you can show her the straight path. Take whatever time is necessary to do that.
     [PS.]         I hope to leave here 	for Wardha on the 17th.  Blessings 	form  BAPU

         BOMBAY, 
     DEAR 	KHWAJA SAHEB,  May 	15, 1938 
  	I thank you for your letterlibtech_327_footnotelibtech_328_footnoteof 	the 11th instant received yester- day. I showed it today to Subhas 	Babu. I must confess that it does not satisfy my expectations. At 	the same time, I fully recognize the  labours given to the question 	by the Government. I can also appre- ciate their extreme caution. I 	am not, therefore, going to come to any hasty decision. But before I 	can examine the  implications  of  the policy adumbrated in your 	letter, I should like to know the number of prisoners that will 	still remain to be dealt with after the operation of the first three 	clauses. And before I can come to any conclusion, it will be 	absolutely necesary for me to know how the prisoners will respond to 	the propositions laid down by the Government.  	I can well understand from your standpoint that such a pro- cedure 	may not be countenanced. But I am bound by a moral pro- mise given 	to the prisoners and in pursuance thereof, if the whole programme is 	to work smoothly, it is necesary for me to know their mind. It would 	be a breach of promise on my part if I submitted without demur to 	anything less than almost immediate and un- conditional discharge.  	I am sure you will not ask me for this purpose to travel to 	Calcutta. I would, therefore, ask you kindly to grant permission 	either to Subhas Babu or to Sarat Babu to see the prisoners as my 	deputies.  	Of course, your request for secrecy will be strictly respected. 	Subhas Babu has  not  seen   this  letter.   He  is  engaged  in  	the  	Working Committee meeting away from where I am staying, but if he was 	here, I am sure he would share the views expressed herein.  Yours sincerely,  M.  K.

  	You will have received my letter of yesterday. Mahadev has been 	terribly hurt by your letter. He has been crying. He had already 	been anguished and given to crying. Your letter has added to his 	agony. However, it is just as well that you have expressed through 	this letter whatever was weighting on your mind. That is the only 	way to regain mental composure and to be cleansed of the kind of 	suspicions and prejudices lurking there. Mahadev has not written the 	letter “under pressure from me” as a last resort. Yes, the 	letter was the result of his discussion with me. But it was not 	written under pressure. His pen moved because he felt that his 	writing the letter would be justified. All arguments were his own.  	Mahadev wrote to you on his own and the letter was full of anguish. 	That is why I did not allow it to go. It would have only intensified 	the misery and there would have been more misunder- standing. Now he 	has decided to stop writing to both of you for the time being. I 	have approved of this decision. You and Sushila may write if you 	feel like doing so. You can even write if the absence of Mahadev’s 	letters irks you. Mahadev had told Sushila that he would write [to 	her] about my health. But for thetime being even that has been 	stopped. In any case, I would be writing almost every  day. Hence, 	you would continue to get the news. This should not lead to the 	conclusion that I have suggested to Mahadev not to write to you, 	since the idea was Mahadev’s. I have given it my approval for the 	time being. The past, except when it is essential for the present, 	needs to be forgotten. I wish to discuss the past only to be certain 	that I have not done any injustice either to Mahadev or to Sushila. 	No one has deliberately committed mistakes. That is sufficient 	consolation for me. It should be so for Mahadev and Sushila as well. 	Where there was no wrong at all, I saw wrong and insisted that all 	of you should also see it. I wish I had not committed such a grave 	sin. You can be of great help in my quest to find out. Do not 	conceal the truth from me by showing me undeserved pity. Of course I 	know that you will not stay on there a 
 moment longer than necessary and I am not therefore impatient. My blood-pressure is not checked every day. What daily news then can I give about my health? My own diagnosis says that my health is fine. I sleep well. I take my walks regularly. I eat well. Perhaps mangoes are  a little difficult to digest. I do a fairly good amount of work. It does not show any adverse effect. I lie down in the bath-tub. I get sleep. My legs are massaged. My head and feet are massaged with ghee. A[mtus] S[alaam] gives me nourishment. She prepares rotis with her own hands. She is quite successful.
 Kanti and Saraswati are here. Manilal and Sushila have arrived today.
 There is a letter from Nazimuddin. I cannot say it is wholly satisfactory. I shall see what I have to do.

  	There was no letter from you yesterday. It would be good if you did 	not keep me without letters these days. I am now putting out of my 	mind the distress of Mahadev and Sushila. It should now be 	considered entirely a matter of the past. I am sending today by 	book-post three letters from Mirabehn. Both you brother and sister 
 may peruse the letters and let me know your reaction. Is not Mirabehn’s description similar to that of Ravana’s  palace  by Tulsidas? Ravana is lying unconscious and his numerous queens are reclining around him in various states of undress. I laughed and cried when I read it. How could I have been affected in that way ? Disregarding Mirabehn’s exaggeration, I was affected by what remained in the letter and I wrote that I would change my practice. What if the suffering witnessed on the 14th was the result of those physical contacts? So far I have not found any clear evidence to conclude that it could not have been so. Then have all these women become impure by my touch ? If that is so, have I been like that from the beginning. In that case, is the peace that some women and young men are supposed to have found by being close to me a delusion ? If that is the case, do I have a place in the world? Who am I to find fault with Mahadev and Sushila? Who can say that I may not be thrusting my own faults on them? What have you all gained from me? Is it only disappointment? Would it be proper for me to guide you? Such thoughts pass through my mind. I am maintaining my calm in the midst of this turmoil. My attention is centred on you. If you remain composed then I may regain my self-confidence. Your action will help me only if it is natural. Or, if I find that whatever steps you take express your sense of duty, then too I shall feel at ease. This means that I have found the guru that I have’ been looking for. I shall consider myself fortunate if that happens. It is my belief that suchshould be the result of my training. I shall attain glory only if those who are my heirs have reached higher than I. Right now I see you, Mahadev, Sushila, etc., as occupying a loftier place. This does not mean that now I cannot guide you in any matter at all. But it does mean that if the experience of the 14th is indicative of my generally diseased mind, the situation in which all of you sustained yourselves would have reduced me to bits!
I shall not elaborate further.
 If possible, decide about the time of your coming. After you receive this letter, write to me at the Wardha address.
 Today’s post has not yet arrived. I expect to hear that Sushila has regained her calm.

 If you take it with a smile the pain will be lessened. Of course if you wish to make me cry you may wear the long face. I cannot put up with your looking sullen. Is not one Pyarelal enough?
 If you have read Mahadev’s letter to me you will know that I have told Leela nothing. I have told nothing to anyone. I told only Mirabehn that I had conveyed her complaint to both of you. What is your fault after all? I am at fault in having accused a young man likeMahadev and a pure girl like you. Is this not all that I can tell anyone? Why should you make me more unhappy by being unhappy about it? If you can bear with me, keep a cheerful face and absorb yourself in service. If there is even a little purity and love in me, Pyarelal will be saved and with him both of us will be saved too. Otherwise, both of us will be ruined.
 Keep this letter with you. I am afraid of somebody reading it if it is left with me. Ultimately it has to be destroyed.

 STUPID DAUGHTER,
 You have been proving your stupidity in every letter. Yes, I did say that if you were tired of Segaon then I had not been entitled to receive service from you. This could not in any way imply that you should not come to me. It did imply that you should hasten your return. If your mind cannot grasp such a simple thing, ask me again. In this context let me describe to you my condition. These two days have not passed well. Yesterday I worked for 12 hours. I was mentally exhausted. I had a terrible backache. I slept well. I was alert again. But the mental condition is not good. In such a situation I do feel your absence. But how can I send for you, how can I ask you to come so long as you do not feel drawn to this place? Would I have been able to work so much if you had been near me? Now do you understand what  I want? But this certainly does not mean that you should come here at once under any circumstances.
 Now your second question. I accept your version of what happ- ened on the 9th night. There is no question of your account being incorrect. Those who see silver in a sea-shell are right at all times. But he who knows a sea-shell will see it only as a sea-shell, will he not? Oh, the things that sexual impulse makes us do! This does not even mean that I am in the right and what you thought was merely imagination. Believe me, I admit I may have been a prey to illusion; so you can stick to your own position. Indeed it is your duty to do so. Ponder that verse in the Bhajanavali. Only that is dharma which is followed by the learned and practised by the saintly and by peoplefree from attachment and hatred, and which your heart accepts as dharma. What the learned, the saintly and people free from attachment, etc., believe can never be acceptable to us if our heart does not accept it. I am neither a learned man, nor a saint; nor am I free from attachment, etc.  I have only appointed myself your godfather. The words of such a man must be rejected unless your heart and mind accept them. Whatever you do, your position with me will always remain the same. In no way have you fallen in my estimation.
Yes, a man’s words should be taken at their face value. But even
 so, one must consider their context. That is to say, while it is necessary to exercise discretion, we must take it that if the reasons which dictate avoidance of physical contact are applicable to any other behaviour or gestures, such gestures, too must be avoided. So much for the literal interpretation. But even this much is not sufficient. To know the meaning of words it is also necessary to know their deeper signifi- cance. When you recite the Gita every day, you know the literal meaning of the words. But so long as you do not understand their deeper significance, going by the literal meaning of the words would be futile and burdensome. Does this fully answer your letter?
 We shall probably leave here on the 20th. I have torn up your letter. Mahadev does not read your letters these days. He sees what I write. He continues to be miserable. That is in his nature. Time will do its work. Is not Kaalalibtech_336_footnoteone of the names for God?

 [May  18, 1938]libtech_338_footnote
 The Working Committee has read the popular and official versions of the recent firing that took place near Vidhuraswatham in Mysore on an unarmed crowd. The Committee deplores the fact that the State authorities felt called upon to resort to firing. On seeing that the Mysore government has appointed a tribunal to inquire into the causes that led to the firing, the Working Committee refrains from expressing any opinion on the tragedy. But the Working Committee thinks that H.H. the Maharaja should establish responsible govern- ment in his State so that the responsibility for law and order including firing, whenever it is deemed necessary, will be shouldered by a government answerable to the people.

It should further be borne in mind that though there is a growing party among Congressmen who seeks the total abolition of States as a relic of the Middle Ages, the policy of the Congress as a whole has hitherto been and remains one of friendliness to the States in the hope that they will recognize the signs of the times and establish

 BOMBAY,
 May  20, 1938
 Sardar Prithvi Singh, who has been just taken in custody by the collector of Bombay Suburban District, is a life-sentence prisoner in connection with what is known as the first Lahore Conspiracy Case of 1915. He served part of the sentence in the Andamans, and when as a result of public agitation that criminal settlement was closed, Sardar Prithvi Singh was transferred to Madras and then to Rajahmundry. There, having grown tired of jail life, he made two attempts to abscond. He succeeded in the second attempt in 1922, and has ever since succeeded in eluding the police. He is a self-made man. He is a leading revolutionary and for some time has been revising his views on armed revolution, and ultimately decided in consultation with his friends to surrender himself to me and be guided by me. After having had a full conversation with him, I decided to take charge of him, and told him that according to my view of life there could be no secrecy and voluntary surrender to authorities was in itself a service to the country. He recognized the force of my opinion. He came to me on the morning of the 18th, and I wrote to the District Magistrate on the 19th, informing him that Sardar Prithvi Singh  had  surrendered himself to me, and that I was about to put myself in communication with the Government of India with a view to securing his discharge, and that if the District Magistrate could not legally allow Sardar  Prithvi Singh to remain with me, he was at liberty to take him into custody. The District Magistrate wrote to me to say that he had no authority to leave him free. He himself accompanied by the Superin- tendent of Police arrested him today at 1 p.m. at our residence at Juhu.libtech_343_footnote
 I have been given to understand that he will be treated as an A- class prisoner. I had asked Sardar Prithvi Singh to write an account of his career. It is a thrilling romance. So far as I can see, he has not been
 
 guilty of anything of which he need be ashamed. He developed revolutionary ideas in Canada where he had migrated in his youth. He was witness to the illegal and shameful turning away of the Coma Gata Maru from the Canadian shore, and he and a band of Indian settlers in Canada decided to return to India and lead a revolution. After absconding he has evidently made himself useful to the nation in various  ways.  He  is  very  powerfully  built  Rajput.  Five  months of hunger-strike in the Andamans and injuries received, whether in scuffles with the police or in escaping from custody, have left no visible trace of weakness on his body. He became a first-class gym- nastics teacher and studied the science of physical culture and the art of massage, and gave training in physical culture in many schools.
 To seek the relief of the political prisoners has come to me in the later years of my life as a God-sent mission. To strive for the early discharge of Sardar Prithvi Singh is the latest addition to this mission. He tells me that he is endeavouring to examine the method of non- violence for the deliverance of the country. He says that many of his past revolutionary companions are thinking along these lines. He has no other aim in life but the freedom of India. I was so much taken up by the sincerity with which he talked to me that I had no difficulty in taking his word at its face value, and I should love to have men like him as fellow-pilgrims in the pilgrimage to the temple of freedom,

 MY DEAR C. R.,
 I had two hours and a half with friend Jinnah yesterday. The talk was cordial but not hopeful, yet not without hope. I must not enter into the details of the conversation, but he complained bitterly of Hindi having been imposed in particular areas of Madras in primary schools. What is exactly the position? Are Mussalman boys affected? Please send me as early a reply as possible and one that I could publicly use.
 I had a long chat with Jawaharlal about the Communist party. I think we understand each other better than before on this particular question. He says [in] the Communist Party’s programme, there is no violence, there is no secrecy. Why should it [be] banned therefore as such? If any communist or party resorts to violence openly or secretly or incites to violence they must be dealt with not because of allegiance to a particular party, but because of violence. Thus the author of the writing that you showed me can clearly be dealt with under law, not because there is a ban on the Communist [Party] but because the writing itself has a criminal taint. Have you anything against this argument? If the ban is lifted, what will happen?
 I hope you have received the official reply from Subhas. It enables you to deal with your correspondent.
Love.

209,"May 	21, 1938",LETTER TO LORD LINLITHGOW,"
            DEAR 	FRIEND,     SEGAON, WARDHA,  May 	21, 1938 
  	Sardar Prithvi Singh is an old revolutionary who, belonging to a 	party that believed in armed revolution, was one of the odd hundred 	Indians, who being enraged over the treatment meted out to the 	passengers of the Kamagata Maru who vainly sought legal 	landing on the Canadian shore, took their passage to India with the 	avowed purpose, I believe, of causing trouble. Sardar Prithvi Singh 	was tried and sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment. He was then 	tried in what is known as the first Lahore Conspiracy case of 1915 	and was sentenced to transportation for life, and was sent to the 	Andamans. When the penal settlement was broken up, he, with many 	other prisoners was transferred to Madras and thence to Rajahmundry. 	On the way he absconded — this was in 1922—and successfully 	evaded capture. All these years of hiding he passed in studying the 	science of physical culture, and was responsible for training 	hundreds of youths. But this life gave him no satisfaction. He fell 	in the company of those who believe in the non-violent method. He 	seems to have developed faith in non-violence. On the 18th instant, 	he surrendered himself to me, and put himself under my guidance. I 	told him that I would love to keep him with me, watch him, and 	engage him in constructive national activity if the Government left 	him free. But I told him also that I could not keep him without 	informing the Government of what I was doing. On the 19th instant, 	therefore, I wrote to the Collector of the Suburban District in 	Bombay (for I was living in Juhu) telling him that if he had no 	authority to let Sardar Prithvi Singh remain with me, the Sardar was 	ready to be arrested. Yesterday the District Magistrate came to Juhu 	and arrested Sardar Prithvi Singh and lodged him in Thana Jail as an 	“ A” class prisoner.libtech_346_footnote  	I have given only the bare outline of Sardar Prithvi Singh’s 	activities. I feel that persons like Sardar Prithvi Singh should be 	given an opportunity of leading a useful life, instead of being kept 	in custody, especially when some person like me, known to the 	Govern- ment, is willing to keep them, and hold himself responsible 	for their  
 peaceful conduct. I wonder if my presentation makes any appeal to you. If it does I would urge you to make my way smooth, and restore Sardar Prithvi Singh to me. I may tell you that my having interested myself in the discharge of political prisoners has brought me in touch with many revolutionaries. I entertained high hopes of their conver- sion, especially if I received hearty co-operation from the authorities concerned.
 I do not know exactly whom or which department, or which provincial government I should properly approach. But I felt that aswe have come to know each other, and there is a friendly contact between us, I would approach you, the fountainhead.libtech_347_footnote
 May I expect an early reply? I know how busy you are, but perhaps you realize the importance of the matter and will therefore forgive me for the trouble I am giving you.

         MY 	DEAR IDIOT,         SEGAON,  May 	 22, 1938 
  	A letter addressed to me at Calcutta in which you wrote about a 	young graduate, went from place to place and was received only 	yesterday. Your letter written on the train was duly received and 	was easily readable. And now has come yours of 19th.  	I feel better and rested after reaching Segaon. I want mental rest. 	The mind has been overworked. I can take that rest only here, so I 	find from experience.  	The heat is no doubt trying. But I feel the joy of being a co- 	sharer with the other inmates. I propose presently to take daily 	silence for a few hours.  	My weight was found to be 106 yesterday—not much of a loss for 	retaining the health I was able to keep.  	Yes, the Mysore communiquelibtech_351_footnotelibtech_352_footnotewas 	distinctly good. You must have liked the W. C. resolutionlibtech_353_footnote. It was good you went to Mysore.     
 I shall gladly revise what you may send.
What do you say to my exploit about Prithvi Singh?
 I must send you a copy of what happened between Jinnah and me. He is a very tough customer. If the other members of the League are of the same type a settlement is an impossibility. But there is a way out for a unilateral undertaking. Settlements cannot be unilateral. I do not know that a unilateral undertaking will not be in the prevailing atmosphere a better mode of handling the situation. But every attempt must be made to arrive at a mutual understanding.
 I have not yet written to the Mirza. I shall do so in a day or two. As for myself you are right. You and others can  help me  only through prayer. I feel that the cloud is lifting. What is happening to make me feel easy, I do not know. And why should I worry? God’s ways are mysterious.
 I had an hour’s good chat with Jawaharlal on 19th. Your diagnosis is correct. The European visit will do him good. Of course he is at heart religious, though he denounces religion. He reads the Gita. He sports a Buddha head in his bedroom. Whatever he does and wherever he is, it is well with him.
 Did I ever tell you that I did not deliver your letter to Jinnah? I did not like it. It should have made no mention of me but should have confined itselt to the question itself. But it does not matter.
 How are you doing? What about the eczema? And the throat? Love.

 I have your letter. I do not find in it any contempt for me. What you have done is scientific analysis. I agree with many of the points. I shall enclose with this the article I had written. You can tear it up after having Devdas read it. Nothing has been published. If I write anything afresh, I shall circulate it among friends. I am still not convinced that there is anything wrong about discussing such matters. To my know- ledge, such discussions have been beneficial so far. I am not aware of the harm done. There will be a great deal of dirty discus-sions. How can filth be removed unless it is brought out through discussions? All this is unnecessary today. I submitted to Mahadev, Raja, etc., because I am a little scared of them myself. We shall see about it when I have acquired confidence in myself.
 Does it not follow from your letter that it is not right that I should forbid others from taking the liberties I permit myself? I am not perturbed. I have almost regained my original calm. I am thinking impartially about everything, including the bitter experience of the 14th.
Can you indicate the date of your return

  	I have received two of your envelopes together. Mahadev appears 	calm. But if his calm is genuine, he will not be distressed by your 	letters. I send him all your letters. You 	certainly are stupid, but certainly not unfortunate and 
 undeserving. And why unfortunate? Have you lost my love? Have you lost Mahadev’s love? Why undeserving? What have you done to make you undeserving? You certainly are stupid because you could not understand some simple things about the world. But it is I who make you stupid, What if I should be seeing my stupidity in you?
 Now about the 9th night. Why are you suffering so much? Can it not be that my affliction is the result of my latent lust? Maybe it is not. Can it not be that it is the result of my delusions? I have not claimed divinity. If you can be in the wrong, why can I not be in the wrong too? Both are a matter of imagination, are they not? You have not experienced anything and I cannot know your heart. God alone is the ruler of the hearts of both of us. He alone knows our hearts. That is why as your godfather I command you to regard your conduct as having been absolutely innocent and to forget your anguish. My misconceptions are the cause of your anguish.

 STUPID DAUGHTER,
 When will your sorrow end? In expressing your sorrow, you use words which pierce me like arrows. Have I ever worked for 12 hours in your presence?
 Are you receiving Mahadev’s letters now? Did I write to you that Mahadev had resolved to stop writing to you?
 In today’s letter you have reached the limit of your stupidity. Where is it laid down that if you see silver in a sea-shell once you will do so every time. And only yesterday I wrote that if something was possible in your case, it would be possible, in my case too. Could it not be that I saw silver in a sea-shell?
 You will have to withdraw the adjective “undeserving”. Would you be undeserving when I considered you so or would you believe it of yourself on your own? Do you wish to abandon me altogether by saying that? Now I am unable to bear your sadness because there is no cause for it at all. Can even Pyarelal not tell you such a simple thing? Forget your sorrow, if only for my sake. What can I do to comfort you? Granted that you have made me unhappy. But have I made you any less unhappy? Who should blame whom? Why should we not leave it to God to decide?

As for the night of the 9th I have explained that I fully agree with what Sushila says. I have indeed said that her impression might not have been correct. By the same token, I also believe that my impression might not have been correct either. I am even going a step further. Sushila is witness to her purity of mind. I cannot even claim purity of mind. I am willing to admit that I might have had a dirty mind. Can it not be that my diseased mind might have aroused me and I might have seen the reflection of my own morbidity in that innocent girl and in her action? Why should Sushila feel unhappy when all this is possible? Why should she feel miserable on account of my morbidity, my delusion and my imperfection? Why should Sushila go on feeling unhappy in spite of my acceptance of all these possibilities? I am not accusing her of anything. If you are convinced by my argument, try to pacify Sushila in your own words and in your own way. I do not wish that she should be calm for my sake. I can be calm only if her mind accepts that there is no reason at all to feel perturbed. I have somehow started feeling that in all these incidents I alone have played the role of Satan and by imputing guilt to an innocent act have caused untold misery to Sushila, to Mahadev and even to you. Thus, while on the one hand I am beginning to feel calm under the intoxication of work, on the other hand, whenever there is free time, I keep analysing the incidents of the day of the 14th of April and the night of the 9th. I have found no clue so far. I do not know if I shallfind it at all. As Rajkumari says my faith in God is being tested. If Sushila cannot be pacified at all, I can see that it will be a terrible thing for me. But if she cannot be pacified what will you
 do? What will poor Sushila do? As for me, I shall reap what I have sown.

 DEAR KHWAJA SAHEB,
 I thank you   for  your  exhaustive  reply  of  the  24th  instant.libtech_363_footnoteEvidently my position has been misunderstood. I do not wish to suggest that my judgment or that of the Congress is to be made sub- servient to the opinion of the convicts, but before I could come to a final judgment, it would be necessary for me in the interest of the common cause itself to sound the prisoners’ mind. If I had not,  subject to confirmation after an examination of details, come to the preliminary conclusion that the solution suggested by the Bengal Government might be worthy of acceptance, I could not have thought of any interview with the prisoners. My idea is, after deeper exami- nation of the solution, to convince the prisoners of the desira-bility of its acceptance. Before, therefore, I can finally accept the solution suggested, I hold it to be necessary to take the prisoners into confi- dence. I hope that you will agree with this opinion, for the sake, as I have already said, of the common purpose, viz., to ensure peace so far as this ticklish question of prisoners’ release is concerned.
 I take it that the question of detenus has been satisfactorily settled. I would appreciate a line as to how the matter stands.
 yours sincerely,

 SEGAON, WARDHA,
 May 28, 1938
 The fact that the first one thousand copies of this pamphlet have been sold out shows that what Dr. Zakir Husain and his committee have called Basic National Education is exciting fair interest in India and outside. A more correct though much less attractive description would be Rural National Education through  village handicrafts. ‘Rural’ excludes the so-called higher or English education.‘National’ at present connotes truth and non-violence. And ‘through village handicrafts’ means that the framers of the scheme expect the teachers to educate village children in their villages so as to draw out all their faculties through some selected village handicrafts in an atmosphere free from superimposed restrictions and interference. Thus consi- dered, the scheme is a revolution in the education of village children. It is in no sense an importation from the West. If the reader bears this
 
 fact in mind he will be better able to follow the scheme to the prepa- ration of which some of the best educationists have given their un- divided attention.

    CHI. 	PYARELAL,  	Give the enclosed letter to Sushila if you think it proper. It will 	give you an idea of my present state. It seems by entering  into 	Sushila’s life I have embittered it at least for the time being. 	How should I punish myself for it?  	I have not shown your letter to Mahadev. I have understood your 	point. So far, I should say, I have not made any changes yet. The 	conflict is still going on. I like Mirabehn’s conclusion better 	than that of all of you. That is exactly what Sushila’s great 	anguish suggests. I attributed guilt where there was none. Does this 	not point to my own morbid state of mind? Mirabehn is not even aware 	of that incident. Yet she has warned me as gently as she could. The 	direct implication of Sushila’s anguish is this: “What sort of a 	father are you that you saw guilt in an innocent girl?” Even by 	deserting me she gives me the same warning. She is of course taking 	the whole responsibility on herself. But if I let her do it, would 	it not be the limit of my wicked- ness? If this conclusion is 	correct, would I not be doing penance by not taking service from any 	woman? This question is before me in spite of myself. I am 	perplexed. I cannot see my way. I cannot make up my mind. Who can 	help me in this matter? Hence I am praying to    
 God that He may either guide me or take me away.
 I have taken note of your programme. Even for the sakes of Prakash, Satya and Sushila, stay there as long as necessary. Do not desert me altogether. Ba’s remarks have scared me.
 I have given vent to the fire that burns me. However, do not think that I am in the least disturbed. I continue working as much as I can. All the things have been safely received. What tyranny? Why did you join in it?

Have I not 	troubled you enough? Am I not the one who saw guilt in your innocent 	act? I had lost you at that very moment. I had even told you so that 	day. I am reaping as I sowed.

           CHI. 	PYARELAL,     SEVAGRAM, WARDHA,  May 	30, 1938 
  	You will have received the letter I wrote you yesterday. It seems  I 	forgot to mention that I had not shown your letter to Mahadev.  	I would wish this to be my last letter concerning the 	Sushila-Mahadev episode. So far as I am concerned, the conclusion I 	have come to from the facts that have come to me is final.  	Sushila’s firmness has opened my eyes. I thrust my suspicion on 	Mahadev. Only what Mahadev said to me on the 14th was correct. 	Whatever he wrote and said since then has been done merely under my 	influence. Hence, I must treat it as cancelled. In the process, the 	innocence of both of them comes out clear before me. My love was 	full of suspicion. That is why I saw pure gold as brass. I 	attributed my morbid tendencies to both of them. It is my cussedness 	which is the cause of Sushila’s tortured state of mind. I have now 	got to look into the source of this cussedness. The fact that 	Sushila has abandoned me because she feels that she is undeserving 	is due to her determination    
 not to see any cussedness in me. The result is of course good. I do not consider myself worthy even to touch Sushila. But would I thereby forget the anguish I have caused her? How can I expiate  for maligning Mahadev? Did I not do the same with you in relation to Yoga? Your firm stand conquered me. I shall handle Mahadev. He cannot abandon me at all. When you could not abandon me, how can Mahadev do so?
You have been looking after Sushila. Bring her back into line.
 Once your affairs are settled there you have got to come here. If you can give me a firm assurance about your coming, I can patiently wait.
 Now about me. If I have caused anguish to Sushila even unknowingly, where do I have the right to serve women or be served by them? I cannot expiate for it by fasting. I cannot do it by suffering in any other way. My expiation can only be in one form and that to avoid the touch of women altogether and serve them from a distance in whatever way I can. In no sense have I been a brahmachari of my definition. I must make this known to my colleagues and do the necessary sadhana to approximate to my definition.
 I do not know if my cussedness has gone that far. I am trying to carry on an impartial search in that direction. If  it  results  in something, I shall inform you.
 Neither you nor Sushila need be disturbed on reading this. I am certainly not perturbed. I am trying to understand myself in the light of the Gita. I am not troubled by my cussedness. I have not delibe- rately cultivated it. I was not aware of the stench I was carrying. But when Sushila’s fragrance entered my nostrils I thought it was a stench. Such a feeling cannot develop in a day. The root must be lying deep somewhere. Who can unravel this tangle except God? He alone can pull us out of trouble. He will show me the way.
 If Sushila can benefit by reading this letter, let her read it.
Otherwise there is no need at all to show it to her.
 I have already written to Mahadev something to this effect in the morning. I have said the same thing to him in a clear manner.
 I do wish you would not feel upset. Nothing is to be gained by feeling upset at this time of trouble.
I am well.

  	I received your two letters together. Now everything is changed, is 	it not? My letters of yesterday and the day before will have made 	this clear. Now I have more or less decided that with the exception 	of Ba I will not accept from any other woman any service involving 	physical contact. After that, there is no question at all of an 	affectionate touch. I have made another discovery. In saying that I 	alone might touch women and that no one else might do so, I was 	guilty of a terrible error—and for how many years I persisted in 	the error! I should have known that I could claim no scientific 	sanction for the experiment. I was impelled solely by my terrible 	arrogance. Among all my colleagues I considered only myself entitled 	to break the restrictions of brahmacharya. As long as I am 	not willing  to accept my colleagues touching women I have not the 	slightest right to touch a woman. I hope to settle everything in a 	day or two. I have 
 only your firmness to thank for making me see my error. In my viewthe restrictions I had laid down for you and Mahadev are no longer justified. What qualifies me to lay down  such  restrictions? When I admit that my accusing you was merely the reflection of my own failing, not yours or Mahadev’s, where is the place for the restrictions set by me? To the extent I am involved in this affair, I am the guilty person, not you, nor Mahadev. I am writing all this dispa- ssionately.
 And what reward I gave you for your services! Now for Pyarelal. Mother’s words were like nectar to me: “You have already taken away Pyare. Now you want to take away Sushila too?” She was right. I did not do you any good. What good have I done to Pyarelal? Pyarelal’s future would be the test whether my acts were good or evil. As for you, I still consider you stupid. You have worked for me like a benign spirit. But for your resolute stand, my eyes would not have been opened. I would have still been in the slumber of my illusions. Mira-behn has rightly said that I would have died repenting. God has alerted me only through you. Even though you came to me as a daughter, you have acted like a mother. Not my merit but maybe yours will save your brother.
 It is good that you are helping Brijkrishna. My advice is that you should take the place for the hospital. You must be fully recovered. But who am I to guide you? You have got a brother like Pyarelal. He is with you. Do only what he says. After all, how can God give you up? Who will be left for Him if He gives you up? You will always prosper. Do not worry about me. I am well.

256,"June 	2, 1938",NOTE TO ASHRAM INMATES,"
    Not 	Revised         June 	2, 1938 
  	I have been distressed since the 7th of April. I had a dirty dream 	that night. I did wake up before the crisis but I felt ashamed. 	After the experience I hardly slept that night. I was restless. I 	walked about on the terrace and calmed myself a little. I felt that 	I was not fit to accept service from Sushila and Prabhavati who 	slept close to my bed. After the prayer, I first recounted to them 	what I had been through and then told them that I would not be 	taking service from them. But both took this decision very badly. 	Within twelve hours I reviewed my decision and continued to take 	service from them. But my distress did not cease. On the 14th I had 	another type of experience which increased my shame and added to my 	anguish. I had not made any change in my outward behaviour. But 	consciously or unconsciously, my mind was preparing itself. While I 	was caught in that whirlpool, I had to meet Mr. Jinnah. I thought it 	was my duty to write something for the occasion. I wrote something 	and indicated my sense of shame in it.libtech_376_footnote  	I had lost my self-confidence. I had shamed my brahmacharya. 	After a great deal of thought I have come to this decision. For 	the time being, and so long as I am able to bear such physical 	contact with other people, I should not take any service from  women 	 which involves physical contact, unless it is absolutely 	unavoidable. It is obvious that I must not touch them in jest or in 	affection. This change is very important to me. My whole life has 	been shaped in the belief that there is nothing wrong about innocent 	physical touch of women. Before I took the vow of brahmacharya 	and after, I touched nume- rous woman in a light-hearted way or 	in affection, I have not expe- rienced any adverse effect thereby 	and have not known any woman who may have been sensually aroused.  	But a doubt arose after my experience of the 7th April. Why have I 	not become free from passion in spite of my constant effortstowards 	brahmacharya? Why have my thoughts and my mind not become 	purer and purer? I can say that I have not felt myself free from 	carnal desire in India as much as I did in South Africa. Could the 	contact with women have obstructed my path in some subtle way? Who 	can answer that question? The only solution is that unless God 	Himself answers it, I should try to shun all physical touch and    
 understand my own mind and conquer it.
 Yesterday it became clear to me as day that it was very wrong of me to prevent my colleagues from taking the liberties which I myself have taken. I still cannot understand how I allowed it to happen for so many years. It seems to me that behind that restriction was my pride. It was a failing. I should not have undertaken the experiment if it was so terrible. If it was worth undertaking, I should have encouraged all my colleagues to pursue it on my condition. My experiment was a transgression of the limits prescribed by brahmacharya. Only a sage like Shukadevji who was always pure in thought, speech and action would be entitled to exercise such freedom. Such thinking led me to the above decision yesterday.
 I feel that the bitter experiences of Dahyabhai and others at Sabarmati had my experiment at their root. Who can say in how many cases my behaviour has led to wrong actions?
 Only he who can observe complete brahmacharya can give complete training in non-violence. I am the self-appointed leader of the path of non-violence! What wonder if my non-violence is weak to the extent that I cannot pass the above test? Even then, I shall continue my experiment in non-violence so long as I feel convinced that even my imperfect brahmacharya has lent considerable support to non-violence. Otherwise too my behaviour would remain the same at least for the present. Who can say where the future will lead me? My strongest desire is to submit lovingly to God and let myself be driven whither He wills.
 It was my clear duty to convey this much to my co-workers. I assume that any co-worker who wishes will let me know his reactions and point out any error he may find in my thinking.

 June 2, 1938
 
 CHI. PYARELAL,
 Your letter was received late. You had written ‘Shegaon’, which is not this Segaon. The letter went to some other Shegaon. If you write ‘Wardha’, I shall receive the letters regularly and intact. The postal service is bad here.
 You must have read my letter to Sushila which I wrote yesterday. You will see that I have gone further ahead. Now what have I got to draw out of Sushila? The whole misunderstanding arose because of my misguided imagination and poor Sushila had to pass through an ordeal. I am not now feeling sorry about it. Whatever I did had been prompted by my love. But according to my definition I proved to be a father with sensual tendencies. How can such a father do justice even to his own children? He would see his morbidities in others. Where do you figure in this? According to my analysis, this entire tragic episode is the result of my mistaken thinking. Now my eyes have been opened and so things must calm down. Does my diagnosis now sound complete? The credit for everything goes to Sushila’s firmness.
 I have now understood about Sushila. Now why should I worry? Did my worry have behind it the fear that Sushila migh be harbouring  a scorpion? Sushila having shown her crystal purity, why should I worry about her? She will shine wherever she settles.
 I am enclosing a copy of the   I  notelibtech_377_footnotehave  addressed  to  co- workers. I hope it will make everything clear. Give this to Devdas to read.
 What should I say about you? My conclusion is clear. If I have to lose you, the blame will be entirely on me. I realize that in some matters I am slow-witted. I shall not go into a fresh analysis of myself If I lose you, I shall know myself as I really am. If I can have you back with me in the natural course, I shall feel reassured thatI was not an absolutely undeserving co-worker and father. I have written to Sushila that if my meritorious acts do not save me, hers will certainly save her. During this period of turmoil I have without a doubt obtained a jewel in the person of Sushila. By saying this, I am not undeservedly praising her. I am describing her as I see her at present. Your letter of today confirms that thought.
 Sushila writes that l should get my blood-pressure taken twice a day and get my urine also examined twice a day. That will be possible when you come here and attend to it. I am myself not too keen about it. All that Sushila wants you can carry out. But definitely not right now. Only after you have settled everything there and settled Sushila well.

STUPID DAUGHTER SUSHILA,
 There is no letter from you. Then why should I write? But on second thoughts I decided to write.
 My decision should not hurt you in the least. Though stupid, you are intelligent enough to see that my decision is absolutely independent and inescapable. How can I do what others could not do? How was it I did not understand such a self-evident thing, till today? Why was I so silly? And yet, I do not hesitate to call you stupid!

  	Are you trying to prove your stupidity? What did I know of your 	purity before Mahadev told me? Since then I have been taking service 	from you. If you too have experienced desire, it is as well. For 	then we are both in the same plight and we both ought to be on our 	guard. For me it is sufficient that I am on my guard. The day I have 	to save myself from you, you will only see my dead body, you will 	not see me alive. After my 69 years, the  vikaralibtech_380_footnotelibtech_381_footnotein 	you cannot affect me. I burn with my own vikara. Because of 	my vikara I regard myself unfit to take service from any 	woman. For that reason, you are free to abandon me, but you are 	always telling me that you do not want to leave me under any 	circumstances, so I must accept your services in      
 all humility.
 Have you read the letters of others? No one has any complaint to make. Mirabehn had only imagined things. Even then there was no complaint against you. Only I have a complaint. But that is a different story altogether. You should forget these people.
 You have to consider two questions. I must not take you away from your duty to Mother. Deep in your heart you desire to study. It is a good desire too. Should I make you give up that desire and con- tinue taking service from you? These two questions are very pertinent.
 About my experiment later. I can write now, but you must show pity for my hand.

  	It was not difficult for me to read even those portions in your 	letter which were scored out. You have harassed Sushila for no 	reason. But she has already passed through the ordeal. It was just 	as well that she was thus tested. You too should stop lamenting. My 	decision is based on entirely different grounds. It has nothing to 	do with Mira’s argument. It is not possible that my argument would 	have occurred to Mira. If I see something wrong in a practice I have 	continued for forty years, shall I not say that there is the hand of 	God in it? That was why I did not wait for your and Sushila’s 	letters. Now you can both see that even if it could be proved that 	Sushila was perhaps on the verge of succumbing to impure thoughts, 	my conclusion would remain unaltered. So long as I am not prepared 	to allow others to do what I do myself, why should I do it? This 	seems to me self-evident. I am now beginning to see this fault has a 	historical background. After my decision all of us must feel at 	ease. According to me everything has become clear.  	I understand about the machines. Only you can put them to use. Right 	now I am not even in a position to tempt Sushila. When she comes on 	her own I shall of course embrace her in spite of my having    
 stopped taking service from women. But right now her well-being does not lie with me. It lies in her settling somewhere. But it is not for me to decide. Only you two should jointly decide. I see from what you have scored out in your letter that you are shouldering a heavy responsibility there. I do wish you would leave as soon  as  the problems are solved. And if Sushila wishes to come, her place will be higher than it was. Where would you escape to by running away from me! Such words should not have come from your pen. I am returning your letter.
My health I should say is good.

  	I have read your letter to Mahadev. Why so much lamentation now? 	Having taken the decision I am now absolutely at peace. Even Mahadev 	is calm as far as I can understand him. l am not worried about 	Sushila either. You are there. That particular incident has  nothing 	to do with my decision. Although it provided the immediate pretext I 	have justified it independently of that incident. Even if Mahadev 	and Sushila had been proved guilty instead of innocent, I would 	still consider my decision right. Since they have been proved 	innocent my decision is of course correct. My decision is not at all 	by way of expiation. Whatever blame I am taking upon myself appears 	to me justified. It may well not be so. But even if the cause of the 	incidents of the 9th and the 14th is proved to be purely imaginary 	the legitimacy of my decision holds. Very often, a decision becomes 	necessary to open our eyes. Hence, let us stop lamenting. Let us 	forget the past and look after the present.  	Sushila therefore does not have to come to pacify me or to find her 	peace of mind. I would certainly like to have Sushila by my side. I 	would take service from her in so many ways. But I would be afraid 	to let her come alone. She is a chain that binds. I. would not 	willingly 
 permit you to keep out. I wish your presence even without her. I would be very happy if she too accompanied you. That is why I have sent a telegramlibtech_383_footnotetoday to let you know my state of mind. Now decide what seems right after taking into consideration what needs to be done there. I am in fine fettle.
 What Sushila’s instrument says or what the urine test indicates only Sushila or you will know. But I am sleeping well and eating well. My diet includes 10 to 12 oz. of milk, roti, vegetables, garlic, onions and fruit. This is sufficient. I am not taking jaggery for the present. In the afternoon I take juice of raw mango or lime withsoda. I have a tub-bath in the morning. I rub ghee on the soles of my feet twice a day. I massage my head with oil at night. As usual, I apply mud-pack to my abdomen morning and evening. This is for two to two-and- a-half hours altogether. I take light walks. I invariably sleep in the afternoon.

        CHI. 	MUNNALAL,     SEGAON,  June 	4, 1938 
  	That my ideal is Shukadevji does not mean that I should like to have 	a face like his, to sleep, sit and eat like him and go to the 	Himalayas as he did. It only means that I should like to cultivate 	brahmacharya like his. And if you say that this can’t be 	the ideal of one who wishes to live and serve in this world or that 	it cannot be attained by such a one, then brahmacharya like 	Shukadevji’s is of little value. A perfect brahmachari should 	remain unaffected by passion in any circumstances. If you say that 	nobody has ever been, and nobody will ever be, able to cultivate 	such freedom from passion, then it means that we should abandon the 	struggle to cultivate brahmacharya. If this is correct, then 	it follows that one can never cultivate perfect ahimsa. I 	am alarmed, or was, by my experiencelibtech_384_footnotelibtech_385_footnotebecause 	I was at a loss     
 to know what to do. Now that I know, the reason for alarm has disappeared. Saying that I know does not mean, either, that physical contact with women was one of the causes or the only cause of my painful experience. But this has become clear to me as day that I should not have done what I was not prepared to tolerate in others. Now that I have given up the practice I shall discover whether it was physical contact with women that was obstructing my progress or whether there was some other cause. Hence, for fully assessing the result of the experiment of refraining from physical contact with women, I must avoid such contact completely, for the present at any rate. There is no question here of more or less contact.
I hope you will understand everything from this.

You are unnecessarily 	putting the whole blame on Sushila. I have not exonerated Mahadev 	independently. What I am saying is that the scale by which I was 	measuring Mahadev was itselffaulty. He is innocent from that point 	of view. Right now, Mahadev has lost all capacity to decide whether 	or not he has committed a wrong. My wretched suggestions are 	responsible for that. What can poor Mahadev do? Hence it is useless 	if he considers himself innocent and a thousand times more so if he 	considers himself guilty. Sushila’s case is different. But today’s 	letter puts her in Mahadev’s position. Both you and I are 	responsible for that. And even there do I not take the lead? 	Sushila’s agony started with my intimation [of the happening] of 	the 14th. But I have not taken my decision on that basis at all. It 	does not involve any expiation. It involves awareness on your part. 	In your view it is utter ignorance. If you prove that to me I shall 	swallow my pride. I shall do what I did about Bardoli.

MANILAL,  	You will be leaving on Wednesday. You came but I feel as if you had 	not come at all. We had long enough conversations but I can’t say 	that we talked at leisure. But, then where do I have such a thing as 	leisure? Whatever decision you take, do it calmly. If you can keep 	[Indian] Opinion going, do so. But remember the 	meaning of keeping it going, which I explained to you. I would not 	consider it being kept going if it is done through advertisements. 	This does not mean that you should now stop accepting 	advertisements. But it would be pitiable for the journal to be kept 	going on advertisements. Advertisements should be used for 	increasing the profits or for reducing the subscription rate. In the 	case of pice-newspapers a pice would not help to meet even the cost 	of the newsprint. But because they get advertisements they are able 	to reach lakhs of readers by charging a nominal price. If we accept 	the policy of taking in 
 advertisements we can justify it only in this way. The royal road for you, therefore, is that you should divide the total expenditure by the number of prospective subscribers and fix that figure as the subscription rate from the very beginning. If you don’t get subs- cribers at that rate, then you should conclude that I. O . should be closed down. The rest you know. If you want to earn, settle down there. I won’t consider that objectionable. If you wish to return to India, you should be content with whatever you get and decide to devote yourself to public service. Please treat all this as no more than my advice and do what you yourself wish.
Have an amicable talk with Kallenbach.
 Don’t carry with you any worries about Sushila and the chil- dren. Vijayalakshmi and Nanabhai are there to look after them. They will stay in Akola as long as they wish and then come here. You should also know that what the children will acquire in India in the ordinary course from the surrounding atmosphere they cannot acquire in a foreign country, despite all our efforts. You need not, therefore, worry about the children’s education either. Sushila should
 come to Segaon early, because most probably I shall be  in  the Frontier Province in October. And I can’t say how long I shall be there. My health is all right. Pyarelal and Sushila are still in Delhi. Maybe they will come after a few days. Don’t be lazy in writing letters.

  	Is there any limit to your stupidity? How could I abandon you 	forever? Why are you raising me so high? The place you assign to me 	is not my place, though I certainly wish it was. My experience on 	the night of the 7th could not in any way have been influenced by 	the prurience of any of you. As for the incident of the 14th, I find 	only my own sensuality reflected in it. I shall explain it further 	when we meet. Why do you presume the existence of something in your 	heart which was not there? Your saying such a thing is a matter of 	shame for me. I constantly see that I am sensual. In that case why 	should we ignorewhat is evident and look for what is not evident? 	But you both will have left before this letter reaches Delhi.

 I have been asked if there are any rules here about anything. There are. For when winding up Sabarmati Ashram I had said that we would from then on be a mobile Ashram and carry with us wherever we went Ashram life and Ashram rules. Prayers, etc., thus stay as before as also the hour of rising. We may certainly introduce changes, excepting in principles, according as circumstances may warrant, as has been done here. We deliberately employ Harijan servants, because we want to serve the Harijans. But though we employ them as servants we have to treat them as our brothers.
*	*	*	*
 Therefore we must do even menial work that we can do ourselves. If we cannot do some particular work ourselves we may have it done by others. Only work that even others cannot do may we ask Harijans to do.

 MY DEAR ATULANAND,
 I have not been able to overtake your letter of 20th May earlier. Yours of 22nd April I saw only today. The reason for this delay you know.
 About the year-book, you have to do what Subhas Babu suggests. I may not, and must not take the lead. I can’t issue invita- tions. The thing has got to be taken up by the Congress. What I said was that an accurate year-book would supply a felt want. It is not the work of any single individual, but you can make yourself responsible for it as editor if the Congress would entrust the work to you.
 I am glad that you have dropped the idea of the monthly journal.
I hope your daughter is fully restored.
 Yours sincerely,
 M. K. GANDHI

 SEGAON, WARDHA,
 June 9, 1938
 DEAR KHWAJA SAHEB,
 I am grateful for your letter of the 1st inst. If you will please refer again to my letter of 27th ultimo, you will find that the sentence referring to deeper conviction has been wholly misunderstood. You will see that it does not bear the meaning you have put upon it. It is clear from the context that if, after deeper examination of the solution suggested by the Government,libtech_393_footnoteI should find it acceptable, I would like to convince the prisoners of the desirability of their acceptance. For deeper examination I must have more material, which is lacking and which I am seeking from you and other sources. If, before I or Sarat Babu or Subhas Babu went to the prisoners, we all three came to the conclusion that the Government’s was a sound offer, I for one should stand by it, even if I failed to get the prisoners’ acquiescence, unless they could convince me of the error of my judgment. I must however inform you that my deeper study is shaking my belief in the workability of the solution offered by the Government. Naturally I must weigh every solution in the scales I have set up for my guidance, and on the basis of which I submitted my propositions to you before leaving Calcutta. I do not mind through what formula or through what machinery the object of securing the release of every prisoner inside of one year or thereabouts is attained.
 With reference to the detenus and the State prisoners  I remember the paragraph you refer to in your letter of 17th April. I did not raise any objection to it, although I felt it to be a new intro- duction, because I had hoped that an early solution of the prisoners’ question would be reached. I venture to remind you that in the very
 
 
 beginning of the conversations it was agreed that the detenus and the prisoners who were incarcerated without trial were to be separately considered from the convicted prisoners. In my opinion it would be a grave injustice if the discharge of the detenus and State prisoners is to be made contingent upon an agreed solution of the question affecting convicted prisoners.
 May I also remind you that the policy about detenus has been already made public by you? It would be a thousand pities, therefore, if the release of detenus and State prisoners were delayed  or indefinitely postponed because of the possible breakdown of the negotiations for the release of convicted prisoners.
 Yours sincerely,
 M. K. GANDHI

 Women may well be there, but I must nevertheless have a man by me. Whether I want support or not is not the question. I am trying to do without it but how can I say when I may have to have it?
 I shall see about the massage. Sushilabehn knows every nerve and tissue of the body. That is why even she does not dare to give it

281,"June 11, 1938",TALKS ON VOCATIONAL EDUCATION libtech_396_footnote,"
  
 [Before June 11, 1938]
 I had long been impressed with the necessity for a  new  departure as I knew the failure modern education had been through the numerous students who came to see me on my return from South Africa. So I started with the introduction of training in handicrafts in the Ashram school. In fact an extra emphasis was placed on manual training, with the result that the children soon got tired of the manual training and thought that they had been deprived of literary training. There they were wrong, for even the little that they gained was more than children ordinarily get in the orthodox schools. But that set me thinking, and I came to the conclusion that not vocation cum literary training, but literary training through vocational training was the thing. Then vocational training would cease to be a drudgery and literary training would have a new content and new usefulness. The acceptance of office by the Congress prompted me to place  the thought before the nation, and I am glad that it was welcomed in many quarters.
 English we decided to taboo, because we knew that most of the time of the children was taken up with memorizing English words and phrases, and even then they could not put in their own language what they had learnt, and could not properly follow what the teacher taught them. On the other hand they forgot their own language by sheer neglect. Education through vocational training seemed to be the only way to avoid both these evils.
 I should make a start on the first day with finding out the calibre of the boys—whether they know any reading and writing, any geography, and then start with trying to add to their equipment  through the introduction of the takli.
 Now you might well ask me why I picked up the takli out of the many other existing handicrafts. Because takli was one of the first crafts that we found out and which has subsisted through the ages.In the earliest ages all our cloth used to be made of takli yarn. The
 
 
 spinning-wheel came later, and [as] the finest counts could not be produced on the spinning-wheel, one had to go back to the takli. In devising the takli man’s inventive genius reached a height that had not been reached before. The cunning of the fingers was put to the best possible use. But as the takli was confined to the artisans who were never educated, it fell into disuse. If we want to revive it today in all its glory, if we are to revive and reconstruct the village life, we must begin the education of children with the takli. My next lesson would therefore be to teach the boys the place the takli used to occupy in our daily life. Next I would take them into a little history and teach them how it declined. Then would follow a brief course in Indian history, starting from the East Indian Company, or even earlier from the Muslim period, giving them a detailed account of the exploitation that was the stock in trade of the East India company, how by a systematic process our main handicraft was strangled and ultimately killed. Next would follow a brief course in mechanics—construction of the takli. It must have originally consisted of a small ball of clay or even wet flour dried on to a bamboo splinter running through its centre. This has still survived in some parts of Bihar and Bengal. Then  a brick disc took the place of the clay ball and then in our times iron or steel and brass have taken the place of the brick disc and a steel wire the place of the splinter. Even here one might expatiate with profit on the size of the disc and the wire, why it is of a particular size and why not more or less. Next would follow a few lectures on cotton, its habitat, its varieties, the countries and the provinces of India where it is at present grown and so on. Again some knowledge about its cultivation, the soil best suited for it, and so on. That would make us launch into a little agriculture.
 You will see that this takes a fund of assimilated knowledge on the part of the teacher before he can impart it to his pupils. The whole of elementary arithmetic can be taught through the counting of yards of spinning, finding out the count of yarn, making up of hanks, getting it ready for the weaver, the number of cross-threads in the warp to be put in for particular textures of cloth and so on. Every process from the growing of cotton to the manufacture of the finished product—cotton picking, ginning. carding, spinning, sizing, weaving—all would have their mechanics and history and mathematics correlated to them.
 The principle idea is to impart the whole education of the body and the mind and the soul through the handicraft that is taught to thechildren. You have to draw out all that is in the child through teaching all the processes of the handicraft, and all your lessons in history, geography, arithmetic will be related to the craft.
 If such education is given, the direct result will be that it will be self-supporting. But the test of success is not its self-supporting character, but that the whole man has been drawn out through the teaching of the handicraft in a scientific manner. In fact I would reject a teacher who would promise to make it self-supporting under any circumstances. The self-supporting part will be the logical corollary of the fact that the pupil has learnt the use of every one of his faculties. If a boy who works at a handicraft for three hours a day will surely earn his keep, how much more a boy who adds to the work a development of his mind and soul !

 I saw your letterlibtech_397_footnoteaddressed to Mahadev. I can understand your pain. I hope the step I have taken will help to lighten your pain to some extent. I have drafted a statementlibtech_398_footnotein English for newspapers, but I have not as yet published it. Your suggestion is certainly worth thinking over. My temperament inclined me to another course. I experience greater peace when I make such things public. The fear mentioned in your letter is based on practical considerations. I don’t feel that I have lost the strength to stick to a step which I may have decided to take deliberately and as a matter of dharma. However, I won’t publish the statement in a hurry. Even though I am putting it off, for non-Gujarati readers there must be a statement in English similar to the one in Gujarati.

CHI. BALWANTSINHA,
 
 
 SEGAON,
 June 11, 1938
  	Your letter is extremely good. It is pure. Your doubts are 	pertinent, even your fear is relevant and your  caution is quite 	welcome.  	The vowlibtech_401_footnotelibtech_402_footnoteof 1935 was worded in English, I had not seen the 	Gujarati or the Hindi translation. The purport of the original 	English is that I renounce the practice of placing my hands on the 	shoulders of women. I did not feel then that there was anything 	wrong about it, nor do I now. I gave up the practice only for the 	sake of public good. My heart never took it to mean that I would 	never place my hand on the shoulder of any girl whatsoever. I have 	no recollection of the particular girl with whom the practice was 	resumed in Segaon. But I do recollect that I fully remembered my vow 	of 1935 when I placed my hand on her shoulder. Possibly I could not 	resist her request, or may be I needed her support. I cannot of 	course say that the support became necessary because of my weak 	state for had that been the case  I could have had the support of 	some man so as to keep the vow inviolate. But my vow never had such 	a wide meaning, at least for me. From the very begining I have 	regarded Sushilabehn in the same way as Ba, as an exception. My 	tender feelings are to account for that too.  I would like to give 	up physical contact even with these two if it were possible, but I 	have no desire to do so at the cost of the deep hurt which I would 	be causing them while my heart feels no sin in the contact of these 	two. I took the decision only after much discussion with the girls 	here, after some laughter and some cajoling. I have caused Ba much 	pain. I still occasionally do, but I have no courage nor any desire 	to inflict any further pain on her. Sushila has observed 	brahmacharya since childhood but her observance does not 	include the exclusion of innocent contact with men. Pyarelal too is 	a brahmachari and one of the reasons for his joining me is 	that I do not advocate total avoidance of innocent contact between 	the two sexes and I have had a certain measure of success in this. 	Once I intended to give up all personal services from Sushila but 	within twelve hours my soft-heartedness had put an end to the 	intention. I could not bear the tears of Sushila and the fainting 	away of Prabhavati. I did not even want to. It is these brothers and 	sisters that my decision has affected most and that is why I 	summoned them by wire. I want their sincere    
 co-operation in my present task. Sushila has been present in the bathroom while I have bathed in the nude and in her absence Ba or Prabhavati or Lilavati have attended on me. But I see nothing wrong in it. It was necessary for someone to be there. I could call a male co- worker, too. Pyarelal has been in attendance occasionally but I have never felt any embarrassment in being seen naked by a woman. Still it would have to be a woman whose relations with me cannot come under any kind of suspicion.
 Now for its implementation. As soon as I put my decision into practice the discussions arose. During the first round of discussions I started acting upon the decision the very next day though the step was to be taken only after 3-4 days. The discussions are inevitable as long as my mastery over the passions is incomplete, perhaps they are even necessary. Complete realization can be expressed best only through silence. Speech can never fully express thought. Ignorance denotes disorganization of thought which is why it needs the  vehicle  of speech. Thus you may take it for certain that the very necessity of any explanations and persuasions on my part proves my imperfection or proneness to passsions. My claim is and has ever been very small. I am striving incessantly to have full control over my thoughts, i.e., to remain unaffected in every circumstance. I am quite vigilant but the outcome lies with God which fact relieves me of worry. Do write to me  if some points has still not been covered or a new doubt arises.
I return your letter.

 Your argument is welcome. I haven’t the time  for  long argument with you.
 S.libtech_405_footnoteis out of the picture.   She  must  be  an  exception  being  a doctor. But your objection is sound in that even one woman vitiated the experiment. I am struggling to exclude Ba, too. S. has put herself
 
 out. She wouldn’t have what others can’t. Therefore she is training a male nurse.
 You are again right in saying that even a woman’s proximity, speech, look, letter, etc., may work the evil as her touch might. But I had to think of myself. If I scented danger then I must put out my eyes, rather than have the animal in me be aroused.
 You miss the crucial point. It is not the woman who is to blame.  I am the culprit. I must attain the required purity. This experiment is but a way to be tried.
 The article has not gone to the press. It may never go though the prohibition is in force. You will put yourself wholly in the wrong if you avoid me because of my decision. If you were here I would convince you of the necessity of the decision, in spite of your finding flaws.

 I hope, if I keep well, to join in the takli-yajna daily.
 This yajna is not obligatory for anyone but I think it essential for all inmates of the institution. Takli-yajna is a social and public yajna and the charkha has no place in it. Takli teaches us  silent  service. The millions can perform the yajna only through takli. The noise of the spinning-wheel is a distraction in the takli-yajna. So those who understand its worth may ply the takli-exclusively.
 The room we sit in is not arranged properly. Quite a few things there are superfluous. They should be removed after due exami- nation. The case lying near my seat is quite out of place. Every-thing can be accommodated on the box. Our possessionss hould be the very minimum. We should remember that non-possession is one of the eleven vows."

  	I was delighted to have your letter and am happy to learn that you 	are quite comfortable there.  	You have rightly asked me how a prisoner wishing to observe truth 	and non-violence should behave in prison. Your present beha- viour 	is quite commendable, but let me put down here a few prin- ciples:   A 		votary of 		truth and non-violence 		may have 		 nothing secret. He 		will observe all the jail regulations cheerfully.  He 		may invite 		the attention 		of the 		authorities to 		such rules 		as may appear to him to be improper or hard.  He 		has a 		right, and 		it may 		be even 		his duty, 		to disobey 		such rules as 		may offend 		his self-respect. 		But it 		is his duty first to 		make a 		representation to the authorities in respect of these rules, and he may  
 disobey them holding himself ready to suffer the consequences only after he has failed to obtain redress.
  Such 	a prisoner 	will never regard 	himself in 	any way 	superior to 	the rest, and 	will never agitate to 	secure facilities which 	are denied to others.  Such 	a prisoner 	will regard 	the prison 	as a temple 	of freedom, 	and will 	therefore work for the 	development of 	his mind 	and his 	soul by 	serious study and 	thinking. He 	will not 	waste a single minute.  Such 	a prisoner 	will regard 	all jail labour 	as his 	own work and 	will perform 	it with the same 	devotion. He 	will seize every opportunity 	to learn 	a new calling.  Such 	a prisoner 	will always think of 	God, will never give 	himself up 	to despair, and 	will cheerfully put 	up with all 	hardships and 	sufferings. 
What more can I say? I know you will fill in the details.
 I am in correspondence with the authorities regarding your release. The result is in God’s hands.
 Do write whenever you can. I do get news about you from Shantilal and Jamnadas. Your father has been informed. I shall let you know when I have his reply.

           MY 	DEAR IDIOT,         SEGAON, WARDHA,  June 	17, 1938 
  	I have never liked the idea of our women seeking foreign aid in 	their fight for freedom.

But if I have to examine their viewpoint, I refuse to read colour 	prejudice where there are other cogent reasons to justify a 	particular course of action. I wonder if this is plain to you. You 	may not agree just yet, though you will in the end. For I am quite 	sure  of  my ground. The women in S. A. rose at a bound by their own 	action.

NAGlibtech_409_footnote","
  
 [Before June 18, 1938] KALIDAS NAG: Wherever I have been . . . non-violence is the question of questions. But it is just a question or a matter of doubt . . . But . . . has not Buddhism
 been responsible for widespread emasculation? And whatever may be the potency of
 non-violence, is it not impossible as a weapon of defence?
 GANDHI: Do you want me to answer these questions or did you reply to them?
 K.N. I have been replying to them after my own historical fashion, but I want you to answer them, for yours will be authentic answers. . . .
 G. Well, the answer is being given in India in actual practice. It is no use citing the example of China and Japan. India is the only place where if an answer must come can come. Experience here is quite encouraging. Intellectually of course even many people in the West have come to recognize the futility of violence and begun to ask if non-violence may not after all be worth a trial. Dr. Stanley Jones has sent me a copy of his recent article, “Gandhian Solution of the Chinese Trouble”—and he has seriously discussed various forms of non-co-operation that may be successfully adopted. There was time when Dr. Jones had not much belief in non-co-operation, but he now seriously suggests it as a non-violent solution, and has pressed me to go to Europe to preach peace. But so long as my mission in India remains unfulfilled, my visit to the West on a peace mission must be a vain effort. Whilst it is true that non-violence has made much head- way in India, it is not of much value to an outsider and a critic at that.
 K. N. What you say, Mahatmaji, is quite correct, viz., that the answer is being given, and if it is really given on such a scale as the size of our country it will be most effective. For their acceptance—even intellectual—of non-violence and non-co- operation is in a spirit of condescension.
 G. It is impossible that a thing essentially of the soul can ever be imparted through the intellect. It is just like trying to impart faith in God through the intellect. It cannot be as it is essentially a matter of the heart. Faith can be turned into knowledge by experience, and it can come only through the heart and not the intellect. The intellect, if anything, acts as a barrier in matters of faith.

292,,A CRITICISM,"
  
 A C. P. correspondent sends me a bitter letter criticizing the
C. P. Ministry.libtech_410_footnotelibtech_411_footnoteI condense it below toning down the bitterest part:
 I have been wanting to write to you for some time but did not do so advisedly. I do so now as one interested in the good government of my province which, I take it, is also your adopted home for the rest of your life. We were led to believe that government by the representatives of the Congress would be so good as to escape calumny and be able to rule for all time merely by reason and by moral influence. But the main purpose of the Congress Ministry appears to us to be.
 to 	worship your idol in 	public and 	break it 	in secret;  to 	worship the 	symbols of 	Imperialism in 	secret and 	denounce them 	in public;  to 	play the 	malefactor towards their 	opponents whom 	they cannot conquer 	by truthful and legitimate methods; to carry on a brisk traffic in legislation and public offices. 
 The government of a people cannot be run, as the Congress Ministers in the C. P. seem to imagine, by the common argument of promised boons and by corrupting the electorate with hope. During the past ten months your Ministers have left no stone unturned to shake the moral foundation of good government of this province. The Ministry and its component parts are honey-combed with intrigues and corruption. To sum up my conclusion, which I wish to convey to you, is that the Congress Party might have been deemed capable of governing had they never assumed power and responsi- bility. Next to assumption of power is the responsibility of relinquishing it. It is strange that your soul should not revolt against such a predatory Ministry for the creation of which the moral responsibility is entirely yours.

 democratic organization with the widest possible franchise. The Working Committee is its mouthpiece and has to work within the limits prescribed for it by the Congress Constitution. It was open to the C. P. Congress representatives to demand resignation from the Ministers, but they did not. On the contrary they wanted the present Ministers to compose their difference and carry on the Government. The Parliamentary Board could not disregard the wishes of the representatives. It had no power to do so. But it did all it could to rid the Ministry of whatever short-comings they had discovered. The Ministers, it must be admitted, offered no opposition to whatever the Board wanted to do. It now remains to be seen how the new arrangement works.
 The point, however, that I wish to make is that the Working Committee does not hush up any evil that is found in the Congress organization. It is not afraid to impose discipline which is readily obeyed in most cases.
 I wholly endorse the correspondent’s proposition that the Congress can only rule “by reason and moral influence”. He and critics like him may rest assured that the Congress will die a natural and deserved death if and when it substitutes reason and moral influence by goondaism.
 One more point. The Congress is composed of  ordinary  mortals. They share the virtues and vices of the nation which they seek to represent. But after all is said and done, it will not be denied that it is the oldest political organization in the country, it is the most representative, it has drawn to itself the best talent in the country, it has the highest amount of sacrifice to its credit. Above all it is the one organization that has offered the greatest resistance to foreign rule and exploitation. Whilst all honest criticism is to be welcomed, I would like to remind the correspondent and other critics that it is open to them to join the Congress and criticize it from within and to try to rid it of all the removable limitations they may discover in it.

 "
293,,QUALIFICATIONS OF A PEACE BRIGADE,"
  
 Some time ago I suggestedlibtech_413_footnotethe formation of a Peace Brigade whose members would risk their lives in dealing with riots, especially communal. The idea was that this Brigade should substitute the police
 
 and even the military. This reads ambitious. The achievement may prove impossible. Yet, if the Congress is to succeed in its non-violent struggle, it must develop the power to deal peacefully with such situations. Communal riots are engineered by politically minded men. Many of those who take part in them are under the influence of the latter. Surely it should not be beyond the wit of Congressmen to devise a method or methods of avoiding ugly communal situations by peaceful means. I say this irrespective of whether there is or there is not a communal pact. It cannot be that any party seeks to force a pact by violent means. Even if such a pact were a possibility, it would not be worth the paper on which it might be written. For behind such a pact there will be no common understanding. What is more, even after a pact is arrived at, it would be too much to expect that there would never be any communal riots.
 Let us therefore see what qualifications a member of the contemplated Peace Brigade should possess.
 He 	or she must 	have a living 	faith in non-violence. 	This is 	impossible without 	a living 	faith in God. 	A non-violent 	man can do 	nothing save by 	the power 	and grace 	of God. 	Without it he won’t 	have the 	courage to 	die without 	anger, without fear and 	without retaliation. 	Such courage 	comes from the 	belief that God 	sits in 	the hearts 	of all 	and that 	there should 	be no 	fear in 	the presence of 	God. The 	knowledge of 	the omnipresence 	of God 	also means 	respect for the 	lives of 	even those 	who may be 	called opponents 	or goondas. 	This contemplated 	intervention is a 	process of 	stilling the fury 	of man 	when the 	brute in 	him gets the 	mastery over him. This 	messenger of 	peace must have equal 	regard for all the 	principal religions of 	the earth. 	Thus, if he is a 	Hindu, he 	will respect 	the other 	faiths current 	in India. 	He must therefore 	possess a knowledge 	of the 	general principles of 	the different 	faiths professed 	in the country. Generally 	speaking this work of 	peace can only be 	done by 	local men in their own localities. The 	work can 	be done 	singly or 	in groups. Therefore no 	one need 	wait for companions. 	Nevertheless one would 	naturally seek 	companions in one’s 	own locality 	and form a 	local brigade. This 	messenger of 	peace will cultivate 	through personal service 	contacts with the people 	in his locality 	or chosen 	circle, so that 	when he 	appears to 	deal with ugly 	situations, he 	does not 	descend upon the members 	of a 	riotous assembly as 	an utter stranger 	liable to be 	looked upon as 	a suspect or 	an unwelcome visitor.  Needless 	to say, a peace bringer 	must have a character 	beyond reproach and must 	be known 	for his strict impartiality.  Generally 	there are previous 	warnings of coming 	storms. If these 	are known, 	the Peace 	Brigade will not wait 	till the conflagration 	breaks out but will try to handle the situation in anticipation.  Whilst, 	if the 	movement spreads, it 	might be 	well if 	there are 	some whole-time 	workers, it is not 	absolutely necessary 	that there 	should be. 	The idea is 	to have as many 	good and 	true men 	and women 	as possible. 	These can be 	had only 	if volunteers 	are drawn 	from those who are 	engaged in 	various walks 	of life 	but have leisure enough to 	cultivate friendly 	relations with the 	people living in 	their circle and 	otherwise possess the 	qualifications required 	of a 	member of 	the Peace Brigade.  There 	should be 	a distinctive 	dress worn by 	the members 	of the contemplated 	Brigade so 	that in course of time 	they will 	be recognized without 	the slightest difficulty. 
 These are but general suggestions. Each centre can work out its own constitution on the basis here suggested.
 Lest false hopes may be raised, I must warn workers against entertaining the hope that I can play any active part in the formation of Peace Brigades. I have not the health, energy or time for it. I find it hard enough to cope with the tasks I dare not shirk. I can only guide and make suggestions through corrspondence or these columns. Therefore let those who appreciate the idea and feel they have the ability, take the initiative themselves. I know that the proposed Brigade has great possibilities and that the idea behind it is quite capable of being worked out in practice.

 WARDHA,
 June 21, 1938
 To questions from the Frontier delegate regarding the non-violence with  special reference to foreign aggression, Mahatma Gandhi said that violence means a vicious circle of conquest and defeat. True freedom is only possible through non- violence and religion lives by non-violence.
 Mahatma Gandhi further said that agriculture is not a craft dependent on social and political condition. Craft training is essential for Indian villages. A compact and   a small area without previous schools and with national work as the background, is necessary for introducing the Wardha scheme which is primarily rural, and for urban areas the same principle with the necessary modifications.

I got your letter. Replies tend to get delayed.
 The reasons which you have mentioned also may be responsible for the scene on the 14th.libtech_418_footnotelibtech_419_footnoteBut a great experiment can be carried out only by enlisting the support of those who are most likely to respond, and only thus can one discover truth. I can now clearly see that it was a fundamental error on my part to have deliberately excluded other co-workers from my experiment. I should have tried to get a class of workers who would be able to carry on the experiment in accordance with conditions laid down by me. My taking it upon myself, instead of finding such a class of workers, was the result of abysmal ignorance and certainly of conceit, too. In consequence, while I would not tole- rate even the most trivial departure from the conditions by my co- workers. I myself committed the most serious blunders. This was the limit of intolerance. The small-mindedness implied in this attitude fills me with disgust for myself; but on the other hand the generosity dis- played by all of you co-workers delights me with its sweet fragrance. This, in brief, is the truth.
 The new  experimentlibtech_420_footnotestarted  on  the  2nd.  But  it  is  only  the beginning as yet. The ship has set sail and is slowly leaving port. It is not easy for one who has been used to sailing in one kind of weather continuously for 40 years to try to sail in weather of another kind. Hence the slowness of speed.
 I am not in a position to advise you much in regard to Gijubhai. But I should certainly like you to consider one point. Gijubhai is a devoted follower of the Montessori system. I know its basic principle. We do not even make an attempt to follow it here. Narandas and you have understood the principles of the Wardha scheme and are convinced of the soundness of the scheme. Probably Gijubhai will not be able to co-operate with you. For, as far as I know him, he will not
 
 be able to co-operate unreservedly in implementing the Wardha scheme.

  	My idea of boycott is that it can be a perfectly non-violent 	measure. When it is that, it becomes a duty. Hence boycott of 	Japanese goods does become a duty for those who consider Japan to be 	wholly in the wrong. And when it becomes a duty, it takes no account 	of consequences.

Courtesy: Amrit Kaur. Also G.N. 6439.       [Before 	June 25, 1938]  Gandhiji 	explained to them 	how almost since the 	beginning of 	his public 	life in 	South Africa he 	had been 	closely associated with labour. When he 	settled down to 	practise at 	the bar in 	South Africa 	he decided 	to give 	the whole of his 	spare time to work 	for the Indian settlers 	there, and the first man 	who came to him 	for assistance was an 	indentured labourer. This 	case at once 	put him in touch 	with labour. 	The labourers 	brought to him 	their troubles with 	their employers and 	also their personal 	and domestic 	worries, and that 	gave him a 	glimpse into 	their lives as nothing 	else could have done. Non-violence was the first thing he placed before them, and non-     
 violence was the only thing that they had been pledged to observe when, at a critical stage in the satyagraha campaign, nearly 60,000 labourers downed their tools and faced imprisonment. They went through untold hardships, suffering, starvation, and some even died, but they adhered to non-violence until the end. Their condition was particularly difficult and in a sense worse than the workers’ here. They were not free, but indentured, and they had to fight not only for justice from their employers but for the abolition of the opprobrious £3 tax which threatened them with extinction. But non-violence helped them to pull through. His work in Champaran and Ahmedabad was recent history. Regarding Champaran he said that the condition of the peasants there was almost the same as the indentured labourers’, and that they had failed in their agitation for nearly half a century for there was no cohesive power of non- violence to hold them together. There had been several riots and their condition had grown worse every year. But the first taste of non-violence breathed new life into them, and at the end of a remarkably brief struggle they were emancipated.
Without that necessary discipline in non-violence, they would
 have internecine strife and would never be ready to develop  the strength that is needed to enable them to realize the power that they possess. Organization, technical skill and everything else would follow the acceptance of the fundamental principle of non- violence. Class collaboration would also follow as a matter of course.  They  are  strong in numbers and yet they feel so dependent, so very much at the mercy of their employers. That is because they do not know their own inherent strength. Otherwise what is there to prevent them from pooling their own resources and dictating terms as employers do now. The thing that they have to realize is that labour is as much capital as metal. That realization can come only through acceptance of non- violence.
 But after that realization has come and they have come to their own, non-violence does not become superfluous. If they were to bid good-bye to it, they would be as bad as capitalists and turn exploiters themselves. The realizaton of their strength combined with adherence to non-violence would enable them to co-operate with capital and turn it to proper use. Then they will not regard it as a conflicting interest, they will not regard the mill and the machinery as belonging to the exploiting agents and grinding them down, but as their own instruments of production, and will therefore protect them as well as they would their own property. They will not steal time and turn out less work, but will put in the most they can. In fact, capital and labour will be mutual trustees and both will be trustees of consumers. The trusteeship theory is not unilateral and does not in the least imply
 superiority of the turstee. It is, as I have shown, a perfectly mutual affair, and each believes that his own interest is best safeguarded by safeguarding the interest of the other. ‘May you propitiate the gods and may the gods propitiate you, and may you reach the highest good by this mutual propitiation,’ says the Bhagavad Gita. There is no separate species called gods in the universe, but all who have the power of production and will work for the community using that power are gods—labourers no less than the capitalists.

 DEAR KHWAJA SAHEB,
 I thank you for your letter of 18th June,1 as also for the letters from prisoners, dated 21st and 26th May respectively. I wish the prisoners’ letters could have been sent to me earlier. I am enclosing replies2 to them, which I hope will be sent to them without delay.
 With regard to the prisoners, I had the benefit of a fairly long chat with Subhas Babu. On his return he hopes to be able to see you, and then, if necessary, ask for permission to see the prisoners. As, very properly, his acceptance and that of Sarat Babu is regarded necessary, it is as well that further negotiations are conducted by one of them. Moreover this arrangement saves me another journey to Bengal. I am sorry to inform you that my health has again become very uncertain owing to the heavy strain of work I have been recently undertaking.
 Before the proposed scheme can be accepted by us three it is necessary that even following out the method of the Government scheme, the result should approximate to what I have submitted in my letter of 13th April last. It I accepted anything less I would be guilty of a breach of faith with the prisoners to whom I gave an absolute assurance, often repeated, that, subject to their subscribing to non- violence, I should strain every nerve to secure early discharge for every one of them. I could, therefore, not be party to any scheme which does not imply such discharge of all prisoners. The method adopted for achieving the end would then cause no difficulty.
 I hope that when Subhas Babu meets you, it will be possible to reach a satisfactory solution. If, at any time, you desire my presence, and if it is likely to facilitate matters, you will please not hesitate to drop me a line and, health permitting, I would gladly visit Bengal.
 Yours sincerely,

  	I have been regretting having called Saraswati. She has been 	miserable ever since you left. She told Vasumati so the day before 	yesterday, and Vasumati told me. I had a long talk with Saraswati. 	She said: “I cannot live without Kanti. Send me to Bangalore.” I 	got into a fluster. I said: “I certainly could not do that. It 	would interfere with Kanti’s studies. It would also spoil your 	life and your parents would not approve of it. But I shall write to 	him. You too may write.” But she was not satisfied with that. She 	told me this morning: “Call Kanti. Send him a telegram.” I did 	not agree at first. Then I felt that I should at least inform you 	and so sent you a telegram. You must have received it. She goes on 	repeating: “If K. does not come, send me to       
 Bangalore.” I did not like your not having stayed on. I am now in a fix. I cannot trust her word. I do not even know what is in your mind. It is my firm opinion that you should make it clear to her that you two cannot live together till you are married. You certainly  cannot abandon your studies and come away. It is a different matter if you marry immediately and live together. But none of her elders would be agreeable to that. Your firmness is absolutely essential in the interest of Saraswati’s progress. Without that she would be completely ruined. And you too will not be happy. But this is only my opinion.

  	I got your letter. I have done all that you wished and more. I have 	arranged for her coaching in Hindi, music, etc. I ask her to sit 	with me. I permit her to eat everything. I have permitted her to 	cook    
 her food with chillies, even offered to get it cooked for her. I have asked Vasumati and Sharda to keep her company. I give her a good deal of my time too. But she wants you. How can I give that?
 You are safe because you can see your errors sooner or later. Being at my wit’s end I have already sent a wire to Ramachandran. I have asked him or Govindan to come over. There has been no reply so far. It was your duty to let me know what happened there.
 Now my advice. If you wish to save yourself and Saraswati you will have to be hard-hearted. You should plainly tell Saraswati that you will neither leave Bangalore nor permit her to come over there; that she will have to stay either at Segaon or at Trivandrum. She will submit to you. But she knows your weakness. She is, of course, a child but you, too, have proved to be a child. I had thought that you were mature and had ability to guide Saraswati. But my judgment has proved to be wrong. You seem to have become completely infatuated. If you find it impossible to overcome the infatuation, then there is no other way for you except to get married. But I would consider it an outrage for you to marry at present. I would not give my consent to it. But you do not need my consent. I would regard it as your duty to do that without which you cannot live. If I cannot give my consent to it because I don’t like it, you should not feel unhappy.
Give up the idea of going to Nagpur. Complete the course there.
 Permit Amtul Salaam to talk. It would be easy for me if you did so. You should trust me. I will not let Amtul Salaam violate propriety.
 I will tell you an interesting thing that happened yesterday. In the morning Saraswati came and asked me to send you a wire stating: “I will be brave,” etc. I asked her to write down the telegram. She, therefore, brought the enclosed. I told her that it being Sunday I would send it today. She was pleased. Before two hours had passed she brought another telegram, also enclosed. It was of course not sent. This is the position. Everything depends on you. I wish to give you all possible help. But all that should be within the limits of dharma. Be mature and steady of mind. At present you should live purely a student’s life. Your life will be ruined if you yield to attachment.
 May God show you the right. path. I will not be in a hurry to send Saraswati to Trivandrum.

 SEGAON, WARDHA,
 July 1, 1938 I thought I had never been one of the domestic circle and had never even tried to be one. There has been an invisible spiritual bond
between us derived from the common loyalty to Dadabhai.  I  have
 regarded you as more than his descendants by blood. You have believed in him and his mission. His life was an inspiration to me when I was yet a boy. I came under his influence before I had known any other Indian leader. That influence has persisted. Soon after I returned to India Perin entered my life and it was more than a joy to me to find Dadabhai’s granddaughter sharing my ideals. This contact grew. And it has become such that I instinctively feel and share the sorrows that overtake you when I come to know of them. I never came near enough to Jalbhai to know him so well as you four sisters. But I knew his great worth from many sources. I knew above all his quiet services. I realize therefore what a shock his death must be to you all. This is to supplement my wire. May the knowledge that I am a silent sharer in your grief lighten it somewhat.
With love to you all,

           CHI. 	KANTI,         SEGAON,  July 	1, 1938 
  	I did not like your wire. How can we stand between Saraswati and her 	parents? How can we insist that she should never visit them at all? 	But now your wire has no meaning. The latest position is this. I had 	a talk with her about a great many things. I joked with her and I 	even assumed a stern tone, but Saraswati did not give up her obsti- 	nacy. Firmly she told me: “Get me married.” I said: “I will 	never agree to that. I cannot attend such a marriage nor can I give 	my blessings. I do not approve of a girl of your age marrying. I am 	a reformer and therefore cannot give my consent to a thing which I 
 don’t approve of. Moreover, I have every fear that Kanti’s studies will suffer as a result of the marriage, and that is another reason why I cannot give my consent. But if your parents agree and Kanti also is willing, then I will not stand in your way and in that case you will not need my blessings.” Saraswati was pleased and said at once: “Then I am ready to go to Trivandrum. You can arrange for that.” I then asked: “Shouldn’t we first ascertain your parents’ and Kanti’s views?’’ So she asked me to write immediately. This conversation took place yesterday during my walk. There was no question of writing a letter then. In the morning I got your wire. I showed it to her and asked her how she could go to Trivandrum now and also how the marriage could take place. But she said: “Kantibhai  is  definitely ready for marriage. My parents also will not object. You should write a letter and after getting his consent send me to Trivandrum.” When during our talk yesterday I agreed not to oppose the marriage to the extent of preventing it, she agreed even to study during the time she had to stay here. She has started learning English from Mr. Kallen- bach’s niece. Today she must have started even the Hindi lessons. This is the position.
 The idea of Nagpur is absolutely useless. Mahadev has already written to you about that. I also have already given you my opinion. I had given my consent only with the hope that your relationship would be an ideal one. At the moment, I do not see any sign of that hope being realized. I said to Saraswati: “Kanti wants that you should be treated as Kanam.” She vehemently protested: “I am not Kanam. I know my interests. I will not stay here without Kantibhai. Please call him for fifteen days.” I cannot make Saraswati obey my orders as you think. I ought not to do that either. The key is solely in your hands. My advice is that you should let Saraswati go to Trivandrum, should flatly refuse to marry just now and should not go to  Trivandrum yourself. You should sacrifice everything else for the  sake of your studies. You should write all this to Saraswati  very frankly. You ought not to leave your studies and come here. But this is, of course, my opinion. If it does not appeal to you and if you are ready to marry, you may by all means do so. You need not bother if I do not think that it will be for your good. Who can foresee the future? My fear may be unjustified and my reasoning may be wrong. You know best what is good for you. You should, therefore, decide as you think best without taking into consideration my opinion and inform me accordingly. In the mean time, I will do whatever may be
 necessary to humour Saraswati. Yesterday I spared four hours for that girl. Vasumati is devoting a good deal of her time to her, but she frankly confesses: “The task is beyond me. How would a girl who does not listen to you listen to me?” Over and above this Kanu also gives some time to her. Lilavati, Sharda, etc., try their level best to make friends with her. But she is not easy to make friends with. It seems she feels somewhat at home with Vasumati, though. I still think that Amtul Salaam might be able to influence her.
Now do as God prompts you and write to me.

  	I got your letter. I have already read through twice the letter to 	Maulana Saheb. I do not reject it but may have to  redraft it 	completely. Hence the delay.

There was no 	reason at all for you to apologize for it. I fully remember the dis- 	cussion at the Sabarmati Ashram. But my impression is the opposite 	of yours. I think also that the subject was discussed on two 	separate occasions. I have a faint impression that at the end of the 	discussion 
 on the first occasion some decision was arrived at regarding my practice of walking with my hand on a girl’s shoulder. Kaka was not present at that discussion. When he came to know about it, he raised the subject again, for he approved of the principle behind  my practice. At the end of the second discussion, my memory is that I had decided to maintain the status quo. Be that as it may, the main point is that I do not think I have failed to do what I had promised to do.
 As regards the Wardha decision, you will see if you read  Harijan1 that the girls, while going in procession from  Maganwadi  to Mahilashram and from Mahilashram to Maganwadi, used to call at my hut and take me out with them. I walked with my hands on their shoulders by turns. This was observed by some people and became the subject of comment. I myself raised the matter for discussion and published the decision at which I finally arrived. It was not in my mind at all that I would never place my hands even on the shoulders of girls who live with me, for after writing that article I continued to use Manu and other girls as my walking-sticks. But that procession stopped, and the practice has not been revived and will not be revived. The reason for stopping it had nothing to do with my vow of brahmacharya. The only consideration was the good of society. In this instance, too, there is no question of my having failed to do what I had declared I would do. If I had made such a declaration and then failed to abide by it, knowing full well that I was doing so, I would be pained and feel humiliated in my own eyes. It would give me no pleasure to know that I had weakened in my determination to keep a vow. Yes, there may be self-deception sometimes; as, for instance, when I decided to drink goat’s milk because my vow forbade me to use cow’s or buffalo’s milk, or when I compromised by counting several vegetables as one item in observing the vow of not consuming more than five items at any one meal. This is a painful memory for me. Even so, I have convinced myself that I have not violated the letter of my pledges and exercise the utmost strictness in observing a vow. I have no comment to make about Thakkar Bapa having been pained. You had no reply to give to the criticism of that muni of Kutch, for you had before you two instances of what you regard to be violation of pledges; you should, therefore, bear that criticism without resentment. Your only reply can be: ‘Even we, who live with him, are puzzled by some of his actions. But we think we have lost nothing by
 
 our association with him, and so we cling to him. I will ask him about the comparision which you have made.’ If you gave this reply, it was correct. If you kept quiet, that also was right. In any case, you can always give this reply: ‘He has always touched girls with a  pure feeling and never with a gross purpose. But a doubt having occurred whether, unknown to him, there might not be an impure feeling in his heart, he has temporarily given up the practice to end that doubt.’
 Personally, I cannot compare the muni’s conduct with mine. According to me, there is a serious error in it. If, however, his own conscience feels nothing wrong in his practice, he should continue it no matter what I do. This is so deep a matter that blind imitation of one another is likely to land one into serious error. Everybody, therefore, should cultivate a vigilant conscience and be guided by it, with God as witness.
 I am trying to issue a statement explaining my position. I wish to satisfy as many co-workers as I can. Let us see if I succeed.
 You do not seem to have understood the meaning of the remark “the ship is still in port”1. It only means that, though the experiment is going on, while discussion about it is still continuing it cannot be said that it is being carried on in thought, speech and action. I can observe its effects only if I go on with it silently. Just now, therefore, it  is being followed only in action. As for thought and speech, we joke about the matter daily. This is enough for today.
 I can say nothing about the Frontier Province just now. I shall see about it afterwards.

  	Saraswati has just showed me your letter. One moment you are angry 	and the next moment you are pleased. How can anybody, therefore, 	feel happy when you are pleased or unhappy when you are angry?  	Have I ever considered your attachment to Saraswati wrong? I felt 	unhappy because I did not see what I had expected of you. But what 	does it matter? It would be best that you appear to me exactly as 	you are.  	Saraswati has been jubilant since the day before yesterday, for she 	has concluded from your letter that she will be marrying you in a 	few days. She was afraid that I would oppose the marriage. She was 	in high spirits the whole of yesterday. She showed me your today's 	letter to her. I feel afraid now that there will be some hitch 	again. I strain myself on her account. I give her as much time as I 	can and do my best to cheer her. But I see that whenever her mind 	gets fixed upon something it is impossible to do that.  	Otherwise I very much like her innocence, her simplicity and her 	childlike nature. I will look after her as long as she stays here. I 	will watch what effect your letter has on her. She has not yet 	talked to me. I did ask her of course.  	You are right when you say that wherever my conclusions are based on 	incomplete information, they are faulty. They must be so. It may be 	called a virtue in a votary of truth, for his conclusions ought to 	be strictly based on the facts in his possession. He should not be 	led astray by any consideration of self-interest and should preserve 	an objective attitude. I should be happy if my condition is such as 	you have described it. That is what it should be. I 	have received a letter from Nagpur saying that yesterday was 
 the last day for filling the posts. There were only nine posts for one of which you were a candidate, and there were sixty applications for those nine. What would you have done in such a crowd?

It is not proper 	that you should first make a doll of her and then treat her as your 	property. Do not dismiss all this in a fit of anger. Remember that  	I am a man of experience.  	I am afraid there is no way out except marriage. After the marriage 	you may do what you like. Do not worry if I do not give my consent 	to the marriage. It should be enough for you that I do not oppose 	it. It would of course be best if you two could bear separation and 	be content with writing to each other from time to time and meeting 	occasionally. But that seems impossible so far as Saraswati is 	concerned. Think over what you should do after the marriage. Discuss 	the matter with me. My feeling is that you will have to give up 	study afterwards. But I shall be happy if my fear is proved wrong 	and both of you study together, as Saraswati says you will. You may 	now think calmly and do what you please. Meanwhile I am tending 	Saraswati like a flower.

  QUESTION: 	What is the place of 	religious instruction in the Wardha Scheme of Education?  ANSWER: 	We have left out the teaching of religions from the Wardha 	Scheme of Education, because we are afraid that religions as they 	are taught and practised today lead to conflict rather than unity. 	But on the other hand, I hold that the truths that are common to all 	religions can and should be taught to all children. These truths 	cannot be taught through words or through books. The children can 	learn these truths only through the daily life of the teacher. If 	the teacher himself lives up to the tenets of truth and justice, 	then alone can the children learn that truth and justice are the 	basis of all religions.  When 	Mahatmaji was asked whether it was possible to teach children 	between the ages of seven and fourteen equal respect for all 	religions he said:  	Yes, I think so. The truth that all religions are the same in 	essentials, that we must love and respect others' faiths as we 	respect our own, is a very simple truth, and can easily be 	understood and practised by children of seven. But, of course, the 	first essential is that the teacher must have this faith himself.  The 	Bombay Chronicle, 	7-7-1938   "

 It is perhaps as well that you will be the only member of your Peace Brigade. This work does not need thousands. True immolation of a few will do the trick.
 You are wrong. I began work among women when I was not even thirty years old. There is not a woman in S.A. who does not know me. But my work was among the poorest. The intellectuals I could not draw. My appeals have always been from heart to hearts. I have felt like fish out of water in the company of intellectuals. Hence you are wrong in laying down the sweeping proposition you have. You can't blame me for not having organized the intellectuals among women. I have not the gift. And then my method of organizing is out of the ordinary, not necessarily superior. All I mean is that I have nothing to show on paper. But just as I never fear coldness on the part of the poor when I approach them, I never fear it when I approach poor women. There is invisible bond between them and me. And why do you miss the agony I am passing through? Is it not for woman kind? I am wringing my soul for adequate purity, to enable me [to] render greater service to them and through them to the whole of
humanity. Ahimsa, which is my sheet-anchor, demands all this.
 I expect your next letter to tell me you are well. Love.

BALWANTSINHA,  	One point in brahmacharya is this that the vital fluid should 	not be wasted. It is supposed that it is not wasted when it moves 	upward. This is not correct. A man giving way to anger mis-spends it 	or rather destroys it, thus rendering it unfruitful. To that extent 	brahmacharya has been damaged. Similarly a man wastes his 	vital fluid when he indulges in intercourse for the sake of 	pleasure, as it is unproductive. 
 When a man has no desire for sensual pleasure and both the man and the woman desire a child and come together for that purpose, then alone is vital fluid completely fruitful. Such a couple are truly brahmacharis. But such a couple might be only one among crores. Apart from the one single occasion of copulation they live  like brother and sister and refrain from any sensual indulgence in thought, speech, contact or any other way. Their intercourse for the purpose of procreation alone can in no way come under the category of gratification of the senses. This ought to clear your doubt.

 "
340,,THE STATES,"
  
 Events seem to have justified the wisdom of the Congress resolution of non-intervention in the affairs of the States. The constitution, however unjust, arbitrary and illogical it may be, is such that, legally and politically, every State, small or big, is an independent entity in its relation to the other States and that part of India which is called British in contradistinction from the States. The similarity common to all is that they are under the iron grip of British Rule. But geographically and ethnically the people of the States and the other parts of India are one and indivisible. We, the thirty-three crores of men and women, are blood relations who cannot be parted by any constitutional or military device. This natural relationship is working itself without let or hindrance because of the recognition of the constitutional fact while it lasts. That is the way of satyagraha or the way of non-resistance to evil. It is the aseptic method in which the physician allows the poison to work itself out by setting in motion all the natural forces and letting them have full play.
 By its resolution of non-interference the Congress put the States people on their mettle, in other words set in motion the natural forces, i.e., the powers latent in the people themselves. In the few recent instances it has been found that the people having discovered their strength they used it without any aid from outside and won  full victory. The result also was that the assistance of Congressmen was invoked by the States’ authorities in order to settle the differences between themselves and their people. No doubt this method like every other known to mankind has its limitations. The Congress cannot
 dictate unreasonable terms. The people must have a real grievance and they must approach it with pure hands. For the tool of satyagraha is ahimsa, i.e., self-suffering without inflicting suffering on the opponent for the vindication of a cause which must be absolutely just.
 If only the people of the States can realize the full meaning and potency of satyagraha, i.e., of non-violence, they will win their relative freedom before India as a whole comes to its own. And they will have to before India has Independence. Thus they can have full liberty of non-violent speech, writing and action without having to deal with cumbersome British machinery. They can secure with comparative ease a more equitable, even if not an equal, distribution of the wealth produced in the States. They can, without much effort, regulate the privy purse of their Princes and can have cheap and pure justice guaranteed. They can deal with the problem of poverty and village reconstruction with infinitely greater ease than in unwieldy and bureaucracy-ridden British India. They can have real national education for the wanting.
 This will be their swaraj—no doubt far short of the Indepen- dence that the Congress wants. But if the people of the majority of the major States attain their full height, the day of Independence will be hastened in a manner no one has dreamt of. Let not the reformers in the States therefore be unduly impatient; let them not forget their limitations and above all the conditions of success, viz., strictest observance of truth and non-violence. They must be ready to face bullets without flinching but also without lifting their little finger in so-called self-defence. A satyagrahi abjures the right of self-defence. Let it also be remembered that a satyagrahi’s minimum is also his maximum.

 "
341,,HIGHER EDUCATION,"
  
 The Rt. Hon. Shri Srinivasa Sastri has criticized, as he had a perfect right to do, the views I timidly and very briefly expressed some time ago on higher education. I entertain a very high regard for him as man, patriot and scholar. It is therefore always painful to me when I find myself disagreeing with him. And yet duty compels me to re-express my views on higher education more fully than before, so that the reader may make out for himself the difference between his views and mine.
 I admit my limitations. I have no university education worth the name. My high school career was never above the average. I was thankful if I could pass my examinations. Distinction in the school was beyond my aspiration. Nevertheless I do hold very strong views on education in general, including what is called higher education. And I owe it to the country that my views should be clearly known and taken for what they may be worth. I must shed the timidity that has led almost to self-suppression. I must not fear ridicule, and even loss of popularity or prestige. If I hide my belief, I shall never correct errors of judgment. I am always eager to discover them and more than eager to correct them.
 Let me now state my conclusions held for a number of years and enforced wherever I had opportunity of enforcing them:
  I 	am not 	opposed to 	education even 	of the 	highest type 	attainable in 	the world. The State must pay for it wherever it has definite use for it.  I 	am opposed 	to all 	higher education being 	paid for 	from the 	general revenue.  It 	is my firm conviction 	that the vast 	amount of the 	so-called education 	in arts, 	given in our colleges, 	is sheer 	waste and has resulted 	in unemployment 	among the 	educated classes. What 	is more, 	it has destroyed 	the health, 	both mental and 	physical, of 	the boys 	and girls who have the misfortune to go through the grind in our colleges.  The 	medium of 	a foreign 	language through which 	higher education has 	been imparted in 	India has 	caused incalculable 	intellectual and 	moral injury to 	the nation. 	We are 	too near our 	own times to 	judge the 	enormity of 	the damage 	done. And we 	who have received such 	education have both 	to be victims  and 	 judges—an almost 	impossible feat. 
 I must now give my reason for the conclusions set forth above. This I can best do, perhaps, by giving a chapter from my own experience.
 Up to the age of 12 all the knowledge I gained was through Gujarati, my mother tongue. I knew then something of arithmetic, history and geography. Then I entered a high school. For the first three years the mother tongue was still the medium. But the school- master’s business was to drive English into the pupil’s head. Therefore more than half of our time was given to learning English and mastering its arbitrary spelling and pronunciation. It was a painful discovery to have to learn a language that was not pronounced as it was written. It was a strange experience to have to learn the spelling by
 heart. But that is by the way, and irrelevant to my argument. However, for the first three years, it was comparatively plain sailing.
 The pillory began with the fourth year. Everything had to be learnt through English—geometry, algebra, chemistry, astronomy, history, geography. The tyranny of English was so great that even Sanskrit or Persian had to be learnt through English, not through the mother tongue. If any boy spoke in the class in Gujarati which he understood, he was punished. It did not matter to the teacher if a boy spoke bad English which he could neither pronounce correctly nor understand fully. Why should the teacher worry? His own English was by no means without blemish. It could not be otherwise. English was as much a foreign language to him as to his pupils. The result was chaos. We the boys had to learn many things by heart, though we could not understand them fully and often not at all. My head used to reel as the teacher was struggling to make his exposition on geometry understood by us. I could make neither head nor tail of geometry till we reached the 13th theorem of the first book of Euclid. And let me confess to the reader that in spite of all my love for the mother tongue  I do not to this day know the Gujarati equivalents of the technical terms of geometry, algebra and the like. I know now that what I took four years to learn of arithmetic, geometry, algebra, chemistry and astronomy I should have learnt easily in one year if I had not to learn them through English but Gujarati. My grasp of the subjects would have been easier and clearer. My Gujarati vocabulary would  have been richer. I would have made use of such knowledge in my own home. This English medium created an impassable barrier between me and the members of my family, who had  not  gone  through English schools. My father knew nothing of what I was doing. I could not, even if I had wished it, interest my father in what I was learning. For though he had ample intelligence, he knew not a word of English.  I was fast becoming a stranger in my own home. I certainly became a superior person. Even my dress began to undergo imperceptible changes. What happened to me was not an uncommon experience. It was common to the majority.
 The first three years in the high school made little addition to my stock of general knowledge. They were a preparation for fitting the boys for teaching them everything through English. High schools were schools for cultural conquest by the English. The knowledge gained by the three hundred boys of my high school became a circumscribed possession. It was not for transmission to the masses.
 
 A word about literature. We had to learn several books of English prose and English poetry. No doubt all this was nice. But that knowledge has been of no use to me in serving or bringing me in touch with the masses. I am unable to say that if I had not learnt what  I did of English prose and poetry, I should have  missed  a  rare treasure. If I had, instead, passed those precious seven years in mastering Gujarati and had learnt mathematics, sciences, and Sanskrit and other subjects through Gujarati, I could easily have shared the knowledge so gained with my neighbours. I would have enriched Gujarati, and who can say that I would not have, with my habit of application and my inordinate love for the country and the mother tongue, made a richer and greater contribution to the service of the masses?
 I must not be understood to decry English or its noble litera- ture. The columns of Harijan are sufficient evidence of my love of English. But the nobility of its literature cannot avail the Indian nation any more than the temperate climate or the scenery of England can avail her. India has to flourish in her own climate and scenery and her own literature, even though all the three may be inferior to the English climate, scenery and literature. We and our children must build on our own heritage. If we borrow another, we impoverish our own. We can never grow on foreign victuals. I want the nation to have the treasures contained in that language, and for that matter the other languages of the world, through its own vernaculars. I do not need to learn Bengali in order to know the beauties of Rabindranath’s matchless produc- tions. I get them through good translations. Gujarati boys and girls do not need to learn Russian to appreciate Tolstoy’s short stories. They learn them through good translations. It is the boast of Englishmen that the best of the world’s literary output is in the hands of that nation in simple English inside of a week of its publication. Why need I learn English to get at the best of what Shakespeare and Milton thought and wrote?
 It would be good economy to set apart a class of students whose business would be to learn the best of what is to be learnt in the different languages of the world and give the translation in the vernaculars. Our masters chose the wrong way for us, and habit has made the wrong appear as right.
 I find daily proof of the increasing and continuing wrong being done to the millions by our false de-Indianizing education. Those graduates who are my valued associates themselves flounder when they have to give expression to their innermost thoughts. They are strangers in their own homes. Their vocabulary in the mother tongue
 is so limited that they cannot always finish their speech without having recourse to English words and even sentences. Nor can they exist without English books. They often write to one another in English. I cite the case of my companions to show how deep the evil has gone. For we have made a conscious effort to mend ourselves.
 It has been argued that the wastage that occurs in our colleges need not worry us if, out of the collegians, one Jagadish Bose can be produced by them. I should freely subscribe to the argument if the wastage was unavoidable. I hope I have shown that it was and is even now avoidable. Moreover, the creation of a Bose does not help the argument. For Bose was not a product of the present education. He rose in spite of the terrible handicaps under which he had to labour. And his knowledge became almost intransmissible to the masses. We seem to have come to think that no one can hope to be like a Bose unless he knows English. I cannot conceive a grosser superstition than this. No Japanese feels so helpless as we seem to do.
 Nothing but a heroic remedy can deal with the deep-seated evil which I have endeavoured to describe. The Congress Ministers can, if they will, mitigate it if they cannot remove it.
 Universities must be made self-supporting. The State should simply educate those whose services it would need. For all other branches of learning it should encourage private effort. The medium of instruction should be altered at once and at any cost, the provincial languages being given their rightful place. I would prefer temporary chaos in higher education to the criminal waste that is daily accumulating.
 In order to enhance the status and the market value of the provincial languages, I would have the language of the law courts to be the language of the province where the court is situated. The proceedings of the Provincial Legislatures must be in the language, or even the languages of the province where a province has more than one language within its borders. I suggest to the legislators that they could, by enough application, inside of a month, understand the languages of their provinces. There is nothing to prevent a Tamilian from easily learning the simple grammar and a few hundred words of Telugu, Malayalam and Kanarese, all allied to Tamil. At the centre Hindustani must rule supreme.
 In my opinion this is not a question to be decided by acade- micians. They cannot decide through what language the boys and girls of a place are to be educated. That question is already decided
 
 for them in every free country. Nor can they decide the subjects to be taught. That depends upon the wants of the country to which they belong. Theirs is the privilege of enforcing the nation’s will in the best manner possible. When this country becomes really free the question of medium will be settled only one way. The academicians will frame the syllabus and prepare text-books accordingly. And the products of the education of a free India will answer the requirements of the country as today they answer those of the foreign ruler. So long as we the educated classes play with this question. I very much fear we shall not produce the free and healthy India of our dream. We have to grow by strenuous effort out of our bondage, whether it is educational, economical, social or political. The effort itself is three- fourths of the battle.
 Thus I claim that I am not an enemy of higher education. But I am an enemy of higher education as it is given in this country. Under my scheme there will be more and better libraries, more and better laboratories, more and better research institutes. Under it we should have an army of chemists, engineers and other experts who will be real servants of the nation and answer the varied and growing requirements of a people who are becoming increasingly conscious of their rights and wants. And all these experts will speak not a foreign language but the language of the people. The knowledge gained by them will be the common property of the people. There will be truly original work instead of mere imitation. And the cost will be evenly and justly distributed.

 CHI. NARANDAS,
 I  got  your  pamphlet1.  The Rentia Baras  day  is  or  should be the time for drawing up an annual balance-sheet of the progress of khadi work and thinking out ways and means of speeding it up. I see that your resolutions are increasing in number every year. But in comparison to what we have to achieve, even this increased number of resolutions are nothing. According to the saying, ‘drop by drop fills the lake’, we should content ourselves with doing the best we are capable of. Let all participants in this yajna remember that we should not rest satisfied till the daily income of all workers including the spinners reaches eight annas for a day of eight hours. And in order to achieve that we should be proficient in all aspects of the charkha science. In that way we shall be able to improve the quality of the khadi without raising the prices very much. If we master that science, we can prove that khadi, though apparently costly, is actually bound to be cheap.
 I hope to be able to send someone for the Rentia Baras day.

 I write this just as I got your letter and before destroying it. You must not allow your imagination to destroy your sanity. I have taken no drastic step. I shifted to Pyarelal’s hole for giving Hanna the privacy she needed. She is wholly unaccustomed to our ways. I have now come back and you will occupy your usual corner. Sharda is my constant attendant. Amtul Salaam sleeps by my side, fans me and covers me when I need more covering. She feeds me. Lilavati is helping Mahadev, Shanta having gone back to England. You must not be quite so idiotic as you seem to have become over my travail. It is there. But my faith in my original conception is not shattered. Only I must learn how to realize it. Bad dreams must be avoided. There must be no repetition of 14th April.
 Hanna has been sent by Kallenbach to gain experience and to know me personally as she has known me through him for years. She is most lovable but I fear she is too delicate to be able to stay here long.
 I shall expect you on 23rd, the day of the meeting of the W. C. It is quite cool just now but the road is fearfully muddy. You will feel  a little crowded. But that you won’t mind.
 You are criminally wasting your body. There is no occasion for all the neglect of which you are guilty. Some people deem it a merit to neglect their bodies. I wish you would have your name removed from the register of these illustrious criminals.

  	You are at present ruling over me. I often feel like complaining but 	I dare not. How did I come to have so much fear?  	I am perturbed by Hakumat Rai’s warning. Sushila will not recover 	if she is forced to eat. She will recover only when the fear 
 which is lodged in her mind is removed. I have not seen such a woman anywhere. I cannot bear to look at her face. You see how unhappy Ba is.
 I am trying hard to comprehend your idea of your duty but I am baffled. I find your fasts irksome. I shall suffer so long as you make me suffer. But is it not your duty to let me know?
 Is my experience worth nothing at all? It is true that I no longer have the right to write like this after my lapse of April 14. But since you attach no importance to the lapse you should give my writing the importance it deserves.
 I have freed you from all anxiety. If you must fast, I will not fast with you. Right now I am doing it without any deliberation. I am trying to follow whither God leads me. But who knows if it is notSatan rather than God guiding me? But I am carrying on in the belief that it is God who is guiding me. My wish is not to worry about you or Sushila. But that does not happen. I do worry about those who have become part of me. Free me from anxiety on your account if you can. Consider Sushila.

 SEGAON,
 [July 14, 1938]
 I welcome your advertising the principles in defence of which Hind Swaraj was written.1 The English edition is a translation of the original which was in Gujarati. I might change the language here and there if I had to rewrite the booklet. But after the stormy thirty years through which I have since passed, I have seen nothing to make me alter the views expounded in it. Let the reader bear in mind that it is a faithful record of conversations I had with workers, one of whom was an avowed anarchist. He should also know that it stopped the rot that was about to set in among some Indians in South Africa. The reader
 
 all nevertheless saw the great importance of the work. Frederick Soddy, for instance, though disagreeing with Gandhiji, suggested that “anyone who wishes to change the world would do well to study” the book. To G. D. H. Cole Gandhiji’s case against the West looked “infinitely stronger” than it did in 1908, when “the ephemeral civilization of the West looked stable under Western eyes”. C. Delisle Burns saw the highest merit of Hind Swaraj “in its emphasis upon moral issues and opposition to the pursuit of private wealth and power”. John Middleton Murry considered Hind Swaraj a “great book”, “one of the spiritual classics of the world”, and compared
 Gandhiji’s vision of real swaraj to the Christian vision of the Kingdom of Heaven. Gerald Heard thought Hind Swaraj was superior to Rousseau’s Social Contract and Karl Marx’s Das Capital, for it did not mark the end of an age but the beginning of a new order. Irene Rathbone found the book “enormously powerful”, the language of which forced her “by its tremendous honesty to search my own honesty”. She thought the work was “simple and logical, economical, condensed, poetic”. Hugh Fausset
 summed up Hind Swaraj as a book whose purpose was “to save India, not from
 Englishmen, but from the modern civilization which is eating into the vitals of the West”. He had enough trust in the indestructible vitality of the human spirit to be sure that it would not allow itself to be lastingly mechanized. The machine was exposing ruthlessly the consequences that must happen to men and nations who had lost their integrity. Hind Swaraj was an attempt at restoring man to his true estate, and was, for this reason, “one of the best modern handbooks of that real revolution which must happen in us all, if we are to fulfil the creative purpose of life”.
 
 may balance against this the opinion of a dear friend, who, also, is no more, that it was the production of a fool.libtech_445_footnote

  	What a sad and wretched letter, yours of 11th. I am enjoying myself 	and you are sorrowing for nothing. When you come here, you will 	laugh at your own folly. My misery is superficial if there is any 	yet left. My peace cannot be permanently taken away by anything or 	anybody. You simply do not know me if you think that  my experiences 	have undone me. If there is real attempt at purification, it must 	strengthen me and make me more joyful. But how can I help you if you 	must allow your imagination to run riot?      had 	also asked some questions which she said Mahadev Desai could answer 	if Gandhiji was busy.  
 You have to apologize about women. I could not organize intellectual women as such.libtech_449_footnoteI have not organized intellectual men as such. But this thing does not lend itself to argument. I simply cannot subscribe to the charge that there has been any neglect on my part about organizing women. It may be that I have not had the qualifi- cations for doing better. But that would [be] no charge against me. However I do not mind your complaint. I rather like it. It shows that there are things in which we look at things differently. And why not? True affection does not demand identity of outlook. But I do not even on this point despair of convincing you that I could not have done better than I have. My passion for brahmacharya has that meaning. I must be wholly pure if I have true love for womankind.

Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	the Gujarati original: Pyarelal Papers. Nehru Memorial Museum and 	Library. Courtesy : Beladevi Nayyar and Dr. Sushila Nayyar       	Some controversy has raged round  the propriety  of  the Speakers of 	the various Provincial Assemblies taking an active part in politics. 	There has been the Speaker’s ruling and a full debate and a 	resolution in the U. P. Assembly to the effect that the Speaker can 	consistently with the due discharge of the obligations of office 	take an active part in politics. Shri Sambamurti was with me for a 	few days and exhaustively discussed the question with me. He read to 	me copious extracts from authoritative treatises dealing with the 	Speakers’ duties in the Parliaments of the world. And there has 	appeared an article in Harijan by Shri Satyamurti. I had a 	long discussion on the question with Shri Purushottamdas Tandon 	during his recent visit to Wardha.  	After all these discussions and study of the subject I seem to hold 	a view perhaps different from those I have heard and read. Mine is 	derived from my conception of the acceptance of office by Con- 	gressmen. When I advised the Working Committee to authorize accep- 	tance of office, the idea was that whilst the letter of the 	Government of 
 India Act should not be transgressed, its interpretation should be stretched to the farthest limit so as to widen the liberty of the people and to strengthen the Congress. The Act was not to be worked in the manner conceived by its authors, but while it lasted should be fully used for the advancement of the Congress goal and therefore in a manner least expected by its authors. Such being my conception of office acceptance, British and foreign precedents are of little use to me. Moreover, in the nature of things, they can help us but little for the simple reason that unlike ours the constitutions of the world’s Parliaments are not imposed on the respective peoples but are their own creation.
 A Congressman who is a member of an Assembly, no matter what office he occupies there, is subject to the discipline of the Congress and has to carry out its instructions from time to time. Therefore, so long as the Government of India Act does not in so many words prohibit it, the Congress may, if it thinks it necessary, require Speakers in the Congress Provinces to take an active part in the politics of the country.
 But the Congress, as far as I know, has not considered the ques- tion. In my opinion Congressmen who are members of Assemblies, whether as mere members or Ministers or Speakers, have in every act of theirs to bear in mind the fact that they have, in virtue of the Congress constitution, to conform to truth and non-violence. Thus the conduct of a Congressman in an Assembly would have to be that of strictest honesty and courtesy in dealing with his opponents. He will not resort to shady politics, will not hit below the belt, will never take a mean advantage of his adversary. The greater his position in the Assembly, the greater is his responsibility in these matters. A member in the Assembly no doubt represents his constituency and his party but he also represents the whole of his province. A Minister no doubt advances his own party but never at the expense of the nation as a whole. Indeed he advances the Congress only so far as he advances the nation. For he knows that if he has no sword to give battle to the foreign ruler, he has it not to give battle to his adversary inside the nation itself. And since the Assembly is the place where all commu- nities meet together willy-nilly, it is the place where by winning over his opponents he expects to forge sanctions which can be made irresistible. All the problems that affect the body politic including communal unity can be solved if the Assembly is regarded not merely
 in terms of the Government of India Act but as an instrument to be used for solving questions which representatives of different commu- nities composing the nation can be expected to solve if they had unrestricted powers. And the Government of India Act does not pre- vent the use of the Assemblies for solving the many problems which are outside its scope but which are necessary for national progress.
 Looked at from the point of view here suggested, the Speaker’s position assumes very high importance, greater than that of the Prime Minister. For he has to discharge the functions of a judge while he occupies the chair. He has to give impartial and just rulings. He has to enforce decorum and laws of courtesy between members. He has to be calm in the midst of storms. He has opportunities of winning over opponents which no other member of the House can possibly have.
 Now if a Speaker outside the House ceases to be impartial and indulges in party polemics, he cannot possibly carry the weight he would if he observed impartiality and calmness everywhere. I claim that if a Speaker cultivates the habit of uniform impartiality outside his own very limited sphere, he will enhance the Congress prestige. He can, if he realizes the unique opportunity his office gives him, pave the way for the solution of the Hindu-Muslim tangle as also many others. Thus in my opinion the Speaker, if he has to be that not only inside but outside the House, must be a first-class Congressman. As a man too he has to have a character without reproach. He must be able, fearless, naturally just, and above all truthful and non-violent in thought, word and deed. Then he may stand on any platform he likes.

360,,SOME OBJECTIONS,"
  
A Muslim correspondent writes:
 During the last four months opinions have been appearing in the Urdu Press regarding the Wardha scheme. As usual nobody seems to have read the report carefully or to have thought out the subject of basic educations. The objections centre round three points:
 that 	religious instruction has 	been completely ignored; that 	boys and girls 	are to be taught together; and  that 	a respect 	for all religions 	is to be inculcated. 	These objections have been culled from the Urdu Press. 
Religious instruction in the sense of denominational religion has
been deliberately omitted. Unless there is a State religion it is very
 difficult, if not impossible, to provide religious instruction as it would mean providing for every denomination. Such instruction  is  best given at home. The State should allow enough time for every child to receive such instruction at home or otherwise. It is also conceivable that the State should provide facilities for private tuition by those denominations which may wish to instruct their children at school provided that such instruction is paid for by such denominations.
 As for co-education, the Zakir Husain Committee has not made it compulsory. Where there is a demand for a separate school for girls, the State will have to make provision. The question of co-education has been left open. It will regulate itself according to the time-spirit. So far as I am aware the members of the Committee were not all of one mind. Personally I have an open mind. I think that there are just as valid reasons for as against co-education. And I would not oppose the experiment wherever it is made.
 As to the necessity of teaching equal regard for all religions, I personally hold strong views. Till we reach that happy state, I see no prospect of real unity among all the different communities. I regard it as fatal to the growth of a friendly spirit among the  children  belonging to the different faiths if they are taught either that their religion is superior to every other or that it is the only true religion. If that exclusive spirit is to pervade the nation, the necessary corollary would be that there should be separate schools for every denomi- nation with freedom to each to decry every other, or that the mention of religion must be entirely prohibited. The result of such a policy is too dreadful to contemplate. Fundamental principles of ethics are common to all religions. These should certainly be taught to the children and that should be regarded as adequate religious instruction so far as the schools under the Wardha scheme are concerned.

361,"July 16, 1938",A FALLACY,"
  
 July 16, 1938
 An A.I.S.A. agent asks what he is to say to his co-workers who have formed a union and presented him with terms. I regard the for- mation of such unions a fallacy. The workers have evidently missed the scope and the message of the A.I.S.A. It is a philanthropic organization formed by the Congress and has been given an autonomous charter for the specific purpose of developing the central village industry of hand-spinning and all it implies. Those who are
 engaged in this voluntary organization not only derive no pecuniary advantage from it but are expected, if they can, to give their labour free of any hire. And since in this the poorest country in the world many persons cannot do so, a large number are paid an emolument only enough to sustain them. Whilst every attempt is made to make them comfortable, they are not regarded as employees in the ordinary sense. There are no profits shared by anyone. If there are share- holders or proprietors, they are the spinners, weavers and the like. Even the consumers are not beneficiaries. They are expected to wear khadi not because it is cheaper or better to look at than mill cloth, but because it gives employment to the largest number of half-starved half-employed persons, mostly women. The whole of the takings go to these dumb artisans after deducting the salaries and other expenses incurred in running this vast philanthropic organization.
 If, therefore, any body of workers form unions as against the Association, they are against the  artisans.  What  they take  has  to come out  of the  pockets of the  artisans  or the  consumers. It would be manifestly absurd to tax the consumers in the interest of the workers. Will they, the workers, not realize that the agents are themselves as much workers as they themselves? In several cases the agents are purely honorary. It is of course a different thing where an agent is found to be going beyond his sphere of duty and acting as if he was the lord and master of, instead of being co-worker with, the men working with and under him. In such a case the workers have their remedy through the central office but surely not through unions after the orthodox style. In the one case they are a necessity, in the other they are not only superfluous, but they are, as I have said above, a fallacy and, if persisted in on a wide scale, they may kill the Asso- ciation of which they are part creators and trustees.

We can even question whether it is right for a brahmachari to 	engage in any activity at all. But the problem before us is to 	determine when brahmacharya is violated.

 July 19, 1938
 MY DEAR AGATHA,
 Here is a letter  received  by  Dr.  Shaukatullah  Shah from H.E.’s office about Harold Ansari. Poor Shaukatullah has not yet built up any practice worth the name. He  has  sent  all  the  money  he could scrape together. And now he has nothing. He and Zohra, Dr. Ansari’s daughter, were with me for two days. Shaukatullah had drafted a reply which I advised him not to send. Now I would like you or Polak to find out and tell me what this Education Department is and what is its function. Does it help students in distress? I am anxious to find the money here. But this is a difficult case. In any case Harold’s studies must not suffer. If therefore the Department can make an advance, they should do so in the hope of recovering it from the heirs or Harold himself when he begins to earn. If you know Harold and his mother, do please get in touch with them and guide me. I am writing to Harold too. I have never met the boy. Of course I knew nothing of Dr. Ansari’s domestic affairs.
 I am sending you the papers Dr. S. has left with me. Please return after use.
Love.

 SEGAON, WARDHA,
 July 19, 1938
 DEAR NAWAB SAHEB,
 Zohra and Shaukat were with me for two days. They left yesterday. It was distressing to learn from them that they were unable to discharge the obligations left by Dr. Ansari. His boy Harold has to finish his education. Harold’s mother has to be supported. This means
 £35 per month for 3 years at the end of which Harold should finish his education. Dr. Ansari has left petty debts amounting to Rs. 12,000. I know the intimate friendship that existed between you and the late Dr. Ansari. I know too that you sent some help after Dr. Ansari’s death.
 But as Zohra and Shaukat were talking to me I could not help thinking of you and asking you to come to the rescue if it is at all possible for you to do so. I hardly need add anything by way of pleading this cause. For I know that you had known Dr. Ansari before  I had the privilege of knowing him.
I hope you are keeping excellent health.

  	You do not seem to have got the mail sent form here in the morning 	by the time you sent the mail from there. It contained four letters 	and a list of medicines for Sushila.  	You did right in not coming. When there is no work, you can skip the 	day.  	The Danish engineer has captivated my heart. One does not come 	across many such frank faces.  	I am sending with this some other letters. “Skill overhead”1 	is all right. As we reduce “overhead charges”, we 	increase “over-head    
 skill”. But if “skill overhead” does not seem correct English, you may change it suitably after understanding the meaning.

KALELKAR","
  	Sarvodaya is impossible without satyagraha. The word satyagraha 	should be understood here in its etymological sense. There can be no 	insistence on truth where there is no non-violence. Hence the 	attainment of sarvodaya depends upon the attainment of non- 	violence. The attainment of non-violence in its turn depends upon 	tapascharya. Tapascharya, again, should be pure. 	Ceaseless effort, discretion, etc., should form part of it. Pure 	tapascharya leads to pure knowledge. Experience shows that 	although people talk of non- violence, many are mentally so lazy 	that they do not even take the trouble of familiarizing themselves 	with the facts. Take an example. India is a poor country. We wish to 	do away with poverty. But how many people have made a study of how 	this poverty came about, what its implications are, how it can be 	removed, etc.? A devotee of non- violence, should be full of such 	knowledge.  	It is the duty of Sarvodaya to create such means and not to 	enter into controversies. Editors of Sarvodaya should forget 	Gandh- ism. There is no such thing as Gandhism. I have not put 	anything new before India; I have only presented an ancient thing in 	a new way. I have tried to utilize it in a new field. Hence my ideas 	cannot be appropriately called Gandhism. We shall adopt truth 	wherever we find it, praise it wherever we see it, and pursue it. In 	other words, in every sentence of Sarvodaya, we should catch 	a glimpse of non-violence and knowledge.  From 	a photostat of the Hindi: G.N. 7680.

  	I re-read your letter with care. I think that my answer should have 	sufficed. The only answer to the question as to when the desire for 	procreation may be regarded justified is when a couple desires 	offspring without desiring sexual pleasure. This was believed so in 	the case of Dasharatha. The whole process has been given the 	character of dharma. What 	you write about the mastery over sexual passion is correct.  	My interpretation of  	 ”libtech_464_footnotelibtech_465_footnoteis that he who is wholly free from attachment will not 	kill at all. Thus the expression may be regarded as an exaggeration. 	My walking up to Wardha may not be called dharma but it is not 	adharma either. The same is true of the utterance on 	procreation.  	Now this answers all your doubts. If not, put them to me in the form 	of questions and I shall answer.     	“Discourses 	on the “Gita” 
 One suggestion. My pronouncements should not be taken as authority. They are not all revelations. Some are empirical, some rational.

  	I forgot to give today three of the accompanying letters. I did not 	look into the pad.  	I hope you remember that Rajkumari is coming tomorrow, the 23rd. She 	is arriving by the Grand Trunk Express. Come after making 	arrangements for receiving her at the station. If it is  raining,  	she  should be detained there.  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	a photostat of the Gujarati:S. N. 11610.       	A Congress leader said to me the other day in the course of our 	conversation, “How is it that in quality the Congress is not what 	it used to be in 1920-25 ? It has deteriorated. Ninety percent of 	the members are not carrying out the Congress discipline. Can you 	not do something to mend this state of things ?’’  	The question is apposite and timely. I can’t shirk responsibility 	by saying I am no longer in the Congress. I have gone out of it for 	the purpose of serving it better. I know that I still influence the 	Congress policy. As the author of the Congress constitution of 1920. 	I must hold myself responsible for such deterioration as is 	avoidable.  	The Congress started with an initial handicap in 1920. Very few 	believed in truth and non-violence as a creed. Most members accepted 	them as a policy. It was inevitable. I had hoped that many would 	accept them as their creed after they had watched the working of the 	Congress under the new policy. Only some did, not many. In the 	beginning stages, the change that came over the foremost leaders was 	profound. Readers will recall the letters from the late Pandit 	Motilal Nehru and Deshbandhu Das reproduced in Young India. 	They had experienced a new joy and a new hope in a life of 	self-denial, simplicity and self-sacrifice. The Ali Brothers had 	almost become fakirs. As we toured from place to place, I watched 	with delight the 
 change that was coming over the Brothers. What was true of these four leaders was true of many others whom I can name. The enthusiasm of the leaders had infected the rank and file.
 But this phenomenal change was due to the spell of ‘swaraj in one year’. The conditions I had attached to the fulfilment of the formula were forgotten. Khwaja Saheb Abdul Majid even went so far as to suggest that, as the general of the satyagraha army, which the Congress had then become and still is (if only Congressmen realize the meaning of satyagraha), I should have made sure that the conditions were such that they would be fulfilled. Perhaps he was right. Only I had no such prevision in me. The use of non-violence on  a mass scale and for political purposes was even for myself an experiment. I could not therefore dogmatize. My conditions were meant to be a measure of popular response. They might or might not be fulfilled. Mistakes, miscalculations were always possible. Be that as it may, when the fight for swaraj became prolonged and Khilafat ceased to be a live issue, enthusiasm began to wane, confidence in non-violence even as a policy began to be shaken, and untruth crept in. People who had no faith in the twin virtues or the khadi clause stole in, and many even openly defied the Congress constitution.
 The evil has continued to grow. The Working Committee has been making some attempt to purge the Congress of the evil but has not been able to put its foot down and risk the loss of numbers on the Congress register. I myself believe in quality rather than quantity.
 But there is no such thing as compulsion in the scheme of non- violence. Reliance has to be placed upon ability to reach the intellect and the heart—the latter rather than the former.
 It follows that there must be power in the word of a satyagraha general—not the power that the possession of limitless arms gives, but the power that purity of life, strict vigilance, and ceaseless application produce. This is impossible without the observance of brahmacharya. It must be as full as it is humanly possible. Brahmacharya here does not mean mere physical self-control. It means much more. It means complete control over all the senses. Thus an impure thought is a breach of brahmacharya; so is anger. All power comes from the preservation and sublimation of the vitality that is responsible for creation of life. If the vitality is husbanded instead of being dissipated, it is transmuted into creative energy of the highest order. This vitality is continuously and even unconsciously dissipated by evil, or even
 rambling, disorderly, unwanted thoughts. And since thought is the root of all speech and action, the quality of the latter corresponds to that of the former. Hence perfectly controlled thought is itself power of the highest potency and can become self-acting. That seems to me to be the meaning of the silent prayer of the heart. If man is after the image of God, he has but to will a thing in the limited sphere allotted to him and it becomes. Such power is impossible in one who dissipates his energy in any way whatsoever, even as steam kept in a leaky pipe yields no power. The sexual act divorced from the deliberate purpose of generation is a typical and gross form of dissipation and has therefore been specially and rightly chosen for condemnation. But in one who has to organize vast masses of mankind for non-violent action the full control described by me has to be attempted and  virtually achieved.
 This control is unattainable save by the grace of God. There is a verse in the second chapter of Gita which freely rendered means.: “Sense effects remain in abeyance whilst one is fasting or whilst the particular sense is starved, but the hankering does not cease except when one sees God face to face.”libtech_469_footnoteThis control is not mechanical or temporary. Once attained it is never lost. In that state vital energy is stored up without any chance of escaping by the innumerable outlets.
 It has been said that such brahmacharya, if it is at all attainable, can be so only by cave-dwellers. A brahmachari, it is said, should never see, much less touch a woman. Doubtless a brahmachari may not think of, speak of, see or touch a woman lustfully. But the prohibition one finds in books on brahmacharya is mentioned  without the important adverb. The reason for the omission seems to be that man is no impartial judge in such matters, and therefore cannot say when he is or is not affected by such contacts. Cupid’s visitations are often unperceivable. Difficult though therefore brahmacharya is of observance when one freely mixes with the world. it is not of much value if it is attainable only by retirement from the world.
 Anyway, I have practised brahmacharya for over thirty years with considerable success though living in the midst of activities. After the decision to lead the life of a brahmachari there was little change in my outward  practice,  except  with   my   wife.   In   the   course   of my work among the Indians in South Africa, I mixed freely with women. There was hardly an Indian woman in the Transvaal and Natal
 
 whom I did not know. They were so many sisters and daughters to me. My brahmacharya was not derived from books. I evolved my own rules for my guidance and that of those who, at my invitation, had joined me in the experiment. If I have not followed the prescribed restrictions, much less have I accepted the description found even in religious literature of woman as the source of all evil and temptation. Owing as I do all the good there may be in me to my mother, I have looked upon woman never as an object for satisfaction of  sexual desire but always with the veneration due to my own mother. Man is the tempter and aggressor. It is not woman whose touch defiles man but he is often himself too impure to touch her. But recently a doubt has seized me as to the nature of the limitation that a brahmachari or brahmacharini should put upon himself or herself regarding contacts with the opposite sex. I have set limitations which do not satisfy me. What they should be I do not know. I am experimenting. I have never claimed to have been a perfect brahmachari of my definition. I have not acquired that control over my thoughts that I need for my researches in non-violence. If my non-violence is to be contagious and infectious, I must acquire greater control over my thoughts. There is perhaps a flaw somewhere which accounts for the apparent failure of leadership adverted to in the opening sentence of this writing.
 My faith in non-violence remains as strong as ever. I am quite sure that not only should it answer all our requirements  in  our country, but that it should, if properly applied, prevent the bloodshed that is going on outside India and is threatening to overwhelm the Western world.
 My aspiration is limited. God has not given me the power to guide the world on the path of non-violence. But I have imagined that he has chosen me as His instrument for presenting non-violence to India for dealing with her many ills. The progress already made is great. But much more remains to be done. And yet I seem to have lost the power to evoke the needed response from  Congressmen  in general. It is a bad carpenter who quarrels with his tools. It is a bad general who blames his men for faulty workmanship. I know I am not  a bad general. I have wisdom enough to know my limitations. God will give me strength enough to declare my bankruptcy if such is to be my lot. He will perhaps take me away when I am no longer wantedfor the work which I have been permitted to do for nearly half a century. But I do entertain the hope that there is yet work for me to do, that the darkness that seems to have enveloped me will disappear,
 and that, whether with another battle more brilliant than the Dandi March or without, India will come to her own demonstrably through non-violent means. I am praying for the light that will dispel the darkness. Let those who have a living faith in non-violence join me in the prayer.

397,"July 23, 1938",DUTY OF KHADI-WEARERS,"
  
 July 23, 1938
 I have before me several letters, some protesting against the constant rise in the price of khadi, and some piteously appealing to me to show the way to poor middle-class people for buying dear khadi.
 The A. I. S. A. exists only for the betterment of the khadi producers, the majority of whom are poor women spinners. I hold that the Association cannot be satisfied till every woman who puts in an honest hour in spinning gets one anna per hour. We are on the point of reaching half an anna per hour, and if the consumers and the Congress Governments do their duty, the Association expects to give the anna per hour much earlier than most people expect.
 This must mean some rise in the price of khadi, but not a proportionate rise. City people should know that ceaseless effort is being made to evoke greater skill among the artisans so that the whole of the increase in the wages may not fall upon khadi.  Overhead charges are also being constantly reduced. Skill overhead increases with experience. But sixteen times increase in the wages of spinners cannot all be brought about merely by increased efficiency Therefore some rise in the price of khadi is inevitable with the increase in the wages. This is being unequally distributed among the different varieties so that the heaviest rise will take place in the khadi that is purchased by the monied classes. Everything that can be done to ease the burden on poor buyers is being done and will be done by the Association.
 But khadi-wearers should know that the economics of khadi are different from the ordinary economics which are based on competi- tion in which patriotism, sentiment and humanity play little or no part. Khadi economics are based on patriotism sentiment and humanity.
 Before the new policy of the Association was laid down, its aim was to cheapen khadi, mostly in disregard of the wages of the
 
 spinners, the most helpless artisans perhaps in the world. This con- tinued for nearly a decade. It was a mistaken ploicy, but the mistake was unconscious and based on faulty reasoning. I must  take  the largest share of the blame for the mistake. Khadi-wearers had the sole benefit of the mistake. Is it right for them to complain when the mistake is being repaired and the spinners are gradually being paid what is their due ?
 The Association has expected hearty co-operation from the khadi-wearers and I am glad to be able to say that on the whole the increase in the price of khadi has not been resented by them. Many consider it a privilege that they are partners in the tardy justice that is being done to the dumb sisters whose need is infinitely greater than that of the wearers of khadi.
 I know that there are many middle-class persons who find it difficult to make the two ends meet, and for them every additional anna becomes a problem. And they will not spin. They have my sym- pathy. But they cannot have it both ways. If they will not spin, they should cut down their requirements or reduce other expenses. In this climate we do not need the clothes we use. Where there is a will there is a way.
 A correspondent suggests that khadi is mainly supported by the poor middle class, and contends that if the prices are not brought down to the level at which they can buy it, it will not survive me. If that is the condition on which alone khadi can live, it deserves to predecease me. Happily there is a fallacy behind the argument. The question of cheapness mainly affects the city-dwellers. If all of them, rich and poor, took to khadi, they could hardly use more than ten percent of the possible production of khadi. The rest has to be used by the producers themselves who are villagers. The question of price does not affect them materially, if at all. It is true that khadi has not penetrated the villages to the extent expected. During the transition period, therefore, it has to depend upon the patriotic spirit of city dwellers both rich and poor. Those who believe in the message of khadi will not consider any price too dear for khadi. It is the only real insurance against famine and unemployment. Even if India were to be industrialized overnight, much of the unemployment would remain. In this country the problem is to find work for a whole nation which has one-fourth of her time without occupation. If pestilence, poverty and blood-shed are to be avoided, there is no remedy but khadi and
 other village industries. Those who believe in this mission of khadi and who believe also in a living wage being paid to the spinners, will not grudge the increase that has to be made in the price of khadi. They may rely upon the Association moving with the utmost caution. The past two years’ experience warrants the hope that the public welcome the increase in the wages that the spinners are receiving.

 CHI. AMRITLAL,
 Since Vasumati has asked for time, you should tell her that you cannot spare more time. Give her fifteen minutes. Explain to her that she can get much in fifteen minutes if she works with concentration.
 Do not worry if you cannot at present give help in preparing bhaji. Those who feel hurt by people’s criticism become old pre- maturely. Such persons violate brahmacharya according to my definition of it and those who do so become old.
 We should feel unhappy about our own shortcomings. When others impute faults to us we should laugh it away. If they are inclined to listen we can explain to them. It is our duty to explain to those who have formed a wrong opinion about us. We should treat others as if they were our kith and kin.
 By all means take Sunday off. On that day you may help in preparing bhaji. Cultivate a sense of humour.
 There were four or five mistakes in Dahyalal’s Gita recitation yesterday. Observe all such mistakes and correct them. His recitation has certainly improved, but there is scope for futher improvement.

  	An ex-professor writes a long letter on my article on higher 	educationlibtech_485_footnotefrom 	which I take the following relevant extracts :  There 	is need 	for further clarification 	of your 	views on higher 	education as they 	have appeared in the Harijan 	of the 	9th inst. I 	agree with many of 	your views—especially 	those regarding the 	enormity of 	the damage 	caused by the 	foreign medium. I 	also feel 	that what 	passes as 	higher education 	today contains 	much brass mistaken 	for gold. 	I speak 	from experience as 	I was 	a teacher in the line of the so-called ‘higher education’ till very recently. It is    
 your third conclusion about general revenue and claims of higher education and its corollary, viz., that universities should be self-supporting, that has left me unconvinced. I believe that every country to be a progressive country must have sufficient faicilities for the pursuit of all branches of knowledge— not merely chemistry, medicine and engineering, but every kind of knowledge—literature, philosophy, history, sociology, both abstract and applied. All higher pursuits require many facilities which cannot be had without State support. A country depending only on voluntary effort for such pursuits is sure to fall behind and suffer. It can never hope to be free and be able to maintain that freedom. The State must be jealously watchful over the position of higher education in all fields. Voluntary effort must be there and we must have our Nuffields and Rockefellerslibtech_486_footnote. But the State cannot and must not be allowed to remain a silent spectator. It must actively come forward to organize, help and direct. I wish you to clarify this aspect of the question.
 You say at the end of your article:“Under my scheme there will be more and better libraries.” I do not find the ‘scheme’ you speak of in your article, nor am I able to make out how ‘more and better libraries and laboratories’ will come into being thereunder. I am of opinion that such libraries and laboratories must be maintained and so long as donors and voluntary agencies are not coming forward in sufficient numbers, the State cannot divest itself of this responsibility.
 My article is clear enough if the expression “definite use” mentioned in it is given its extensive meaning. I have not pictured a poverty-stricken Indian containing ignorant millions. I have pictured to myself an India continually progressing along the lines best suited to her genius. I do not, however, picture it as a third-class or even a first-class copy of the dying civilization of the West. If my dream is fulfilled, and every one of the seven lacs of villages becomes a well- living republic in which there are no illiterates, in which no one is idle for want of work, in which everyone is usefully occupied and has nourishing food, well-ventilated dwellings and sufficient khadi for covering the body, and in which all the villagers know and observe the laws of hygiene and sanitation, such a State must have varied and increasing needs, which it must supply unless it would stagnate. I can therefore well imagine the State financing all the education my correspondent mentions and much more that I could add. And if the
 
 State has such requirements, surely it will  have  corresponding libraries.
 What, however, according to my view the State will not have is an army of B.A.s and M.A.s with their brains sapped with too much cramming and minds almost paralysed by the impossible attempt to speak and write English like Englishmen. The majority of these have no work, no employment. And when they have the latter, it is usually clerkships at which most of the knowledge gained during their twelve years of high school and college is of no use whatsoever to them.
 University training becomes self-supporting when it is utilized by the State. It is criminal to pay for a training which benefits neither the nation nor the individual. In my opinion there is no such thing as individual benefit which cannot be proved to be also national benefit. And since most of my critics seem to be agreed that the existing higher education, and for that matter both primary and secondary, are not connected with realitites, it cannot be of benefit to the State. When it is directly based on realities and is wholly given through the mother tongue, I shall perhaps have nothing to say against it. To be based on realities is to be based on national, i.e., State, requirements. And the State will pay for it. Even when that happy time comes, we shall find that many institutions will be conducted by voluntary contributions. They may or may not benefit the State. Much of what passes for education today in India belongs to that category and would therefore not be paid for from the general revenue, if I had the way.
 But the agreement of my critics on the two main points, medium and the realities, cannot lull me to rest. They have criticized and tolerated all these many years the existing system. Now that the opportunity for reform has come, Congressmen ought to become impatient. If the medium is changed at once and not gradually, in an incredibly short time we shall find text-books and teachers coming into being to supply the want. And if we mean business, in a year’s time we shall find that we need never have been party to the tragic waste of the nation’s time and energy in trying to learn the essentials of culture through a foreign medium. The condition of success is undoubtedly that provincial languages are introduced at once in Government offices and courts, if the Provincial Governments have the power or the influence over the courts. If we believe in  the  necessity of the reform, we can achieve it in no time.

 [July 30, 1938]
 With regard to the recent ministerial crisis in C.P., it has been suggested that Dr. Khare was asked to sign a prepared draft containing humiliating admissions. I have no hesitation in saying that this suggestion is baseless. Dr. Khare accompanied by  several members of the Working Committee, came to Segaon on July 25, and after discussion he prepared a statement to be issued to the Press.libtech_487_footnotelibtech_488_footnoteI made corrections and additions to it, but after reading my corrections and additions he changed his mind and said that he would consult his friends and then decide whether to issue it or not. In my opinion there was nothing humiliating in it, if only because it contained nothing but facts. I hardly think Dr. Khare will dispute this. The best thing, however, is for the public to have the statement itself before it. I invite Dr. Khare to publish a facsimile of it. I have kept no copy of his own with my amendments. He took it with him to Nagpur.

In April the 
 instructive reading. That the resolution of the Working Committee condemning the action of veteran leader like Dr. Khare would come in for some severe criticism was a foregone conclusion.libtech_503_footnotelibtech_504_footnoteBut I was not prepared for the ignorance betrayed by the critics on the functions of the Working Committee.
 Dr. Khare was not only guilty of gross indiscipline in flouting the warnings of the Parliamentary Board, but he betrayed incompet- ence as a leader by allowing himself to be fooled by the Governor, or not knowing that by his precipitate action he was compromising the Congress. He heightened the measure of indiscipline by refusing the advice of the Working Committee to make a frank confession of his guilt and withdraw from leadership. The Working committee would have been guilty of gross neglect of duty if it had failed to condemn Dr. Khare’s action and adjudge his incompetence. I write these lines in sorrow. It was no pleasure to me to advise the Working Committee to pass the resolution it did. Dr. Khare is a friend. He has run to my aid as a physician when quick medical assistance was needed. He has often come to me for advice and guidance and has expressed himself to be in need of my blessings. I banked on this friendship when, on the 25th ultimo, I appealed to him bravely to stand down and work as a camp-follower. He himself seemed to be willing but he was badly advised, and not only declined to accept the Working Committee’s advice but sent a letter instead, questioning the propriety of the whole of the action of the Working Committee in connection with his ill- advised and hasty resignation of office and equally hasty formation of a new Cabinet. I hope that on mature reflection he would have seen the error of his conduct and taken the action of the Working Committee in a sportsmanlike spirit. There is no moral turpitude involved in his action. He is a good fighter. He is free with his purse in helping friends. These are qualities of which anyone may be proud. But these qualities need not make the possessor a good Prime Minister
 
 Congress Parliamentary Committee managed at a meeting at Pachmarhi to resolve these differences and achieve a settlement. But Khare did not keep the terms of the settlement and continued to function without consulting the Working Committee or the Parliamentary Committee. In order to get rid of certain ministers he submitted his resignation to the Governor and asked the ministers concerned to resign. When they refused to oblige, the Governor dismissed them and later invited Khare to form a new ministry.
 or administrator. I would urge him as a friend to work for the time being as a camp-follower and give the Congress the benefit of the admitted qualities I have recited.
 If Dr. Khare was impatient of his recalcitrant colleagues he should have rushed, not to the Governor, but to the Working Comm- ittee and tendered his resignation. If he felt aggrieved by its decision, he could have gone to the A. I. C. C. But in no case could any Minister take internal quarrels to the Governor and seek relief through him without the previous consent of the Working Committee. If the Congress machinery is slow-moving, it can be made to move faster. If the men at the helm are self-seekers or worthless, the A. I. C. C. is there to remove them. Dr. Khare erred grievously in ignoring or, what is worse, not knowing this simple remedy and rushing to the Governor on the eve of the meeting of the Working Committee to end his agony.
 It is suggested that the men who succeed him are self-seekers and incapable, and can make no approach to Dr. Khare in character. If they are as they have been portrayed by their critics, they are bound to fail in the discharge of the onerous responsibility they have undertaken. But here again the Working Committee has  to  work within the limits prescribed for it. It cannot impose ministers on a province. After all they are elected members, and if the party that has the power to elect them chooses to do so, the Working Committee has no authority to interfere so long as they remain under discipline and are not known to be persons unworthy of public confidence. But the crisis should surely put the Ministers on their mettle. It is up to them to show by their conduct that the charges levelled against them are baseless, and that they are capable of discharging their trust ably and selflessly.
 It speaks well for the impartiality of the Indian Press in that several journals found it necessary to condemn the action of the Working Committee in pronouncing the opinion it did on the part  H.
 E. the Governor of C. P. played during the unfortunate crisis. I am not in the habit of hastily judging opponents. The criticism of the resolution has left me unconvinced of any injustice done to the Governor by it. In estimating his action, time is of the essence. In accepting the resignations of Dr. Khare and his two colleagues, in demanding resignations from the other three Ministers, in expecting an immediate answer, in summarily rejecting their  explanation  and
 dismissing them, and for this purpose keeping himself, his staff and the poor Ministers awake almost the whole night, the Governor betrayed a haste which I can only call indecent. Nothing would have been lost if instead of accepting Dr. Khare’s resignation there and then, he had awaited the meeting of the Working Committee which was to meet two days after the strange drama. In dealing with a similar crisis the Bengal Governor acted differently from the C. P. Governor.
 Of course, the Governor’s action conformed to the letter of the law, but it killed the spirit of the tacit compact between the British Government and the Congress. Let the critics of the Working Committee’s action read the Viceroy’s carefully prepared declaration which, among other declarations, induced the Working Committee to try the office experiment, and ask themselves whether the Governor was not bound to take official notice of what was going on between the Working Committee and Dr. Khare and his colleagues. These indisputable facts lead one to the irresistible conclusion that the Governor, in his eagerness to discredit the Congress, kept a vigil and brought about a situation which he knew was to be uncomfortable for the Congress. The unwritten compact between the British Government and the Congress is a gentleman’s agreement in which both are expected to play the game.
 The resolution therefore gives English administrators more credit than evidently the critics would give. Englishmen are sports- men. They have ample sense of humour. They can hit hard and take a beating also in good grace. I have no doubt that the Governor will take the Congress resolution in good part.
 But whether he does so or not, the Working Committee was bound to express what it felt about the Governor’s action. It wishes to avoid a fight if it can; it will take it up if it must. If the fight is to be avoided, the Governors must recognize the Congress as the one national organization that is bound some day or other to replace the British Government. The U.P., the Bihar and the Orissa Governors waited for the Congress lead when a crisis faced them. No doubt, in the three cases, it was obviously to their interest to do so. Is it to be said that in C.P. it was obviously to the British interest to precipitate the crisis in order to discomfit the Congress? The Working Committee resolution is a friendly warning to the British Government that if they wish to avoid an open rupture with the Congress, the powers that be should not allow a repetition of what happened at Nagpur on the night of the 20th July.
 Let us understand the functions of the Congress. For internal growth and administration, it is as good a democratic organization as any to be found in the world. But this democratic organization has been brought into being to fight the greatest imperialist power living. For this external work, therefore, it has to be likened to an army. As such it ceases to be democratic. The central authority possesses plenary powers enabling it to impose and enforce discipline on the various units working under it. Provincial organizations and Provincial Parliamentary Boards are subject to the central authority.
 It has been suggested that, whilst my thesis holds good when there is active war in the shape of civil resistance going on, it cannot whilst the latter remains under suspension. But suspension of civil disobedience does not mean suspension of war. The latter can only end when India has a Constitution of her own making. Till then the Congress must be in the nature of an army. Democratic Britain has set up an ingenious system in India which, when you look at it in its nakedness, is nothing but a highly organized  efficient  military control. It is not less so under the present Government of India Act. The Ministers are mere puppets so far as the real control is concerned. The collectors and the police, who ‘sir’ them today, may at a mere command from the Governors, their real masters, unseat the Ministers, arrest them and put them in lock-up. Hence it is that I have suggested that the Congress has entered upon office not to work the Act in the manner expected by the framers but in a manner so as to hasten the day of substituting it by a genuine Act of India’s own coining.
 Therefore the Congress conceived as a fighting machine has to centralize control and guide every department and every Congress- man, however highly placed, and expect unquestioned obedience. The fight cannot be fought on any other terms.
 They say this is fascism pure and simple. But they forget that fascism is the naked sword. Under it Dr. Khare should lose his head. The Congress is the very antithesis of fascism, because it is based on non-violence pure and undefiled. Its sanctions are all moral. Its authority is not derived from the control of panoplied black-shirts. Under the Congress regime Dr. Khare can remain the hero of Nagpur, and the students and citizens of Nagpur, and for that matter other places, may execrate me or/and the Working Committee without a hair of the demonstrators’ heads being touched so long as they remain non-violent. That is the glory and strength of the Congress—not its weakness. Its authority is derived from that non-violent attitude. It is
 the only purely non-violent political organization of importance, to my knowledge, throughout the world. And let it continue to be the boast of the Congress that it can command the willing and hearty obedience from its followers, even veterans like Dr. Khare, so long as they choose to belong to it.

448,,HARIJANS AND HINDU HOTELS,"
    
 The strike of the Hindu hotel owners does credit neither to them, nor to Ahmedabad, nor does it afford protection to Hindusim. These hotel owners could close down their hotels if others did not go to their hotels because of the presence of Harijans there. But resorting to  strike is tantamount to preventing the Congress Government from doing justice.
 The question arises whether the Hindus on strike are on the side of the Congress or opposed to it. Are they enemies of Hinduism or are they its well-wishers? If they consider themselves supporters of the Congress, they should lovingly feed Harijans despite having to put up with difficulties. If, while doing so, other Hindus stop coming to their restaurants, they should put up with this. If all Hindu restaurant- owners practise this dharma, other Hindus would either be forced to take advantage of those very restaurants or wholly give up eating in such restaurants. In the latter eventuality the restaurant-owners should look for a new source of livelihood. They should on no account forsake their dharma.
If they are Congressmen—and they should be—they should
 
 regard untouchability as adharma and, if that is so, it is evident that by resorting to strike they are practising adharma.
 This strike indicates that the ordinary mass of Hindus share the opinion on the restaurant-owners. If that is so they are opposed to the Congress. But that cannot be so, because Ahmedabad has always sided with the Congress. How can they not be convinced that the practice of untouchability cannot survive in this age? Akha Bhagat has taught us that untouchability is a superfluous appendage and the cutting off of such a limb is beneficial.
 Moreover, today, we find Hindus everywhere eating in all sorts of places. Their religion does not come in their way there. They frequent Irani restaurants. They freely visit English hotels. There is no prejudice against Harijans in those places.
 If Harijans put on the caste mark on  their  foreheads,  wear  beads and go  to  restaurants  without  proclaiming  their  caste,  who can prevent them? How can one find out about their caste? There is no doubt that many Harijans go to restaurants in this way. Is the strike then merely for the crime which the Government has committed in issuing the order to enforce its own law? If those who regard untouchability as their dharma actually wish to put it into practice, they should stop going to restaurants, taking foreign medicines; they should refrain from eating sweets whether foreign or Indian, as there is every possibility of Harijans having had a hand in their making. Foreign medicines are not made by Hindus and who knows how many Harijans may not have touched them before they reach the consumer? Today there are many vaids who do not practise untouchability. Is not their medicine polluted? And the less said about sweets the better. All this is worth considering. And those who do so will certainly come to the conclusion that those who practise untouchability should give up many other things. And, as that is not possible, they should realize the difficulty involved in it and tolerate the presence of Harijans in restaurants.
 The path of those who regard untouchability as being opposed to dharma is simple. If no restaurant-owner opens the doors of his restaurant to them these people should start restaurants in whatever way it is possible and lovingly feed those visiting them. If anyone feels that Harijans are dirty, that their clothes are unclean, rules of cleanliness applicable to all can be enforced with regard to restaurants. Absence of cleanliness is not a monopoly of Harijans alone.
 
 A few words about the duties of the Government. So long as public opinion is in favour of the Congress, the dharma of the latter is clear. On no account will it tolerate untouchability. It will sink or swim with Harijans. Even if the Congress can rule over the entire world by doing injustice to Harijans, it should regard it as dirt. Abolition of untouchability is an indispensable part of Congress policy. If no one starts a restaurant which would be open to all, either the municipality or the Government should run such places as required at its own expense. If such a restaurant does not find enough customers it could be closed down. But not a single Hindu restaurant should be allowed to function which does not permit the entry of Harijans.
 Now a few words to the Harijans. Just as Congressmen and sanatanist Hindus have to practise their dharma, so have the Harijans. These men and women have to see to it that they do not lose the game which is almost theirs. I have before me letters written by some proven Harijan workers. In these they have mentioned that at some places either in order to show their enthusiasm or to show their gratitude towards the Government, or for some other reason, Harijans, in large numbers, had surrounded restaurants and attempted to enter them. They were not even properly dressed. Those who do so render no service to Harijans but rather do them harm. They misuse laws laid down by the Government. Some rights are such that they cannot be utilized fully as soon as they are given. Some time must elapse before they are fully enjoyed and we should patiently put up with it. This right to enter restaurants is of this nature. Not a single Harijan must visit them to assert a right. Any Harijan who is really hungry and is passing by a restaurant, who has the money and is clad in  clean clothes, should certainly go to the restaurant. He should suffer any insult which he encounters while doing so, he should inform the Harijan Sevak Sangh of this without taking any offence and the latter will certainly take steps to ensure that he is not insulted again. And, finally, if steps outside of the law prove to be futile, he will resort to legal help. The statement made by Shri Muldas in this connection is very useful. Harijan men and women will see it published in  the current issue and I hope that they will put it into practice.

  	I got your letter. The practicability of Mr. Kallenbach’s sugges- 	tion will depend on my ability to send teachers from here. But that 	is nil. It is difficult to get teachers who would satisfy me. Even 	if I come across such a teacher, he would have to be paid a salary 	which we cannot afford. Thus whatever arrangement you think of 	making will have to be made locally. My opinion, therefore, is that 	the plan of a school will not work.  	So I have to think only about  I. O.libtech_519_footnoteIf the people there give a clear guarantee to make 	good the loss, not oral but such as will satisfy the bankers, then 	it is your duty to keep it going.  	If Rustomjee Trust offers some help, there is no harm in accepting 	it. But I would like only direct help from the people.    
 If the I. O. can be kept going, Sushila must return there. I think that essential for helping you as also for her and your peace of mind. Sushila’s presence by your side will by itself be a source of comfort, such as you cannot have from anything else.
 I feel that if Sushila goes there, Arun should accompany her and Sita should stay here. Both of you should learn to bear such sepa- ration. I am considering here only the welfare of the children.
 In case Sushila goes there, you should treat Phoenix as your home and stay there. You should overcome your desire of coming over here too often. It is, of course, a different thing if you get an unsought opportunity of coming.
 You should overcome the desire to see your elders. If separation from one’s people is one’s dharma, one must cheerfully abide by that dharma.
 Today this is enough. The other news Sushila may give if she wishes and knows how to.
 If Ramdas can be tempted to stay there, then there is nothing better than that. In that case the children of both of you should also be trained to look after the work there.

Allahabad also may be considered. We never hold meetings there. But this is only a suggestion for your consideration.

  	At the moment I am unable to talk. If I try I am likely to burst 	into loud wailing. I cannot reason with you. You have thrown a new 	light on things today. No vows, no religion—since I know no 	satisfaction outside these, how can I understand?  	Still, I shall talk with you when I am in a position to do so. In 	the mean time you may take the liquids that you like. If the stomach 	is still heavy with what you took in the afternoon, what can you 	drink? I have now given up insisting on anything. Do whatever brings 	you satisfaction. I had thought you were under my protection. But 	where do I have the purity for it? You are under the protection of 	God. Let His will be done.

Now, what 	would you like to do? Get well quickly. Get rid of the dysentery. 	Your letter this time has caused me considerable pain.  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	a photostat of the Hindi: G. N. 6171. Also C. W. 3445. Courtesy: 	Kantilal Gandhi         	Mahadev has passed on to me information containing com- plaints 	about violence being done by Congressmen. One complaint is that, in 	the name of peaceful picketing, picketers are resorting to methods 	bordering on violence, such as making a living wall beyond which no 	one can pass without being hurt or hurting those who make the wall. 	As the author of peaceful picketing I cannot recall a single 	instance in which I had encouraged such picketing. A friend has 	quoted Dharasana against me. I had suggested the occupation of salt 	works. But that is wholly inapplicable to the case under 	consideration. In Dharasana the objective was the salt works of 	which possession had to be taken and maintained as against the 	Government. The action could hardly be called picketing. But to 	prevent workers from going 
 to their work by standing in front of them is pure violence and must be given up. The owners of mills or other factories would be fully justified in invoking the assistance of the police and a Congress Government would be bound to provide it if the Congressmen concerned would not desist.
 Another instance brought to my notice is that of a body of Congressmen having taken possession of the offices of a Congress Committee recognized by the Provincial Congress Committee. This is surely unpardonable unruliness.
 The third instance is that of breaking up meetings by shouting and otherwise creating disturbances.
 The fourth is that of reviling capitalists as a class and inciting people to loot them.
 All these are clear instances of violence and indiscipline. I am told that such unruliness is on the increase. I have before me a letter which bitterly complains that whereas capitalists used to get justice during the old regime, now under the Congress regime they not only get no justice but are even insulted and humiliated.
 There can be no doubt that the British system favours capi- talism. The Congress, which aims at securing full justice for the famishing millions, cannot favour capitalism. But the Congress, so long as it retains non-violence as its basic policy, cannot resort to usurpation, much less allow any class of persons to be insulted or humiliated in any way whatsoever or allow any Congressman or a body of Congressmen to take the law into their own hands.
 Nor can the Congress tolerate violent picketing or speeches inciting to violence.
 If violence is not checked in time, the Congress will go to pieces purely from internal decay. It is up to the heads of provincial and subordinate committees to root out the evil without the least delay. If on the other hand Congressmen in general are tired of non-violence, the sooner the first article of the constitution is revised the better it will be for all concerned and the country. Let it not be said of the great organization that it used truth and non-violence as a cloak to cover untruth and violence.

483,,TWISTING OR INTERPRETING?libtech_523_footnote,"
    
 A friend writes a long letter with reference to my article on ‘Speakers and Politics’.libtech_524_footnoteWhat is discussed in the letter can be put thus in the form of a question:
 When you say that the language of the Government of India Act should be stretched to the farthest limit, so as to give the greatest strength to the movement for Independence, do you imply that the Speaker should, or can, knowingly twist any section of the Act so as to give it the desired meaning?
 I should be surprised if such an implication could be extracted from my article. It will amount to encouraging untruth. A Speaker who knowingly gives an interpretation contrary to the plain meaning of a text, renders himself unfit for the high office and discredits the Congress cause. He must, at all cost, preserve the Congress credit for honesty and integrity. What, however, I have meant is that where a section is manifestly capable of two meanings or more, he is bound to give that which favours the national cause. And when a section bears only one meaning which is manifestly restrictive of the people’s liberty, he must unhesitatingly give that meaning. I have no doubt that such impartiality on the part of a Speaker will enhance his reputation and to the extent increase the moral prestige of the Congress. Having discarded violence, the strength of the Congress depends wholly upon the moral fibre and fearlessness of individual Congressmen.

TAOlibtech_525_footnote","
         	[Before August 15, 1938]libtech_526_footnoteGANDHIJI: I 	am exceedingly sorry to receive you when I am in distress. I may not 	break my silence even to speak to you. But of course 	you will say whatever you want to. You may speak, I may not.  Prof. 	Tao explained that he was a member of the People’s Council of 	Action of all China. This was a body of 140 or 150 drawn from all 	parties in China, under which the whole of China was united to meet 	Japanese aggression . . . . All parties. . . were      Gandhiji 	had met Tao before that date. 
 united in fighting the common danger, under one supreme military command of Chiang Kai-shek. Tao was happy that a Medical Mission from India was sailing
 to China as a token of India’s sympathy, and he asked Gandhiji if he had any suggestions to offer in order to fight the war to a successful conclusion.
G. I do not know that I can throw any light on the problem at
 the present moment. My method is so radical that it is wholly inapplicable to your struggle. You cannot all of a sudden change the course of the struggle. A nation in arms cannot all at once give up arms and accept non-violence as its weapon.
 Prof. Tao saw the difficulty and explained that the Chinese had not even time to think, the aggression was so sudden and so unprovoked. But he would like to discuss problems of national reconstructions. He had given up University work in order to take up peasants’ education and he was deeply interested in the Wardha Education Scheme. “What exactly is the core of the Scheme?” he asked.
G. The central fact is some village craft through which the whole
of the man or the woman in the child can be drawn out.
 “But there was the difficulty of teachers,” said Prof. Tao, and Gandhiji laughed. “We had the same difficulty. Would you have trained teachers to learn a craft or craftsmen to learn the art of teaching?” asked Prof. Tao.
G. The average educated man can be expected easily to master a
 craft. Our craftsmen will require much longer time to acquire the necessary general instruction than an educated man, say like you, can require to learn say, carpentry.
 “But,” said Prof. Tao, “our educated man is after fat jobs and money. How can he be interested in this?”
G. If the scheme is sound and appeals to the educated mind, it
 must prove attractive in itself and thus wean the educated youth from the lure of gold. It must fail, if it does not evoke sufficient patriotism from the educated youth. There is one advantage with us. Those who have received instruction through the Indian languages cannot enter colleges. It is just possible that they will find the scheme attractive.
 Prof. Tao was deeply interested in our present political struggle. How were we going to acquire power at the centre?
G. If we are true to our salt in the seven provinces, the accession
 of strength that will come to us will put us on the way to power at the centre.
 T. But the power is being felt everywhere, and the Congress prestige has risen. Has it not?
 G. The Congress prestige has risen. The people have become conscious of their power and strength. The Government also recog- nize this. My fear is that this power may throw us off our balance.
 Prof. Tao reverted to the question of mass education. He made an attempt to describe the Chinese system of “relay” teachers whereby each man or woman who had learnt something had to pass it on to the next one he or she came across. Even the child, the “little” teacher, had to share his or her learning with his illiterate parents, and the Chinese through this system were liquidating illiteracy and ignorance on a mass scale.
G. I have no doubt that it can. I would like you to write for me a
 short note on how the “relay” teachers and the “little” teachers are taught, how they teach and with what result.
 Prof. Tao said he would gladly comply.
 Prof. Tao would not go without a message from Gandhiji for the people of China. He explained that even a non-violent message would be welcome	They
 were engaged in a war of self-defence, but in other respects they were observing non- violence         On May 20 Chinese planes had flown over Japanese towns, and they
 might easily have spread death and destruction among the people of Japan in retaliation for the bombing of so many Chinese ports by Japan. But instead of raining bombs they rained handbills and leaflets showing the wrong of the war . . . .
G. But the self-inflicted restraint won’t last when the real stress
 comes. The temptation will be irresistible. I shall not be surprised. It is inevitable. There is no love in war. We have got to come to the conclu- sion that either there is to be complete non-violence or undiluted violence. Is not this enough message?
 Prof. Tao wondered if some day the Chinese might expect to have Gandhiji in their midst.
G. I almost came to your country when those who had invited
 me had to stop me from going owing to the disturbances that had taken place. I do want to see peace reigning in your land during my lifetime. Nothing will please me better than to visit your great country some day.

521,"August 	20, 1938",HOW TO SAVE HANDLOOM WEAVERS,"
         August 	20, 1938  	The statement that the handloom industry has defied mill competition 	is only partially true. There are not today half as many handloom 	weavers as there were, say, twenty-five years ago. There was  a  	time  when,  as  the   spinning-wheel   spun   the   whole   of   	the yarn      
 required by the nation, the handloom wove all the cloth required. When the mills were established the spinning-wheel all but died out for the very simple reason that it gave a paltry return and was never a whole-time occupation. But the loom offered stubborn resistance, for the reason, among others, that it was a full-time occupation by itself and paid the weaver enough to eke out a living. When the spinning mill came, the weaver fell back upon it for his hanks of yarn. He even welcomed the change because he could get more evenly spun and stronger yarn. Little did he know that he was to become perfectly helpless if the mills for any reason could not supply him with yarn. Unlike the village spinner the millowner dictated the price of his yarn. By and by the weaver who wove simple patternless khadi could not withstand the mill competition and he died. And for the past few years the weaver of fancy cloth has felt the pressure from weaving mills. Public taste is slowly but surely changing. If the mills cannot exactly copy the patterns woven by the village weaver, they can, as they do, produce new patterns and by efficient advertising attract customers. Therefore several thousand Orissa weavers are idle for want of custom.  A similar cry came to me the other day from Ahmednagar,a strong weaving centre. My advice to them all was that if these weaving families would but introduce carding and spinning in their homes, they could be wholly independent of mill yarn and enlist the never- failing assistance of the A. I. S. A. It might be that the weavers might not earn as much as before because of part of their time being given to spinning. But now, under the revised policy of the A. I. S. A. which aims at giving one anna per hour to the spinner and is actually giving one and half pice per hour, the weaver would hardly feel the reduction in his income. And in any case a reduced wage is surely better than starvation.
 Let it be borne in mind that the weaver, in introducing spinning and carding in his family, has to go in for very little outlay. The wheel he already has. It will no doubt require some improvment. He has to
invest in a carding-bow costing a few annas.
 I understand that the Orissa Government is banishing mill yarn from their jails and restricting their cloth purchases to khadi. They deserve congratulations for conforming to the constructive pro- gramme of the Congress. Let the workers in charge of the organiza- tion remember the prescription herein suggested, and they will find that production of the yarn required will be the easiest by educating
 the weavers to take up spinning. They will also by this method pro- bably find that khadi can be, comparatively speaking, more cheaply produced than if they were to wait till they trained raw villagers to become efficient spinners. No doubt they will have to introduce spinning in all the villages. For that is the goal of the A. I. S. A. But they may not neglect the handloom weavers till the high purpose is accomplished.

522,"August 20, 1938",RECENT RIOTS IN BURMA,"
    
 August 20, 1938
A telegram says :
 Burma riots deserve more attention than you paid. Whatever Govern- ment information, no peace till tenth, when I left Rangoon by aeroplane. Indians frightfully perturbed. They adopted your non-violence, suffered terribly. Effective steps urgently solicited.
 The step that I took immediately on receipt of a wire from Rangoon was the only effective step I could then take.libtech_548_footnoteI was not then even in possession of facts. Now there is before me a narrative of the cause of the Burmese fury. It appears that a Burman wrote a tract in disparagement of Islam some time ago. A Burman Buddhist who had become a convert to Islam wrote a counter-tract attacking the original and also attacking Buddhism. No Indian had a hand in the writing of the counter-tract. It did not attract notice at once, but the Burmese Press fiercely criticized it and inflamed the Burmese mind. The result was the savagery which took many precious, innocent lives and destroyed property worth, it is said, millions. Nor was it confined to Rangoon; it spread throughout Burma wherever there were Indian settlers.
 If, as my correspondent says,“Indians adopted your (i. e., my) non-violence,” I can only say they suffered less than they would have otherwise done. Non-violence has no limits. If a particular dose does not seem to answer, more should be administered. It is a never-failing remedy.
 But why call it my’ non-violence? Probably the wire is a gentle rebuke to me, so much as to say that my remedy failed. The pertinent question is whether they believed in non-violence as a sure remedy against violence, or was it undertaken because there was no help for it
 ? I, however, need not wait for a reply. If one is to believe the papers,
 
 
 there was not complete non-violence practised by the Indians. I have, however, no difficulty in believing that a considerable number observed non-violence whether from belief or necessity.
 The question for consideration,  however,  is:  ‘what of the future ?’ There will no doubt be some kind of an inquiry. There may be some compensation paid to the losers. There would be some punish-ment meted out to the offenders who are not likely to be the prime movers but their dupes. I must confess that I am uninterested in these proceedings. There will be no insurance against future  out breaks.
 Indians in Burma should  realize  that  they  are  at  the  mercy  of the inhabitants of Burma. They have no Government in India that can really afford them protection. We know what is happening in the other parts of the world; nor is it to be wondered at. England will never go to war with any nation or country because it has insulted or wronged Indian settlers in that country. It may, it will, make represen- tations, sincere of course; it will lodge energetic protests even. But there her help will end. And in a case like the Burmese riots, the relief that the Government of India can afford will be next to nothing. What does it do when riots take place in India itself ? It can do very little after they are over. The utmost it can do is to take measures to quell riots when they take place. What have even Congress Governments been able to do after the riots that have recently taken place in some Congress Provinces? They do not admit of relief being granted to the sufferers except in rare cases. What is possible in Burma I do not know.
 I am concerned with attainment of permanent peace in so far as permanence is possible in this very impermanent life. When once religious animosity is roused, it has a knack of repeating itself with periodic regularity, if radical measures are not adopted by the communities concerned. One such measure is cultivation of mutual respect for the several religions professed by the parties. If the Buddhists of Burma have little regard for Islam and the Muslims for Buddhism, the seeds of dissension are there. They will take little watering to sprout into the savagery such as we saw the other day. I would, therefore, suggest a mutual understanding of these great religions.
My fear is that at the bottom of the riots there is an anti-Indian
 feeling, due, perhaps to economic causes. For though Muslims seem to have suffered most, Hindus too seem to have come in for a fair share of the Burman fury. Therefore, Indian settlers must see to it that their dealings with the Burmans are fair and above board. It is said that everything is fair in trade, and that no turpitude attaches to a trader taking advantage of his customer’s ignorance and demanding from him even an unconscionable price for his goods. That kind of dealings will surely acerbate feelings. Wherever we have gone, even before the British rulers took possession of our country, we have depended solely on the goodwill of those among whom we have lived and with whom we have traded. Such is the history of our relations with Zanzibar, Aden, Java, etc.
 Times have however changed. The people all over the world have become conscious of their rights. Whereas formerly foreign settlers in other lands did questionable things with impunity, they cannot do so now. Honesty has never been so much proved to be the best policy as it is now for those who do not or cannot back their dishonesty with gunpowder and poison gas. If India is to escape that training and is to adopt, as a free nation, peace as her motto in every walk of life and in every country where her children go, they will have to practise strictest honesty in their human dealings.
 To the Burmese friends one word. When I was in Burma some years ago, Burmese priests were good enough to invite me to their conference and honour me with their address under the shadow of the mighty Pagoda. They were good enough, as Buddhists, to claim me as one of them. It therefore hurt me when I read of the mob fury which knew no distinction of sex or age and wreaked vengeance on persons who could never have had anything to do with the  offending pamphlet. I have the greatest veneration for the Buddha. He is one of the greatest preachers of peace. The gospel of the Buddha is gospel of love. It passes comprehension how representatives of that faith could give themselves up to savagery, and that on an apparently flimsy pretext. The pity of it is that, if the newspaper reports were true, even priests, the repositories of the Buddha’s gospel, were  to  be  seen among the mob, not stilling its fury, but actually taking part in loot, arson and murder. Would that the wise men among them would do a little heart-searching and take steps to prevent a recurrence of the tragedy which all right thinking persons must deplore !

Shah         August 	21, 1938  	I realize your regard and support for Dr. Khare, I also have great 	love for Dr. Khare, but we who are fighting the independence battle 	have to forget family relations while doing our duty. After 	introspection I found that no wrong or injustice had been done to 	Dr. Khare. You have no material for comparison. I myself framed the 	Congress constitution in 1920 wherein the All-India Congress is the 	final appellate authority which everybody can approach. The  Working     
 Committee or leaders referred to, if found guilty, deserve punishment. I advise you to prepare your case in favour of Dr. Khare to be placed before the A. I. C. C. I have said whatever I wanted to. I cannot
address a public meeting at seventy. I have no desire to prove Dr.
 Khare’s guilt, nor do I wish you to lessen your love for Dr. Khare. Time alone will tell and Dr. Khare will admit his mistake. I have patience. If I realize that I did injustice in this case unknowingly, I will apologize.
 I do not wish to win independence through hooliganism which will destroy the Congress if it enters that body. Everybody has the right to criticize provided the criticism is fair, decent and truthful. No ban was imposed on Dr. Khare for contesting the election of the leadership of the C. P. Assembly Party nor did Mr. Subhas Chandra Bose threaten any member while exercising his right to vote, not did I deprive Dr. Khare of his right to contest the election.
 The Working Committee’s resolution against Dr. Khare was recommendatory, not mandatory. The charge of favouritism against the C. P. Ministry was inquired into, and the wrongs redressed, while the charge of bribery and corruption was not proved. The Working Committee can correct its mistake if it has committed any. If the members of the Working Committee had the right to attend the party meeting  none  could  remove  them.  It  could  convene the  meeting at Wardha. That resolution was drafted after consulting constitutional- ists and lawyers who committed no mistake in framing it.

556,,MY SO-CALLED INCONSISTENCIES,"
    
 During my student days improperly so called (for they properly began after the period of examinations and are not yet over for me) I learnt a saying of Emerson’s which I never forgot. “Foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds,” said the sage. I cannot be a little mind, for foolish consistency has never been my hobgoblin. My critics are shocked over my recent remarks on picketing. They think that in describing as a species of violence the formation of a living wall of pickets in order to prevent the entry of persons into picketed places, I have contradicted my sayings and doings during the civil disobedience campaign. If such is really the case, my recent writing must be held as cancelling my comparatively remote sayings and doings. Though my body is deteriorating through age, no such law of deterioration, I hope, operates against wisdom which I trust is not only not deteriorating but even growing. Whether it is or not, my mind is clear on the opinion I have given on picketing. If it does not appeal to Congressmen, they may reject it, and if they do, they will violate the laws of peaceful picketing. But there is no discrepancy between my past practice and the present statement. When civil disobedience was first orgainzed by me in South Africa, my companions discussed with me the question of picketing. The registration office had to be picketed in Johannesburg, and the suggestion made was that we should form there a living wall  of pickets. I at once rejected the idea as violent. And pickets were posted in marked positions in a big public square so that no one could elude the eagle eyes of the pickets and yet everyone could go to the registration office, if he liked, without touching anyone. Reliance was put upon the force of public opprobrium which would be evoked by the publication of the names of ‘black legs’. This method was copied by me here when liquor shops were to be picketed. The work was specially entrusted to the women as better representatives of non- violence than men. Thus there was no question of the formation of a living wall. Many unauthorized things were no doubt done during those days as they are now. But I cannot recall a single instance in which I countenanced the kind of picketing condemned by the article that has come in for sharp criticism. And is there really any difficulty about regarding a living wall of pickets as naked violence ? What is the difference between force used against a man wanting to do a
 
 particular thing, and force exercised by interposing yourself between him and the deed ? When, during the non-co-operation days, the students in Benares blocked the passage to the University gates I had to send a peremptory message and, if my recollection serves me right,  I strongly condemned their action in the columns of Young India. Of course I have no argument against those who hold different views from mine regarding violence and non-violence.
 The other inconsistency imputed to me has reference to my advice to factory-owners to invoke the assistance of the police to defend themselves against what I have described as violent picketing. Having condemned the Ministries for calling in the aid of the police and even the military for suppressing riots, how could I advise employers of labour to ask for, and Ministers to supply, police assis- tance, ask my critics.
This is what I wrotelibtech_578_footnotelibtech_579_footnotein  Harijan about the Ministerial action in
 U.P.:    It 	has been suggested that when we have our independence riots and the 	like will not occur. This seems to me to be an empty hope, if in the 	course of the struggle for freedom we do not understand and use the 	technique of non-violent action in every conceivable circumstance. 	To the extent that the Congress Ministers have been obliged to make 	use of the police and the military, to that extent, in my opinion, 	we must admit our failure. That the Ministers could not have done 	otherwise is unfortunately only too true. I should like every 	Congressman, I should like the Working Committee, to ask themselves 	why we have failed, if they think with me that we have.  	Surely here there is no condemnation of the Ministers’ action.I 
  	have deplored the necessity for it as I would deplore such necessity 	in the matter of picketing. But till the Congress has developed a 	peaceful method of dealing with violent crimes, its Ministers must 	use  the  police and, I fear, even the military, if they are to 	undertake the administration of the affairs of the country in the 	present stage of its career. But it will bode ill for them and the 	country if they do not devise methods of dispensing with the use 	both of the police and the military or at least of visibly reducing 	their use to such an extent that he who runs may notice the 	reduction. There certainly is a way. I have ventured to give a faint 	indication of it. But it may be  that  the Congress organization is 	not really fitted for the great task. Without a living faith in 	non-violence, neither the military nor the police can be supplanted.  
 Cries come in from many quarters of growing insubordination, indiscipline and even open violence among Congressmen. I hope that the charge is untrue of the majority of Congressmen.

          CHI. 	VALJI,         August 	27, 1938 
  	I read your third article and am returning all the three. The idea 	of composing a new Smriti is a tempting one, but I am not 	qualified. If I assume that I am qualified, I would require the 	leisure that is posible in jail. Outside I have no choice. I have to 	take up the work that comes to me and do it as best as I can. There 	is some freedom of choice in jail. If you wish to contribute in the 	compositon of a new Smriti, you will have to go deep into the 	thing. There are many interpolations in the Smritis. Some 	portions, though not interpolations, deserve to be rejected. Even in 	the Vedas everything contained is not eternal truth. The Vedas are a 	mixture of poetry, history and eternal verities. We should try to 	pick out the last. We should formulate rules of interpretation. And 	after that, we may place before the people our interpretations right 	from the Vedas to the Puranas, as the substance of Hinduism. You 	have got the necessary ability for this, but have I ? This task is 	beyond the ability of a single person. For this we should have a 	group from among ourselves. You will now get some faint idea about 	how my mind is working. I do know what is dharma, but I do not know 	how to put it as the Vedas do. I am not sufficiently well- versed in 	the Shastras. And the most important thing is that I am not 	completely free from attachment. I aspire to be so in this life. But 	I will not feel sorry if I fail. I am using all the strength God has 	given me to destroy attachment, etc. It is not impossible for me to 	attain to that state, but I do not know whether I have that much 	time left to me. 
 Please, therefore, do not give me anything raw just now.  Your language is attractive, but I will not yield even to that attraction and accept all that you send just now. Please improve your healh if you can.

I also have formed the 	same impression about Khan Saheb that you say you have. However, he 	is so suspicious that one cannot know when he might do what. But 	being a man of God, he remains unharmed by mistakes and perhaps he 	may live his whole life in this way and remain blameless. He suffers 	from mental lethargy and so does not know what to do in particular 	circumstances. And, moreover, he is simple-hearted. He would believe 	everythng that a man whom he has come to trust told him, would not 	believe anything said by anyone against whom he is prejudiced, and 	get angry with those that did. Even so, he is a saintly person, and 	so one does not mind his faults.  	Pyarelal has pulled through this time. Showing him what you have 	written would have an adverse effect. He is not fit enough just now 	to bear your jokes and it would not do showing him the letter after 	it has been edited ! If his temperature is not normal today, it will 	be so in a day or two. He follows my advice on most things. He gives 	me no trouble, and so you need not worry. My silence has benefited 	me so much that if and when I have to give it up, I shall find it 	hard to 
 do so. Most certainly there is anger in me. The silence eats it all up. After all, how much anger can I give vent to by writing ?
 We are going through a period of wet adversity. Water is dripp- ing everywhere. You will see evidence of it in this also. I fully realize now the meaning of living in a village.
I am enclosing Ramdas’s letter.
 Ramachandran is likely to be arrested in a day or  two. Rajkumari will return from Travancore tomorrow. Poor woman, she did her very best. But after all we can only try, is not that so ? We have left, and should leave, credit or discredit to God. If we do not act thus, we would come to grief. I may not give you any more time now.

SATYAGRAHISlibtech_586_footnote","
    
 [August 27, 1938]libtech_587_footnoteHarijan friends . . . calling themselves ‘satyagrahis’ marched to Segaon on Saturday last and demanded justice from Gandhiji. Gandhiji was of course silent, but
 he received them and asked them in writing if they would be content with written replies. They said they would. He asked them to explain the purpose of their visit.
 “We gave you notice,” their spokesman said, “that unless you could have a Harijan appointed as a Cabinet Minister we should go to Segaon and do satyagraha there. You asked us to desist. We did so and wrote to you to say so. But after that, having heard nothing from you we decided to fulfil our promise.”
GANDHIJI: But what do you want, and what do you mean by
satyagraha?
 HARIJANS: We want a Harijan to be in the Cabinet and a seat reserved in the Cabinet for a Harijan as there is one reserved for a Mussalman.
 But 	that is 	not in my power.  It 	is. You were prepared to 	lay down your life for 	the Harijans at 	Yeravda and your fast led to the Yeravda Pact. You can do everything for the Harijans. 
 I am doing all that is in my power. But let that be. What do 
you mean by satyagraha?
  We 	will remain here without 	food until another party 	from Nagpur comes 	to relieve us. 
 You are welcome to do so. You want me to provide you 
 with room. Well we are cramped for space, but you tell us where you will sit, and we will vacate the place for you.
  We 	will be 	fasting, and 	five or six 	people will 	have to stay 	with us to 	attend to our needs 	whilst we are fasting. 
G. I am not concerned with that. You select the place and we
vacate it for you.
 One of the Ashram inmates went out with them to show them over the place. He returned to say that they wanted a room adjoining a hut reserved for women and also the verandah in front of it.
G.	Explain to them that that room is reserved for women and
 
 they might select some other place.
 He did so, but came and reported that they would have no other place.
 G. Vacate it then. Let not Ba be perturbed. She can come and occupy my room, and I will go there or in the house outside which is built for Aryanayakum.

         BROTHERS,       August 	28, 1938 
  	I am pained to see the troubles that you are taking because I do not 	know what useful purpose your troubles are going to serve. I 
 consider that your vow is born of lack of knowledge. Whatever that may be, your fast cannot effect a change in my views. We should not coerce anyone by resorting to fasts. I therefore appeal to you that you should give up the fast and then resort to any other kind of agitation.
 At the same time I [do not] consider that agitation of any kind is necessary because it is the duty of every Congress Ministry to include a Harijan in the Cabinet if a capable Harijan is forthcoming.

  	Rajkumari Amrit Kaur was born in 1887 A. 	D. She is the only 	daughter of the late Raja Sir Harnam Singh. The late Raja Saheb was 	the uncle of the Maharaja of Kapurthala. The Rajkumari was educated 	in England for eight years. She has been taking a prominent part in 	the women’s movement since 1928. At present she is President of 	the All-India Women’s Conference. Her way of living is exceedingly 	simple. She has been wearing khadi for years. She is a member of the 	Spinners’ Association and the Village Industries Association and 	takes great interest in both these activities. This information 	should suffice for you.  	Tell Chhaganlal that if he wants to arrange a tour of Kathiawar for 	her for a few days, he may do so. It is not absolutely obligatory to 	arrange the tour. It may be dropped if the atmosphere at present is 	not favourable. I have prepared her for it.

  	I got your letter. Who can help one who makes herself unhappy 	without cause? Joy and sorrow are mental creations. I experience 	this every moment. If Jayaprakash does not go to Malabar at all, 	will it mean that you will not be permitted to come? When he goes to 	 Malabar he may take you from here, or he may go directly there and 
 you may leave this place at the same time and join him there. My visit to the Frontier Province may perhaps start around the 20th Septem- ber. In that case you will remain here. I shall have to be back from there around October 20.
 Pyarelal has no fever now, but feels weak. The danger is over. My silence is for an indefinite period. God alone knows when it will be over. But you are not concerned with that. You will be able to talk to your heart’s content, and I will reply to you by writing. But the truth is that you do not need to talk. It is enough for you to stay with me to have peace of mind. I need not worry about you then. Please, therefore, come if you can. I will see about your studying.

The point is not that the language is abusive. The 	socialists are carrying on massive activities for an ideal. We 	should not ignore them. There is some criticism of the Bihar Bill in 	the current Congress Socialist. There are other articles too. 	Read them. Write an article about the Bihar Bill in reply to the 	article in the Congress Socialist. If something has been 	written about the matter I should like to see it. 
 I am sending with this three Hindi weeklies. Glance through them. Somebody at least should read such things. We should not be unaware of all these ideas.

  	For what is Rajaram going to Wardha? Are the mosambis over? 	Ba says that there are still many mosambis left. Find out 	correctly and tell me. How many are there? They are more than 	enough. Pyarelal would need very few or none at all. Who all are 	taking mosambis? Chimanlal, etc.? The point is that it should 	not be made a duty for Rajaram to go. If it can be managed, he 	should not be sent in such rains. I have been facing such problems 	from the days of South Africa. There too a particular man went to 	the city every day. I came to know about it. I took up cudgels and 	resolved that he should go only twice a week. Thereby, I saved 	energy, time and money. Any one     
 who observes non-violence should learn to put up with in- conveniences. Creating only means of comfort is the religion of violent creatures. Hence, let it be made clear that Rajaram should not be sent unless there is a particular reason. It is not a question only of today. If it is necessary, he may go today. If he goes, and does not deliver the post, let the post be left behind. Let everyone understand this. Whatever advantages are given to me would mean that much of my time is saved.

I made inquiries 	and then there was a certain improvement. The matter went further 	and it was desired that rather than make comments in front of    
 everybody one should put down things in writing. That was why Munnalal wrote that letter. Thus, knowing as I do his nature, I cannot find fault with him.

593,"September 3, 1938",STATEMENT TO THE PRESS,"
    
 September 3, 1938 I have been in close touch with the prime movers affected by the tragedy which is now being enacted in Travancore, and I  had  hoped
that I should be able to avoid having to make any public statement.
 After a study of the available evidence and interviews with rep- resentative men from Travancore, I have come to the conclusion that the Travancore Government are resorting to repressive methods, far in excess of the requirements, if there are any.
 The Travancore Government contend that the Travancore State Congress activities are disloyal and subversive. I have studied the documents alleged to contain evidence in support of such a charge and have failed to find anything of that nature. On the contrary, I have seen emphatic repudiaton by the State Congress of the charge unless constitutional agitation for responsible government is to be called subversive.
 I have, however, read the memorial of the Working Committee of the Travancore State Congress, making the most serious charges unsupported by any evidence against the able Dewan, Sir C. P. Ramaswami Aiyar. They should never have been made, even if the memorialists had evidence in support. Such evidence is irrelevant to the case for responsible government. It would have its place in a memorial for the removal of the Dewan. There is no doubt that these charges have harmed the memorialists and therefore the State Con- gress, though they cannot weaken the case for responsible govern- ment.
 I have no doubt whatsoever that the case for responsible government will be strengthened by the frightfulness being committed by the Government of Travancore if only the people will not be demoralized and will continue to adhere to non-violence. If reports about violence by students are true, I appeal to the students to desist and allow the movement to develop non-violently.
 Leaders who have been locked up should make amends by with drawing the charges against the Dewan.
 I had the honour of meeting the young Maharaja and the Maharani. I have had the privilege of knowing Sir C. P. Ramaswami Aiyar for many years. I appeal to them to retrace their steps and allow
 
 the State Congress to function so long as its activities remain peaceful. Surely the common law of the State is enough to cope with individuals using violent language or resorting to actual violence. But at this hour of the day, to expect the people to submit to the suppression of free speech or of demands, however advanced these may be is to invite trouble.
 In my humble opinion, the prevention of Shrimati Kamaladevi Chattopadhyaya from entering the State was a first-class tactical blunder. it passes comprehension how Sir C. P. Ramaswami Aiyar, himself a foreigner, prohibited the entry of a distinguished Indian lady on the grounds, according to him, of her being an outsider. She was amenable to the State law if she had committed any  breach thereof. I thought it was only reserved for the English administrators to treat Indians going from one province to another as foreigners. It ill becomes the Indian Princes and their advisers to follow the perni- cious practice of the English administrators—a  practice  of  which many Englishmen are heartily ashamed. The Government may, by the terrible repression they have resorted to, succeed in killing the move- ment for the time being, but it will never die and will leave a bitter memory behind. I hope that wiser counsels will yet prevail and the State Congress will be permitted to function properly.

 "
594,,CHOICE BEFORE CONGRESSMEN,"
    
 Since  the  publication  of  my  articlelibtech_603_footnotelibtech_604_footnoteon  violence  said   to   be creeping into the Congress ranks, evidence is coming in to corro- borate the complaints made by my correspondents. Violence at Con- gress elections, they say, is on the increase. It looks as if Congressmen are not able to digest the power that has come to the Congress.  Everyone wants to have a share in the spoils of office. And so there is an unhealthy competition to capture committees.
 This is not the way to win swaraj, nor is it the way to work the office programme. The holding of any office in the Congress Government must be in the spirit of service without the slightest expectation of personal gain. If A is satisfied in ordinary life with getting Rs. 25 per month, he has no right to expect Rs. 250 on becoming a minister or obtaining any other office under the Govern-
 ment. And there are many Congressmen who are taking only Rs. 25 per month in voluntary organizations and who are well able  to shoulder ministerial responsibility. Bengal and Maharashtra are teem- ing with able men who have dedicated themselves to public service on a mere pittance and who are well able to give a good account of themselves no matter where they are put. But they are not to be tempted to leave the fields they have chosen, and it would be wrong to drag them out of their invaluable self-chosen obscurity. It is true all the world over, and more true perhaps of this country, that as a rule the best and the wisest men will not become ministers or accept positions under Governments. But I have digressed.
 We may not always get the best and the wisest men and women to run Congress Governments, but swaraj will become a distant dream if the ministers and other Congressmen holding offices are not self- less, able and incorruptible. We are not likely to have such men if congress committees become job-hunting arenas in which the most violent would win.
 How to preserve the purity of the organization is the question. Anyone who subscribes to the credal article of the Congress and pays
 4 annas can demand registration as a member. Many  sign  the  congress pledge without believing in the necessity for observing truth and non-violence as conditions of attainment of swaraj. Let no one cavil at my use of the expressions ‘truthful and non-violent’ as synonymous with ‘legitimate and peaceful’. From the very comm- encement of the Congress constitution I have used those adjectives without challenge. The word ‘non-violence’ was first introduced by me in the resolution on non-co-operation carried in Calcutta by the Congress. Can anything be untruthful and yet be legitimate, violent and yet be peaceful?  Be that as it may, I claim that those who commit a breach of these two primary conditions, no matter by what adjectives they are known, can have no place in the Congress organization so long as it is governed by the present constitution.
 Similarly those who do not use khadi as habitual wear have no place in any Congress committee. This condition should apply also to those who do not carry out vital resolutions of the Congress, A.I.C.C. or the Working Committee. My prescription would be that those who commit a breach of any of these conditions should  automatically cease to belong to the Congress. It may be urged that the remedy is too drastic. It is, if it is regarded as a punishment. If it is the automatic
 result of a particular act or omission of a person, it is no punishment. I know that thrusting my finger into a furnace will surely burn it and still I thrust it; my suffering is no punishment, it is the natural consequence of my action. Punishment depends upon the will of the judge. Natural consequences are independent of any person’s will.
 It will be urged that under these conditions the Congress will cease to be a democratic organization, it will become a close corpo- ration.
I hold a wholly contrary view.
 Democracy of the West is, in my opinion, only so called. It has germs in it, certainly, of the true type. But it can only come when all violence is eschewed and malpractices disappear. The two go hand in hand. Indeed malpractice is a species of violence. If India is to evolve the true type, there would be no compromise with violence or untruth. Ten million men and women on the Congress register with violence and untruth in their breasts would not evolve real democracy or bring swaraj. But I can conceive the possibility of ten thousand Con- gressmen and women who are cent per cent true, and free from having to carry the burden of innumerable doubtful companions, bringing swaraj.
 Let us reflect upon the past a little. Over fifty years ago  a handful of men and women took it into their heads to meet together and represent and speak in the name of the dumb millions. Time has proved the validity of their claim. Since then the prestige of the Congress has risen not in proportion to its numbers, not in proportion to the display of intellect on the platform or in committee rooms, but it has risen in proportion to the ability of Congressmen to suffer and sacrifice, themselves for the nation. No one will deny that when in 1920 the Congress definitely became a democratic, duly elected body having a large number of voters on its rolls, it found itself possessed of new power only because it deliberately adopted truth and non- violence as its means of reaching its goal. And even at the present day, the Congress has quite an insignificant number of men and women on its register compared to the tremendous power it wields. The reason to my mind is that it shows a measure of sacrifice cohesion and discipline unequalled by any other organization in India. But as an experienced servant and general I make bold to say that we shall have
 to show a much higher measure of these qualities if we are to win independence before many years are out. It is my deliberate convic- tion based on closest observation that we can secure all we want, within
 much less time than perhaps any one of us imagines, simply by showing high efficiency and equally high honesty in every one of the Congress activities.
 It would ill become us as truly brave men and women to wish ill to the British in order to gain our end. In non-violent warfare wishing ill to the enemy is not permissible A non-violent person relies upon his own strength and refuses to trade upon his opponents’ weakness.
 With all the earnestness I can command I, therefore, plead with every Congressman who believes in his pledge to make his choice: either to apply the purge I have suggested, or, if that is not feasible because of the Congress being already overmanned by those who have lost faith in its creed and its constructive programme on which depends its real strength, to secede from it for its own sake and prove his living faith in the creed and programme by practising the former and prosecuting the latter as if he had never seceded  from  the Congress of his ideal. If one or the other thing is not done, I see grave danger of the Congress collapsing by the weight of  its  own weaknesses.
 It has given me no pleasure to pen these lines. But having felt the urge, I would have been untrue to the Congress if I had not uttered the warning. It is the voice of silence. For the reader should know I took silence over a fortnight ago for an indefinite period. It has given me peace I cannot describe, and it enables me to commune with Nature.

have to contradict Dr. Khare.
 He came to Segaon voluntarily. He came as a friend. There was no protest on his part when he came. It was not without full argument that he felt convinced of the charges I brought against him. When he realized the force of my argument, he said he placed himself unreservedly in my hands. I told him that as he had admittedly lost his balance, if he felt like consulting his friends whom I had named, he should do so. There was no desperate hurry. He said he was quite capable of deciding for himself and that there was no need to consult other friends. Then I said he should better write out himself what he had admitted. He suggested that I should draft a statement, as he was no draftsman. I said nevertheless that I wanted his language. If I felt it did not cover sufficiently what he had admitted, I would revise it or
 
 add to it.
 After some hesitation he took pen and paper and drew up the draft. I then took it up and made the corrections and additions.libtech_607_footnotelibtech_608_footnoteHe read them twice or thrice and said he could never admit betrayal of trust and that in any case he would not make any statement there and then but would accept my suggestion that he should consult  his friends.

Instead of importing the military and a Special Officer to carry on repression, I invite the Travancore Government to request someone like the Rt. Hon’ble V. S.

Bearing in mind that He who controls us all is perfect, we should be content with whatever we are able to do.

  	I have told Sushila what I had to. Now her good lies in her doing 	what she thinks proper. She need not act under pressure from Mother. 	But if she is moved by Mother’s love, she should not grum- ble. We 	do many things moved by parental love and find joy in doing them. I 	shall be content with whatever she does.  	As for you, what can I say? I see that our ideas of duty differ. You 	see the same thing in one way, I in another way. So we must tole- 	rate each other and pray that the veil of untruth may be lifted and 	we may both see the same truth. 
 What I wish is that, if possible, you should assure me and Sushila that you will not take any step at least while I am alive. Even that you should not do mechanically. Do it only if you can do so naturally.

  	You can write to me in Urdu. Your letter has pained me a great deal. 	Those who live with me never turn beggars. I. consider myself the 	richest person. Beggars are those who work for salaries, because 	they are always wanting more and more. They want promotions, no 	matter how. I urge you not to press Sushila. Persuade her by love 	and argument. Let her go her way if she is not convinced at heart. 	Parents who order their grown-up children about, commit a sin. Save 	yourself from such a sin. Pyare and Sushila are enjoying greater 	authority than you ever did. You had money power. Why delight  in  	the  memory of these things and why shed tears thinking about them? 	Did not Father do good to others? Can one do good only by securing a 	big job? Are not Pyare and Sushila doing altruistic work? Their life 	is full of it. Enough is enough.

 Whatever I say to you does not satisfy you— I cannot discuss your food. If I ask you to strain less, you will exert more. If I ask you to sleep, you will not listen. Even if you try to sleep, your heart will protest that it is not correct advice. How can I know what was said to the Maulana? Tell me, how can I make you understand.

 LETTER FROM M. A. JINNAHlibtech_620_footnote
 NEW DELHI,
 March 3, 1938
 
DEAR MR. GANDHI,
 I have received your letter of the 24th February, 1938. I am sorry for the delay in replying as I was not well. In your letter I missed the note of response, first whether you are of opinion that you see light now and the moment has come, and secondly, if so, whether you are prepared to take the matter up in right earnest, and thirdly, I find that there is no change in your attitude and mentality when you say you would be guided by Maulana Abul Kalam Azad as Dr. Ansari is no more. If you pursue this line you will be repeating the same tragedy as you did when you expressed your helplessness because Dr. Ansari, holding pronounced and die-hard views, did not agree and you had to say that although you were willing, but what could you do? This happened, as you know, before you went to the Round Table Conference. At the Round Table Conference the tragedy was repeated by you when you seemed to be willing to accept provisionally certain terms: but you there also expressed that you were helpless as the Hindus were unwilling and you, as a representative of the Congress, would have no objection, if the Hindus and Mussalmans came to an agreement.
 We have reached a stage when no doubt should be left that you recognize the All-India Muslim League as the one authoritative and representative organization of the Mussalmans of India and on the other hand you represent the Congress and other Hindus throughout the country. It is only on that basis that we can proceed further and devise machinery of approach.
 Of course, I shall be glad to see you, although I shall be equally glad to see Pandit Jawaharlal or Mr. Bose, [as] you may desire. The matter as you know will not be clinched without reference again to you by either of them. Therefore, I will prefer to see you first. In any case, I am sorry to say that I cannot come to Segaon to see you before the 10th March. I have to go to Bombay and also I have fixed various other engagements of my tour. But we can fix up the time and place that may suit us both.
 Yours sincerely,

 APPENDIX II
 A TRAGEDY  libtech_621_footnote
 I proudly write in these columns about Gandhiji’s health, discussing the causes of its breakdown, warning people, asking them to give him more rest. Ruthlessly I have turned out people wanting to see him, and have even interrupted talks and interviews, lest they should strain him over much and raise his blood-pressure. Fancy, therefore, my misery and my shame when I found one morning at Delang that what he considered a serious blunder on my part had raised his blood-pressure to the breaking point and might have brought about a catastrophe. Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday, 29th, 30th and 31st—which in that peaceful atmosphere of Orissa should have been the most blissful days—were the most miserable days I have ever had in my life. But they were, if anything, more miserable for Gandhiji, as I found from his heart-broken and heart-breaking utterance on the afternoon of the 30th. I thought I had made amends indeed at that morning’s prayer by telling everyone present how I had been the cause of the terrible breakdown, but Gandhiji was not present when I spoke. But he knew that I had spoken about the incident, and so he devoted his speech to the incident. I bespeak the indulgence of the  reader  for inflicting on him this tale of personal woe. But I do it on public grounds, as he will find at the end of the story.
 The circumstances were somewhat like these. My wife, who rarely attends the annual meetings of the Gandhi Seva Sangh, or for that matter any such meetings, came to Delang, especially, I was told, with a view to being able to go to Puri. And Gandhiji told me that I should make every arrangement for her going to Puri. Personally I disliked her having come for the sake of Puri, and had no heart to make any arrangements. I was once again asked if I had made the arrangements, and asked a third time. My wife to my surprise did not know that the Puri temple was not open to the Harijans. During Gandhiji’s Harijan tour she was in jail. But that was no excuse for the ignorance. On the very first day in the course of his exhibition speech Gandhiji made it clear that the temple of the Lord of the World was not open to the Harijans, and so long as it remained so, the Lord was not, in his opinion, the Lord of the World, but the Lord of those who fed and feasted under His shelter. I had hoped that this speech would be a warning to all, including my wife, though I had a fear that she would go into the temple. I must also confess that I had a lurking suspicion thatGandhiji’s repeated insistence on my making arrangements for her going to Puri sprang out of the depth of his ahimsa—the ahimsa that had made him serve liquor to Tommies in the Zulu Rebellion, and to serve meat to his friends at table in South Africa. I had also hoped that because she was going there with a number of other friends, including Gandhiji’s second son Manilal, she would not go into the temple when the rest stood out. What I did not do was to din into her head that her going into
 
 the temple would break Gandhiji’s heart. As I have said, I was stupid enough not to realize the possible reaction and had even fancied that in the boundless charity of his heart he had found room for forgiving a temple-goer like my wife. I must therefore confess that even if she had definitely told me before going that she had made up her mind to go into the temple, I should not have resisted her. I did not want to disturb her faith to that extent. She knew that I was against it, she also knew that I have a horror of these temples—temples which even when they are opened to the Harijans, would not be better unless they were purged of the unscrupulous pandas. But if  she  thought it would do her soul good to go into the temple, I did not in my heart of hearts feel like standing in the way. As for Kasturba Gandhi, I must say that I had assumed she would stand out and her presence would perhaps act as a check on my wife and others. But as it happened, my wife went in, another friend went in, and also went in
 Kasturba. Some members of the party stayed out, including my little son who put up a plucky fight with the pandas.
 On Monday evening when they returned and Gandhiji knew the whole story, he was sad. He had a sleepless night. He called Kasturba and my wife and me to account. The explanation, part of which is contained in the argument above, failed to satisfy him. It even irritated him. He held that I was primarily to blame. He held that I should have explained to them the history of the movement, how Gandhiji had gone to Puri in 1934, how violence was organized there, how he had to undertake the Orissa pilgrimage on foot, how reformers were warned not to go to the temple until Harijans were admitted, and if my wife still did not listen, Gandhiji’s assistance should have been sought, and if then too she insisted on going she should have been free to go. He held hat I had not been watchful enough and that I had thus been unjust to him, my wife, myself and to the cause. And so he thus poured out his heart to the members of the Sangh :libtech_622_footnote
 This pouring out of the agony of his heart was for me an added agony. He was so disconsolate. The next day he felt too weak to speak and went into silence for the whole day as a measure of precaution. What could I do in the circumstances? I was afraid lest I should make matters worse by entering into explanations and arguments.  I felt like waiting until he had regained his normal pressure and strength. But the thought of my having been the cause of the collapse tormented me. If I was guilty of a grievous error of judgment, how could I continue to serve him? How could I correctly represent and serve the Harijan cause?  What right had I to be his door-keeper?  I had   the hell of a night, and in sheer desperation I wrote to him a note imploring him to put me away. This exasperated him all the more and made the cross heavier to bear. He would prefer death, he said, at the hands of one who loved, to life at the hands of one who did not love him ! Instead of realizing my folly and repairing it by going to Puri with a band of satyagrahi pilgrims, he said, I had gone into hysterics over a well- meant rebuke ! Instead of serving my wife, he said, I had in my blind love of her
 
 encouraged her superstition !
 All this was too stunning for words. I felt that Gandhiji, who has performed several spiritual operations using the chloroform of love, had performed this one without that chloroform. In resentment I cried :
 To live with the saints in heaven Is a bliss and a glory,
 But to live with a saint on earth Is a different story.
 May it not be that he had made a mountain of a molehill ?
 But who am I to judge? As I write this I feel that I was perhaps too dense to probe into the workings of his highy sensitive mind. And after all he who had devoted half a century of vigilant endeavour to the pursuit of truth and ahimsa should be trusted to judge a situation better than I, ever liable to be swayed by passions and desires. What may appear to me to be trifles may be matters of life and death to him. I realized that however difficult life with him may appear sometimes, separation would be still more unbearable. He disclaims saintship. He claims to be no better than the smallest of us. I realized that I had grievously erred in associating even in thought those doleful lines with him. Whether he is a saint or a mere mortal, like all of us, I see that my cry for separation was a fit of frenzy. For when I look upon the note that I wrote to him, I feel I could not have gone five yards before returning as a penitent.
 And after all is said and done, one thing stands out in bold relief—Gandhiji’s uncompromising love of the Harijans and his anxiety to lay down his life for that cause. The poignant utterance became a call to greater dedication for the cause. The incident burnt into every one of those who attended the Sangh meeting this year the lesson that no one shall tamper with that most important item of the constructive programme and that everyone shall be wide awake. The week of retreat in sacred Orissa became more sacred with the cleansing effect of the electric shock that Gandhiji gave them, and the members went home with a message that they are not likely easily to forget.

 LETTER FROM KHWAJA NAZIMUDDINlibtech_623_footnote
 
DEAR MR. GANDHI,
 
 
May 11, 1938
  I 	write to acquaint you with the conclusions which have been reached 	by the Government of Bengal in the matter of the premature release 	of terrorist convicts. In formulating these proposals, Government 	have given the most careful consideration to the suggestions which 	you were good enough to put forward in your letter of April 12.  It 	is necessary to emphasize at the outset that the scheme which is 	embodied in the succeeding paragraph is to be regarded as a 	connected plan, the different parts of which form a single and 	indivisible whole. As such, it is communicated not only for securing 	your own acceptance, but also the acceptance of Mr. Sarat Chandra 	Bose, President of the Bengal Provincial Congress Committee as well 	as the leader of the Congress party in the Assembly.  Government 	desire to commend the scheme to your most earnest conside- ration, 	because the declared acceptance by you, and by the Congress of 	Government’s policy in this matter is a vital precedent condition 	to the adoption of the plan. In the absence of that acceptance 	Government will regard these proposals as null and void and will 	continue to discharge their responsibilities in this matter, 	according to the policy which has already been announced in the 	Legislature.  The 	scheme is as follows :   To 		release forthwith 		terrorist convicts suffering from 		serious and con- 		tinued illness.  To 		release as 		soon as 		possible those convicts 		who have not been con- 		victed of 		offences involving the 		actual commission of 		murder and 		serious violence, 		and have a 		comparatively short 		period of their 		sentences not in 		excess of 		18 months still 		to serve.  To 		place the cases of the remaining 		convicts before 		an Advisory 		Committee which will examine them on 		individual merits and 		make such recommen- 		dations in 		each case to 		Government as 		it thinks 		fit.   The 	decision as to the orders to be passed in each case, after 	consideration of the recommendation of the Advisory Committee, will 	rest with Government.   The 		Advisory Committee 		will be appointed 		by Government 		and will  consist 		of 9 members 		as follows :   The 		President, a retired judicial officer of high standing; A 		member of 		the Coalition Party;     
  A 	member of 	the Legislative Assembly 	from the Congress Party;  A 	member of 	the Legislative 	Assembly from amongst the 	representatives of 	the Scheduled Castes; A member of the Legislative Assembly from the Liberal Party; A 	member of 	the Legislative Council 	from the Congress Party; A 	European member of the Legislature; One 	other Muslim member; and An official. 
 The names of the members constituting the Committee will be announced as early as possible.
 As an integral part of the scheme it shall be agreed and accepted between the Government, yourself and the Congress as follows :
  That 	no attempt 	will be 	made hereafter 	by the 	Congress, or 	by any other 	body with the 	support, tacit or 	open, of 	the Congress to 	secure an 	advance upon these 	terms, and the matter shall cease to be a political issue;  That 	you and the Congress 	will actively discourage all 	forms of 	agita-tion for 	the accelerated release 	of prisoners, 	all attacks 	in the 	Press on 	the policy 	of Government 	in the 	matter of 	terrorist prisoners, all 	demonstrations and 	receptions on 	the release 	of such 	prisoners or 	thereafter, and 	all statements,writings 	and speeches 	favourable to 	terrorists or terrorism;  That 	you and the Congress will 	take every step 	possible to 	create and 	maintain public 	opinion against 	hunger-striking and will 	publicly condemn such 	a course if adopted. 
 In proposing these terms and conditions, the Government of Bengal have gone to the utmost limit which they consider to be compatible with the discharge of their responsibilities for the eradication of this canker of terrorism, which has for so long been a recurrent factor in the political life of the Province. They have done so in the hope of mobilizing public opinion and of contributing to the creation and maintenance of the atmosphere calculated to render a recrudescence of terrorism unlikely. Government earnestly desire the active association with themselves of all who genuinely wish for the ordered and non-violent political development of the country. Your own support I claim with the confidence of one who knows how much you have the same object at heart.
 I should be glad, therefore, if you will be good enough to communicate your views on these proposals as early as possible, and I would suggest that it would be appropriate if you would communicate with Mr. Subhas Chandra Bose and the Leader of the Congress Party in the Legislative Assembly, Bengal, with a view to obtaining their acceptance. . . .

 I have already admitted an error of judgment committed by me in presenting my resignation to the Governor on the eve of the  meeting of  the  Working Committee. I admit that I have been guilty of indiscipline. I, as an old Congressman, should have known the value of discipline.

 I am sincerely sorry for what has happened on account of this loss of balance and I think that it is my duty to relinquish all positions of trust in the Congress, whose cause I have put in jeopardy by my action. I shall be content if I am permitted  to serve as a camp-follower. I shall do everything in my power to retrieve the prestige which the Congress has lost through my action.
 I hope that all Congressmen will rally round the Working Committee in its endeavour to form a united and stable ministry, for there are rumours of a split in the Province between Maharashtra and Mahakoshal. I hope that good counsels will prevail and we shall not think in terms of Maharashtra and Mahakoshal. I shall try my best to prevent any such split.

 APPENDIX V
 WORKING COMMITTEE RESOLUTION ON C. P. CRISISlibtech_627_footnote
 After having heard the Parliamentary Sub-committee and given anxious consideration to  the   events   that   have   happened   since   the   agreement   arrived at in Pachmarhi between the Ministers in the presence of the members of the Parliamentary Sub-committee and the Presidents of the three Provincial Congress Committees concerned, and after having had several  interviews  with  Dr.  Khare,  the Working Committee have reluctantly come to the conclusion that by the series of acts committed by Dr. Khare, culminating in his resignation of his charge and demanding the resignation of his colleagues of their charge, Dr. Khare was guilty of grave errors of judgment, which have exposed the Congress in the C. P. to ridicule and brought down its prestige. He was also guilty of gross indiscipline in that he
 
 
 acted in spite of warnings against any precipitate action.
 His resignation was the direct cause for the exercise, for the first time since office-acceptance by the Congress, by a Governor of his special powers, whereby Dr. Khare’s three colleagues were dismissed. The Working Committee note with satisfaction that these three Congress Ministers showed their loyalty to the Congress by declining, without instructions from the Parliamentary Sub-committee, to tender their resignations which were demanded by the Governor.
 Dr. Khare was further guilty of indiscipline in accepting the invitation of the Governor to form a new Ministry, and, contrary to the practice of which he was aware,  in actually forming a new Ministry and taking the oath of allegiance without  reference to the Parliamentary Sub-committee, and the Working Committee, specially when he knew that the meetings of these bodies were imminent.
 By all these acts of his Dr. Khare has proved himself unworthy of holding positions of responsibility in the Congress organization. He should be so considered till, by his services as a Congressman, he has shown himself well balanced and capable of observing strict discipline and discharging the duties that may be undertaken by him.
 The working Committee have also come to the reluctant conclusion that H. E. the Governor of the C. P. has shown, by the ugly haste with which he turned night into day and forced the crisis that has overtaken the province, that he was eager to weaken and discredit the Congress in so far as it lay in him to do so. The Working Committee hold that, knowing, as he must have, what was going on among members of the Cabinet and the instructions of the Parliamentary Sub-committee, he ought not to have, with unseemly haste, accepted the resignation of the three Ministers and demanded the resignation of the other three, dismissed them on their refusal to resign, and immediately called upon Dr. Khare to form a new Ministry and sworn in the available members of the new Ministry without waiting for the meeting of the Working Committee which was imminent.
