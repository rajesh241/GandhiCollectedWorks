libtech_3_footnote,"1The Somali, by which Chhaganlal Gandhi sailed from India, was first  expected to arrived at Durban on july 15, 1911, according to the German East African Line advertisement in Indian Opinion, 15-7-1911. A news-item appearing in the Gujarati section the same week, however, mentions that the boat would arrive on july 18, 1911, instead. Acually she arrived on July 20, 1911, Indian Opinion 22-7-1911. From Gandhiji’s letter of July 12, 1911 to Maganlal Gandhi (p.123), it is clear that he has heard from Chhaganlal Gandhi but is awaiting a cable from him, presumably about his arrival. It was therefore, on a Monday following July 12, 1911, that this letter was written, that is, on July 17, 1911. On this Monday, it was still believed that s.s. Somali would arrive on July 18, 1911. Thus it is that Gandhiji says later in the letter that Chhaganlal and the others must have arrived by the time Maganlal got this letter."

This emanated from the Colonial Secretary’s Office but the Protector’s  Department provided Hindi and Tamil translations. While Clause 3 of the Act exempted re- indentured Indians from “arrears” of the £3 tax, the English circular mentioned “licence money due”and the translations probably suggested exemption from current payments as well. Aiyer (footnote 2, p.162) brought the issue to the notice of The Natal Mercury which, in an article published on November 8, 1911, opposed the interpretation as contained in the circular produced by Aiyer with that of the Union law officers who argued that the interpretation would depend upon the wording of the statute which they held made re-indentured men liable to payment of the current tax.

In 1911, at Stanger, a woman hawker was sent to prison for two weeks for failure to pay this tax owing to  extreme  poverty.  Indian  Opinion, 8-7-1911. The Indian Immigration Law of 1891 fixed the wages of indentured Indians at 16s. per month for the first year, rising to 20s. per month for the fifth year (Vol. I, pp. 215-6), while the wage for a Native worker in the Rand mines about the year 1901 was 45s. per month and Native labour was unobtainable even at that price; Gandhiji had always therefore argued that the Indian labourers’ savings from which they paid the tax could not have been very considerable. Maud Polak, in a letter to the Colonial Office (C.O. 477) mentions a Natal planter who testified before a South Afican Commission that “only 6 per cent. of ex-indentured Indians could afford to pay the £3 tax”."
libtech_176_footnote,"3Natal Indians had always objected to the £3 tax on indentured Indians who had become free men on the ground that the tax was not a source of revenue but a measure designed to drive the Indian out after his term of indenture and that it was repugnant to British constitutional traditions.

W. Ritch’s name. The Europeans of Boksburg, an East Rand centre which had hitherto allowed no Asiatic to trade in the town, called a meeting on November 8, and protested against the advent of Asiatic competition. A few days earlier the East Rand Express had styled Bhyat as an “astute invader” who, with the help of Ritch and his “influential European friends in England”, was forcing a test case and promised that the local whites would fight “to the last ditch”. An editorial in Indian Opinion, 4-11-1911, agreed that the “clear-cut issue” was whether British Indians could trade or pursue their crafts outside “coolie Locations”. The Transvaal leader, too, took up the cry of white self-preservation and the European Press spoke of an “Asiatic invasion” and declared that European traders could never compete with the Asiatics with their “primitive mode of existence”, “Oriental ingenuity” and “inferior standard of civilization”. This meeting passed three resolutions, demanding that: (a) action should be taken against Bhyat under Section 131 of the Gold Law; (b) the condition under which the leasehold of Ritch’s property was converted into a freehold—that no Coloured person should reside thereon or trade therein—should be enforced; and (c) municipal facilities be denied to Bhyat by the Town Council. The Town Council, in its meeting of November 22, 1911, was faced with more extreme amendments to these resolutions and was called upon to instruct the Receiver of Revenue to cancel all existing Asiatic trade licences. In its meeting of December 8, the Town Council, however, rescinded its amendments having meanwhile taken legal advice and forwarded the resolutions to  the Government. Meanwhile, the Mayor and the Chairman of the Committee of the Town Council had met General Smuts in deputation and he assured them that the  Government would take immediate steps regarding the stands occupied by Coloured persons in Boksburg. On January 12, 1912 the Government served a notice on Ritch through their lawyers asking him to surrender the crown Grant of August 21, 1911 which gave him freehold of the Stands since he had “violated the conditions of Grant by permitting Coloured persons... to reside on the Stands”. On February 12, 1912, the Supreme Court (Transvaal Division) issued summonses against Ritch and Bhyat following an application by the Government and hearing commenced on June 7. The Minister of Justice had moved the Supreme Court for a declaration that the plaintiff was entitled to the ownership of the said Stand since the defendant had refused to cancel the transfer deed and to deliver up the possession of the Stand.

libtech_453_footnote,"2While Law 3 of 1885 did prohibit a Transvaal Asiatic from owning landed property outside Locations, it did not prevent a European from doing so on his behalf whether in perpetual leasehold or freehold. In 1905, the Transvaal Supreme Court “definitely recognized these equitable trusts as between nominal European owners and Asiatic virtual owners” (case of Syed Ismail and Another v. Jacobs cited by Maud Polak). The effect of the Townships Amendment Act and the Gold Law of 1908 was to annul these confirmed rights. Under the Townships Act, Part II, Chapter 3, Section 9(1), leaseholds of all Stands in Stands Townships were automatically converted into freehold on the payment of a licence fee. The lessor or owner was admittedly not obliged to take out a freehold title. If he did so, Section 130 of the Gold Law of 1908, prohibiting the subletting of premises or the residence of Asiatics thereon, came into force. Obviously, in cases where the property was held in trust, the Indian could not himself take out a freehold owing to the prohibition on “Coloured ownership”. If the nominal European owner did so, he became liable under the Townships Act, Chapter 3, Section 3(1), to criminal prosecution, and his property would become forfeit to the Government, under Sections 130 and 131 of the Gold Law of 1908, which was brought into operation in such cases. It happened in cases where the laws were read together. That is, he could not then allow a Coloured person other than a domestic servant to reside on Township properties. Moreover, when such property passed at"

As for proof of marriage, although it was from the Transvaal that Mrs. Sodha, Bai Rasul and Mrs. Jussat were turned away by virtue of very stringent judicial interpretations on the sanctity of marriages contracted under the law of other religions, Gandhiji here seems to have in mind the Natal circular issued only a few days previously by Cousins and referred to in 1st and 2nd footnote of “The New Broom”, 13-7-1912."

Soon after his arrival he received a cable from the Natal Indian Congress authorizing him to represent that body in his dealings with the Indian Government and public organizations. He was instructed to lay great stress on the abolition of the £3 Tax. Polak addressed many letters and petitions on the subject to the Secretary, Department of Commerce and Industry. His other communications to the Government of India dealt with the Transvaal Townships Amendment Act of 1908, the Gold Law, and the Transvaal Government’s refusal to recognize “polygamous marriages” contracted under Muslim Law. He also addressed the Calcutta session of the Indian National Congress held between December 26 and 29 on the Indian situation in South Africa (“Mr. Polak at the National Congress”, p.207) and his speech was received with great ovation. He also surveyed the South African situation in a speech delivered at the sixth session of the All-India Muslim League. Other meetings he addressed passed resolutions condemning the treatment of Indians in South Africa and demanded that the Indian Government take steps to end their grievances and abolish the system of indentured labour. The memorial that the Sheriff’s meeting (pp. 299-300) addressed to the Viceroy was the outcome of Polak’s “stirring speech”.

It measures 4Ω” x 3 Ω” (Crown sexto-decimo size). Written in Gandhiji’s hand, it contains, for the most part, names of persons he wrote to each day and of those who visited hem at Tolstoy Farm and references to his visits to Johannesburg or to Phoenix. While all these notes are in Gujarati, the entries of daily receipts and disbursements, made in single vertical column, are in English. These accounts presumably concern the petty cash kept with him at the Farm and include sundry credits and receipts and disbursements on account of the school. The punctuation in the Diary is meagre and sometimes misleading. Marks of punctuation have been supplied where absolutely necessary. In transliterating names of persons from the Gujarati, English spellings have been taken over from advertisements or news-items in the Indian Opinion issues for the year or from the English entries in the accounts column. As for proper names, which could not be checked with contemporaneous sources, the conventional or phonetic spelling has been used. Of  the  letters mentioned in the Diary, the few that have been traced have been identified by cross- references."

Mr. Gandhi thought, and he agreed, that it was politic and expedient to concentrate efforts on obtaining for those already in South Africa the same conditions as were enjoyed by Europeans. The grievances that could be redressed included ability to enter and leave South Africa without difficulty; to migrate freely from one Province to another; to reside where they might choose; to acquire and own land and other property; . . . to enjoy the municipal and political franchise; and to enter  the  Government   service   and   public   life.   .   .”   Indian   Opinion, 4-1-1913."

He asked the local magistrate to issue him a visitors’ permit for Natal which the latter in this ignorance of Cape Immigration laws thought unnecessary. He was, however, issued a certificate of identity which mentioned his standing in the community. On arrival at Durban, Cousins, the Natal Immigration Officer summoned him and discovered that he had neither a visiting pass for Natal nor a permit of temporary absence from the Cape. While Cousins issued him a visiting pass for Natal, he ordered Gajjar to stay on in Durban until he had obtained the Minister’s instructions, but refused to allow his family to disembark on the ground that Gajjar was technically a “prohibited immigrant” in both provinces--in Natal because he had not got a visiting pass and in the Cape because he had not obtained a permit of absence. He was, however, allowed to return home as “an act of grace”. Polak then wrote to The Natal Mercury saying, “Such, however, is the ‘humane’ administration of the Immigration Law that Mr. Gokhale was given to understand might be expected when he interviewed  the Ministers at Pretoria. Are these expectations never to be realized, and is every conceivable occasion to be seized to harass unfortunately placed members of the Indian community?” Indian Opinion, 11-1-1913."

They were both accompanied by their wives one of whom had brought her baby with her. Although one of the men could have passed the education test and both calimed that they had been in the Transvaal on May 31, 1902, Cousins, the  Immigra- tion Officer refused them visitors’ permits. Polak obtained an affidavit from a respect- able Transvaal Indian who vouched for their identity and certified that they had been in the Transvaal on May 31, 1902, but Cousins refused to consider their claim without instructions from the Registrar of Asiatics; he further refused to communicate with the Registrar or to give the applicants visitors’ passes. Polak telegraphed the Registrar of Asiatics and asked Goodricke and Laughton, attorneys, to apply for an interdict against Cousins and other parties to prevent removal of applicants, pending consideration of their claims by the Transvaal authorities. The interdict from the Supreme Court was obtained, a condition being that applicants should lodge £100 as security. Cousins,  after considerable delay, went aboard ship and demanded that applicants sign  a document authorizing him to keep them under restraint at the Detention Camp and to use the security for their maintenance. Polak protested that it was unlawful, but Cousins,"

Replying on September 24, Polkinghorne admitted that “a few” deaths had occurred but assured that there was “no need for any alarm”. The Editor wrote again enquiring about the number of those dead, affected or detained owing to the disease. In reply, Polkinghorne referred him to a Natal Mercury news report. Indian Opinion of October 1 commented strongly on this reply, at which the Protector declined to give any further information to the Editor. On October 26, the Natal Indian Congress wrote to Polkinghorne who said he would supply the desired information provided they did not publish it in Indian Opinion. The Congress wrote to him on October 31 saying that, as the matter was a public one, they would certainly hand over Polkinghorne’s reply to the Press and that Indian Opinion could not be prevented from taking a “copy from the local dailies”; vide “Indentured Indians’ Plight”, 1-10-1910 and Indian Opinion, 1-10-1910 & 19-11-1910."

libtech_811_footnote,"1At Roodepoort, one Alfred Tamblin was charged under Section 130 of the Gold Law of 1908 for subletting a mining Stand to two Asiatics, Ahmed Khan and Abdulla Khan. His counsel argued that under the old Gold Law, an owner had the right  to sublet his Stand to Coloured persons and that under Section 77 of the present Gold Law, Coloured persons were entitled to acquire rights to Stand, but the case was remanded. Subsequently, a Krugersdorp magistrate found Tamblin guilty  and sentenced him. On appeal, the Transvaal Division of the Supreme Court Africa acquitted Tamblin and ruled that the Asiatics in question were protected by Section 77   of the new Gold Law.
