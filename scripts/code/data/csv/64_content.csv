  LETTER TO BRIJKRISHNA CHANDIWALA 
 August 3, 1934
 CHI. BRIJKRISHNA,
 Your letter. I am unable to draw any conclusions till Damod- ardas sends a reply to your letter. I must state this much that whatever  I say must be regarded only as a suggestion. It should be followed only if acceptable both to the mind and the heart, not otherwise. This being my attitude you are certainly at liberty to follow your own inclination. I am awaiting Damodardas’s letter in order to find out if I have to alter my opinion in any way so that I may inform you.
 You must be keeping well. It is good that you have reached a compromise at Delhi but nothing should be done at the cost of your health.
 Blessings from

  SPEECH AT BIHAR CENTRAL RELIEF COMMITTEE MEETING, PATNAlibtech_393_footnote 
 August 3, 1934
 It is in the fitness of things that we are having a resolution recording confidence and not expressing any elaborate appreciation. There were two reasons, one being that the report is not yet in the hands of the public and, secondly, the  general  committee  in eulogizing the work of its Managing Committee would be eulogizing itself. But the resolution is necessary in order to tell the public that the Managing Committee retains their confidence and that the general committee wants it to go ahead with its work. It is worth nothing that the Committee has expended just little less than half of the funds as its disposal; not that it could not spend it all, but it knew its limitations. Thus it might have attempted to clear the sand-covered areas and sunk
 
 the whole of the funds in sand. I am in a position to move this resolution because though I have not been able to go through the report, I have been in constant touch with the actual work of the Committee.
 There is a complaint that the Committee has not been mindful of the interests of the middle classes inasmuch as it has spent something like twenty-two thousand rupees for helping the middle classes. The complaint is hardly just because the total amount allotted is Rs. 5 lakhs and I am here to give the assurance that the balance will be spent for the middle classes. The critics must remember that those responsible for distribution of relief themselves belong to the middle classes and could not be accused of neglecting them. Besides, Government has distributed Rs. 22 lakhs for their relief, the Government being in a better position to ascertain the condition of these classes. The Bihar Central Relief Committee had naturally to concentrate its attention to the relief of the poorer classes inasmuch as it knows their condition and their grievances better than any other agency. It was well that there was a natural division of functions between the official agency and our agency. There was also another reason why relief to the middle classes could be deferred for a while, for they had much more staying power than the poor. I can assure you that not only the balance of Rs. 4,80,000 would be expended for the help of the middle classes, but that even more will be voted if it is needed and is available. I would ask everyone, who could afford, to go in for a copy of the report and study it. Every little contribution has been acknowledged. I would invite everyone to study the report critically and pass on his criticism to the Committee.
 I am thankful to the railway companies and the Tata Company for the concessions and the help they have extended to the Committee but I associate myself with Babu Rajendra Prasad that they should continue these concessions unless they have strong reasons not to do so.
 I am thankful that we had a band of volunteers and workers to help us in the work. Volunteer work is done ever so much efficiently and honestly than paid work. I hope and pray that the presentcalamity will have taught us the lessons of resourcefulness and self-help so that in case of future emergencies we may not be found wanting.
 I am sorry that we are not ready with the full audited accounts today. This is a thing that public organizations can illafford to neglect
 and we should always be ready to account for our receipts from minute to minute and from day to day. No care in this matter would be too great.
 In conclusion, I would ask you to note that the committee is not making a further appeal for funds mainly at my instance. It is not that we don’t want more money. The sum of Rs. 83 lakhs received for the Viceroy’s Fund and by the Bihar Central Relief Committee is hardly enough for our needs but we cannot appeal for more so long as we have not disbursed all the funds at our disposal. Let the public, however, remember that we may have to make an appeal in future and let them be prepared to pay as generously as they  have  done especially when they know that all the monies are well spent and every pie is accounted for.

  INTERVIEW TO THE PRESSlibtech_394_footnote 
 PATNA,
 August 3, 1934
 INTERVIEWER: Are you now in a position to say what your programme will be in the very near future ?
GANDHIJI: So far as I am aware this month will be devoted to
 fasting and convalescence. Thereafter what is in store for me in September I have no notion. But I can say this much. I am in no hurry to find myself in a prison. On the contrary, I shall try to avoid it to the best of my ability. If it becomes possible for me to avoid imprisonment for any length of time, I hope to be able to devote it undoubtedly to the continuation of the Harijan work and the rest of the constructive programme of the Working Committee, for I swear by that programme, and I am positive that if we are to mount to freedom through really non-violent means, the workers will have to qualifythemselves for such constructive work and devote themselves whole-heartedly to it.
 Though I am mainly responsible for the coming into being of the Congress Parliamentary Board, I have always insisted that it is the least part of the national programme. It will be useless, in terms of swaraj, without the backing of the constructive programme, not one on
 
 mere paper but in solid substantial Indiawide work. If God enables me to do so I hope to be able to show in its fulness the marvellous potency of the Working Committee’s resolutionlibtech_395_footnoteon swadeshi,  passed at Benares.
 But what about the split between Pandit Malaviya and Mr. Aney on the one hand and the Working Committee and the Parliamentary Board on the other?
You may call it a split if you like. In spite of Herculean efforts
 on either side to prevent the parting we saw that there  were fundamental differences which were not to be overcome and we have parted as friends and hope to remain as such although we might be fighting.
 Indeed I am not without hope that the fight could be avoided. How it will be, I do not know. How it can be, I do know. I have submitted my proposallibtech_396_footnotelibtech_397_footnoteto Pandit Malaviya. If it comes to anything it will have to go to the Working Committee and the Parliamentary Board. I have no power whatsoever to come to any agreement.
 But rumour has it that you and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel have agreed to divide half the available seats with Panditji and those who represent his point of view.
 I can give you a summary contradiction of that rumour. Indeed, any such division will be a betrayal of trust. After all, the Working Committee’s resolution enunciates a very big principle. If the members of the Working Committee had no confidence in the correctness of their position they would have been wrong to lose the co-operation of such men as Pandit Malaviya and Mr. Aney. The Working Committee and the Parliamentary Board have, therefore, to work out the comprehensive resolution on the White Paper and the Communal Award to its full extent and know, as also demonstrate, the efficacy of all its parts. That surely cannot be done by a surrender of half the available seats to the representatives of the view for which Pandit Malaviyaji stands. I would, therefore, urge the public  to discount all rumours.
 Pandit Malaviya is a seasoned servant of the nation. He is one amongst the very few of the oldest of Congressmen with an unbroken record of brilliant service and sacrifice. I have no manner of doubt that he will do nothing to undermine the Congress influence whether they put up a fight or it becomes possible, as I hope it will be, to come to an honourable understanding. But let me not anticipate.
 
 
 We have read the Working Committee’s resolutionlibtech_398_footnoteon discipline. There are Congressmen whose views coincide with those of Pandit Malaviya. In such cases, where they are members of Congress Committees, should they retire, as Mr. Aney has done ?
I personally do not think so. Disciplinary action in such matters
 can only extend to bodies corresponding to the Central Working Committee. Thus, the Provincial Congress Committees have members who may represent Malaviyaji’s point of view and advocate it in the Press or on the platform without being considered guilty of indiscipline, even as members of the All-India Congress Committee expressing views opposed to those held by the Working Committee will not be. But every Provincial Congress Committee has or should have its own Executive Committee corresponding to the Central Working Committee. That is the real Executive which has to carry out loyally and without murmur the whole of the Congress programme. And if any of the members has no faith in the programme he should retire from the Executive. But so long as he is in it, he may not criticize the programme either in the Press or on the platform. This is the view I have always held. Any other attitude will break to pieces any organization.
 Is it likely that you will devote any time now or in the near future to a special effort at tackling the terrorist problem? What special methods do you contemplate employing to bring revolutionary young men under control?
Indeed I am a determined opponent of the cult of violence. Not
 a day passes when I do not do or think something about this question which is one of life and death to me. But I would like to do ever so much more than I am able to at present. For that, however, I need help from outside, both Indian and English, official and non-official. The cult of violence is not going to die easily. I entertain no extravagant dreams about the establishment of the kingdom of non-violence on the earth. If I get the atmosphere for the work that I need, I would love to bury myself for some time in Bengal and see what possibility there is for me to battle with violence. But I have patience. God will open the way for me, if he wants me to work more actively than I am doing in that direction.libtech_399_footnote
It is a matter of great thankfulness for me that the tour was
 
 finished without interruption and according to the programme that was settled from time to time. The impression left on my mind is that untouchability is on its last legs. Millions who attended the meetings were not all utterly ignorant of all I had to say to them. They were certainly not indifferent. The intensive propaganda carried on by sanatanists had left no room for ignorance or indifference. Nothing was left undone to prejudice the mass mind against the movement. The grossest falsehoods were broadcast. It would be wrong, therefore, to say that the attendance of multitudes at the meetings was purely a personal compliment to me and had no reference to my message. I am quite sure that the message has appealed to the reason of the masses. I am also fully aware that all of them are not yet ready to translate their beliefs into practice. But I consider it a tremendous gain that the masses have begun to believe in the truth of the message. It makes the task of the workers easier than before. To show  how heartily the masses have taken part in the movement. I should mention that the eight lakhs of rupees collected during the past nine months represent contributions from the poorest. It has occupied hours, from day to day, of our accountants to count coppers and small coins, whether collected at public meetings or at railway stations. People are not known to contribute to the cause which they have utterly disliked. The third thing I should say about the tour is that a demonstrable awakening, on a large scale, has taken place among the  Harijans. Many of them have made unsolicited statements before me that the position had considerably advanced and that they had confidence that untouchability would be a thing of the past in the near future. I share their confidence. If the movement goes on as it is doing at present— and I have no doubt that it will go on—it must cause daily increasing awakening among Harijans and when they fully realize how they can substantially help themselves, and how in many cases the law is with them, whether savarna Hindus like it or not, Harijans would make good their position. I would, of course, hope that savarna Hindus will realize the wickedness of untouchability as it is practised today and get rid of it themselves rather than that they should be compelled to do so by circumstances beyond their control. Whatever happens, untouchability cannot survive for many years.
 Much mischievous agitation has been led on this question in spite of my having cleared the position at the beginning stage of the Harijan tour. No temple was opened where there was not a virtual consensus of opinion, in favour of opening, on the part of those who
 
 were in the habit of visiting those temples. Nobody has ever suggested that when practically the whole congregation is in favour of such opening, the temple should not be opened. As to the Temple-entry Bill, I hold that it is a legal necessity. But I have declared times without number that I would be no party to forcing the Bill through the Assembly by the vote of a mixed majority. It is, therefore, that Mr. C. Rajagopalachariar is ascertaining independently Hindu sentiment in the legislature and if Hindu sentiment is against the Bill, so far as I am concerned, it will be withdrawn. With all these reservations, therefore, all agitation against the measures ought to die, unless I commit a breach of faith. How I wish that the undivided attention of all Hindus was concentrated on the ameliorative measures that have been adopted by the Harijan Sevak Sangh !
 Let me finally add that no money has been spent during these nine months in connection with the temple-entry agitation or the Bill. No temple has been built out of Harijan purses.

  LETTER TO MANILAL AND SUSHILA GANDHI 
 August 4, 1934
 CHI. MANILAL AND SUSHILA,
 I thought I would write a few lines before the fast which commences in two days’ time. We are in a train just now. We shall reach Wardha tomorrow morning. Devdas had come to Kashi. He parted from us at Allahabad.
 This time it may be said that I have already begun the fast; but how can I claim merit for it? Not being well during the last two days I have not taken milk for four days. For two days I have been eating only fruit, and that too in small quantity. Even so, my strength and weight have remained satisfactory. That means that the body has lost nothing yet except the toxins. There is, therefore, no cause at all for worry. By the time you get this letter, everything will have been over. Hence it even seems unnecessary to write all this. But I thought you should know my condition as it is today.
 Sushila seems to be giving you excellent help. If she had a stronger body, she could have done much more. But what she is able to do is quite satisfactory. You must have received the name selected for Arun and sent to you.
 Ramdas’s health causes anxiety. He has become very much emaciated. If you can get passes for him and Dr. Sharma, I would send them over there. But don’t ask for them as a special favour. If they can be obtained in the natural course, it is all right.
 With me are Ba, Mahadev, Prabhavati, Valjibhai, Kakasaheb, Thakkar Bapa and Prithuraj. The others have gone to Wardha in advance.
I hope Manilal has been able to make a good collection.

  TALK ON RAMANAMA libtech_401_footnote 
 August 4, 1934 libtech_402_footnote
 Ramanama to me is all-sufficing. There are as many names of God as His manifestations, but sages have, as a result of their lifelong penance, devised names to be uttered by the devotees, in order to be able to commune with the Nameless. There are other mantras than Ramanama, but for me that is supreme. It has become part of my life. When [I was] a child, my nurse taught me to repeat Ramanama whenever I felt afraid or miserable and it has been second nature with me with growing knowledge and advancing years. I may even say that the work is in my heart, if not actually on my lips, all the twenty-four hours. It has been my saviour and I am ever stayed on it. In the spiritual literature of the world, the Ramayana of Tulsidas takes a foremost place. It has charms that I miss in the Mahabharata  and even  in Valmiki’s Ramayana.

  INTERVIEW AT JABALPUR libtech_403_footnote 
 August 4, 1934
 Mahatma Gandhi, in spite of weakness, appeared cheerful. Interviewed, he said that at present he was quite well and his temperature was normal. He also stated that he would commence his seven days’ fast from August 7. He also inquired about the local political atmosphere and party quarrels.
 Replying, Seth Govind Das said that though the atmosphere is tense with party feelings, efforts are being made to bring about a satisfactory compromise between the rival groups of the workers, adding that in the event of a satisfactory compromise not being arrived at, he along with his friends had decided to retire from political arena and patiently wait for the time when his service will be required by the motherland.
 Mahatma Gandhi expressed approval of Seth Govind Das’s views and said that in order to avoid conflict and friction, he had always advised loyal Congressmen to retire from the field of party-feeling and to devote their energies in other constructive and solid programme.
 
 Mahatma Gandhi also appealed to the public to contribute towards the Harijan Fund and collections were made on the spot.

  MESSAGE  ON  BIRTHDAYlibtech_404_footnote

 I cannot understand how anyone who has even a drop of pity for the semi-starved millions living in seven lakh villages, can oppose spinning or khadi.
     From a photostat of the Gujarati: G. N. 7752     OF  “HARIJAN”   M. K. GANDHI        [August 	 6, 1934]libtech_405_footnote 
  	With the completion of the tour and the year of probation  during 	which I was to devote myself wholly to the Harijan cause and take no 	active part in politics, many have begun to speculate about my 	immediate future activity. Happily, the fast is to predetermine my 	course during it and for some time after. But, even apart from the 	fast, I should like to say that, whilst it is open to me to speak 	and write on politics, I propose to keep myself aloof from them as 	much as  possible. The joy of the past self-restraint is too fresh 	to fade from the memory and to induce volubility of political 	speech. My partiality for Harijan and kindered causes persists and 	will persist, I hope, to the end of my life.  	And what is true of my general attitude is truer still of Harijan. 	No doubt I shall have to do more political work. I may be 	compelled to resort to civil resistance. But the Harijan 	will remain what it has been ever since its inception. It 	will rigorously eschew all politics. But now that I expect to have 	some time for them, it will, I hope, deal with constructive causes, 	more especially those that have direct connection      activities 	in “The Purification Week”, Mahadev Desai had explained under 	this date that “though thoroughly exhausted [Gandhiji] wrote a few 	letters and the two articles for the last [week’s] Harijan”. 	The “two articles” 	referred to are this and the following. 
 with Harijans. It will, therefore, consistently with the Harijan interest and as time permits and occasion arises, deal with communal unity, khadi and all the processes leading to khadi, other branches of swadeshi, temperance and the constructive side of prohibition and the condition of the so-called criminal or aboriginal tribes, who live on the border-line of untouchability.

  SWADESHI 
 [August  6, 1934]libtech_406_footnote
 Early in the year, if not immediately after my convalescence last year, I was called upon by those who were interested in swadeshi to frame a definition so as to answer the many difficulties that faced them. I had to bear in mind the various shades of swadeshi in textiles.  I put together the definitions that were suggested. I had correspo- ndence with Shri Shivarao and Shri Jalbhai Naoroji and well as others.  I failed to frame a definition that would suit all cases and found that it was impossible to frame an exhaustive definition . As I was travelling far and wide, I had the opportunity of observing things and of seeing how swadeshi organizations were functioning. I came to the conclusion that the existing practice was an unconscious fraud upon the public and that many workers of ability were wasting their energy in a vain effort. They were practising self-deception. This strong language, whilst it correctly describes my mental attitude, is not intended to cast any reflection whatsoever upon the workers in swadeshi organizations. They were doing their best without realizing that they were moving in a vicious circle and labouring under self- deception.
 Let me explain what I mean. We were holding exhibitions of things that were in no need of special help or of advertisement for their sale. In their case, our interposition can either stimulate the prices of their wares or set up unhealthy rivalries between flourishing but competing firms.
 We may profess to gratuitously help textile, sugar and rice mills and, respectively, kill the village spinning-wheel, the handloom and their product, khadi, the village cane-crusher and its product, the vitamin-laden and nourishing gur or molasses, and the hand-pounder
 and its product, unpolished rice, whose pericarp, which holds the vitamins, is left intact by these pounders. Our clear duty is, therefore, to investigate the possibility of keeping in existence the village wheel, the village crusher and the village pounder, and, advertising their products, discovering their qualities, ascertaining the condition of the workers and the number displaced by the power-driven machinery and discovering the methods of improving them, whilst retaining their village character, to enable them to stand the competition of the mills. How terribly and criminally we have neglected them ! Here, there is no antagonism to the textile or the sugar or the rice mills. Their products must be preferred to the corresponding foreign products. If they were in danger of extinction from foreign competition, they should receive the needed support. But they stand in no such need. They are flourishing in spite of foreign competition. What is needed is protection of the village crafts and the wokers behind them from the crushing competition of the power-driven machinery, whether it is worked in India or in foreign lands. It may be that khadi, gur and unpolished rice have no intrinsic quality and that they should die. But, except for khadi, not the slightest effort has been made, so far as I am aware, to know anything about the fate of the tens of thousands of villagers who were earning their livelihood through crushing cane and pounding rice. Surely, there is in this work enough for an army of patriots. The reader will say, ‘but this is very difficult work’. I admit. But it is most important and equally interesting. I claim that this is true, fruitful and cent per cent swadeshi.
 But I have as yet merely touched the fringe of the question. I have merely sampled three big organized industries and shown how voluntary swadeshi agencies need to concentrate their attention solely on the corresponding unorganized village industries that are dying for want of voluntary and intelligent, organized help.
 There are numberless other village, and even town, crafts that need public support, if they are to live and thus  maintain  the thousands of poor artisans depending upon them for  their  daily  bread. Every ounce of work in this direction tells. Every hour given to this work means the sustenance of some deserving workers.
 It is my certain conviction that, if work is done on a systematic basis in this direction, the department doing it will become self- supporting, new talent will be stimulated, the educated as well as the uneducated unemployed will find honourable employment without displacing anyone and crores will be added yearly to the wealth of this
 country, which is getting progressively impoverished.
 Here is enough profitable and entertaining work and to spare for all the swadeshi leagues put together. The recent resolutionlibtech_407_footnoteof  the Working Committee on ‘swadeshi’ means all this and much more. It provides limitless work for the creative genius in the country.

  A LETTER 
 August 6, 1934
 MY DEAR. . . libtech_410_footnote ,
 Jamnalal and Swami Anand report that you have made different statements to different persons, that you have not fulfilled many of your promises to Swami Anand and that their strong suspicion almost amounting to belief is that you have made up the story about the girl. This seems to me to be unbelievable. And yet if you cannot give me the name of the girl, I must also reluctantly come to the conclusion that Jamnalal or Swami are fast coming to.
 Your concern about the girl is surely needless. You will be surprised to learn that . . . libtech_411_footnoteand his wife are sitting by me while I am writing this. It would be a great shock to me if I discover in you a young man in the prime of life capable of connections involving the honour of girls of tender age.
 
 May God be your guide and help. Love.

  LETTER  TO RANCHHODLAL A.  SHODHAN 
 August  6, 1934
 CHI. RANCHHODLAL,
 I was shocked when I heard about your financial condition from Jamnalalji yesterday. I had never imagined that money deposited with you would be unsafe in any circumstaces. In my view, you credit was higher than that of the Bank of India. Is that true no more? If not, why not? Why did you not even breathe a word to me about the matter? If you wish to be as a son to me, you must always tell me about things like this. In such a situation Jamnalalji would most certainly have told me.
 Let me know the details in brief. Do this thing now. Don’t keep back a single pie. Hand over even the house and the furniture and the jewellery to the creditors. If anything is held in Motibehn’s or Rama’s name, they and you should regard that as belonging to the creditors. The gifts given to relations in times of prosperity should be looked upon as deposits on behalf of creditors to be used in the hour of misfortune. Difficult times come to all. He alone will have lived well who preserves his honour even at the cost of his wife and children, as Harishchandra did. I hope that you will not—I bless you that you may not—shrink from heroism such as Harishchandra’s.
 Do not worry about my fast. Reassure me by giving me proof of your uprightness.

 CHI. BRIJKRISHNA,
 I had your telegram, and the letter too. A telegram has been sent in replylibtech_412_footnoteto yours. It is regrettable that you show such impatience.
 
 How can I encourage it? Even in such things you have to exercise self-control. What service can you render? The Ashram is full of people ready to serve. I am keeping out all those who are not here. I have stopped Mehta and Bidhan too. Now, how can I allow you? You can do there what you can. You may clean the Harijan locality and take with you whosoever wishes to join. Has the Municipality done anything? Have you not received Damodardas’s reply by now? What does it mean? Tell me promptly. His remarks are such that I cannot leave matters at that.
       From 	a photostat of the Hindi: G. N. 2418     STATEMENT ON FAST libtech_413_footnote   Blessings 	from  BAPU        August 	6, 1934 
  	As I enter upon the seven days’ fast from tomorrow (Tuesday), I 	would like to re-emphasize the necessity on the part of Harijan 	workers helping the cause by greater personal purification and 	greater concentration on the work before them. The monster of 	untoucha- bility will not be killed without constant and ceaseless 	effort on the part of workers who have faith in the mission and who 	have by patient toil built up personal purity and integrity. Let 	everyone also realize that fasting is not for everyone and for every 	 occasion.  Fasting without faith may even lead to disastrous 	consequences. All such spiri- tual weapons are dangerous when 	handled by unqualified persons.  	I would like to utter a word of warning to Congressmen and Congress 	workers. During the coming seven days I shall be filled with 	thoughts about them as I have been during the past month. The 	acrimony with which Congress elections have been fought in some 	places and the unclean methods adopted by Congress workers by 	manipulating votes and grossly abusing the rule about habitual 	wearing of khadi have filled me with horror and dismay. The 	constitution provides for truthful and non-violent methods. In some 	provinces, at some elections, truth and non-violence have been 	conspicuous by their absence. Though my fast has nothing to do with 	these unclean methods, how I wish Congress workers will detect my    
 anguish in the words I have written and lighten it during the purification week by resorting to self-introspection and resolving to make the Congress an organization in keeping with its creed, so that anyone who cares may without difficulty find it to be a living embodiment of its creed. I shall certainly be praying for its purification. Purity of this, the greatest national organization cannot but help the Harijan movement, since the Congress is also pledged to the removal of the curse.
 Finally, I ask all friends, whether in India or outside, no matter to what faith or race they may belong, to pray that God may bless the forthcoming little penance.

         CHI. 	MIRA,   LETTER TO MIRABEHN     August 	7, 1934 
  	At 6 a.m. I entered upon the fast. It is now 7 a.m. I do hope that 	you would not be disturbed during the week. There is no cause for 	uneasiness. But what is the use of my saying all this? Ere this 	reaches, the fast would have been twice over.  	You are quite right in repeating your warning. (At this stage I felt 	too sleepy to write, so I slept. It is now 7.30 a.m.) So long as you 	feel like giving the warning, you should go on doing it, in ever so 	emphatic terms. Some day it may have its full effect. Partial effect 	there is even now. It keeps me on my guard. If . . . libtech_414_footnotecopied me, he had surely a corrupt mind. For there is 	no warrant for thinking that any other person was similarly affected 	unless of course I have been kept in the dark or unless you suggest 	that every fall in the Ashram was due to my practice. So far as. . 	.libtech_415_footnotelibtech_416_footnoteis concerned, Jamnalalji and Swami Anand with whom. . 	.libtech_417_footnotelibtech_418_footnotehad long talks have almost come to the conclusion that 	. . .libtech_419_footnotelibtech_420_footnotehas concocted the whole story for the purpose of 	blackmail. They are both finishing the chain. But this is all by the 	way. You should not disturb yourself over this. I don’t. I take 	the necessary steps and forget all about it. You have given a whole       
 paragraph to the matter. Hence this reply.
 Many changes are taking place in my mind just now. The corruption in the Congress is preying on me as it has never before done. I am conferring with friends as to the advisability of leaving the Congress  and  pursuing  its  ideals   outside   it.libtech_421_footnoteIt   is  good   that   the corruption agitates   me. I shall take no hasty step but there it is. And  I feel that the girls’ institution here should be closed unless I am prepared to sit down in Wardha or Vinoba takes the sole responsibility of its management. He will think over it during the fast. These are the two things that are uppermost in my mind.
 The rest you will have from Mahadev or Pyarelal both of whom and Bal, Bapa, Devraj and Prithuraj are here. I insisted upon Jamnalalji going to Bombay for his ear trouble. Ba, Prabhavati and Om are of course here. And Vasumati and Amtul Salaam have insisted  on  coming here. The latter is somewhat better but by no means overwell.
 Your work there is certainly voluminous. You are putting forth extraordinary energy. What more can you do? Take your time. Do not get ill.

     LETTER TO AGATHA HARRISON   Unrevised	August 	7, 1934  DEAR 	AGATHA,  	Your love-letters continue to pour in on me. And as you have been 	hearing regularly from someone or other of the (now) many 	companions, I do not write to you. This is to tell you I entered 	upon the little fast at 6 a.m. today and to ask you not to worry. 	But where is the meaning in asking you not to worry when I know that 	this letter     
 would reach you only after the fast will have become a faint memory? That the fast is a fitting finish to the Harijan tour I have no doubt. It is a great spiritual instrument. That Protestantism has
virtually discarded it is a distinct loss to it and the world seeing what a
 power it is today in the world. However, I must not argue about it. If it is a desideratum of the soul, there are too many seekers after truth among Protestants not to feel the want of it sooner or later.
 During this month I shall be resting in Wardha and collecting my thoughts. What is in store for me in September I do not know. But this I do know. To go to the Frontier Province or to Bengal or to both alternately is a craving of the soul. Where to go first I do not know. If the so-called Red Shirts are violent, I must know them and disown them. If they are not, I must defend them against the slur cast on them. Those who are not given to lying and are well able to judge have testified to their non-violence. These are Khurshed Naoroji, a much-travelled woman of exquisite purity and honesty, Elwin whom you know and Devdas whom too you know are the three eye-witneses. And yet the British official testimony is equally emphatic the other way. It cannot be all manufacture. The mystery can only be solved if I am permitted to go and live in their midst. This is a fundamental necessity—greater perhaps than that of going to Bengal from one point of view. I go to the Frontier to find the truth and  act accordingly. I go to Bengal not to find any truth but to try to wean terrorists from terrorism. Detention of Abdul Ghaffar Khan and Jawaharlal is a great disturbing factor and a wholly unnecessary irritant. But this detention, while it worries me, does not just now appeal to me as a cause of war. Now you have an analysis of my mind as it is likely to be at the end of the month. What occupies my mind at present is how to achieve the purity of the Congress and to rid the Ashram here of subtle untruth and breaches of brahmacharya. Perhaps you are not sufficiently interested in such things. Here I was interrupted by an army of doctors. They have overhauled the system and say I must not do any writing even this first day of the fast. So goodbye and much love.

  SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING, WARDHAlibtech_423_footnote 
 August 7, 1934 I can say from experience that fasting is an essential part of Ashram life. The assault on Lalnath was certainly the occasion of the
 fast, but as I have said in my public statementlibtech_424_footnote, this fast is intended for the purification of many. If I were to have regard to all the incidents and happenings that have prompted me to take such a step, I should have to go on a much longer fast. But I am painfully aware of my own physical and spiritual limitations and hence could not think of a longer fast.
 Our Ashram was certainly in my mind when I made the decision to fast. There are two enemies against which we must guard—untruth and impurity. Purity of the mind is essential for the observance of all the vows. If the mind is not pure, no amount of physical restraint would avail. The Gita teaches us that the man who restrains the organs of action, whilst he allows the mind to run after the objects of the senses, is a hypocrite.libtech_425_footnoteWe may fail to restrain the mind, but let us not be hypocrites. If we fail, let us own up, rather than be guilty of the double sin of untruth and want of restraint. For not only telling lies is untruth, but guilty silence or hiding one’s state of mind from one’s guardians is also untruth. Let my fast spur you on to further self- purification and self introspection.
 We have also to remember that one of the objects of the Ashram is the abolition of untouchability, it is one of our eleven vowslibtech_426_footnotelibtech_427_footnote. Now an effective observance of that vow is impossible without  an observance of the other vows, especially of truth and non–violence. In fact, no worker in the cause of removal of untouchability—and we are all workers in the cause—is fitted for it, unless and until he is pledged to observe truth and non-violence in thought, word and deed. In a word, no service is possible without self-purification. If, therefore, we think more and more of self-purification as a result of this fast, we should be able to bring about the proper atmosphere. I shall be constantly thinking of you this whole week and I want you to co- operate with me. I am hoping that God will pull me through this ordeal, and I know that all of you will help me with your prayers.

  LETTER TO JAWAHARLAL NEHRU 
 August 14, 1934
 MY DEAR JAWAHARLAL,
 Though you are now under distressing circumstances, your releaselibtech_433_footnotelibtech_434_footnotetakes a great load off my mind, as it is three-fourths medicine for Kamala. I have missed you greatly during all the momentous steps I have taken. But of these when we meet.
 I am well, though the last day proved the most trying of all the days and washed me out thoroughly. But I have no doubt that I shall pick up quickly.
 This is however to suggest to you that you should not make any public political pronouncement. I have felt that in cases of domestic illness or sorrow the Government has acted in a becoming manner. I do feel therefore that we ought to recognize this fact by not using the liberty thus obtained for any other purpose not inconsistent with that of the Government. I feel that this is due to them and to ourselves, especially when civil resistance is suspended. If my argument appeals to your reason, you will announce your self-restraint in a fitting manner. When Kamala is better I expect you to come here. I shall be in Wardha up to the end of the month, except that I might have to go  to Bombay to attend the delicate operation that Jamnalalji might have
 
 to go through during the month.
 I hope Mama is doing well and so Krishna. You will let me know how you have fared this time in jail.
Love.

  LETTER TO HIRALAL SHARMA 
 Unrevised	August 14, 1934
 CHI. SHARMA,
 I am sorry for the mistake I made in addressing the letter.libtech_435_footnoteIt should not have occurred. Send me your views about Ramdas’s condition.
 Your sending the money to Amtussalaam was not right. No longer do you have any funds to make donations. Moreover Amtussalaam is in no such predicament as to warrant any help. I pointed out to her that she should not have taken money thus and she has understood. Friendship never implies that we pamper our mutual weaknesses. Its aim is to ennoble one another. I regard it as a subject of study for the nature-cure practitioner. The naturopath recognizes physical, mental and spiritual ills and treats them  mainly  by developing inner powers. He takes the help of earth, water, ether, fire and air. It should be an impossibility for him to be instrumental in spiritual degeneration. Consider the case of Amtussalaam from this viewpoint. She has a weak heart. It is a disease. She has a weakness for squandering money yet feels reluctant in accepting funds from the family. Sending her money is contributing to her downfall, while not sending it will help her progress. So a naturopath would not send money.

  DISCUSSION WITH GUJARAT VIDYAPITH TEACHERS libtech_436_footnote 
 [AfterAugust 14, 1934]libtech_437_footnoteThe real work of the Vidyapith lies in the villages. I have been stressing this point ever since the inception of the Vidyapith, but until
a couple of years ago, when it was declared an illegal organization and
 most of our professors and boys were imprisoned, we laboured under the impression that the work could be carried on only through a central institute situated in the capital town of Gujarat. But under the altered conditions, and now that we have some breathing time to put our heads together and to collect our thoughts we shall do well to hark back to the original conception and think of our future work in its terms. Each member of a live institution must be a living embodiment of the ideals of the institution, wherever he may be, and when such a state of things is brought about, it is the same thing whether the institution has a habitation and a corporate existence or not.
 I would, therefore, expect every one of you who has cherished the ideals of the Vidyapith and who is pledged to serve it to  go straight to the villages and start living those ideals there. Each one of you will thus be a peripatetic Vidyapith, teaching the ideals by means of his own personal example. It is quite conceivable that a host of workers, after having lived the life in the villages according to the ideals of the Vidyapith, re-establish the central institute in a village. But we are not in that position today. We have yet to gain all that experience on which alone you can build the new Vidyapith.
 The centre of this village worker’s life will be the spinning- wheel. I am sorry I have not been able yet to bring home to anyone the message of the spinning-wheel in all its implications. The reason is that my life itself is not a true echo of the message. But it came home to me again and again during my nine months’ peregrinations in India. We have not yet sufficiently realized that hand-spinning is a supplementary industry of universal application and scope in India. The village weaver cannot live but for the spinning-wheel. He gets his yarn no doubt from the mills, but he is doomed to destruction, if he is
 
 to remain for ever dependent on the mills. Today, the spinning–wheel has established itself in our economic life only to the extent that it is needed to minister to the clothing needs of the new class of khadi weavers that has sprung up during the past decade. But a large body like the Spinners’ Association cannot justify its existence to fulfil that limited object. The idea at the back of khadi is that it is an industry supplementary to agriculture and co–extensive with it, that it is the life–breath of millions of Harijan weavers who derive their sustenance from it. The spinning-wheel cannot be said to have been established in its own proper place in our life, until we can banish idleness from our villages and make every villge home a busy hive. Unemployment and idleness of millions must lead to bloody strife. Khadi is the only alternative to this and not the so–called socialism, which presupposes industrialism. The socialism that India can assimilate is the socialism of the spinning–wheel. Let the village worker, therefore, make the wheel the central point of his activities.
 The worker will not be spinning regularly but will be working for his bread with the adze or the spade or the last, as the case may be. All his hours minus the eight hours of sleep and rest will be fully occupied with some work. He will have no time to waste. He will allow himself no laziness and allow others none. His life will be a constant lesson to his neighbours in ceaseless and joy–giving industry. Bodily sustenance should come from body labour, and intellectual labour is necessary for the culture of the mind. Division of labour there will necessarily be, but it will be a division into various species of body labour and not a division into intellectual labour to be confined to one class and body  labour to be confined to another class. Our compulsory or voluntary idleness has to go. If it does not go, no panacea will be of any avail, and semi–starvation will remain the eternal problem that it is. He who eats two grains must produce four. Unless the law is accepted as universal, no amount of reduction in population would serve to solve the problem. If the law is accepted and observed, we have room enough to accommodate millions more to come.
 The village worker will thus be a living embodiment of industry. He will master all the processes of khadi, from cotton–sowing and picking to weaving, and will devote all his thought to perfecting them. If he treats it as a science, it won’t jar on him, but he will derive fresh joy from it everyday, as he realizes more and more its great possi-
 
 bilities. If he will go to the village as a teacher, he will go there no less as a learner. He will soon find that he has much to learn from the simple villagers. He will enter into every detail of village life, he will discover the village handicrafts and investigate the possibilities of their growth and their improvement. He may find the villagers completely apathetic to the message of khadi, but he will, by his life of service compel interest and attention. Of course, he will not forget his limitations and will not engage in, for him, the futile task of solving the problem of agricultural indebtedness.
 Sanitation and hygiene will engage a good part of his attention. His home and his surroundings will not only be a model  of cleanliness, but he will help to promote sanitation in the whole village by taking the broom and the basket round.
 He will not attempt to set up a village dispensary or to become the village doctor. These are traps which must be avoided. I happened during my Harijan tour to come across a village where one of our workers who should have known better had build a pretentious building in which he had housed a dispensary and was distributing free medicine to the villages around. In fact, the medicines were being taken from home to home by volunteers and the dispensary was described as boasting a register of 1,200 patients a month! I had naturally to criticize this severely. That was not the way to do village work, I told him. His duty was to inculcate lessons of hygiene and sanitation in the village folk and thus to show them the way of preventing illness, rather than attempt to cure them. I asked him to leave the palace-like building and to hire it out to the Local Board and to settle in thatched huts. All that one need stock in the way of drugs is quinine, castor oil and iodine and the like. The worker should concentrate more on helping people realize the value of personal and village cleanliness and maintaining it at all cost.
 Then he will interest himself in the welfare of the village Harijans. His home will be open to them In fact, they will turn to him naturally for help in their troubles and difficulties. If the village folk will not suffer him to have the Harijan friends in his house situated in their midst, he must take up his residence in the Harijan quarters.
 A word about the knowledge of the alphabet. It has its place, but I should warn you against a misplaced emphasis on it. Do not proceed on the assumption that you cannot proceed with rural instruction without first teaching the children or adults how to read and write.
 Lots of useful information on current affairs, history, geography and elementary arithmetic, can be given by word of mouth before the alphabet is touched. The eyes, the ears and the tongue come before the hand. Reading comes before writing and drawing before tracing the letters of the alphabet. If this natural method is followed, the understanding of the children will have a much better opportunity of development than when it is under check by beginning the children’s training with the alphabet.
 The worker’s life will be in tune with the village life. He will not pose as a litterateur buried in his books, loath to listen to details of humdrum life. On the contrary, the people, whenever they see him, will find him busy with his tools—spinning-wheel, loom, adze, spade, etc.—and always responsive to their meanest inquiries. He will always insist on working for his bread. God has given to everyone the capacity of producing more than his daily needs and, if he will only use his resourcefulness, he will not be in want of an occupation suited to his capacities, however poor they may be. It is more likely than not that the people will gladly maintain him, but it is not improbable that in some places he may be given a cold shoulder. He will still plod on. It is likely that in some villages he may be boycotted for his pro- Harijan pro-clivities. Let him in that case approach the Harijans and look to them to provide him with food. The labourer is always worthy of his hire and, if he conscientiously serves them, let him not hesitate to accept his food from the Harijans always, provided that he gives more than he takes. In the very early stages, of course, he will draw his meagre allowance from a central fund where such is possible.
 I have deliberately left out the question of the cow. The village worker will find it difficult to tackle the question and will not attempt it, except to the extent of educating the people in the theory of it. We have not yet hit upon the best way of curing dead cattle’s hide and dyeing it, as also the best means of protecting the cow. In Gujarat the buffalo problem complicates the situation. We have got to  make people realize that to encourage the buffalo is to allow the cow to die. But more of this some other time.
 Remember that our weapons are spiritual. It is a force that works irresistibly, if imperceptibly. Its progress is geometrical rather than arithmetical. It never ceases so long as there is a propeller behind. The background of all your activities has, therefore, to be spiritual. Hence the necessity for the stricktest purity of conduct and character.
 
 You will not tell me that this is an impossible programme, that you have not the qualifications for it. That you have not fulfilled it so far should be no impediment in your way. If it appeals to your reason and your heart, you must not hesitate. Do not fight shy of the experiment. The experiment will itself provide the momentum for more and more effort.

  	“GOD BE PRAISED” 
 [August 15, 1934]libtech_438_footnote
 Happily nobody questioned the propriety of the fast just finished. On the contrary, those who have written about it have recognized the necessity of it. Its spiritual value for me has been inestimable. Why, I do not know, but it is a fact that man clings most to God when he is in distress, even as a child clings to its mother when it is in suffering. Though I was cheerful, I had my due share of physical suffering attendant upon all fasts except when required by ill-health.
 I was able during the seven days to understand more fully than hitherto the implications of what I had meant when from a hundred platforms I had declared that untouchability was not to be removed without the workers showing in their lives great purity of character. Therefore, so far as the fast was directed towards myself, it has, I hope, served its purpose. That I may fail to come up to the standard I visualized during the fast is possible, nay, probable. But no fast has ever proved an insurance against human frailties. We can only mount to success through failures.
 The fast was primarily and nominally intended as a penance for the hurt caused to Swami Lalnath and his friends at Ajmer at the hands of sympathizers with the movement. But in reality, it is a call to all the workers and sympathizers to be most exact and correct in approaching opponents. Utmost consideration and courtesy shown to them is the best propaganda for the movement. The fast was taken to impress upon the workers the truth that we can only win over the opponent by love, never by hate. Hate is the subtlest form of violence. We cannot be really non-violent and yet have hate in us. The dullest brain cannot fail to perceive that it is impossible by violence to wean
 millions of caste Hindus from the evil of untouchability, which they have hitherto been taught to regard as an article of faith.
 Evidence so far received shows that the fast has operated to quicken the conscience of many workers. Time alone can show the extent of its influence. It is not for me to measure the influence of the fast. It was for me humbly to perform what was a clear duty. God be praised that He permitted me safely to go through the fast. Let the reader join me in the prayer that He may give me greater purity and strength of purpose of fulfil the mission He has entrusted me with.

 CHI. MIRA,
 I wrotelibtech_441_footnoteto you on Tuesday, 7th,   after  commencing  the  fast. Today is Thursday, the third day of the breaking of the fast. The last day was one of physical torture. It was well perhaps it was so. What was the penance worth, if it did not cause me any physical suffering? The phrase joy of suffering has no meaning if there is no suffering felt. I knew on Monday more fully than before the meaning of the phrase joy of suffering. I am the richer for the treasure which I would not have missed for a kingdom.
 There it was. As I am writing this I feel the strength slowly coming. I have settled down to this after having walked a few, paces on the terrace with Vasumati’s help. She and Amtul Salaam and  Amala have been with me all the time. Prabhavati is of course there. She has slaved during these day. I cannot understand where she gets all the strength from. She seems never tired. Amala is as mad as ever. But she is better with me than elsewhere.
 Don’t be sorry or angry that I have not yet written to Mr. Maxwell about the prisoners. The thing has never been out of my mind but want of time has prevented me from doing it.
 You remember the green canvas bag which contained my dictionary, Gita, Bhajanavali  and such other things. That and the green khadi bag I can’t trace anywhere. I thought that you had put them together with the other things in Wardha. The bundle of khadi too which you put at Lady Thakersey’s is missing.
 
 It is strange you have not been keeping quite fit there. I do hope you are not denying yourself the fresh fruit and salad which are necessary there to keep oneself in a fit condition for strenuous work.
 Your   account   of   your   visit   to   your   Oxford    cousinlibtech_442_footnoteis entertaining. Somehow or other the oval Italian facelibtech_443_footnoteis very attractive to me. Your beautiful description of the baby therefore does not surprise me.

 CHI. BRIJKRISHNA,
 Your letter. I am doing well. The rest you must have seen from the newspapers. Jamnalalji has undergone in Bombay today a successful operation of the ear.
 Without your consent I will not write anything to Keshu and others about Damodardas. His argument is without substance. I find in it neither the dharma of friendship nor any other. My distrust of Damodardas as also of Keshu and others is increasing. That is why unless I am fully confident of the truth I cannot remain perfectly neutral and that undermines my capacity for serving Keshu’s people. It is a matter of regret that Damodardas fails to understand this clear- cut dharma. But whether he does or not, you at any rate ought to understand it clearly. You have one more duty. It is not possible for you to hide anything in this world from me. Therefore those who discuss things with you should know that ultimately it will all reach me. How to use that knowledge depends on me. If this is clear you should let me have your opinion. You may acquaint Damodardas with this letter. What more shall I say? I can give you this assurance that I will not write anything to Keshu and others without your consent.

 H. Cole, which Gandhiji said he had been reading during his fast and he had not yet finished. When asked about his future programme, Gandhiji continued in a low voice:
I have no plans ready. My immediate concern is to pick up
strength.
 He added he was making satisfactory progress and for the first time after eight days he had been at his charkha yesterday for about half an hour. He also wrote an articlelibtech_446_footnoteyesterday for this week’s Harijan and did some walking too. He hoped to
 
 regain his energy and strength soon. He said he would continue to stay in Wardha during convalescence unless some pressing engagement took him out of it.
 If you ask me whether I thought anything about the Congress during the seven days, I can say as I have stated in the columns of Harijan That I constantly thought of Congressmen. I was not thinking in terms of politics and therefore not of what the Congress had to gain in the wake of independence, but I was concentrating on the great necessity of achieving internal purity.
 Letters have been coming to me from Congressmen confirming my fears about corrupt methods that have crept into the Congress ranks over Congress elections and the like. How I wished, during all the seven days that I was lying on my bed, that every man and woman belonging to the Congress would realize that he or she was in it, not in order to mount to office and fame, but to render mute service to the country ! I cannot understand the mutual mudslinging and violence of speech toward one another.
 Civil disobedience is certainly not for those who have not learnt the art of voluntary obedience to law, even when it is irksome. This elementary principle seems to have been altogether forgotten, or else one could not witness spirit of indiscipline and disobedience to laws and rules which we have ourselves enacted and to which we have voluntarily pledged ourselves to render obedience.
 For me, therefore, every other thing has paled into insignif- icance before this prime necessity of achieving internal purity, for I do feel that just as without the purity of Harijan workers untouch- ability would not be removed so also do I feel that the Congress, as a powerful national organization, will perish unless it is sustained by internal purity of those who compose that organization. At present, I have no other message to give, for my mind is still preoccupied with this predominant feeling.

 Sitaramayya explains that the compromise was not accepted by M. S. Aney and M.
 M. Malaviya. Consequently they resigned from the Congress parliamentary Board and summoned a conference of Congressmen and others at Calcutta on August 18 and
 19 under the presidentship of Malaviya, which announced the formation of  Nationalist Party with the object of carrying on agitation in the Legislatures and outside against the Communal Award and the White Paper, and to put up candidates for the Legislative Assembly to promote that object.
  LETTER TO JAWAHARLAL NEHRU 
 Unrevised	August 17, 1934
 MY DEAR JAWAHARLAL,
 Your passionate and touching letterlibtech_451_footnotedeserves  a  much  longer reply than my strength will permit.
 I had expected fuller grace from the  Government.  However your presence has done for Kamala and incidentally for Mama what no drugs or doctors could have done. I hope that you will be allowed to remain longer than the very few days you expect.
 I understand your deep sorrow. You are quite right in giving full and free expression to your feelings. But I am quite sure that from our common standpoint a closer study of the written word will show you that there is not enough reason for all the grief and disappointment you have felt. Let me assure you that you have not lost a comrade in me. I am the same as you knew me in 1917 and after. I have the same passion that you knew me to possess for the common goal. I want complete independence for the country in the full English sense of the term. And every resolution that has pained you had been framed with that end in view. I must take full responsibility for the resolutions and the whole  conception surrounding them.
 But I fancy that I have the knack for knowing the need of the time. And the resolutions are a response thereto. Of course here  comes in the difference of our emphasis on the method or the means which to me are just as important as the goal and in a sense more important in that we have some control over them whereas we have none over the goal if we lose control over the means.
 Do read the resolution about ‘loose talk’ dispassionately. There is not a word in it about socialism. Greatest consideration has been paid to the socialists some of whom I know so intimately. Do I not know their sacrifice? But I have found them as a body to be in a hurry. Why should they not be? Only, if I cannot march quite as quick, I must ask them to halt and take me along with them. That is literally my attitude. I have looked up the dictionary meaning of socialism. It takes me no further than where I was before I read the definition. What will you have me to read to know its full content? I
 
 have read one of the books Masanilibtech_452_footnotegave me and now I am devoting all my spare time to reading the book recommended by Narendra Deva.
 You are hard on the members of the Working Committee. They are our colleagues such as they are. After all we are a free institution. They must be displaced, if they do not deserve confidence. But it is wrong to blame them for their inability to undergo the sufferings that some others have gone through.
 After the explosion I want construction. Therefore now, lest we do not meet, tell me exactly what you will have me to do and who you think will best represent your views.
 As to the trustlibtech_453_footnote, I was not present. Vallabhbhai was. Your attitude betrays anger. You should trust the trustees to do their duty. I did not think there was anything wrong. I was too preoccupied to concentrate on it. I shall now study the papers and everything. Of course your feelings will be fully respected by other trustees. Having given you this assurance, I would ask you not to take this matter so personally as you have done. It more becomes you generous nature to give the same credit to your co-trustees for regard for Father’s memory that you would take for yourself. Let the nation be the custodian of
Father’s memory and you only as one of the nation.
 I hope Indu is well and likes her new life. And what about Krishna?
Love.

  	I hope this will be in your hands in due time. If you have to go 	away without our meeting, I shall be very sorry indeed. During 	convalescence after the recent fast medical friends would not hear 	of my leaving Wardha quite so soon, and I do not feel like 	overriding their advice. If, therefore, we do not meet, you will 	please put down on paper as much as you can of what you intended to 	say to me. I know what a poor substitute it would be for a 	heart-to-heart conversation. But a letter from you will have its own 	value for me.

  LETTER TO BHASKAR MUKHERJI 
 August 18, 1934
 MY DEAR BHASKAR,
 I have read your letter to Mahadev of the 15th instant. I cannot help thinking that you have closed down the  scavengers’  schools much too hastily. The Section 91 that you quote, I certainly do not read in the manner you do. It does not prohibit the Corporation from using even a part of the lakh of rupees for education among scavenger boys and girls. On the contrary, I should read the Section to compel the Corporation to use a part of the funds amongst the scavengers. The Section to be of any use can only mean that the Corporation will begin by spending the money among the poorest, and surely not among the fashionable suburbs of Calcutta for instance. Has the Corporation taken legal opinion  on  the interpretation of the Section in question? If, therefore, there is any chance of the Corporation retracing its steps in the matter, I ask for its reconsideration.
 With reference to the penultimate paragraph of your letter I would like you to tell me in detail what work the Corporation has done, and is doing, for Harijans and what sum is spent during the past twelve months in their behalf.
That I am dictating this letter shows that I am gaining strength.
 Jawaharlal’s release has brought relief to poor Kamala and relieved Jawaharlal’s many friends of a great burden of anxiety over Kamala’s ill-health.
 My love to baby and children. I hope you are doing well in every respect.

  LETTER TO CALCUTTA CONGRESSMEN 
 August 19, 1934 I am afraid that your optimism is ill-grounded, for I have seen nothing  as  yet   to   shake  my  confidence  in   the   correctness  of the
Working   Committee’s  resolution.  The   utmost  limit   within   which
 accommodation was possible was prescribed in Benares. There it stands. Nobody approves of the Award—much less has anybody acquiesced in it. Everybody condemns it. But a Congressman, because he is a Congressman, can neither accept it nor reject it because if he did one or the other he would be taking sides and therefore not represent the whole nation. I can easily respond to your optimism but if it is based on the belief that I shall any way influence the Working Committee to reconsider the resolution, I am afraid that your optimism is ill-grounded.

  LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI 
 August 19, 1934
 CHI. NARANDAS,
 I got your letter. I understand what you say regarding Siddhimati. She shouldn’t have left like that. I am of the opinion that she should not be re-admitted all too easily.
 Has Jamnadas gone out in search of a job? I tried to persuade him to stay with me, but he did not. His anger does not seem to have subsided yet. Didn’t he and others read the circular letters which I wrote to you ?
 I am glad that Lilavati is doing well. If Kusum is getting fever, wouldn’t it be advisable for her to go to Ranavav? She always gets better there. Chimanlal’s case also is pitiable. His health doesn’t improve at all. Do not put too much trust in Amala’s letter. She is very cheerful here. She is even improving a little. So long as I live here, it will not be advisable to shift her from here. Even when I leave this place permanently, I will burden you with the responsibility for her only if I think that she can safely go there. I am sure that, if she is likely to improve under anybody, she would do so under you.
 If Keshu succeeds in his experiment regarding the spinning- wheel, it will be a great achievement. He should continue the experi- ments. The time-limit cannot be extended now, but, if he succeeds in
 
 inventing a spinning-wheel which would have deserved the prize, everybody will welcome it. He should not, therefore, worry. We have not so far received any model which would deserve a prize.
 I have still not been able to decide anything about the dairy. I wish to discuss the matter also with Jamnalalji who is in hospital. I gathered your viewpoint to be that it should be run as an independent activity and should not be handed over to the Harijan Ashram. Is this impression of mine correct ?
 Has there been any change in Harilal’s mod of life? Does he exercise self-control there or does he continue to live in the same manner?
 It is exessively humid here. The rainfall has been quite heavy. If possible, I don’t wish to shift you from there for the Kanya Ashram. You have been doing excellent work there. It is desirable that you should put everything in perfect order. In case of absolute necessity here, you will of course be available. Vinoba has agreed to take up complete responsibility. I see that I shall have to call you here once before I decide anything. I hope I shall be able to give you fairly long notice.
 I am regaining strength fairly well. Even if the progress is rather slow, I am satisfied.
 Narahari, Kishorelal, Maganbhai, Soman and Kakasaheb are here at present. I have been discussinglibtech_458_footnotewith them plans for proper organization of villages.
 I hope you read the Harijan carefully. I suppose you know that Krishnamachari and Sulochana are here. Amtussalaam and Vasumati are with me, and of course Prabha. Ramdas may come back in three or four days. There is an epidemic of cholera in Khurja.

Andrews is coming on the 25th. I think it will be 	good if you are here then. I do get here as much rest as I need. 	Nobody bothers me. The chowkidars also follow Jamnalalji’s 	instructions to the letter. I am sure that you, too, will get more 	peace here than you do there. But you can think of that only after 	you have completely recovered from fever and regained peace of mind. 	If you come, Mani will definitely benefit at any rate.  	I understand that nothing can be done about your nose trouble just 	now. If anything can be done by staying on there for some time, I 	think it will be worth while to do so. Let us see if it helps. There 	will be no risk at all in getting it done just now. The only thing 	is that you will have to keep to the bed for some time. That need 	not matter.  	I had a long letter from Jayaprakash yesterday. He is very unhappy. 	He has read much but does not seem to have digested all that he has 	read. And he certainly has no experience. But he can pour out in 	speeches what he has read. That impresses educated people, which 	fact increases his enthusiaasm and he leaves home and family, 	neglects his health and does about rousing people. He has, however,    
 said in his letter that he will come and see me. Let us see  what  happens.
There is no possibility of my leaving the Congress immediately.
But I share my agony with you.
 How can I leave the Congress till you and others permit me to do so. Personally, however, I do feel that there is no other way for me.   I seem to be obstructing the growth of the Congress. To cling to the means without faith in it or to fail to act according to one’s faith— what a pitiable and frightful conditon to be in ! Is it not your duty to save the Congress from it? There may be no harm [in my remaining in the Congress] so long as I can think of some means of fighting the rot, but what can I do if I cannot think of any way except leaving the Congress? My doing so will rid it of hypocrisy. If the attitude of the ordinary Congressman is that no distinction need be made between truth and falsehood, violence and non-violence, khadi, calico, jagannathi libtech_461_footnoteand muslin, then it is best that he should act accordingly. But that won’t be possible till I leave. These restrictions cannot be removed with my consent, for I would never consent to their removal. If the Congress removes them despite my opposition, would not that amount to expelling me? Would it be desirable to let things go that far? I want to make you, Raja and others think about all these points. If you can come over, we shall discuss them at leisure.
 We shall also have to think what I should do in September or after I have regained strength. It is an issue to which we must give thought. The time is drawing near for taking a decision. Jawaharlal’s explosion is not as frightening as it seems from the flames. he had a right to let off steam, which he has exercised.libtech_462_footnoteI think he has calmed down now.
 About the unfortunate cultivators of Gujarat, I will do what you want, but I have definite views of my own in the matter.
 What you desired regarding the Parliamentary Board has happened, though the reason for postponment was quite different.
I have written enough, I think, for today.

  	After Vinoba had left yesterday, I received a reassuring wire from 	Dr. Jivraj, from which I learnt that there was no recurence of 	bleeding and that the pain also had subsided. Even then I think it 	is good that Vinoba has gone there for a short visit. You must have 	learnt that Kamalnayan himself was the cause of Vinoba’s going  	there. He was very much disturbed by what you had to endure on 	Saturday and, therefore, immediately on arrival here, he sent me a      
 message through Mahadev. I welcomed the suggestion and sent a message to Vinoba who immediately got ready to go. Madalasa also wanted to go but, being obedient, she stayed back on learning that Vinoba wished to go. She will be duly rewarded for her self-control. It is good that she has stayed back. If your pain has subsided now and your mind is at peace, give leave to Vinoba to return soon. But he can stay as long as he is needed. The management of this place is being organized carefully. Vinoba is busy with the task day and night.
 Your promise regarding facilities for education will certainly be kept. I write this to reassure you. Do not try to discuss this matter with Vinoba and exert yourself. Just now your chief aim should be to get all right. You need not worry about anything here or elsewhere. And certainly not about me, for my affairs are going on well enough. Radhakisan and Shivaji keep a strict watch over me. I hope you do not talk much. It will be advisable to use with caution any freedom that the doctors may permit. One should follow their advice as long as it is not against dharma. But it is a different matter when they permit any freedom to satisfy us."

 Your letter is revealing. But I do not want to change my course of action. The cause will be compromised by no one except ourselves. Let them all do their little bit or their utmost there. It is enough for us that they are all well meaning. As you know, I have not set much store by the work that is being done there. Though I do not want to take any action on the strength of what you say, I would like you to have a frank and full discussion with both Agatha and Muriel and hear what they might have to say. So far as the big folk are concerned, I entirely agree with you that you shoudd seek interviews yourself directly. I an quite sure that they will all see you. If they do not, you need not mind.
 The question of Dara is different and difficult. One does not know how to help. He has always appeared to me to be mysterious. Brockwaylibtech_466_footnoteis supposed to be the leader. But he did not seem to me to lead. He was apologetic about Dara and in no way enthusiastic. I am afraid we can do very little for him. Of course there is no difficulty about carrying on correspondence with him. We do no more for the friedns or the fellowship group. We pay nothing. Agatha is paid and that is all. It is well to follow Shakespeare’s adivce: “Give thy ear to everyone, thy voice to none.” You will gather all the information and we shall confer when we meet, if we do at all. ‘If’ clause is merely precautionary. Nothing hangs by it. I have no present plans except the convalescence. Andrews reaches Bombay on 25th. He should be with
 
 me on 26th.
 The news about Jawaharlalji and the others you will get from Mahadev and Pyarelal whoever may be writing.
 Today is exactly one week after the breaking of the fast. Love.

  	I am glad that your venture is making steady progress. Don’t be in 	a hurry, but build on a solid foundation.  	If the boy in question was merely a nominal convert and knew nothing 	of Christianity or of any religion in fact, in my opinion he never 	ceased to belong to the relegion of his birth. And then there is no 	question of reconversion. If, however, he was a bona-fide 	convert it is none of your business to reconvert him. His 	faith must be personal to him and he has to be answerable to God for 	what he actually is. I hope this is quite clear.  	There can be no objection to your admitting Christian boys, but they 	cannot be a charge on the ordinary Harijan Funds. You have to 	procure scholarships for them from personal friends, if the students 	are otherwise deserving. It would be a pity if they had to be turned 	out for want of funds. And yet it would be wrong to disburse their  	expenses out of the Harijan Funds which are intended solely for 	Hindus.

 August 21, 1934
  	I got your letter. Your generosity of heart knows no bounds. You 	would not mind if I don’t write. But I don’t wish just now to 	take advantage of your generosity. All the same, you deserve 	compliments for it. I am glad that you went and saw Jamnalalji and 	also that you prayed with him. It was very good of him indeed to 	offer on his own to meet your expenses. May your future be as good 	as your beginning is. There can be no end, of course.  	In sayinglibtech_468_footnotethat 	we are born every day I didn’t wish to show up your childishness. 	I had no such thought even in my dreams. On the contrary, I tried to 	express my appreciation of your having asked for my blessings. You 	may, therefore, continue to ask for my blessings for your birthday.  	I feel no pain at all if somebody slanders the Ashram. But I do feel 	pain if anybody doubts the reason which I  have  given  for offering 	it as sacrifice. How could I offer as sacrifice something which  I 	did not regard as pure? I hope you have explained this properly. But 	it is our duty to bear everything serenely.  	I am very glad that you met Father and that his anger has left him. 	I have no doubt that this understanding between you two will endure. Things 	are going on all right with me. I am regaining strength. Write 	to me from time to time.  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	a photostat of the Gujarati: G. N. 10358. Also C.W. 6797. Courtesy: 	Premabehn Kantak

  	I did get your letter. I have been trying to give effect to one of 	your suggestions—about bringing Kumarappa into this. I am afraid 	it will be difficult for me to write for Swadeshi. 	 I cannot ride two horses at the same time. You must have 	read about my decision to widen the scope of Harijan. Whatever 	ideas occur to me will, therefore, go into it. Since my store is 	limited, I cannot write the same thing in several journals. For the 	present, therefore, please be satisfied with what I write in 	Harijan. However, 	continue to send me copies of Swadeshi. 	Has the new policy been fully accepted there? Lallukaka 	said that there was no change. Have you fully grasped the new form? 	Do you feel interested in it? Can you understand it?  	Is Jagadish fully ready now? Are both of you fully restored?  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	Gujarati: C.W. 7551.

  	My health is improving so well that my capacity for work is 	increasing every day. I had glanced through the note you gave to 	Shankerlal. It need not be used publicly just now. I liked your 	suggestion regarding the Congress elections. But it  is  incomplete. 	Draft whatever improved rules seem necessary to you. Draft the by- 	rules also. For giving effect to some of the suggestions, it will be 	necessary to amend the Constitution. Don’t hesitate to suggest 	such changes too. You will have to find time for this. Do so if you 	can.  	If you send me cuttings of what you have been writing in newspapers, 	I will try to find time and read them. No hour has been fixed when 	even Mahadev or Pyarelal can give me their substance after reading 	them. Everybody is so busy with his own work that he can get no free 	time. And even if one of them can do so, he will not find me free.  	The work of the Bombay Congress is certainly difficult. The picture 	you have drawn is quite correct. It is not an easy job in such 	circumstances to work so as to enhance the prestige of the Congress. 	Do the best that you can.  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	Gujarati: C.W. 7552. Courtesy: K. M.

  LETTER TO VALLABHBHAI PATEL 
 August 21, 1934
 BHAI VALLABHBHAI,
 I got your letter. I understand the need for you to remain there. You alone can judge which need is more important. Whether here or there, we have to do the same sort of work. We should stay where the need is greater. You may, therefore, do what you think proper. About the Congress work in Bombay, my view is that those who have undertaken the responsibility should do the job in their own way or give up control of the organization. How long will they be able to hide the truth ?
 The problem of purifying the Congress is a big one. We can discuss it in detail only when we meet. I agree with what you write about. . . libtech_472_footnotelibtech_473_footnote. The Congress must decide its policy. Let us send for . . .libtech_474_footnoteand discuss the matter with him and have done with the problem. I had a letter from . . .libtech_475_footnotelibtech_476_footnote, to which I have replied saying that he may come in the first week of September and may fix the date through you. If it is impossible for you to come then, I will argue out the matter with them. I will not give anything in writing without showing it to you.
 I fully understand your impatience regarding Gujarat. Do what you think best. We must have our eyes on the future.
 When Andrews comes there, have a frank and full discussion with him about everything. I will write to you or ask somebody to write to you about what happens here.
 
 Mahadev is going to Prayag today. He will return before Saturday.
Please don’t overwork and fall ill again."

  LETTER TO AGATHA HARRISON 
 August 22, 1934
 MY DEAR AGATHA,
 This is merely to tell you that I am slowly rebuilding the body. The seven days’ rest was good at the price of seven or eight pounds of flesh. I knew your anxiety which you showed in your letter and cable.  I could not avoid the fast. Friends have to put up with that part of me. For this last may not be the last of my fasts. I can survive discredit by the world and not by myself.
 Of the current events you will know from Mahadev and Pyarelal and the cuttings that Chandrashankar may be sending you. These letter(s) are not, I think, duplicated to Mira. Whatever you may consider necessary, you will pass on to Mira. She seems to be going about in a business-like manner. Anyway you must give your own impressions.
 Poor Kamlani!libtech_484_footnoteI expect to have full accounts from   you  and Polak.
 C.F. Andrews reaches Bombay on 25th. He may be here on 26th. Till then do not be anxious about the future. I have no cut and dried plan. Of course Bengal and the Frontier with Abdul Ghaffar Khan as the centre-piece are there. But I see no clear line of action. I want to precipitate nothing. But things may become impossible for me any moment. I must have room to move. The Black Hole  will suffocate anybody—much more me, an open-air creature. A most unnatural condition is becoming naturalized in this unhappy land. This is written to give you my mental condition, not to expect more from you than you are doing. What can you the handful do, if we here can do nothing? And I admit that we are doing nothing or not enough. It is in this atmosphere that I have to act when this convalescence in finished. You must not be alarmed. What I have described is nothing new. You know these things. I have put them here in order to show that the things are about the same as when you left India. Not even all the ordinary civil disobedience prisoners have been discharged. And extraordinary treatment is being meted out to Jawaharlal. He may be pounced upon any day. They have put him out. Without seeming indecent he can’t find himself in prison and they tell him he may be taken away any moment. This gives no
 
 chance to poor Kamala for whose sake Jawaharlal is discharged. This is cruelty double distilled. And in spite of their declarations, many prisoners are still being detained without the slightest cause. Attachments of land still going on for fines ! My ahimsa is on its mettle. But I do not want to act. I am passive till God wants me to act; not my will but His shall be done.
 You should share this with Mira and Muriel without fail. Of course Polak and any other you like.
 Love to you and your sister to whom I was unable to wrtie when her little note was received.

  	I have your letter. You are quite right in saying that I have not 	been able to discover any royal road to physical brahmacharya. 	All that I can say is that you have to persevere along the lines 	suggested by me. Pure food, fresh air and moderate amount of 	exercise are to yield the desired result. Pranayama and some 	asanas have been reported also to produce good results. 	Hipbaths are also valuable. Mustard oil is a condiment which should 	be eschewed. In fact, I would advise you to eschew all oils. 	Vegetables should be boiled. Starchy vegetables should be avoided, 	and so should be pulses. You need not worry about milk. Honey is no 	substitute for milk. You should take a fair quantity everyday. And 	above all you should persevere in praying and have faith that your 	prayer will be answered.

 Here is a problem for you to solve. Kaka wishes to go and work in the South. This has no connection with his resignation as trustee.libtech_489_footnoteI have been telling the teacherslibtech_490_footnotewho have  assembled  here  that  they should go and live in villages and, through constructive work, do what they can to organize village life and educate the people.

We of course wish to utilize the Vidyapith buildings for meeting the needs of the city. libtech_491_footnote
 Mahadev left yesterday evening. He will reach Prayag tonight. Mathuradas will certainly go to receive Andrews on Saturday.
Send some others, too, who can go. If possible, put him up with you
and, if he wishes, let him leave for Wardha on the same day.
I got your letter after I had written the above.
 It was good that you could meet. . . libtech_492_footnote. Let him, the Chronicle, The Free Press, etc., agitate for the release of prisoners. We may remain silent on minor issues, but why should we do so on an important one? Dahyabhai should ask Natarajanlibtech_493_footnotealso to attend. According to a wire received from Ghanshyamdas, he intends to leave on Monday for Wardha.
 I believe Andrews will stay for three or four days at least. But it is also likely that he might want to leave immediately for Santiniketan. You may yourself ascertain his intention.
I cannot write more today.

  LETTER TO BRIJKRISHNA CHANDIWALA 
 Unrevised	August 22, 1934
 CHI. BRIJKRISHNA,
 I have your letter. You may certainly summon Damodardas if you so wish. It is unnecessary to consult me on such matters; how can  I even object to it? I have no desire to curtail your independence in any way. But I do want your consent, if I can have it, to my making use of the remarks made by Damodardas regarding. . .libtech_494_footnotelibtech_495_footnoteand others in order that I may be able to do them justice. This matter is hurting me like poison because now I am terribly embarrassed while writing to. . . and This is probably the first occasion in my life that I heard
 something against them which affects me yet I may not let  them know. It will be enough if I am released from this restriction.
I will never involve myself in the Delhi Congress controversy.
Such matters are now beyond my strength.
Since I have your permission I am sending your letter to Sardar.
The reference to Damodardas is of course there.
 By now you must have realized the point about your writing to Prabhavati about the marriage. It was not as if this subject could not have been discussed at all but that it should never have been discussed with Prabhavati. This has never been nor can it ever  become  her sphere till she has gained some independence in such matters. A discussion about any girl of the Ashram can take place only with Jamnalalji, Vinoba or myself; and in such affairs Vinoba and I give precedence to Jamnalaji. What need was there to write to Prabhavati when the right thing was to contact Jamnalalji?
You may, by all means go to Mussoorie for your health’s sake.
We shall see afterwards.

  STATEMENT TO ASSOCIATED PRESS OF INDIA libtech_496_footnote 
 [ On or before August 23, 1934 ]libtech_497_footnoteWhat was offered was freedom of speech and vote to elect candidates who had real conscientious scruples over the acceptance of
the Working Committee’s resolution on the Communal award. This
 would not satisfy Panditji. He desired full freedom of action for all. This amounted to a nullification of the Working Committee’s resolution which the Committee could not do. It was a mistake to suppose that the Working Committee’s resolution was a virtual acceptance of the Award. The Committee neither accepted nor rejected the Award and thus proved its impartiality and national character. It was the only way to arrive at an agreed solution which was sure to come if Congressmen, Hindus, Mussalmans and others, loyally and seriously worked out the resolution.
 Mahatma Gandhi was then asked if Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya’s new organization could run the elections in the name of the Congress. He replied that the Parliamentary Board was the only authorized body which could function in the name of the Congress.

  LETTER TO ANAND T. HINGORANI 
 August 23, 1934
 MY DEAR ANAND,
 You have given me a tragic tale of your woes. That a little ringworm should develop into a frightful thing passes comprehension. Generally speaking it yields to simple treatment inside of two or three days. Have you not placed yourself under a competent doctor? And you ought not to trifle with your piles. It is a very simple operation, and if a competent surgeon advises that you should go through the operation at once you should do so without demur.
 I see that your letter is dated the 16th instant. It was received only yesterday. Evidently the letter takes a long time to reach Karachi and therefore I am sending the following telegram:
 Hope ringworm cured. Under surgical advice undergo piles operation immediately.
You can publish the message on God. If you like you can copy
 the full text from Young India. As you know, selections from Young India have been published in book form. This message is among the selections.
 I am not writing separately to Vidya, but she ought to. I hope she and Mahadev are all right.
 Unless you are in a hurry I want to delay sending funds till Jamnalalji is discharged from the hospital or till he is in a position to transact business.
Love to you both.

 MY DEAR MALKANI,
 I remember that letter which, at your instance, I sent to a Sindhi friend. When I receive the draft, I shall send the receipts as suggested by you.
 As to the Hampton Institute pamphlets, my own impression is that I passed them on to Thakkar Bapa after I had read them. But in such matters my memory is not to be relied upon at all. I know that I did not destroy them and I must have dealt with them as per your instructions. Nevertheless I have asked Devraj to make a search, and if the pamphlets are traced they will be sent to you.
 I hope that you will get a suitable plot of land for the welfare centre. Brijkrishna wrote to me about it.
I am slowly regaining lost strength.
 You remember the Agra friend who prepared a note containing hints on tanning. I returned that note for amplification. Whether I sent it to you or to Thakkar Bapa or to Ghanshyamdas I cannot quite recollect. But I would like you to make a search and see whether it was sent to the writer for amplification. If it was, I would ask you to remind him that I am still waiting for that note with the necessary amendments made.
I hope you had a good time in Sindh.

  	I have your letter. Why did you not bring the mistake to my notice 	at once? You can understand the difficulty of making refund in cases 	of this character. Surely you must  have  discovered  the mistake at 	once. I would advise you now to forget the 100-rupee note 	altogether. A big organization like Harijan Sevak Sangh cannot 	afford to rectify such mistakes. If, however, you are not satisfied 	with my advice, I would like you to refer to Jairamdas, and if 	Jairamdas thinks that this is a case in which refund should be 	granted I will advise him to write on your behalf to Thakkar Bapa. 	If you propose to approach Jairamdas, you would show this letter to 	him.  Yours 	sincerely,  SHRI 	H. A. LALVANI 	HYDERABAD  From 	a copy: Pyarelal Papers.

I got a report about you from Vinoba also and just now I 	received a wire from Dr. Shah. We can expect now that the wound will 	have completely healed in a few days. But do not build castles in 	the air. Be patient and stay there as long as necessary. There is no 	urgent problem at all which requires your immediate attention and   	nothing   to   worry   about.   Radhakisanlibtech_501_footnotelibtech_502_footnoteis  able   to   look   after everything here and 	he and many others keep guard over me.  	Can a remark be called a “joke” if you have to explain that it 	is written in “joke”? Which is better, Janakimaiya’s angry 	complaints or your suppressing your pain and building castles in the 	air? When Janakimaiya complains, we know that she suffers. But you 	keep things    
 in your own mind and so others are deceived. Tell me now, who deserves to be admired?

  LETTER TO VALLABHBHAI PATEL 
 August 23, 1934
 BHAISHRI VALLABHBHAI,
 Enclosed is a letter from Brijkrishna regarding the dissensions in Delhi. Read it and tear it up.  I have categorically statedlibtech_507_footnotein my reply that, even if they ask me, I will not intervene in this dispute. Every day  I receive nothing but such complaints. Everybody thinks only of himself and nobody thinks of the country. I don’t know how, in such circumstances, we can reach our goal.
 I have received wires from Bengal, too, against Aney. I have replied in plain words saying that nobody should doubt his impartiality and that he should be fully trusted.
 Malaviyaji has ordered The Hindustan Times to change its  policy on the question of the Award. Ghanshyamdas has resigned because of this, giving reasons in his letter of resignation which reveal his disagree-ment with Malaviyaji’s views. Let us see what happens now. I don’t know what has happened to these two.
 On receiving a wire from Rajendrababu, I have sent a statementlibtech_508_footnoteto the Associated Press. You will read it in the papers. If a copy has been preserved, they will send it to you. It would help if you also issued such statements from time to time from Bombay. I had a wire from the Maulana asking me what the formation of the Congress Nationalist Party meant. I have wired back saying that it is the President who should reply to his question, and that, though I would write about it to you, he should send a wire to you. If you receive one, give him a suitable reply.
 I received a letter from Rajaji today, which you should read. Tear it up after reading it. If you wish, write to him. If you regain sufficient strength to travel to Madras and if you can get time, you may go there. I have not seen the cutting from The Statesman. If I find it, I will send it too. Whatever it writes, how can we hide the truth? Prafulla Ghosh has arrived here. He has a painful tale to tell of the rot in Bengal.

  INTERVIEW  TO KHADI WORKERSlibtech_509_footnote 
 [On or before August 24, 1934]libtech_510_footnoteKhaddar in  a	sense is purely an economic proposition. A khaddar organization must be a  business concern before everything
else.    The   democratic   principle,    therefore,   cannot  apply   to	it.
 Democracy necess-arily means a conflict of will and ideas, involving sometimes a war to the knife between these different ideas. There can be no room for such conflict within a business organization. Imagine parties, groups and the like in a business concern. It must break to pieces under their weight. But a khadi organization is more than a business concern. It is a philanthropic institution designed to serve demos. Such an institution cannot be governed by popular fancy. There is no room in it for personal ambition.
 “In reorganizing your khadi production, you should not forget that the science of khadi, in some respects, works on diametrically opposite lines to that of ordinary business.You know  how  Adam Smith in his Wealth of Nations, after laying down certain principles according to which economic phenomena are governed, went on to describe certain other things which constituted  the  “disturbing factor” and prevented economic laws from having free play. Chief among these was the ‘human element’. Now, it is this ‘human element’ on which the entire economics of khadi rests; and human selfishness, Adam Smith’s “pure economic motive”, constitutes the “disturbing factor” that has got to be overcome. What applies to the production of mill-cltoh, therefore, does not apply to khaddar. Debasing of quality, adulteration, pandering to the baser tastes of humanity, are current staple in commercialized production; they have no place in khadi, nor has the principle of highest profit and lowest wages any place in khadi. On the contrary, there is no such thing as pure profit in khadi. And there should be no loss. Loss there is, because we, the workers, are still incompetent novices. In khadi, the prices realized return to the prime producers, the spinners, the others getting no more than their hire.
 
 Sitaramayya left Wardha for Madras on August 24, 1934.
 Then, take the question of standardization. You cannot enforce it in khaddar. As Rajagopalachari once remarked, a poor, ordinary spinner cannot always spin thread of a uniform quality. She is not a machine. Today she may be unwell, tomorrow her child may be ill and her mind will be distracted. If you have love for the poor spinner or her child, you will not insist on having smooth, even thread always, but be satisfied with what she can give, so long as she gives her best in the condition in which she finds herself at the moment. The sacred touch of her hand gives life and history to khadi which the machine- made yarn can never give. The art that is in the machine-made article appeals only to the eye, the art in khadi appeals first to the heart and then to the eye. I would, therefore, deprecate the bleaching of khadi.  It adds to the cost of production, affects the durability of cloth and makes the detection of fraud ever so much more difficult. We must not pamper the popular fancy, but seek to cultivate a new taste. A few washes in the ordinary course will suffice to make khadi perfectly white and give it a softness which bleaching destroys. We must make everybody contribute his or her mite to reduce all unnecessary cost.
 If, then, we treat khadi, not as an article of commerce, but as one necessary for the sustenance of semi-starved millions, we must penetrate the spinner’s home had induce her to wear khadi made from her own yarn. This at once reduces the cost of production and ensures automatic distribution. So far, we have simply tried to manufacture khadi for the city people. From insignificant begin- nings, the production of khaddar has grown to several lakhs per year. We have multiplied varieties. But that does not satisfy me now. Khadi was conceived with a much more ambitious object, i.e., to make our villages starvation-proof. This is impossible, unless the villagers will wear khadi themselves, sending only the surplus to the cities. The singular secret of khadi lies in its salability in the place of its production and use by the manufacturers themselves.
 Our overhead charges are today much too high for me. If we concentrate attention on the central mission of khadi, they will be consi-derably reduced. The rules governing the  reduction  of the  price of khadi are somewhat, if not wholly, different from those that apply to purely commercial articles produced chiefly for profit. In khadi, there is a limitation to the improvement of tools. But there is no limitation to the improvement fo human intelligence and honesty. If we despair of these two, we must despair of khadi. In khadi, therefore, we reduce cost by eliminating middlemen as far as is
 
 consistent with the smooth running of the organization, which itself will be unnecessary when khadi is self-supporting and self-acting.
 The science of khadi is still in its infancy. It is a developing scie-nce. With every new discovery that I make in it, the realization comes to me all the more vividly how little I know of that science. There is no other country in the world , with the possible exception of China, that is potentially so rich as India, with its inexhaustible, untapped reserves of man-power. Tap these reserves, and you at once banish poverty from this country; and hand-spinning is the means by which this could be done. All that we have done so far in khadi was necessary. Without it we could not have reached the present stage. But we have yet only touched the fringe of the problem. We heve now need to take another step. If , therefore, you will have autonomy for Andhra khadi, you can have it for the asking and without much trouble about the discharge of your obligations. There is nothing to prevent you from working along the lines suggested by me.
 Harijan, 21-9-1934
 
  NOTES 
 ITS PHYSICAL EFFECT
 A few words about the physical effect of the recent fast will not be out of place. No matter how much spiritually inclined a person may be, a physical act cannot but produce its corresponding physical effect. The latter may be regulated or reduced by the spiritual effort, but it can never be completely overcome. And as I have often fasted for health reasons, i.e., for physical effect, I have not failed to study from that standpoint all the fasts that were taken from spiritual motives. During all the four fasts undertaken for the Harijan cause, I have noticed a particular dislike for water, whether wlith or without soda or salt, and whether hot or cold. I have been able to bear, but only just bear, aerated water. This inability to drink water has been the greatest drawback in my fasts. I must mention that, being largely a fruitarian and having abstained from condiments of every description, except salt, practically for the past forty yeras, I rarely drink water even in the ordinary course. All the liquid I need comes from the fresh juicy fruit and the non-starch vegetables and honey and hot- water drinks. I have known many friends who have gone through long fasts, but I do not know anyone who had had the dislike for water
 that I had. Medical friends who have kindly helped me during my fasts have not been able to suggest anything within the permissible limits whereby they could make me drink water freely. They have suggested and adopted remedies to reduce the evil effect of inability to drink enough water. My purpose is to compare notes with those who have any knowledge of fasting and to discover a means whereby the dislike of water could be cured. Though I do not know them, surely, there must be people who develop during their fasting periods the same repugnance to water that I do. If any light can be thrown on the question, it will help many persons like me. Much as I should like to avoid having to fast, I cannot make myself believe that the recent fast was the last in my life. It is a matter beyond my control.
 THE AJMER INCIDENT
 Although Shri Ramnarayan Chaudhri and Shri Durgaprasad Chaudhri, captain of the volunteers in Ajmer, do  not  in any way wish to be absolved from any blame that may attach to them for forgetfulness or negligence in connection with the Ajmer incident, they are most anxious to have the blame removed from the volunteers who have been condemned in the Press and who they hold to be utterly blameless. They have made careful investigations and find that not a single volunteer was involved in doing injury to Swami Lalnath or his party. The investigation papers have been sent to me. The only deadly piece of evidence in favour of the theory of the gulit of the volunteers has been utterly discredited. The confessor appears to have been altogether a fictitious person, no trace can be found of him. The newspaper that published the confession has failed to produce the name of the writer, and the Editor has made such acknowledgement in his paper and expressed regret for having published an unauthentic letter. All the evidence, therefore, that I have hitherto received goes to show that no volunteer was involved in the affray. My own statement has nothing in it to warrant the inference that the volunteers had actually assaulted Swami Lalnath or any of his party. I had simply said that Swami Lalnath had said that volunteers were involved. But in this belief he was evidently mistaken. No trace was found of the volunteer described by him.Since the Ajmer volunteers have come in for a great deal of public criticism, it was necessary to give my own opinion in the matter. The fact, however, that in my opinion no volunteer seems to have committed the assault does not imply that the fast was in any way unnecessary. That the assault was committed is not
 
 to be denied, nor can it be denied that those who took part in the affray were of the reformer group. The fact also remains that Shri Ramnarayan Chaudhri forgot to give the necessary instructions and take adequate precautions against the mishap. The fast was, therefore, clearly necessary, and I am thankful to God that He gave me the strength to take and go through  it. Those who handle purity movements cannot be too vigilant. The legal maxim has it that ‘Law’, i,e., God, ‘helps the wakeful, never the sleepy.’
 AN ENGLISH FRIEND’S WARNING
An English friend sends the following message :
 We, English people, do not understand this fasting of yours. We were hardly able to tolerate your previous fasts. But you will be discredited, if you repeat any more  of these.
I know that this warning has been sent out of concern for my
 reputation. I know the Protestant dislike for fasts. But, inspite of all the wish to stand well with my English friends, I am really helpless in this matter. I am not responsible for these fasts. I do not undertake them for my amusement. I would not torture the flesh for the love of fame. Though I bear joyfully the pangs of hunger and many other physical discomforts of fasting, let no one imagine that I do not suffer. These fasts are bearable only because they are imposed upon me by a higher Power and the capacity to bear the pain also comes from that Power. I can only plead with that Power that He may not put me through any more ordeals of that nature. But if my pleading goes in vain and another fast comes my way, I must take it, even though I may have to risk a wreckage of all the reputation I may possess for sanity and what not. ‘For, what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul?’

  LETTER TO F. MARY BARR 
 
 August 24, 1934
  	I was glad to hear from you so soon in reply to my postcardlibtech_511_footnote. Jamnalalji is doing exceedingly well. The operation 	itself was a prolonged affair because it had to do with the bony 	parts of the ear and there were some tough bones to be chiselled and 	hammered. But the convalescence has been exceptionally easy. He was 	allowed to walk yesterday and is almost on normal diet. Even the 	stitches were taken off. That of course does not mean that the bones 	where cuts were made were healed. That must take some time, but not 	so much as the doctors had expected. They say that the operation was 	successful and very cleverly done.  	Mira had a sudden call from within. One fine morning she came to me 	and said that she felt an irresistible call to go to England. I 	asked her, “when”; and she said, “as soon as I can pack and 	go”. I did not resist her. On the contrary I encouraged her 	because I felt that it must do her good and be a rich experience, 	though she might  be able to do nothing. I have confidence that she 	will not make any serious blunder by talking nonsense. She is too 	well-balanced to do that. She does not expect to be away for more 	than four months, but I have written to her not to hurry back and  	that she should stay longer if it was necessary. Her programme is 	very elaborate. She is leaving practically no friend unvisited and 	she is booked to go to Scotland also. She has been sending long 	letters and she herself is more than satisfied with the way she is 	being received. I fancy that she will return in October. Is it not 	strange that the English climate is not suiting her as well as the 	Indian climate ! She told me that she was freezing in Wales ! If you 	want to see a sample of her very long but interesting letters I will 	gladly send you a specimen.  	I hope you are now thoroughly restored. Do you hear from Duncan? Love.

  LETTER TO VALLABHBHAI PATEL 
 August 24, 1934
 BHAISHRI VALLABHBHAI,
 Since Kaka has resigned his place on the Board of Trustees of the Vidyapith, all of us have come to the decision that you should be the Chairman of the Board.We have already appointed you to the post. I did not remember what my legal position was in the Vidyapith, so I enquired about it and was told that I had none, but that, morally speaking, they regarded me as its Chancellor and all the teachers had agreed among themselves that I should be permitted to intervene in its affairs whenever I wished to do so. But this is no way of running an organization. You are the only person who can be the legal chairman.  I am satisfied with whatever moral position I have and have neither the desire nor the strength to shoulder greater responsibility than that.
 Another decision which they have arrived at on my advice and subject to your approval is that Narahari should take over  management of the Harijan Ashram and that as many teachers from the Vidyapith as he may need should be made available to him. The expenditure over Narahari and other teachers from the Vidyapith who may be assigned to the Ashram should be met from the Vidyapith
 
 funds as long as they last. I am of the view that this burden should not be put on the Harijan Sevak Sangh for the present, in view of the policy of the Sangh that it should pay caste Hindus from its funds in as few cases as possible. The ideal is that 95 per cent of the receipts should go directly into the pockets of Harijans. If we wish to realize it, we should set an example with our own workers. The third decision we have taken—and this also subject to your approval—is that the remaining teachers should, if they agree, spread out in villages for rural reconstruction work and for service in villages, and start work according to the scheme or plan which I have put forward. Narahari will explain it to you. If you do not approve of any item in it, exclude  it unhesitatingly. Kakasaheb, Kishorelalbhai, Maganbhai, Soman and Narahari were present when these decisions were taken and they have agreed with them. About Narahari, I have discussed the idea with Thakkar Bapa also. The Harijan Ashram cannot be run on the best lines unless it gets the services of a person like him. I am sure that , if we run it well, we shall advance the cause of Harijans considerably. Only then will the gift of the Satyagraha Ashram have been justified. Though I know, therefore, that we can take many other services from Narahari, I think this is the best use we can make of him at present, and he himself is interested in this work and is fully confident of being able to make a success of it. Please, therefore, let Narahari be sacrificed for the Harijan Ashram.

  LETTER TO VALLABHBHAI PATEL

 BHAISHRI VALLABHBHAI,
 I got your letter and wire. I am not sending a wire in reply to your wire, since I have already written to you yesterday on that very subject.libtech_519_footnoteIf   you have not issued any statement as   suggested in that letter, you may state as follows :
 I have read the proceedings of the new party formed by Pandit Malaviyaji and Shri M. S. Aney. I have read telegrams and letters asking me to clarify certain points. In my opinion it is not proper to use the Congress name without the Congress authority.The party may be called the National Party of Congressmen if its composition strictly confirmed to Congress- men. But without the authority of the Congress duly received it cannot with propriety be called the Congress National Party especially when it is formed deliberately to propagate a policy in direct contradiction to that which is the official policy of the Congress. The adoption of the Congress name cannot but confuse the popular mind and I would respectfully urge Panditji to reconsider the position and adopt another name for the party which he had a perfect right to form for the education of Congressmen and others. There other point I should like to emphasize is that no one but the Congress Parliamentary Board can run elections in the name of the Congress. Lastly in the midst of the unfortunate differences between Pandit Malaviyaji and Sjt. Aney and the Working Committee I hope that all Congressmen will loyally support the policy enunciated in the resoultion of the Working Committee regarding the Communal Award.libtech_520_footnote
If you wish to make any changes in this, you may do so.
 Rejendrababu’s letter was rather strange.There can be only one reply to it. The Congress certainly cannot assume responsibility for providing the money and we cannot raise funds at present through private efforts. That is the responsibility of Bhulabhai and others. Discuss this matter with him.
 
 I will write to Bhulabhai regarding the A.I.C.C.
 He wants a meeting of the Working Committee to be called. I, therefore, think that it will be best to call it. You may hold it either in Bombay or Wardha, as you wish. He wants it to be called early in September.
Rajaji will arrive here the day after tomorrow or on Sunday.

 DEAR DR. BIDHAN,
  LETTER TO DR. B. C. ROY 
 
 August 25, 1934
 
  	Yes, I have recovered from the effects of the fast in the sense that 	there is no untoward consequence. I am steadily but slowly regaining 	strength.  	I have no desire to have a meeting of the Working Committee. But, if 	it is needed by the Parliamentary Board, I have no doubt that Sardar 	Vallabhbhai will call it. But have you need for it? I have a 	telegram from Maulana Saheb and Sardar sardul Singh who evidently 	desire a meeting of the Working Committee at the same time as the 	Parliamentary Board meeting. If such is also your feeling, then of 	course the Working Committee must meet. I am loath to be dragged to 	Bombay just now. Jamnalalji from his sick-bed has been warning me 	not to leave Wardha before I have reached 110 lb. I am now 98 lb. 
 and 	I am gaining at the rete of less than libtech_524_footnote lb. 	a day. Supposing that I 
  	keep up that pace, it would not be before the 20th September that I 	can leave Wardha. But of course Jamnalalji is exacting and he can be 	over-ruled if both the meetings must take place in Bombay, and that 	in the early part of September and if my presence is a necessity. 	All these things I leave to you to decide and then move  Sardar  	Vallabhbhai accordingly.  	Of course the appropriation of the name ‘Congress’ by Panditji’s 	party is a bad job. No one can act in the name of the Congress 	without due authority. I believe Sardar Vallabhbhai would be issuing 	a statementlibtech_525_footnotein 	the matter. You must have seen the brief statementlibtech_526_footnotethat I have issued.  	I hope you do not want the Working Committee to lay down the 	procedure at the present stage to be followed by Congressmen in the 	Assembly. If an amendment of the character you describe is brought 	before the meeting just now I think it would be better not to say 	anything. But the Parliamentary Board is the best judge to decide as 	to what is necessary. But should an amendment be moved, you have 	correctly interpreted my own opinion as to the clear duty of 	Congress members. They must vote against a resolution or amendment     
 accepting the Award. And since they cannot vote for rejection, naturally they must abstain from voting in regard to a resolution or amendment rejecting the Award.
 I am glad that so many districts had undisputed elections. I wish the rest of the districts would follow the good example set by the overwhelming majority of the districts. But if a fight is inevitable, I think that the decisions of Mr. Aney should be loyally followed.
 Yours sincerely,

  LETTER TO MANGHARAM SANTDAS 
 August 25, 1934
 
MY DEAR SANTDAS,
 I have read your little note to Jairamdas at the back of Will Haye’s letter. Though I have not been able to write to you I have been closely  following  the  course  that  Kamlani’slibtech_527_footnotelibtech_528_footnotederangement  is taking. I have no doubt that he will be himself again, and when he does regain his balance, subject to your approval, I would ask him, if it is only for a time, to come back to India before he resumes his work. Life in England, especially for a man with a tender consciencelike Kamlani, is a very difficult job. I hope you are not worrying. After all Kamlani and all of us are in God’s hands. We can but work and pray.

  LETTER TO NARAHARI D. PARIKH 
 August 25, 1934
 CHI. NARAHARI,
 Since Kakasaheb has resigned from the Board of Trustees of the Vidyapith, the question arises as to what should be done regarding the village improvement scheme of Shri Nagindas Amulakhrai. As desired by Shri Nagindas, I had appointed a committee to implement the scheme. On thinking about it, I now feel that the committee should be made completely independent of the Vidyapith, and that Sardar Vallabhbhai should be appointed its President and Raojibhai its Secretary. The latter should be appointed for one year.
 Kakasaheb has rightly deposited the money of the Nagindas Trust with Jamnalalji. After the latter is all right, we may, if necessary, make some other arrangement. I have another fund also under my control. Kakasaheb has deposited that amount, too, with Jamnalalji. For the convenience of keeping accounts and from other points of view I think it would be desirable ot amalgamate this amount with the Nagindas Trust money.
 The late Punjabhai had donated an ear-marked sum and, on my advice, entrusted the Vidyapith with the responsibility of editing and publishing Jain literature through a committee. I have a moral respon- sibility in this matter too. In view of the present circumstances, I would suggest that that work also should be carried on independently of the control of the Vidyapith. I suggest the following names as Trustees of such an independent body:
 Narahari Parikh	4. 	Maganbhai Desai Valji Desai	5. Nilkanth Mashruwala Ramniklal Modi	6. 	Gopaldas Patel 
 If, besides these, we can get a learned and pious Jain, I think it would be desirable to invite him also to become one of the Trustees. We shall have to look out for such a person. If you can think of any name, please let me know.
 In this programme, so far we have paid attention to publication of material from the original sources of the Agamas together with a transl-ation. If, instead, we make selections from this vast field of literature which might be useful to the people, or get such selections made, and publish them, I think the late Punjabhai’s object would be better fulfilled.
 It was always Punjabhai’s wish that Shri Rajchandra’s birth anniversary should be fittingly celebrated. We should assume the respo-nsibility for this. But whereas in Punjabhai’s time people were content with holding meetings on the anniversary day, I think  it would do greater credit to the committee and give greater peace to the soul of Shrimad if some constructive work could be done on that day. The committee should consider whether this should be done by publishing some literature or arranging a lecture on the anniversary day or in some other manner. The anniversary falls on the next Kartik Purnima. We should, therefore, think and decide in time how it should be celebrated on this occasion.

417 LETTER TO VALLABHBHAI PATEL
 August 25, 1934
 
BHAI VALLABHBHAI,
 You must have  received my letterlibtech_529_footnotelibtech_530_footnoteof yesterday. Mathurababulibtech_531_footnotebrought your letter today. It was good that he came. I have sent an emphatic message with him to the effect that they should fight the elections only if the Parliamentary Board provides the money, otherwise they should abandon the idea. They should expect no help from you or me. Of course, if they have the courage to fight without spending money they should certainly do so. If, however, that is not possible, they should think twice before deciding to fight. If it is possible anywhere in the country to fight elections without money and solely on the prestige of the Congress, it is in Bihar. However, this problem is outside my sphere. I haven’t the slightest idea  how elections are fought. If indeed they can be fought without money or with very little money solely in the name of the Congress, there can be nothing more creditable than that.
 I have a wire from Bhulabhai saying that he is coming today between 3 and 4. Mahadev is arriving in the evening .
Did I write to you that I had received three wires regarding the
 
 Working Committee? I have merely wired back in reply that they should ask you about it.
 It will not matter if you find in impossible to come. We shall meet through letters and be satisfied with that. I will keep  you informed about anything new which I come to know about.
 Mirabehn seems to be doing good work. Probably it will bear no result just now, but her trip [to England] will not have been in vain. If you have not been getting letters regarding such matters, I will arrange, after Mahadev’s return, that they are forwarded to you. Muriel met Lloyd George. She talked with him for hours.Thus these few friends have been doing the best they can. Mirabai and Agatha have clashed with each other a bit. Partly Mirabai’s impatience and partly her suspicious nature were responsible for this. Mahadev or Pyarelal will give you the details of the incident.
 You do not seem to have fully regained your strength. Bhulabhai has arrived. Call the meeting in Bombay. That will drag me there. Bhulabhai will be able to manage the A.I.C.C.

  	I was glad to receive your very prompt letter giving me all the 	information I wanted except one. I wonder if with all your 	attainments it would be proper for you, with wife and children , to 	give your services to a Harijan institution for Rs. 150. And it is 	not so much the small maintenance that you require as the fact that 	I cannot provide, perhaps for some years, the scope that your 	abilities would need. I have not in mind the bringing into being of 	a mighty Harijan institution. It would be a small affair with big 	promise in a somewhat distant future. Will you be content to allow 	your abilities to lie fallow? You will just tell me what is the 	urge. And is your wife in hearty co- operation with you in coming 	down from Rs. 750 per month to Rs. 150, when I suppose even now you 	could command, if not Rs. 750 per month, something very near it?

  LETTER TO VALLABHBHAI PATEL 
 August 26/27, 1934
 BHAI VALLABHBHAI,
 Mahadev must have replied to your letter. Raja arrived suddenly today and was in a great hurry to return. Since I spent a good deal of time with him I am late with the post. Aney also came and saw me. All that I can say about him is that he brought a message of love from Malaviyaji and asked me if I had any reply to give. I told him that if they cared for propriety they should put up  their  candidates after consulting us and should not put up anybody simply to fight the Congress. He left soon, as he had to catch the train for Nagpur, and said that he would come again. The new Party has confused the situation, but apart from that I don’t think it will be able to do much harm.
 Bhulabhai came. I had a wire from the Maulana. He will have no objection to the meeting being held in Wardha. He can easily be acc- ommodated here. He says he will not mind if he cannot stay in a hotel. I don’t think he will stop for more than two days. To me, Wardha would certainly be more convenient. There will of course be some burden on Radhakisan, but he has kept everything ready. Recently Jamnalalji has added to the buildings. Hence there is sufficient accommodation. I have been assured that all the arrangements are perfect. Jamnalalji’s invisible presence has been working behind all this, of course.
 Bhulabhai will take care of all the necessary arrangements in consultation with you. You may now do what is most convenient to you. If you fix the meeting here, one advantage at any rate will be that we shall be able to meet.
 I have been discussing with Rajaji my intention of leaving the Congress. He has come specially to discuss that. If possible, he wants to run away on Tuesday.
 Ramdas is returning from Khurja on Monday. It is because of the cholera there. I shall know more when he comes.
I hope you are recovering your strength.
 Mahadev has written to you everything about Jawaharlal. It was very good indeed that he went. Jawaharlal felt much comforted. Moreover, the old lady and Kamala were vere happy.
 I have dashed this off in great haste immediately on entering my silence after the evening prayer. If anything is left out, I will supply it tomorrow.
 
     [PS.]  Blessings 	from  BAPU    Morning, 	August 27, 1934  	I have recollected one thing. It is not necessary for me now to 
  	write to Ballubhailibtech_532_footnotelibtech_533_footnoteor anybody else about the  matter concerning the 	Munic-ipality. I should write to you only. Even if you decide to 	take back the books belonging to the Vidyapith, there must be books  	worth thirty to fifty thousand belonging to the Ashram, maybe a 	little less or a little more. These books are lying unused. If they 	employ a librarian, the books can be catalogued on scientific lines, 	rules for lending them can be framed and they may then be loaned 	according to those rules. I very much desire that something should 	be done.libtech_534_footnote  	Andrews and  Joneslibtech_535_footnotehave 	arrived. I got your letter. Bhulabhai will be seeing you tomorrow.

  LETTER TO AMRITLAL V. THAKKAR 
 August 27, 1934
 BHAI BAPA,
 
 I got your letter regarding Amalabehn. The Sangh needn’t have incurred that expenditure. But I don’t write this by way of criticism. Compassion is a wonderful thing. On the one hand, a trust, and, on the other, compassion. Who can solve this conflict? But the expen- diture ought not to be borne by the Sangh. I, therefore, assume responsibility for that bill and for the ten rupees spent from Pariks- hitlal’s pocket. I will lay my hand on some other appropriate fund. Please forget about that bill. I will send from here a hundi or money order to Parikshitlal in a day or two.
 I have asked Prithuraj to write to you and give you plenty of other news. Somebody has given me a hundi to be spent as I like. Prithuraj is sending it to you to be spent by you in the manner I have suggested.

BHAI CHANDULAL,
 I got your letter. Tell Ramniklal that I have become impatient to see him. Ask him to see me soon. But what would it matter even if we can’t meet? After all, everything that we wish doesn’t happen. I do get news about you through Tara. I am glad that you keep cheerful. That is what one ought to do. I am regaining strength and weight. I was 94 immediately after the fast. Today it was 100. This gain in 14 days is not bad.
 During the fast, I also used to drink boiled water after it had been cooled. The difference between boiled and unboiled does not trouble me. I cannot tolerate water itself. Do you eat oranges during the fast? Write to me about any other symptom that may appear.libtech_536_footnote
 Let me know as soon as you have met  Ramniklal.  Most  probably he will be released before his time. I am trying. But we can try only in a manner befitting us.

  LETTER TO MANILAL AND SUSHILA GANDHI 
 August 27, 1934
 CHI. SUSHILA AND MANILAL,
 Since Manilal has not written to me but Sushila has, should her name not be put first ?
 I am   awaiting  your  reply  regarding  a  permit    for  Ramdas.libtech_537_footnoteMedh has sent nothing as yet to Uncle.libtech_538_footnote. If he does mean to send it, why doesn’t he send it directly to Uncle, or to me?
 I think I have already written to you about saving at least Rs. 5 and sending it to me for Uncle. I have requested this contribution for
 
 
 repaying the sum that I have got paid to him. I would be glad if he is not given even that much as a gift. I don’t think he himself will be able to repay the sum. If you two and Devdas pay every month, you will feel no burden and the sum which I have borrowed  from Jamnalalji can be repaid. You should try and do this much.
 Andrews has returned. We talked a great deal specially about you. He has been very much disappointed. He complains that Manilal has been writing articles about the Agent which are full of anger and cont-empt. He doesn’t say that there should be no criticism of the Agent, but that it should be kept within proper limits. I myself cannot read Indian Opinion these days. I rarely see any newspapers. I therefore don’t know. If however you have been writing anything in anger or with contempt, you should change that. You should realize that your respons-ibility is great. Since I have not read anything, I am not writing this by way of criticism. I am only letting you know the impression that Andr-ews has formed.
Who is the Swami from Bengal who takes so much of Manilal’s
 time?    	Ramdas is coming here tomorrow as cholera is raging in Khurja. 	Kishorelal and Gomati are here at present. The former’s health 
 cannot 	be described as too good.  	Devdas is all right, more or less. Lakshmi has always beendelicate. 	Her daughter is doing fine. Andrews was full of praises of Govind 	alias Arun. I 	have regained sufficient strength. But I have still to take some 
 rest.    Blessings 	from  BAPU

 DEAR DR. BIDHAN,
  LETTER TO DR. B. C. ROY 
 
 August 30, 1934
  	I understand that dispensation from adherence to the Working 	Committee resolution on the Communal Award is being given to Bengal 	Congress candidates on the ground of conscientious scruples. Can 	that be so? If it is, I think we have not got the power to give the 	dispensation.   You   would   have   seen   my   statementlibtech_540_footnotelibtech_541_footnoteto 	  the   Press regarding that. I said that such was the offer made 	and it was rejected; but that if Malaviyaji was disposed to accept 	it,  the  Working Committee would probably make the offer again. But 	until the dispensation becomes part of the Working Committee 	resolution no one can grant it. And it cannot be granted even by  	the Working Committee if the Nationalist Party continues to 	function. Those, therefore, who want dispensation have simply to 	belong to the Nationalist Party.  Yours 	sincerely,  DR. 	BIDHAN 	CHANDRA ROY 	CALCUTTA  From 	a copy: Pyarelal Papers . Courtesy: Pyarelal     LETTER TO HARIBHAU PHATAK   August 	30, 1934  MY 	DEAR HARIBHAU,  	I have your letter. My position on the cow is not that the cow might 	be superior to the buffalo in giving milk. If cow protection is part 	of Hinduism, then we must abjure buffalo milk even if it is superior 	to cow’s milk. Such is the conception of religion. You  cannot 	apply to it the bare rule of utility. If we would prefer buffalo 	milk , then by and by the buffalo would become the object of worship 	and the cow would disappear, as she is fast disappearing. Having 	said this, I can say that all the information that I possess goes to 	show that, all things considered, cow’s milk is superior to 	buffalo milk. But it is a question whcih does not much interest me, 	because I am sure that it would be possible to obtain medical 	testimony in favour of the superiority of the cow’s milk over 	buffalo milk and vice versa.    
 Therefore , in matters of this character, the safest thing is to steer clear of expert opinion. If we worship the cow, we must give her preference over all, irrespective of the quality of the different milk that different animals may give.

It was good that 	I sent you . . .’slibtech_542_footnoteoriginal letter. Your letter throws new light on the 	matter altogether. In such circumstances, you should, in the first 	place, acquaint me with all the facts and, secondly, do only what 	seems right to you. You should follow my advice only if it appeals 	ot your reason, or when I ask you to follow my instructions even if 	they do not appeal to your reason. In this case, I hastily expressed 	my opinion on the basis of . . .’s one-sided letter. You should 	act upon it only if you also are convinced. But, on the contrary, 	you repudiate all her allegations. That being so, there is no 	question of your acting upon my suggestions. First you should 	discuss. . .’s charges in detail and show that they are 	unjustified, and afterwards you should tell her firmly what you 	think regarding money. Personally, I am willing, on the basis of 	your letter, to write to her and reprimand her. But I am not writing 	for fear that my doing so might be misunderstood.  	I understand what you say concerning the dairy. We shall separate 	it. Whom do you suggest for its trustees? I think we had thought of 	some names,but I have forgotten them. Please, therefore, send your 	suggestions. Ramdas and Dr. Sharma have returned here. They will not 	have to go back to Khurja, for the house in which they lived had to 	be vacated and, moreover, there is nothing special in that place.    
 This place is fairly crowded just now. Andrews and Ghanshy- amdas are still here. Sardar and Jairamdas are arriving today. Others keep coming and going.

  THAT ILL-FATED MEASURE 
 The ill-fated Temple-entry Bill deserved a more decent burial, if it deserved it at all, than it received at the hands of the mover of the Bill. It was not a Bill promoted by an individual for his personal satisfaction. It was a Bill promoted by, and on behalf of, the refor- mers. The mover should, therefore, have consulted reformers  and acted under instructions from them. So far as I am aware, there was hardly any occasion for the anger into which he allowed himself to be betrayed or the displeasure which he expressed towards Congressmen. On the face of it, it was, and was designed to be, a measure pertaining to religion, framed in pursuance of  the solemn declarationlibtech_545_footnotelibtech_546_footnotepublicly made in Bombay at a meeting of representative Hindus who  met  under the chairmanship of Pandit Malaviyaji on  25th  September, 1932. The curious may read the declaration printed almost every week on the front page of Harijan. Therefore, every Hindu, caste or Harijan, was interested in the measure. It was not a measure in which Congress Hindus were more interested than the other Hindus. To have, therefore, dragged  the Congress name into the discussion was unfortunate. The Bill deserved a gentler handling.
 Having not a moment to spare myself during the exacting and swift Harijan tour, I had asked Shri Rajagopalachari, in pursuance of the pledge given by me at public meetings and to sanatanist friends in private and in these columns, to ascertain informally (as it could only be done informally) the views of the Hindu members of the Assembly, as, I thought , if it was discovered that the majority was opposed to it, steps should be taken to have the Bill withdrawn. This was the very simple issue on which the Bill could either have been dropped or proceeded with. Both the sanatanists and the reformers would have understood the position. Its fate ought not to have been decided on a side issue. If C. Rajagopalachari or I had committed a mistake, we should have been made to pay for it. But the Bill was above persons. Right or wrong, it enunciated a great principle and, therefore, deserved a more decent treatment than it received.
 As for the part played by the Government, this journal’s policy is to avoid as much as possible criticism of the Government. But I should like to say that, with the material before it, the Government
 
 
 could only have taken the course it did. But the public should know that on behalf of the reformers there was not only no attempt made to canvass public opinion but a decision was deliberately arrived at that no attempt should be made to obtain signatures of the public in general in favour of the Bill, it being left open to expert bodies to send representations if they chose. This was duly announced in these pages. My co-workers and I came to the conclusion that the questions underlying the circulation were too technical for the public to decide. Thus, the question was not whether Harijans should or should not enter public Hindu temples precisely on the same terms as the others. The question was whether there should be any legislation in the matter and, if there should be, whether the Bill was good on its merits . In my opinion, both these questions were too technical to be put before the public. Surely, it is not impossible to conceive occasions when legislative help or interference is indispensable even in matters of religion. As a matter of fact, there are many cases of such legislation. But it was difficult to get an intelligent vote from the public. Then, on the merits, it was equally difficult to show to the public that the Bill was purely of a permissive nature and that no temple could be opened without the consent of the majority of the temple-going public. Such public education is not impossible under congenial circumstances. But it is well-nigh impossible when party feeling runs high and truth is at a discount.
 The temple-entry battle has to continue. The promise made to Harijans must be redeemed and the temples have to be flung open. If they can be, without legislative sanction, no one would be more glad than the reformers. Not that they want a single temple to be opened where the majority of savarna Hindus who are in the habit of using them are opposed. Law’s assistance is invoked because lawyers opine that the law prevents such opening even where an overwhelming majority of temple-goers are agreeable. If such is the case, the permissive legislation is peremptory. Law alone can undo what law has done, whether it is judge-made or statutory or customary. But reformers will wait till such time as the passing of legislation becomes irresistible. But waiting is only for the wakeful. The hasty withdrawal of the Bill teaches its own lesson. There is no cause for disappointment. Redoubled effort is required. It is not necessary to
 know or prove that Harijans want temple-entry. Removal of the sin is necessary for the satisfaction of the savarna Hindus who have realized that untouchability is a canker eating into the vitals of Hinduism, which, if not removed in time, must kill Hinduism.

         MY 	DEAR RAJBHOJ,   LETTER TO P. N. RAJBHOJ     August 	31, 1934 
  	Your letter of 25th August astonished me, for you have now taken up 	a position in connection with the work of the Harijan Sevak Sangh 	which is contrary to what you had taken up some time ago and in your 	correspondence and conversations with me. It may be that experience 	has altered your view. If such is the case, I have nothing to say 	except that you have based your criticism on insufficient data.  	You know that I have repeatedly expressed my opinion that Harijan 	Sevak Sangh is an organization of penitents. Therefore it cannot be 	predominantly manned by Harijans. It has got to do the repentance in 	the manner that the penitent savarnas may consider to be the 	most suitable. It it does not appeal to the Harijans, it would be no 	doubt unfortunate. Then the penitents must try again. But they have 	got to learn the art of repentance from bitter experience.  	As I have said to you personally so often, and you seemed also  to 	agree, the better and more effective method of influencing the 	policy of Harijan Sevak Sanghs would be for local Harijans to form 	representative Advisory Boards to study sympathetically the 	activities of the local Sanghs, and then advise them, criticize them 	and make concrete suggestions. If such Advisory Boards are formed 	everywhere, the work done by the Harijan Boards will be naturally 	much more effective than it is today. But even as it is, the Boards 	have nothing to be ashamed of. If you will follow the columns of 	Harijan from week to week, you will surely be astonished at 	the way the money all over India is being distributed among 	Harijans. It can be shown from records that many institutions 	managed by Harijans are being substantially supported from funds 	collected by Harijan Boards. You 
 will find also, if you study the figures, that the extent of distribution of funds directly among Harijans and Harijan institutions is progressively increasing. Extraordinary precautions are being taken to ensure the impartial distribution of funds.
 You are altogether wrong in thinking that accounts of distributions are not published. Reports by provincial branches are published from time to time. They are available for inspection by the public and you can test the accuracy to my statement by turning over the columns of Harijan and even by application of local offices for copies of their reports. I am asking Thakkar Bapa to let me have a consolidated account for publication in Harijan, and you will be yourself astonished at the amounts spent for Harijan institutions and students all over India.
 As to temple-entry, you will find that practically nothing has been spent either on opening of temples or on the building of new temples, and throughout the nine months’ tour, the reports of my speeches in the columns of Harijan will show you conclusively that the temple-entry question occupies the least part of them. The Harijan Sevak Sanghs have concentrated on some of the very things that you mention. If they have not tackled all the items, it is not for want of will but for want of capacity to overtake all the items at once.
 Your attack upon the Maharashtra Harijan Board comes with ill grace. An out-and-out supporter of the Harijan cause, namely, Mr. Devdhar, is the President of the Provincial Board. He began this long before the Harijan Board came into existence, and probably before the birth of many of us. So far as I am aware, he has never been accused of lukewarmness over this reform. If you have any specific complaints against the locl Board, don’t you think that your first duty is to send those complaints to the local Board, and if you do not get relief or satisfaction, to take your appeal to the Central Board? And then if you find that your complaint has gone unheeded, you will be justified in exposing the respective Boards in the public. As it is, you have nothing but a vague allegation against  the  Maharashtra Board which, in my opinion, has deserved a better treatment.
 Yours sincerely,
 M. K. GANDHI

  LETTER TO SITARAMA SASTRY 
 August 31, 1934
 DEAR SITARAMA SASTRY,
 I have your letter. Although the matter you mention escaped you, there is nothing new in it. We had the large sum spent on Andhra because Andhra had given its due share during the khadi tour. But that does not entitle Andhra to appropriate the sum for use at will. The sum was given to the All-India Spinners’ Association just as Harijan Funds have been given to the Harijan Sevak Sangh. These funds have to be largely used in the province where they were collected. But they are used under instructions of the central organization. Therefore so far as the security is concerned, it has got to be obviously on the same footing for both the funds. And under the proposed autonomy you will be keeping the equivalent of both the funds in the shape of khadi and furnIture. If  you issue debentures and offer them as security, that is totally a different proposition. If that kind of security appeals to the Association naturally it will be accepted. I have not visualized the debentures sufficiently to pronounce any opinion upon merits. I hope this is perfectly clear.
 Yours sincerely,

  LETTER TO PARIKSHITLAL L. MAJMUDAR 
 August 31, 1934
 BHAI PARIKSHITLAL,
 You know that Ramdas has become weak. He feels happy in Surendra’s company. He wants to try the treatment of Dr. Sharma who employs nature-cure remedies. Because he is weak, Ba wants to stay with him. Hence Ramdas, Ba and Dr. Sharma will leave this place and go there. Take them in some conveyance from Sabarmati and lodge them in any building that may be vacant. You should charge rent at the rate that has been fixed. They will not require any other
 attention. You will have no bedsteads there, of course. Beg one for Ramdas from Budhabhai. They will probably get the necessary provisions there. The expenses will be sent from here. If Ramdas stays there for any length of time, the doctor’s wife and his two sons will come there. If you encounter any difficulty, let me know. Ba will cook. They will require one servant. If you can find one, do so. Show this letter to Bhai Narahari.

  TERRIBLE OPPRESSION 
 I have been receiving reports from several quarters about the oppression of the Harijans in the area surrounding Talaja. Even after assuming an element of exaggeration in them and making allowance for it, what remains is shocking enough. It is difficult to understand how man can be so cruel.
 The tragedy of it is that the Harijans were quite innocent. Because there was an epidemic of the plague among cattle and they died, it was supposed that this was the doing of the Harijans. And so the latter were harassed and beaten almost to death, and in some cases actually to death, with the result that, to escape this oppression they left their homes and belongings and took shelter inTalaja.
 It is all the more distressing that such things should happen in a model State like Bhavnagar. I do not say this in order to blame the State. I see from the letters and telegrams I have received that the officials are alert, and I hope that these cruel happenings will be fully investigated, the innocent Harijans will get justice and be resettled in their homes, and the guilty will be forced to compensate the Harijans who have been injured and make good the losses of those whose belongings have been destroyed, and steps will be taken to ensure that such things do not happen again.
 What is specially lamentable is the fact that even  in  a progressive State the people are stony-hearted towards the Harijans, treat them as less than animals and do not hesitate to beat them up
 half-dead or dead and do not even fear being punished with hanging or rigorous imprisonment. Many people seem to argue that they need fear authority or God in beating or killing a Harijan no more then they need to do so in beating or killing cats and dogs, and their reasoning is not completely unjustified either.
 The help that the Government or State can give in such matters  is not much. It can punish the guilty after the event and force the guilty village to pay compensation. But where a strong public opinion has not been cultivated against such things, the State cannot produce big results. At the root of the Talaja atrocities are utter ignorance and superstition. It is the duty of Harijan workers to dispel this darkness. They should explain to the people that epidemics of the plague are known to occur occasionally in all countries of the world, and that outside India nobody is suspected when such an epidemic occurs. The people in those countries merely regard it as a natural calamity, employ blameless remedies for eradicating the plague and give medicines to the cattle. This should be done  vigorously  and ceaselessly in villages sunk in ignorance.
 In this connection I have received a heart-rending letter from a Harijan. Since it is worth reading by every caste Hindu, I reproduce below  its important  part :libtech_547_footnote

  LETTER TO SAHEBJI MAHARAJ 
 September 2, 1934
 DEAR SAHEBJI MAHARAJ,
 It was indeed an agreeable surprise to me to hear from you. But  I am afraid that I must not accept your congratulations. I have no talent for reproducing Dayalbaghlibtech_549_footnotelibtech_550_footnotein the different provinces of India. My reference was to the loan of the excellent men you have sent to Karachi, who are conducting in a methodical manner the Industrial Institute founded by the Mohatta Brothres. Yours is a huge enterprise.  I know my limitations. My experience may be extensive in some directions; but I do claim very little experience in the direction in which you have built up Dayalbagh. Nor have I unlimited resources. However, I do expect, when I am ready, to fall back upon you for trained men, to assist the Harijan Sevak Sangh in  establishing industrial homes for Harijans. Necessarily therefore they have got to be unambitious.
 I am glad you have put up a tannery. Will your expert give me a brief article describing the method of tanning so that an intelligent reader may be able to make his own experiments in tanning? Does your tanning include the treatment of carcasses, flaying them and separating the skin from the bone and the flesh? And if it is, what is being done with the bones, blood, the flesh, the entrails, etc.? For me,
 
 tanning has a most important bearing upon the tremendous question of cattle preservation, consistently with the Hindu belief in the sanctity of the cow. And do you take any leather, or do you confine yourself only to leather of dead cattle as distinguished from slaughtered?
 Do I infer from your kind offer to include Dayalbagh in the list of Harijan colonies, that the Harijan Sevak Sangh may send Harijan boys to be trained there in the several departments? And if the Sangh may, on what terms?
 Mirabehn will be delighted, as I am, to learn that you have succeeded in producing iridiumtipped gold nibs which are eleven- twelfth swadeshi. I shall inform Mirabehn of the good news you have given.
 I thank you for your kind inquiry about my health. I  am making as good progress as can be expected after the fast.

  	You have given excellent advice in your last letter. But do you 	yourself do what you advise? If I did not take sufficient rest and 	proper care of my health, would I be gaining weight at the rate of 	half  a pound a day? If you were to compare how I work now with how 	you saw me working, you would think I was a lazy man or an incurable     
 sleeper. Isn’t it better that you are there and taking walks or idling away your time in the Hanging Garden, and, in return  for  this freedom, doing some nursing for Father? Do you know the story of the Hanging Garden? I believe that it is not a place where poor people like us can enjoy a walk. Only fashionable people go there. When you go there next time, observe and let me know how many poor people you saw. I went there once or twice and had enough of it.
 I don’t mind your displaying your knowledge before me. An adopted father cannot expect better treatment. But I hope you have not alarmed Father there.
 You have made a mistake. You have stated that Father’s weight is 104. I shall probably overtake that in four days. Are you sure you don’t mean 204? Do you read the Ramayana regularly?

  LETTER TO PREMABEHN KANTAK 
 3 a.m., September 3, 1934
 CHI. PREMA,
 
 Your letter was full of descriptions. It seems your work is going on very well. Continue to send accounts of it in the same manner. There is an articlelibtech_556_footnotein Harijan about the work  to be done in villages. Read it. One and the same method will not work everywhere. This is a virgin field of work. Hence there will probably be a great deal of variety in the work to be done. The plan which I have and which I have explained in Harijan is based on one line of approach only. But to whom can I explain this, if not to you? Let me see now to how many persons you can explain it.
 I am not surprised to learn about your being harassed. I would advise you not to mention the name of the Congress at all, let alone civil disobedience. For the present, only explain to the village people the pros and cons of your programme. Speaking of the Congress serves no purpose if its programme  is not carried out. If the programme is carried out, there is no need to speak of it. The real worshippers of Shri Krishna are not those who shout “Krishna, Krishna”, but those who do His work. Our hunger is not appeased if we keep shouting “bread, bread”. It is appeased by eating bread.
 Your assumption is correct. If you receive an order to leave the village, you should readily obey it. Only those who willingly obey laws which they do not like earn the right sometimes to disobey a law. This is rarely remembered by people.
 Please do not assume that I shall attend the Congress. Many plans are maturing in my mind. I don’t get time to write to you about all of them. Wait and see what happens. You should be satisfied that you have chalked out your work.
 Kisan writes to me sometimes. Your letter  to Amtussalaam was  a good one.
You know that Ramdas does not keep good health. He has gone
 
 
 
 to Sabarmati along with Sharma. Ba has gone with him to look afrer him.

 Mr. Mung of Burma came and saw me two days ago. He said that to Haji’s request he plunged into the Burmese question  and carried on such a powerful agitation that it even told on his health. He has incurred, he says, an expense of Rs. 2,000. Since there has been no result, neither the company nor Haji would now accept his demand. They deny any understanding with him. He also expressed a desire to see you. I have replied to him that everybody takes up such work of his own free will and for the good of  his  people.  If somebody refuses to keep his promise, one should blame one’s own stupidity. All the same, I have advised him to write to you.

 Today I have crossed the limits in writing. My back forbids me to go on any more. But I can’t obey the prohibitory order immediately. I could read Narahari’s letter only today. I think some injustice has been done to him. I see no reason at all why you should have felt displeased with him in this matter. Since he could not put his case before you in Bombay, he has stated it with the utmost humility in his letter. The hope which he has expressed in it, that you would dissuade Kaka and prevail over those who cannot co-opearte with him to try and do so, is no doubt too much. However, it is only a request that he has made. It betrays his ignorance of your nature. He should have taken your letter to me as expressing your final view. It is qutie clear and fully meets the requirements of the situation. I have told Narahari that, if anybody can keep Kaka in Gujarat, it will have your
 approval and your blessing. Kishorelal told me that you had written a stiff letter to Narahari. If my argument appeals to you, please write a soothing letter to him. In case you may want to read his letter again, I am returning it.

  LETTER TO MATHURADAS TRIKUMJI 
 September 4, 1934
 I got your letter. I chanced to see your writing on karmayoga only yesterday and glanced through it. I will read it now if I get time. What is this about music and cinema? Do they wish to turn the
Congress session into a Felix Circus or Barnum show? But, then, what
 can I say in this matter? I do love music, but everything is good in its place. If the three or four days of the Congress session are crowded with such activities, the atmosphere of seriousness will disappear. Even if they wish to arrange such programmes, somebody may be given a contract for them. I am of the view, however, that  no  such  programmes can be arranged at the place where the [nation’s] parliament meets. But we have turned the Congress into a tamasha. Inclusion of genuine Indian music in a cent per cent swadeshi exhibiton is legitimate. But only traditional instruments should be  used in such a programme. I can see no room at all for a band. You may show this to Sardar. But if you wish to maintain discreet silence, you may do so. You must have heard from Sardar about the step I am contemplating. I will not, therefore, waste a few minutes of my time by writing about it here.
 Why inquire about my health? It was tested yesterday. I was busy with the pen the whole day. There was no ill effect.
 I dont’t know, however, if somebody here writes to you and gives you a different report.

  DISCUSSION WITH DODDlibtech_565_footnote 
 September 4, 1934
 DR. DODD: I have come to Indialibtech_566_footnote, 10,000 miles, to see Taj  which  is  a monument of the past and Mahatma Gandhi which is a symbol of the future.
GANDHIJI: But why not become a living Taj than a dead Taj? And
why not a monument of the present than of the future ?
 Is there any chance of your coming to America? Could we kidnap you to America? We hear, you know, so much of kidnappers nowadays.
No, for the simple reason that I should be of no use there. If I
 came there, it would be to demonstrate the secret and the beauty and the power of non-violence. I should not be able to do it today. I have not yet carried complete conviction to my own countrymen.
 What is your main objective, Mr. Gandhi ?
 The main objective is obvious and it is to gain independence, not for the literate and the rich in India, but for the dumb millions.
 I know. I have often come across that expression in your writings. What are your methods?
Not many methods, but the one method of unadulterated truth
 and non-violence. But you might ask me, ‘How are non-violence and truth expressed and applied?’ I would say at once that the central fact in my programme is the spinning-wheel. I know that Americans are startled when I say this. What can be the meaning of this pet obsession, they ask.
 Not all Americans. Our daily paper one day criticized the spinning-wheel programme and in the very next column had an article describing people working with the shovel on a public thoroughfare, forty doing the work of a single machine.  In a letter to the editor, I drew his attention to the incongruity and told him that, just  as we were fighting unemp-loyment, India, too, was fighting unemployment. But with you, Mr. Gandhi, it is moral and spiritual symbol, too?
 Yes, of truth and non-violence. When as a nation we adopt the spinning-wheel, we not only solve the question of unemployment but we declare that we have no intention of exploiting any nation, and we also end the exploitation of the poor by the rich. It is a spiritual force
 
 
 which in the initial stages works slowly, but as soon as it gets started, it begins working in geometrical progression, i.e., when it gets into the life of the people.When I say I want independence for the millions, I mean to say not only that the millions may have something to eat and to cover themselves with, but that they will be free from the exploitation of people here and outside. We can never industrialize India, unless, of course, we reduce our population from 350 millions to 35 millions or hit upon markets wider than our own and dependent on us. It is time we realized that, where there is unlimtied human power, complicated machinery on a large scale has no place. An  Indian economist told me once that every American had 36 slaves, for, the machine did the work of 36 slaves. Well, Americans may need that, but not we. We cannot industrialize ourselves, unless we make up our minds to enslave humanity.
 Then, we have to fight untouchability. Untouchability of a kind is everywhere. A coal porter coming from a coalmine would not stretch out his hand to shake yours. He would say he would wash himself cle clean first. But the moment a man has rendered himself clean, he should cease to be untouchable. Here however we have regarded a part of one population as perpetually untouchable.libtech_567_footnotelibtech_568_footnoteWe are trying to abolish that untouchability. Added to their untouchability is unemployment, which they share in common with a vast number of others. You, too, have got the unemployment problem, but it is of your own creation. Our unemployment is not entirely of our creation, but, however it came about, I am sure that, if my method was universalized in India,we should not onlyfind work for those that exist but for those to come. That is, we should easily be able to tackle our population problem. The problem is to double the penny a day which is the average income of a poor Indian. If we can achieve that, it would be quite enough at least till we find a better method. The spinning-wheel, by utilizing the idle hours of the nation, produces additional wealth; it does not, it was never meant to, displace existing employment. Give me a thing which would increase the daily income of the millions of our impoverished people more than the spinning- wheel, and I should gladly give up the spinning-wheel.
 I quite see. We talk of shortening of the hours of work, but as to what they are to do in their spare hours, we do not seem for a moment to trouble ourselves about.
 
 I would ask one more question, Mr. Gandhi. I have  the  opportunity  of speaking to many young men and women and I should like you to tell me what you consider your most satisfactory achievement—I will not say your greatest achievement, lest. I should embarrass you. In other words, what should I put before the young people as a thing that they should aspire after in life?
It is a difficult question. I do not know what to say. I can simply
 say this: I do not know whether you will call it an achievement or not, but I may say that, in the midst of humiliation and so-called defeat and a tempestuous life, I am able to retain my peace, because of an undying faith in God, translated as Truth. We can describe God as millions of things, but I have for myself adopted the simple formula— “Truth is God’’.
 I see it, I see it. You have achieved peace in a world of  confusion  and  turmoil.
But several American friends say to me, ‘You cannot have peace
 unless you believe in Jesus.’ Well, I tell you I have peace, though I do not believe in Jesus as the only son of God.
 I am glad you said this. May I ask you to let me know your conception of Christ ?
I consider him as a historical person—one of the greatest
 amongst the teachers of mankind. I have studied his teachings as prayerfully as I could, with the reverence of a Christian, in order to discover the Truth that is buried in them. I have done so, just as I have done about the teachings of other teachers.
 In this connection, may I ask your opinion on the missionaries’ work in India? Have they wronged India ?
 I should not say intentionally. They, of course, come here as critics, they exaggerate our social evils, they criticize our religion. But that does not matter. All their criticism has but served to make us more conscious of our weaknesses and more alive to our duties.
 But that, I suppose, you say of missionaries as individuals, not of missionary societies as such ?
I should not draw that distinction, for, missionary societies have
 certain pre-conceived notions of our society and religion which the members propagate. Thirty-five years ago, for instance, as I was passing through Zanzibar, I went to the Bible Society to purchase a copy of the Bible and with that I was given a report of work done by a mission there. I was astounded to find therein that a missionary could
 
 count his work in the terms of £. s. d. A convert meant so many shillings, as to a recruiting agent a recruit means so many rupees. One cannot think of a religion in the terms of the number of its adherents.
 What, Mr. Gandhi, has been your greatest disappointment ?
 Frankly, I have no sense of disappointment, excepting, perhaps, that sometimes I am disappointed with myself, inasmuch as I cannot control the fleeting thoughts as much as I should like to. That’s all.
 What is the source of your ideals ?libtech_569_footnote
 The source is truth or the uttermost identity with all life. Truth is the realization of God.
 One last thing, Mr. Gandhi. I am coming from the Congress of the Baptist Christians in Germany. They took a firm stand on peace and racialism. I spoke there on the ‘Gospel of the Day’ and spoke ‘on strict honesty and integrity in the business of our life’ and ‘war as the most insane and unchristian thing on earth’. I made, in conclusion, an appeal to all, coupled with my own declaration, that true Christians everywhere should refuse to shoot down their Christian brethren whenever Governments decided to go to war against any other nation. How much does that proposition come near you ?
 It would come very near me, if you were to drop out the word ‘Christian’ and said only ‘brethern’. I should refuse to shoot down any human being, black or white, Christian or non-Christian. Your declaration must apply to the whole humanity.
 I mean it. I said ‘Christian brethren’, as I was addressing a group of Christians.
 That is all right. I have to give this warning, because sometimes it is thought that there is nothing wrong in shooting down so-called savages.
 No, no.

  LETTER TO VALLABHBHAI PATEL 
 [Before] September[5], 1934libtech_570_footnote
 DEAR VALLABHBHAI,
 After much deliberation and discussions with friends who have been to Wardha recently, I have come to the conclusion that the best interests of the Congress and the nation will be served by my completely severing all official or physical connection with the Congress, including the original membership. This does not mean that I cease to take any interest in an organization with which I have been intimately connected since 1920 and which I have worshipped since my youth. In spite of all I have recently said about the corruption that has crept into the organization, it still remains, in my opinion, the most powerful and the most representative nationl organization in the country. It has a history of uninterrupted noble service and sacrifice from its inception. Its progress has been unbroken and steady. It has weathered storms as no other institution in the country has. It has commanded the largest measure of sacrifice of which any country would be proud. It has today the largest number of self-sacrificing men and women of unimpeachable character.
 It is not with a light heart that I leave this great organization. But I feel that my remaining in it any longer is likely to do more harm than good. I miss at this juncture the association and advice of Jawaharlal who is bound to be the rightful helmsman of the organization in the near future. I have, therefore, kept before me his great spirit. And I feel that whilst his great affection for me would want to keep me in the Congress, his reason would endorse the step I have taken. And since a great organization cannot be governed by affections but by cold reason, it is better for me to retire from a field where my presence results in arresting full play of reason. Hence in leaving the organization I feel that I am in no sense deserting one who is much more than a comrade and whom no amount of political differences will ever scparate from me.
 Nor by retiring at this critical juncture am I less true to Babu Rajendra Prasad who will in all probability be the President to the
 
 forthcoming Congress, and who unlike Jawaharlal shares most of my ideals and whose sacrifice for the nation, judged whether in quality or quantity, is not to be excelled.
 Then there is the Congress Parliamentary Board which would perhaps not have come into being, unless I had encouraged its formation with my whole heart. It supplies a want that was felt be many staunch and true Congressmen. It was necessary, therefore, to bring it into being. Such services as I am capable of rendering will still be at its disposal as at any Congressman’s. It must command the full support of all Congressmen who have no insuperable objection to the entry of Congressmen into the existing legislatures. I should be sorry if the Board lost a single vote because of my withdrawal.
 I fear none of the consequences dreaded by some friends, for I know my ground. A tree is no more hurt by a ripe fruit falling from it than would the Congress be by my going out of it. Indeed the fruit will be dead weight, if it did not fall when it was fully ripe. Mine is that condition. I feel that I am a dead weight on the Congress now.
 There is a growing and vital difference of outlook  between  many Congressmen and myself. My presence more and  more estranges the intelligentsia from the Congress. I feel that my policies fail to convince their reason, though strange as it may appear, I do nothing that does not satisfy my own reason. But my reason takes me in a direction just the opposite of what many of the most intellectual Congressmen would gladly and enthusiastically take, if they were not hampered by their unexampled loyalty to me. No leader can expect greater loyalty and devotion than I have received from intellectually- minded Congressmen even when they have protested and signified their disapproval of the policies I have laid before the Congress. I feel that for me any more to draw upon this loyalty and devotion is to put an undue strain upon them. I wish that those who strongly disapprove of my method would outvote me and compel my retirement. I have tried to reach that position but I have failed. They would cling to me till the end. The only way I can requite such loyalty is by voluntary retirement. I cannot work in opposition when ther are some fundamental differences between the Congress intelligentsia and me. Ever since my entry into public life I have never acted  in  that manner. libtech_571_footnote
Then there is the growing group of socialists. Jawaharlal is their
 undisputed leader. I know pretty well what he wants and stands for. He claims to examine everything in a scientific spirit. He is courage personified. He has many years of service in front of him. He has an indomitalble faith in his mission. The socialist group represents his views more or less, though probably their mode of execution is not exactly his. That group is bound to grow in influence and importance.  I have welcomed the group. Many of them are respected and self- sacrifcing co-workers. With all this, I have fundamental differences with them on the programme published in their authorized pamphlets. But I would not, by reason of the moral pressure I may be able to exert, suppress the spread of the ideas propounded in their literature. My remaining in the Congress would amount to the exercise of such pressure. I may not interfere with free expression of those ideas, however distasteful some of them may be me. libtech_572_footnote
 For me to dominate the Congress in spite of these fundamental differences is almost a species of violence which I must refrain from. Their reason must be set free at any cost. Having discovered this undisputable fact, I would be disloyal to the Congress if, even at the risk of losing all my reputation, I did not leave the Congress.
 But there is no danger to my reputation or that of the Congress, if  I leave only to serve it better in thought, word and deed. I do not leave in anger or in a huff, nor yet in disappointment. I have no
 disappointment in me. I see before me a bright future for the country. Everything will go well, if we are true to ourselves. I have no other programme before me save the Congress programme now before the country. libtech_573_footnote
 In this and various other ways I would love to serve the Congress in my own humble manner. Thus living in complete detachment, I hope, I shall come closer to the Congress. Congressmen will then accept my services without being embarrassed or oppressed.
 One word to those who have given me their whole-hearted devotion in thought, word and deed in the pursuit of the common goal. My physical withdrawal from the Congress is not to be understood to mean an invitation to them to withdraw. They will remain in the Congress fold so long as the Congress needs them and work out such common ideals as they have assimilated.
 Yours,
 BAPU

  STATEMENT TO THE PRESS 
 September 5, 1934
 I am surprised that a responsible paper like The Hindu should have published, without reference to me, unauthorized news about a serious decision said to have been made by me. Surely the Wardha correspondent  could  have  the  news  confirmed  or   denied.libtech_574_footnoteIt   was wrong to disclose incomplete and unauthorized reports of confidential conversa-tions.
 I may say that there have been discussions with co-workers in the matter but no final decision have been taken. According to my wont, I am sharing with friends, who happen to come to Wardha, the thoughts that dominate me. Public life will become impossible if exchange of views in the process of formation is at all published, especially if they are reported as if they are decisions.
 Whatever the decision that may be arrived at, it has and will have no connection whatsoever with Malaviyaji and Mr. Aney.
 Whilst every effort will be made to reconcile differences and conduct the election campaign without friction with the new party that has been created by Malaviyaji, there is no doubt whatsoever in my mind or that of the members of the Working Committee that the Congress Parliamentary Board should, with the full backing of the Working Committee, prosecute the election campaign and in doing so give full effect to the resolution of the Working Committee on the Communal Award, in which it has an abiding faith and which, it believes, is the only effective method of bringing about an agreed solution between the communities concerned.

DEAR DR. DHARMAVIR libtech_576_footnote,
 
 I thank you for your letter. If I could only allow myself lemon-juice, I know there would be no difficulty  in  drinking sufficient quantity of water with lemon-juice added. But my fasts do not admit of the introduction of lemon-juice, for however low it may  be it has a food value apart from such value as water and salts have. The problem before me therefore, is somewhat difficult—how to overcome the disagre-eableness of water without taking anything with it except soda or salt?

 MY DEAR SANTDAS,
 I have your letter. You have good news from Atma. The doctor’s report does not disturb me at all. Naturally he has to be careful, and he has used an expression which need not frighten us. I am already in correspondence with Polak. Any letter going from me to Atma is likely to excite him. Therefore, for the time being I shall confine myself to writing to Polak. I have already written to Mirabehn or Agatha Harrison, I forget which, that Atma should be induced to return to Indialibtech_577_footnotelibtech_578_footnote. When the proper time comes I shall not fail to write to Atma directly and press him to come back, because I am quite clear in

  	I have not been able to reply to you earlier. I am not able yet to 	tell you definitely what I can do with you.libtech_579_footnotelibtech_580_footnoteI 	do want to harness your abilities for the Harijan cause. Would you 	care to go to Harijan Asrham, Sabarmati, and be there for a few days 	or longer, and come in contact with the workers there?The manager 	will then report to me and you will also tell me how you feel there 	and what use you would make of it if you were placed in charge. I am 	afraid that if you take me on trust you may have a reaction and may 	be thoroughly disappointed, or you may not be the man I picture you 	to be, and then I or the co-workers might be disillusioned. I do not 	want either tragedy to take place. And then it won’t be for me to 	take you. It would be the Harijan Sevak Sangh which will have 	finally to decide. But naturally they would be largely guided by me 	seeing that you will be passed on to them through me.

But you may, if 	you want to save time, correspond directly with Sjt. Parikshitlal, 	the manager there, mentioning this letter to him and I have no doubt 	that he will let you go.

  LETTER TO RAIHANA TYABJI 
 September 5, 1934
 DEAR DAUGHTER RAIHANA,
What a letter! But the reply will have to be in  English.libtech_581_footnote
 You are a perfect fraud—a strange mystic who cannot  rise above the loving prejudices of parents. Your issue seems to me to be quite correct. But why are you not satisfied with your being in the right ! Must your neighbours, be they parents, also admit your claim to be in the right? Why must not your knowledge that you are in the right be its own satisfaction? Why should disappointments defeat you? Or you must withdraw your claim to be spiritually-minded and mystic. Mystics are made of sterner stuff—they are not ruffled by misery or pain or insult nor elated by happiness, pleasure or praise.
 If you say, they interfere with your action, it won’t hold water. They do not prevent you bodily fromlibtech_582_footnotelibtech_583_footnotebeing absorbed in prayer or contemplation for two hours or longer. I think you will find that all your difficulties will dissolve, if without irritation, anger or assertiveness you tell them with the greatest firmness and equal gentleness and with a smile on your lips, that whatever  you are doing is a fundamental necessity of your being.
 Whilst I say this you should know that my whole heart is with you. You must have freedom of thought, speech and action. You must be treated as a friend, not as a child. I am afraid that in your resentment you have underrated the atmosphere of largeheartedness and tolerance that is the speciality of Tyabjis. If you gave full credit to them for this rare quality you would gladly overlook what appears to be patronizing in their behaviour towards you. Remember that you will not be you but for the training they gave you and the affection with which they have surrounded you all. Do not be little the much they have done for you. Do you know this great doha of Tulsida, the mystic?
 God has endowed His animate and inanimate creation with good and bad qualities. The good man will sift and treasure the
 
 good from the bad even as the fabled swan separates and eats the cream from the water and the milk he sees before him.
 I advise you and ask you to follow the advice of your fellow- mystic.
 Tell me in reply that you have thrown overboard all your misery and are singing away in praise of Allah the Good and the Benevolent.
 My love to you and Saroj. Do you need thanks for Rs. 15 for the Harijans?

 BHAI THAKKAR BAPA,
 I wish you had told me about Surajbehn in Poona itself. I didn’t know at all that Deodhar and you had encouraged her to study [the working of ] a maternity home. Many women can, and would like to, run such a home. I would never think of engaging Surajbehn in work which many other women can, and would like to, do. Moreover, as Kishorelal says, such work does not seem to be included among our objects. If I can, that is, am free to do so under the trust rules, I will acquiesce in what Deodhar and you have approved, but if I have to decide after seeing for myself, Surajbehn must vacate the building.
 Read Kishorelal’s letter. I was surprised about Swami too. It certainly does not become one who claims to be a satyagrahi to show disrespect to a man or woman simply because he or she did not go to jail. That is why I have given so much time to this matter. Please guide me now.
 Ghanshyamdas and I have had discussion, not exhaustive but enough for our purpose. We have had a full discussion about the Ashram. The draft will be dispatched tomorrow.

         MY 	DEAR CHILD,   LETTER TO ESTHER MENON   September 	6, 1934 
  	I held up your letter all these days in the hope of being able to 	send the answer myself. But I must deny myself that pleasure and 	dictate this letter if I am to overtake the arrears.  	If proof were needed God is proving for me His greatness and 	goodness every day. You remember the hymn “Count your many 	blessings”. I think it is in Moody and Sankey’s Hymn Book. I 	can’t even count the blessings, they are so many. For even the 	so-called sorrows and pains He sends descend like blessings. If we 	knew His love, we should know that He has nothing but blessings—and 	never curses—for His creation. 
 I hope Tangai is quite free and both the children are flourishing. You must have now received the spinning-wheel. I hope that Menon is well-settled.
 I am flourishing. My weight has gone up from 94 to 101 lb. I am going through a fair amount of work and taking regular exercise.
 Mira is doing good work in London. She expects to be back in October. Andrews was here for over a week and he has now gone to Simla. He will come once more to Wardha before sailing, most probably on the 6th October, for London. He was looking quite well. He has brought a Welsh blacksmith with him from South Africa. Mr. Jones, that is his name, has recently joined the Oxford movement and considers himself a changed man. We all liked him very much. When Andrews goes to England, he will go back to South Africa.
 Pyarelal and Mahadev are here. Ba has gone with Ramdas to Sabarmati where Ramdas is to have rest and cure for his ailment. Devdas was here for a few days. He left yesterday for Bombay. He is likely to come back for the Working Committee meeting on the 8th. This, you will admit, is a fair family budget of news. You must write more regularly than you have hitherto done. I don’t expect to move from Wardha yet for some time.
With love to you all,

  LETTER TO SURESH CHANDRA BANERJI 
 September 6, 1934
 MY DEAR SURESH,
 I have your letter. I was not able to reply to it earlier. I had a chat with Birlaji. He is aggreeable to your spending from Rs. 2,000 to 3,000 on land and buildings, provided of course that they remain his property. But you will be at liberty to inhabit the house free of rent or any other charge so long as your health needs such residence. He does not intend to make private use of such property. He will give it for a charitable purpose, most probably for a Harijan hostel. But that is a thing with which neither you nor I are concerned. I think that then you won’t need Rs. 200, but only Rs. 60 per month. Observe too that from October to December you will need not Rs. 200 but ranging from Rs. 125 to 150. You will let me know in time what you would require. And I hope that you will make steady improvement. You must not encourage the thought that the disease is incurable and that you have got to leave within a year or two.

 DEAR BHASKAR,
 I thank you for your letter and whole statement of the work done by the Corporation. I understand clearly now what you meant when you said that the Corporation had no authority. The statement does not show that the Corporation has done anything heroic. Let us, however, hope that this year will show a marked improvement in the treatment of these the most neglected and yet the most deserving of the citizens of Calcutta.libtech_588_footnote

 MY DEAR SHANKERLAL,
 I have the copy of Satisbabu’s letter to you regarding Hussanali who has been recommended by the Maulana for khadi propaganda. I share Satisbabu’s fear, but I think that Hussanali should be taken on three month’s trial. But the ultimate decision, I should leave to you and Satisbabu.

  VILLAGE TANNING AND ITS POSSIBILITIES 
 Village tanning is as ancient as India itself. No one can say when tanning became a degraded calling. It could not have been so in ancient times. But we know today that one of the most useful and indispensable industries has consigned probably a million people to hereditary untouchability. An evil day dawned upon this unhappy country when labour began to be despised and, therefore, neglected. Millions of those who were the salt of the earth, on whose industry this country depended for its very existence, came to be regarded as low class and the microscopic leisured few became the privileged classes, with the tragic result that India suffered morally and materially. Which was the greater of the two losses it is difficult, if not impossible, to estimate. But the criminal neglect of the peasants and the artisans has reduced us to pauperism, dulness and habitual idleness. With her magnificent climate, lofty mountains, mighty rivers and an extensive seaboard, India has limitless resources, whose full exploitation in her village should have prevented poverty and disease. But the divorce of the intellect from body-labour has made of us perhaps the shortest- lived, most resourceless and most exploited nation on earth. The state of village tanning is, perhaps, the best proof of my indictment. It was the late Madhusudan Das who opened my eyes to the great crime against a part of humanity. He sought to make reparation by opening what might be called an educational tannery. His enterprise did not come up to his expectations, but he was responsible for the livelihood of hundreds of shoemakers in Cuttack.
 It is estimated that rupees nine crores worth of raw hide is annually exported from India and that much of it is returned to her in the shape of manufactured articles. This means not only a material but also an intellectual drain. We miss the training we should receive in tanning and preparing the innumerable articles of leather we need for daily use.
 Tanning requires great technical skill. An army of chemists can find scope for their inventive talent in this great industry. There are two ways of developing it. One for the uplift of Harijans living in the villages and eking out a bare sustenance, living in filth  and degradation and consigned to the village ghetto, isolated and away from the village proper. This way means in part re-organization of villages and taking art, education, cleanliness, prosperity and dignity to them. This means also the application of chemical talent to village
 uplift. Tanning chemists have to discover improved methods of tanning. The village chemist has to stoop to conquer. He has to learn and understand the crude village tanning, which is still in existence but which is fast dying owing to neglect, not to say want of support. But the crude method may not be summarily scrapped, at least not before a sympathetic examination. It has served well for centuries. It could not have done so, if it had no merit. The only research I know in this direction is being carried on in Santiniketan, and then it was started at the now defunct Ashram at Sabarmati. I have not been able to keep myself in touch with the progress of the experiment at Santiniketan. There is every prospect of its revival at the Harijan Ashram, which the Sabarmati Ashram has now become. These experiments are  mere drops in the ocean of possible research.
 Cow-preservation is an article of faith in Hinduism. No Harijan worth his salt will kill cattle for good.  But, having become untouchable, he has learnt the evil habit of eating carrion. He will not kill a cow but will eat with the greatest relish the flesh of a dead cow. It may be physiologically harmless. But psychologically there is nothing, perhaps, so repulsive as carrioneating. And yet, when a dead cow is brought to a Harijan tanner’s house, it is a day of rejoicing for the whole household. Children dance round the carcass, and as the animal is flayed, they take hold of bones or pieces of flesh and throw them at one another. As a tanner, who is living at the Harijan Ashram, describing the scenes at his own now forsaken home, tells me, the whole family is drunk with joy at the sight of the dead animal. I know how hard I have found it working among Harijans to wean them from the soul-destroying habit of eating carrion. Reformed tanning means the automatic disappearance of carrion-eating.
 Well, here is the use for high intelligence and the art  of  dissection. Here is also a mighty step in the direction of cow- preservation. The cow must die at the hands of the butcher, unless we learn the art of increasing her capacity of milk-giving, unless we improve her stock and make her male progeny more useful for the field and carrying burdens, unless we make scientific use of all her excreta as manure and unless, when she and hers die, we are prepared to make the wisest use of her hide, bone, flesh, entrails, etc.
 I am just now concerned only with the carcass. It is well to remember here that the village tanner, thank God, has to deal only with the carcass, not the slaughtered animal. He has no means of
 bringing the dead animal in a decent way. He lifts it, drags it, and this injures the skin and reduces the value of the hide. If the villagers and the public knew the priceless and noble service the tanner renders, they will provide easy and simple methods of carrying it, so as not to injure the skin at all.
 The next process is flaying the animal. This requires great skill. I am told that none, not even surgeons, do this work better or more expeditiously than the village tanner does with his village knife. I have inquired of those who should know. They have not been able to show me an improvement upon the village tanner. This is not to say that there is none better. I merely give the reader the benefit of my own very limited experience. The village tanner has no use for the bone. He throws it away. Dogs hover round the carcass, whilst it is flayed, and take away some, if not all, of the bones. This is a dead loss to the country. The bones, if powdered fine, apart from their other uses, make valuable manure. What remains after the dogs have taken away their share is transported to foreign countries and returns to us in the shape of handles, buttons, etc.
 The second way is urbanizing this great industry. There are several tanneries in India doing this work. Their examination  is  outside the scope of this article. This urbanization can do little good to the Harijans, much less to the villages. It is a process of double drain from the villages. Urbanization in India is slow but sure death for her villages and villagers. Urbanization can never support ninety per cent of India’s population, which is living in  her  7,00,000  villages. To remove from these villages tanning and such other industries is to remove what little opportunity there still is for making skilled use of the hand and the head. And when the village handicrafts disappear, the villagers working only with their cattle on the field, with idleness for six or four months in the year, must, in the words of Madhusudan Das, be reduced to the level of the beast and be without proper nourishment, either of the mind or the body, and, therefore, without joy and without hope.
 Here is work for the cent-per-cent swadeshi-lover and scope for the harnessing of technical skill to the solution of a great problem. The work fells three apples with one throw. It serves the Harijans, it serves the villagers and it means honourable employment for the
 middle-class intelligentsia who are in search of employment. Add to this the fact that the intelligentsia have a  proper  opportunity  of coming in direct touch with the villagers.

  LETTER TO NURGISBEHN CAPTAIN 
 September 7, 1934
 I have been withholding replies to your letters and Khurshed’s as you had expected none from me and as I had wanted to save as much time and energy as I possibly could. But your last letter  demands an answer. I must not postpone it for writing the  reply myself.
 I see no objection to your using swadeshi yarn for embroidery so long as we cannot procure a hand-spun yarn suitable  for embroidery work. My justification for this latitude is this: embroidery is no part of original khadi; but embroidery is simply superadded even as we use sewing thread for preparing clothes, or use  even foreign dyes in order to enhance the salability of khadi.
 I am glad Khurshed is looking better. When are you proposing to do likewise? Khan Brothers are here and I am having a glorious time with them. I am having quiet discussions with them twice daily for about two hours. They are both free and penetrative.
 You will be presently seeing another startling announcement from me. Don’t you be anxious or inquisitive. It is better not to hawk about the proposed decision so that I can safely make the announ- cement. There is nothing that I can possibly have to withhold from you, but I do not want to write anything about it.
 Love to you all. I suppose I must not expect any letter from Jamnabehn.

 DEAR SATISBABU,
 I have your several letters as also the ink-bottle. I must report to you on the ink later on. Did you prepare it specially for me, or did you prepare it for the general market ?
 What about Kshitishbabu’s experiment in dried milk? I wonder if he has received my letterlibtech_592_footnotesent through you. So far as I am aware he has been silent.
 Have you yet got charge of the Harijan office? You have asked me for suggestions about welfare scheme for Bengal Harijans. I can’t think of anything special. You must, therefore, refer to Harijan for whatever I had said, and adopt with necessary modifications whatever you may find to be suitable there. Of course your problem  is somewhat different from the problem elsewhere. You will carefuly study the articlelibtech_593_footnoteI have sent to Harijan  on tanning.
 Are you making progress with your “Guide for Village Workers” on treatment of simple diseases and accidents?
 In Onward I see an advertisement on strawboards manufactured by Kuver Board Limited, Mill Department, 84 Clive Street, Calcutta. The advertisement says it is manufactured through Indian capital, Indian labour and Indian material. What are these strawboards? Are they of any use for Yeravda Charkha ?

 CHI. PURATAN,
 
 I got your letter. If you were not cheated when you parted with the hundred rupees, what else could it be? If you were not cheated, what mistake did you acknowledge? As for myself, I believe that you have been cheated. Would a poor man give away a hundred rupees for the sake of a joke? I am afraid, I have no hope that you will either get the Rs. 100 or the money for the bill. If this does not happen again, let us take it as an easy atonement.
 Have we to debit the money which Parikshitlal gave for his  board to the Charkha Sangh? We cannot debit it to the Harijan Fund. Have you taken the right amount of rent for their lodging? What is the rate of rent?
 Tell Parikshitlal that I have written a letter to a palace official at Lakhtar. Let us see what happens.
Are you keeping fit?

I have your letter. You must have got mine.
 I have purposely and after due thought sent Ramdas [to the Ashram]. The result lies in God’s hands. Surendra is engrossed in doing his duty there. How could I call him away? Ramdas’s illness is more mental than physical. According to me, the good company that he will get there will itself help like medicine.
 Give only such help as you easily can without going out of your way. I have not created new work for you in this.
 You may go to the Ashram when you are completely free. I am trying to send you the letter which you require. Why should you feel afraid of Thakkar Bapa? All of us have some idiosyncracies and we should tolerate one another’s. I am sure you will be able to manage. And in the last resort I am always there.

 The matter of. . .’slibtech_599_footnotesecond marriage is being discussed. The future alone can show what the ultimate outcome will be and, whether or not he will get my blessings as well as his elders’.

For years she will not be able to lead conjugal life, so she wishes to take up a life of service. If he marries again there is a talk of satisfactory maintenance for her by . . . and his father. . . . feels the need for a wife. I believe it  is  in conformity with dharma to enable him to lead a restrained married life with a suitable wife. And he should be able to get the blessings of all pious men and women.

 September 8, 1934
  	I have been regularly getting your letters and also reports about 	your health. You seem to enjoy God’s kindness in full measure, for 	the wound is healing more quickly than the doctors had expected. Do 	not be in the slightest hurry to leave. Leave only after the wound 	has healed completely. I like your idea of going to Sinhgad. There 	you will also get Mehta’s help whenever needed. The climate is 	certainly very good. The water is very light. The place, therefore, 	will do you much good. Nor is it very far.  	Do not talk much. Even when necessary, talk in a low voice and not 	with a full voice. The effort to speak has always some effect on the 	ear.  	Avoid rice and dal. I am sure that will do you much good. Rely more 	on milk. Curds should not be even slightly  sour.  Go  on gradually 	increasing exercise as much as the doctors permit from time to time. 	Do not worry about anything. If you follow this regimen, it will not 	only be good for the ear but will also refresh the brain.  	Malaviyaji came today. He is accompanied by Radhakant. Ali and 	Khaliq [uz-Zaman] also have come. The others will come tomorrow.  	Khanbhai is very happy. He is with me every morning when I go for a 	walk and also from 4-5 in the evening. We discuss the problems at 	leisure one by one.  	You must have heard Pagali’s story regarding myself. I do not want 	to bother you with it now. You may offer your criticism later when 	you are completely all right. I think you will approve of 	everything.  	Om stays with me all the time and helps as and when required. Four 	or rather five girls are doing the work which could be done by one 	or two girls. Each, therefore, gets very little to do. As you know, 	Prabhavati will not let the other girls do much. Moreover Madalasa 	also comes to claim her share.  	Radhakisan keeps worrying so much because of your instructions that, 	though he keeps careful watch over me, he is always    
 afraid lest he may be blamed. I do get up very early. I do not need more sleep and I feel light during the day if I have finished my work in the morning. Now the weight will increase slowly. The quantity of food cannot be increased, so what I eat now will increase the weight slowly. I think that is better. Strength is growing steadily. I take a short nap during daytime and am in bed at 8.45 p.m., or at the latest by 9 p.m. Thus nobody can blame me for not taking enough care of my health. I shall be here till you come and even after that. I shall not go anywhere unless there is some reason.
 Andrews is returning on Sunday. Kumarappa  has  taken  20 days’ leave. I will send him back as soon as the period is over. He will arrive here on Tuesday.
 The girls seem to be progressing quite well. Vinoba himself supervises everything. I therefore, don’t have to interfere with anything.

          CHI. 	NARANDAS,   LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI   September 	8, 1934 
 I 	have your letter of the 6th.  	I have asked Narahari to inquire into the facts regarding the dairy 	and let me have his opinion. I will not forget about this matter.  	I am still not able to take sufficient rest. I have again started 	getting up at 2.30. The bed itself pushes me out and I welcome that. 	It is 3.30 just now. I have started writing this after finishing one 	to Jamnalal.  	I can’t think what to do regarding Chimanlal and Sharda. One thing 	is clear to me. Sharda’s living with Chimanlal may not be for 
 her good. If her devotion to her father has become her sole passion, she may, though ill herself, sacrifice her health in nursing Chimanlal. We come across many such instances in Europe. I don’t remember to have seen any among us. But the education which we give is certainly likely to produce girls of this type. Such idealism endures only if it grows spontaneously. If Sharda does not possess this spirit, she should have regard for her health and leave Chimanlal. She may come and live here. There are other girls of her age here, and among them there are ten Gujarati girls even, including Vali. The climate also is excellent. I, too, shall be here for some time. In any case my headquaters will continue to be here. There are good arrangements for study, too. It is desirable that one who is ill should not nurse another sick person. Shakaribehn should undertake to look after Chimanlal. The latter should stop eating solid food and live only on milk and fruit. A pure milk-diet has been found to have beneficial effect, but I think such an experiment is too drastic. A mixed diet of milk and fruit is found best. Even if such a diet brings on weakness, I would advise Chimanlal not to mind it but persevere in the experiment patiently. Sharma is at Sabarmati now. He has renounced everything in order to live with Ramdas. That is why he has taken Ramdas with him and gone to Sabarmati. Ba has gone there to look after Ramdas. You may, if you wish, consult Sharma [regarding Chimanlal]; I have had experience of his goodness. I cannot say, though, anything regarding his competence as a doctor. All the same, there can be no harm in consulting him. Milk and fruit, however, are both food and medicine. Anybody who is not benefited by them is hardly likely to be benefited by anything else. Water and sun treatments also should go on at the same time. The chief thing in my advice is the suggestion regarding Sharda. Both of you should please think over it.
 My personal needs are being looked after by Prabhavati, Amtussalaam, Vasumati and Om. Amala also does some work. But I am really afraid that she will go off her head one day. She is hardly in her senses. She is growing thinner everyday. And now she has become impatient to marry. I observe that she is not free from passion. In consequence of her trying to suppress it, it  has  become uncontrollable. She hopes to be mother of twelve children. She is 37 at present. Let us see what she does. I don’t have the courage now to send her to you or somewhere else. She is trying to get a job in some college. I don’t mind if she succeeds by her own efforts. But I don’t intend to recommend her to anybody. I don’t worry, but the fact
 
 remains that the responsibility of looking after her has become more difficult.

 DEAR SATISBABU,
 You have given a dismal picture. But it does not disturb me. The atmosphere will undoubtedly clear up presently. You will have seen my counter-statementlibtech_602_footnoteabout retiring from the Congress. Discussions are going on. So far as I am concerned, I am most anxious to leave the Congress and serve it from being out of it. I have drawn up a statement which I propose to discuss with the Working Committee. You will know the result in due time. The thing that is deeper than the corruption is the
 fundamental differences between many Congreesmen and myself. But let me not anticipate. Let the constructive workers go on with their work.
 Constructive workers must not touch any newspaper enterprise, and certainly not at this time. Nor do I agree with you that a paper with balanced views is required at this time. An outspoken paper in the face of the Press laws is an impossibility unless it eschews politics altogether. But that is not what you mean. You want something to counterbalance the poisons. That means having to deal with politics also.
 How much ink have you prepared? What is the use  of distributing things gratis unless it is for advertisement?

 I have not been able to answer your enquiry earlier. Gandhi Seva Sangh is just now undergoing a thorough overhauling and is about to adopt some drastic changes. The allowances made hitherto had been on a liberal scale. But it is being redically revised. And then if these changes are to come into force, Jamnalalji is not taking any part in it. He is still undergoing treatment in Bombay and would not be able to attend to regular work before a few months perhaps. He has got to take rest in a quiet place before he resumes normal activity.

  LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI 
 September 11, 1934
 CHI. NARANDAS,
I got your letter.
 I knew that the important letter which I wortelibtech_606_footnotelibtech_607_footnoteto  you   would certainly put you in difficulty. I think what I expected you to do was unreasonable. I was plainly guilty of violence. But I thought it would be a great trouble to re-write such a long letter, and this desire to spare myself increased the magnitude of my violence. God  knows  how many times I must be committing such violence everyday. The path of renunciation of work was discovered to save us from such dangers. But only one person out of ten million can follow it. Can a person who does nothing outwardly but whose mind is always busy be regarded as observing non-violence? For us, therefore, the only course is to go on working and committing errors and to strive all the time to remain inactive inwardly and reduce the number of our errors from day to day.
 I have wired to Kanu and told him that he may come, so that his days may not be wasted. It seems my letters take four days to reach you.
 I am sending to you a letter which I have received from the Superintendent at Dhulia. It will be sent by book post. I have just given it to Vinoba to read.
 I have still not received Mathuradas’s reply. Lilavati may certainly come here in the vacation. I know her very well. Her unsteadiness is incurable.
 The women are doing well as teachers. Even if only 50 per cent of them became permanent here, the Bal Mandir will run well.
 . . .libtech_608_footnotehad started indulging his passion as early as the time when he was at Sabarmati. And he had no scruples in telling lies either. He has now written a letter of repentance to Balkrishna and asked what he should do for atonement.
 Amala’s case is different. As she has got a job in Santiniketan for teaching French, she is quite cheerful these days. She will go in a few days. She is only waiting for the final reply.
 
 I shall be able to decide about the dairy at Sabarmati only after Narahari has gone there.
 Sumitra has trouble in one of her eyes, and so Ba is accompanying her to Bombay today for treatment.

CHI. MATHURADAS,
 You have completed 40 years. Does it not mean that out of the 100 years 40 years are gone? If we reckon the years in this way, we can also say that as time passes our span of life becomes shorter. Live your remaining 60 years as you did your 40 and add to the sum of your achievements so far.
 You must not imagine that I have time to indulge in unnecessary talk with Nariman or anyone else. My time is as occupied as you have so far known it to be. God is sustaining me.
 Who can send you letters now? Mahadev is wholly tied up. So is Pyarelal. Nor does Prithuraj find time in the midst of his work. That leaves the young women. Your hunger should be satisfied. Let me see.
 You have not sent me your book on karmayoga. But I chanced upon it. I read it every day in the library. I shall finish it in a few days.   I like the work. You have tried to say a lot in a few pages. This will make it difficult for the uninformed. The binding is bad. What is the demand it has elicited?

  LETTER TO BRIJKRISHNA CHANDIWALA 
 September 11, 1934
 CHI. BRIJKRISHNA,
 I have your letter. The last two letters received from Damodardas have been sent on to you. I find something  quite different in them. He says there is some misunderstanding on your part. Or is it mine? You yourself must write to Damodardas, and me, too, what precisely you told me. This, now, cuts the ground away from under any charge against Keshu, Santok and Radha. The words you quoted from the letter of Damodardas also are rendered insignificant. You remember, do you not? I am nervous. I am behaving contrary to my nature. How can I remain at peace while I harbour the least doubt about Santok and others? And how can I disbelieve what you have told me? I have no knowledge at all as to when I shall go to Bombay. Possibly I may go in October during the Congress session. And there will be no time then for talking to Damodardas.
 I hope you are keeping well there and there has been no recurrence of fever.
 If you have money enough to send to Radha, why can you not send to me? On the one hand your brothers are under debt, it is not known if the house ever will be saved or not, yet you are capable of shouldering the burden of Radha’s expenses! Don’t you know that Radha is provided for? There has never been any trouble in meeting her expenses. You may certainly help me if you wish to. Are you asking for my permission to send money to Radha over and above her present allowance? If so, why?

  	It is just 3 a.m. This is the first letter I take up after mouth 	wash. My whole heart goes out to you all. Who am I to judge your 	delicate and domestic affairs? You have granted me the unique 	privilege of knowing your secrets. I may not abuse it. I do not know 	the implications of the actualities as they happen. But this mute 	warfare must cease, if you and Raihana are to have peace. If I were 	you, I would either let her have her way ungrudgingly and joyously 	or give her a separate house and maintenance and let her have her 	way. She is too much of an invalid to be left to her own resources. 	I should not bother about Hamida, she is no freak like Raihana. 	Raihana has no marriage in store for her. So far as I am aware she 	is a stranger to the sensuous passion. I wish I could give you a 	cheery letter, but I cannot.

  	In continuation of my letter to you regarding your complaint about 	the Sholapur Dispensary, I have now a letter from the Secretary of 	the Harijan Sevak Sangh, Maharashtra Board, from which I find that 	the grant was being voted and was given only after Thakkar Bapa had 	inspected everything and satisfied himself about it. In the 	circumstances the only thing that I can say to you is that if you 	are not satisfied with this recommendation, you have to write to the 	President of the Central Board at Delhi. As you may know, I have no 	official status in the Sangh. My connection therefore is purely 	moral. It is only on rare occasions that I tender my advice to the 	Board. In this connection I don’t feel called upon to do anything 	beyond what I have done.  Yours 	sincerely,  DR. 	B. V. MULAY, 	M.S. 	SHOLAPUR  From 	a copy: Pyarelal Papers.

  LETTER TO B. J. MARATHEY

  	I have your prompt letter in reply to minelibtech_620_footnotelibtech_621_footnoteof 	6th instant. I have now written a suitable letterlibtech_622_footnotelibtech_623_footnoteto 	Dr. Mulay.  From 	a copy: Pyarelal Papers. Courtesy: Pyarelal     LETTER TO SAUDAMINI MEHTA   September 	12, 1934  CHI. 	SAUDAMINI, I 	got your letter.  	I agree with you that if I knew as much about. . .’slibtech_624_footnotecase as I do about. . .’s, my opinion would perhaps 	soften. I made the remarks in question when I read. . .’s defence 	and . . .’s outpouring of her grief. However, if I became more 	intimate with all the persons involved, I would perhaps have a 	better understanding of their points of view. The conclusion to be 	drawn from this is that before criticizing anybody’s action one 	must go deep into the matter. Since this is not easy to do, the 	golden rule is not to criticize anybody. I know how to follow this 	rule and rarely criticize people, though it is true of course that I 	occasionally pass hasty criticism on persons with whom I am 	connected in some way. I am still not free from that measure of 	attachment. Such subtle attachments cannot be overcome by an act of 	will. They weaken gradually through prolonged effort.  	Let me give you some more information about . . .’s case. Even 	today all his elders except. . .are against his marrying again. If I 	had not supported his intention, the idea of second marriage would 	have been abandoned. I came to know. . .first. The moment I saw her, 	I felt that a girl like her was unfit for conjugal life and that she 	would never be able to satisfy . . . sexually. Before I came to know 	her and take interest in her life, she used to tremble in. . .’s 	presence, talked with none and always wore an unhappy look. Now she 	talks frankly with everybody and can even joke. She expresses her 	views quite freely. She and. . .gave me their letters to each other 	to read. The sole cause      
 of her worry is the fact that . . .has not taken another wife. As long as he has not done so, she does not feel herself safe in her relations with him and with their elders. Other members of the family keep taunting her for her inability to satisfy. She, on her part, being a loving girl,
 keeps thinking about her inability and feels miserable. I doubt if you have come across any other instance like hers. Being a  woman  yourself, you can certainly claim to know a woman’s heart better than  I do. But as against that I can claim many years’ longer experience than yours. Though a man, I have been striving for many years to reach women’s heart, cultivating and preserving complete passionl- essness. As a result, I have had intimate knowledge of the lives of hundreds of women of every class and religion and of different countries of the world. I know of several instances in which women urged their husbands to marry again. This is not a peculiarity of Hindu women. You will perhaps be surprised to know that such instances are to be found in England also.
 I have a motive in writing such a long letter to you even under all this pressure of work. I am pleased that you have taken interest in this matter.       had been after me. She also had expressed her pain. I
 have promised her that I would welcome a deputation of women headed by her and put this case before them. For me this is an issue of dharma. It is one of my experiments in truth. I feel no shame about what I am doing. I am not taking interest in this case because of the bond of friendship. This is part of my service of women. I think of. .
 .as a helpless cow. I should like to protect her as much as I can. I want the help of you women in that task. That is, if in the name of dharma I am in fact yielding to self-delusion of any kind and  following  a course contrary to dharma, please wake me up and save me. If, therefore, you can keep up  your interest in  this case, meet.     and
 discuss the matter with her and then three or four of you may come and see me. I will put my case before you and listen to what you have to   say.   I  am   not  concerned  with  what  happens  to.   .  .  or        as
 individuals. Such cases will always arise. Ill-matched unions are no rarity in this country. I have told.    that when her body has developed
 and grown to the size natural for her age and if she feels sexual desire then and wishes to remarry, I will be ready to help her at any cost to myself. If, however, despite. . .having married a second time  she prefers to live with him and if.    is inclined to agree to that, I shall be
 helpless      ’s father would of course desire that she should share his
bed even though he might have another wife. My effort is to save both
 of them from such a position. This is a very complicated case. In solving it I shall be solving many problems. I, therefore, do not mind giving my time to it.
 I don’t know if I am imposing an unwelcome burden on you through this letter. If you do not wish to go so deep into the matter, you need not reply to it. Please consider the letter to have been written by me more for my satisfaction than for yours. I seem to feel that I know my dharma, but I am always liable to err in my reasoning. I, therefore, cling to any person who points out my error. This has saved me from many errors.

 recovered. The passport also will take some time. It will be in my hands at the earliest on the 23rd. You will get a boat ten days after that. That is quite a long time by our reckoning. By that time you will have perhaps completely recovered. This fever may eventually remove all the poison from your body. I do not worry as Ba is also there.

But I hear that the application is only a formality and release will be granted for certain. If this is correct and you are so inclined, you may apply. But under no condition should the application be sent up if there is the slightest doubt about its acceptance.

  MORE ON SWADESHI 
 I would like to resume the thread of my remarks on swadeshi in the     Harijan   of   10th   August.libtech_632_footnoteTake   the   special   occupations   of Harijans. There is a meaning behind the over two thousand Harijan castes. Most of them denote their respective occupations—basket- making, broom-making, rope-weaving, durri-weaving, etc. If a complete list was made of them, they would make an imposing list. They are occupations which either need encouragement, or should be deliberately destroyed if they are useless or unprofitable. But who is to decide whether they are profitable or unprofitable, useless or otherwise? If there was a true swadeshi organization, if would be its duty to find out the turth about all these innumerable handicrafts and interest themselves in these craftsmen. The ink with which I am writing comes from Tenali. It supports about 12 workers. It is making headway against odds. I had three more specimens sent to me by different makers, all no doubt struggling like the Tenali group. They interested me. I entered into correspondence with them. But I could do no more for them. A swadeshi organization will examine the samples of these inks in a scientific manner and guide them and encouage the most promising ones. It is a good and growing industry, requiring expert chemical knowledge.
 
 In Cawnpore, a man sent me samples of the paper his friend was manufacturing in a village nearby. I enquired into the concern. It supports about nine men. The paper was stout and glossy. However, it was not good enough for writing. Men engaged in the manufacture are eking out the barest livelihood. The skill is supplied by an old man nearing the crematorium. The whole concern may perish with him, if it is not properly guided. I was told that, if there were enough orders, the paper could be supplied at the same cost as the mill–made article. I know that hand-made paper can never supply the daily growing demand for paper. But lovers of the seven hundred thousand villages and their handicrafts will always want to use hand-made paper, if it is easily procurable. Those who use hand-made paper know that it has a charm of its own. Who does not know the famous Ahmedabad paper? What mill-made paper can beat it in durability or polish!
 The account books of the old style are still made of that paper. But it is probably a perishing industry like many such others. With a little encouragement, it ought never to perish. If there was supervision, the processes might be improved and the defects that are to be noticed with some of this hand-made paper may be easily removed. The economic condition of the numberless people engaged in these little known trades is well worth investigating. They will surely allow themselves to be guided and advised and feel thankful to those who would take interest in them.
 I hope I have given enough illustrations to show how vastlibtech_633_footnoteand uncultivated this field of true swadeshi is. It is capable of limitless expansion and of producing, without any capital outlay, new wealth in the country and providing honourable employment to those who are today starving for want of it.

  WHY NOT ‘HARIJAN’ ? 
 TO
 THE EDITOR, “HARIJAN”
 SIR,
 I was rather pained to find that the keen intellect of Mr. Mahadev Desai missed the real point involved in the representation made by “some friends who met Gandhiji claiming to be representatives of the Harijans or rather ‘Depressed Classes’ as they preferred to call them” (See Harijan of August 10, ’34, p. 206, col. 2).libtech_634_footnoteThe “bad odour” attaching to the term ‘Depressed Classes’ is a surety of its ultimate extinction and complete disappearance along with the development of consciousness amongst these classes leading to the unification and consequent solidification of the general  Hindu community at large, which, we all know, is the aim of Gnadhiji in his great and unique endeavour. But the sweetness of the term “Harijan” is likely to perpetuate the gulf between them and the savarna Hindus, which is surely not desired by Gandhiji. This point should have been noticed by Mr. Mahadev Desai, whose use of the adjective ‘curious’ appears to be remarkable and at the same time regrettable, coming as it does from one of the closest associates of Gandhiji.
 I myself feel interested in the matter as one belonging to this great class, but feel indifferent to the appellation that others may choose to give, excepting, of course, the result it is likely to have on the future positon of the great community in the large Hindu fold.
 Will you kindly show this to Mr. Mahadev Desai?
 I am, etc. ,
 H. K. MULLICK Mahadev Desai has passed the foregoing to me. I know Sjt. Mullick, as I had the pleasure of meeting him in Calcutta during the recent visit. I can share his nervousness and his preference for an odious appellation so long as the stigma of untouchability persists. But I invite Sjt. Mullick to enter into the feeling of reformers who have no untouchability in them and who, therefore, have a horror of using an odious name for those whom they love and are eager to serve to the best of their ability. Add to this the fact that tens of thousands of untouchables do not like the words achhut, asprishya and the like and that they do like the word ‘Harijan’. The aim of us all is the
 
 same—total extinction of untouchability. When that happy day arrives, either the word ‘Harijan’ will disappear or we shall all be proud to be called Harijans—devotees of God—deserving to be so described, having been free of the virus of high and low.
 Harijan, 14-9-1934
 
  NOT ARGUMENT, BUT EXPERIENCE 
 For me non-violence, like Truth, is my eternal creed for every activity. That I often fail to act up to it in many activities in my dealings with the sub-human family proves my weakness; it cannot and does not affect the truth of the creed or my faith in it. I am but a weak aspirant ever failing, ever trying. My failures make me more vigilant than before and intensify my faith. I can see with the eye of faith that the observance of the twin doctrine of Truth and Non- violence has possibilities of which we have but a very inadequate conception. If these two should pervade the whole of our being, how much more in the purely religious war against untouchability? I, therefore, gladly share with Harijan workers the following extracts from an intimate letter received from an American friend  who discloses the working of his mind and declares his faith in  non- violence achieved, though, perhaps, not yet fully, after laborious  search:
 You may have gathered from my last conversation with you that I was turning from my faith in the principle of non-violence. I had been troubled by doubts concerning this principle, and that was why I wanted so much to talk with you. I think that was very foolish of me, for, it should be evident that great moral and spiritual truths can never have their validity established through arguments. They have to be tested in the fire of experience, which I have not done in my own life to any large extent. I am persuaded that it would require a much stricter discipline than I have yet known for me to prove by my own experience that non-violence is eternally true.
 But I am able to accept it as one of the great fundamentals of my faith by my observation of the fruits it has produced in the lives of others.  To  associate  intimately with such men as Rajendrababu is a privilege for which one may thank God. I have seen that he and several others whom I might mention, who have accepted the principle of non-violence in their own lives, have been able to purify themselves from all the greed, the lust, the self-seeking, the hatred, the fear which obsesses so many who have caught a vision of a glorious future but are obstructed by these
 
 enemies within the gates from fighting successfully with the enemy without. It is not what non-violence has done to those who oppose you that is to me significant, but what it has done for you and that very small minority who have in their hearts become non-violent. Sicne I believe this is a moral universe, it must follow, as night follows day, that such development of character can never arise out of experiments with falsehood, and, by the same token, I believe that Jesus is right, at least in the long run, when he says that “they who take the sword will perish by the sword”.
 . . .libtech_635_footnoteI am certain that the only virtue which you need to exercise for the ultimate success of your struggle is that of patience.
 . . . libtech_636_footnoteSo far as your own leadership in India is concerned, you did not develop your qualities of leadership in a day, nor were you born with tehse qualities. I consider that you are the product of a long discipline of supreme loyalty to truth as you saw it and that you have arrived at your present position through a long and arduous experience. While Europeans may be untrained in the exercise of non-violence, I do not think human nature is essentially different in Europe from that of India, and the only way they can learn non-violence is through practice. There are bound to be many failures, many heart-breaks, many defeats, as has been true and is still true in your case. But If it is truth, it can never be forsaken.

  ALMOST LIKE HARIJANS 
An Andhra graduate who has married a devadasi writes:
 I wanted to write to you long ago. But I was awfully shy. Thank God ! I am at last confiding my burden to you.
 I come from the devadasi community. My life was socially a torture. Gandhiji, do you think there is any other profession worse than that of the dancing girls in the universe? Is it not a blot on India that prostitution should personify in a community?
 Andhradesa, I think, is the heart of this evil. Hindu society here engages dancing girls—especially during marriages and festivals of the deity—to sing obscene songs accompanied by obscene gestures before the pious deity and sets a bad example before the newly-wed couple.
 The misery of a whole community consigned to a life of prostitution is great. Young men here are trying their best to root out this evil. But they badly need help and guidance. Won’t you kindly take up this matter as equally
 
 important and emergent as the Harijan movement? Please have this affair always in a corner of your heart and give it publicity. You have not only the Congress, but the whole public opinion at your back. What the Brothels Bill and the I.P.C. could not do I am confident that a word from your mouth would do.
 I am legally and religiously married to a girl of my own community and  I am a father of two daughters. My wife is as pious in my eyes as any other Hindu wife. Still society looks down upon us. The sins of our ancestors and wreaking vengeance on us. The stigma of prostitution is attached to us, though both of us are free from the vice.
 Harijans and devadasis are the only two communities which are almost in the same degree of depravity. Of course, they will have to help themselves to moral elevation. Still a teacher like you would educate them and the society more quickly than they can do it for themselves. These are two sister movements. Please don’t forget the sister community in you enthusiasm for the Harijans.
I wish I had the ability he ascribes to me. I am painfully
 conscious of my limitations. The correspondent is perhaps unaware that, when I was editing Young India, I used constantly to refer to the devadasi institution and prostitution in general.libtech_637_footnoteBut my effort did not root out the evil. It would only bring relief in individual cases. If I now refer to the question in the pages of Harijan, it is not because I have any hope of faring better than I did during the Young India days. I shall be pleased if this fresh effort brings relief in individual cases.
 The correspondent is quite right in likening devadasis to Harijans. Nevertheless, he will recognize the difference there is between the two. But it is waste of time to measure the degree of difference in wretchedness. Like untouchability, this institution for the perpetuation of vice must go, if Hinduism is to be purified. Those who are engaged in the noble task of ridding society of the evil will have to work in a systematic manner and not become dispirited if they do not find their effort crowned with success at once. Let them concentrate on the evil immediately surrounding them. There are two ways of working at the problem. These should be work amongst those who employ devadasis for their base end and the devadasi community itself. If the latter will refuse to serve society’s vice, the system ends at
 
 
 once. But the process is not quite so simple. Hunger knows no sin. Even like Drona and Bhishma, devadasis point to their bellies in justification of sin. Habit has dulled their sense of sin regarding their calling. Therefore, they have to be found an innocent source of livelihood in the place of prostitution. Then, there is work in the society. Festival and marriage parties in which  devadasis  are employed have to be sought out and those in charge reasoned with. Reformers may not dictate reform to society. They will have to appeal to its reason and heart. In a way, all reform is a kind of education, just as essential as the education which is commonly known  as  such. Hence it is a science by itself and yields results only when systematically pursued.
 The correspondent who has dared to marry a devadasi deserves to be congratulated. He should be satisfied with the approbation of his own conscience and live down the prejudice against him and his wife.

 CHI. JAMNA,
 I got your letter. Equanimity of mind cannot be learnt from anybody. One can cultivate it by constantly keeping it before one’s mind when acting. Rather than overstrain yourself, you should spend some money in engaging a servant whom you can treat as a member of the family. You ought not to put any burden on Devbhabhi. I see some discontent regarding Santok. You should tell her about it and then suffer it. This, too, you can do by engaging a servant. It is part of the teaching of the Gita that one should endure what is inescapable.

  LETTER TO JAYAPRAKASH NARAYAN 
 September 14, 1934
 CHI. JAYAPRAKASH,
 I have your telegram. Prabhavati is going but not happily. She has decided that she will cheer you up and come away again soon. When your first telegram came I told her that she should go at once. But she did not agree and wrote to you. She waited a long time for your answer, but there was no answer to the very last moment. Then when your telegram to me arrived, I decided that it was my duty to persuade Prabha to go.
Prabha’s difficulty is that she made a promise to Mirabehn that
 
 she would do the work that Mirabehn did till the latter returned. Later Ba also went away after extracting another promise from Prabha—for she knew about your telegram. Prabha told Ba that she could go and promised her that she would not leave till Ba returned. Still, since the work consisted of serving me I told Prabha not to worry about me but go. She is a little troubled as she goes.
 Another thing is that you have both decided that Prabha should serve in the Kanya Ashram for five years. She should not get out of this. It is as well that she has not yet taken up this work. But how can she give it up?
 However, concerning all these matters I am neutral. I have no right to come between you two. I only regret that the education that Prabha has got from me does not have your entire approval. But that education cannot go waste. What she has assimilated is now part of her. You can now strike at her heart as many blows as you like. I have told Prabha not to pay any heed to my advice but to do as her heart and her reasoning dictate.
 I have your sweet and pure-hearted letter. Since I was hoping that you would be coming here I did not answer it. I am conscious of the regard and esteem in which you hold me. We shall talk when we meet.
 My commitment for paying you stands. I have made an arrangement about it with Ghanshyamdasji too. It was you who had raised the question of moral dilemma. It is you who must take a decision. We shall do as you say.
I hope you are in good health.

  LETTER TO G. V. MAVALANKAR 
 September 15, 1934
 BHAISHRI MAVALANKAR,
I have your letter.
 There is no connection between the Vidyapith library  and Kaka’s idea of leaving Gujarat. If the original Trustees had no right to hand over the library, its gift would remain illegal even if made at a meeting attended by all. If you think that the Trustees had a right to make the gift, I believe Sardar wishes to take no action regarding Kaka’s other error. Being one of the Trustees, he only wants to know what his duty is. I don’t think anything can be said about that. But personally I wouldn’t blame Kaka for this ignorance of law if it is such.
 The serious error committed by Kaka, may be unintentionally, was that, though he had not secured the consent of the Trustees, he allowed a sentence implying that it had been secured to stand in the letterlibtech_644_footnoteto the Collector. Kaka decided to atone for this carelessness by resigning from all the trusts. Sardar has had nothing to do with this.
 However, Kaka’s resignation only solved the moral problem and has no connection whatever with the question of whether or not he should remain in Gujarat. He has been waiting for a long time to run away from Gujarat. We need not go into the reasons for that. But the final decision whether he should leave or not rests with me. Sardar will have had no part in it. I will not let Kaka run away. He will leave only if I feel helpless. You and other co-workers, however, should have no worry or fear.
 You should merely give your professional opinion as a lawyer as to the legal loophole.

APPENDICES
 APPENDIX I
 RESOLUTION ON WHITE PAPER AND COMMUNAL AWARDlibtech_645_footnote
 The following is the authorized report of the Working Committee resolution on the policy of Congress regarding the White Paper proposals and the Communal Award:
 The Congress Parliamentary Board having asked the Working Committee to enunciate the Congress policy on the White Paper proposals and the Communal Award, the Working Committee declares the Congress policy on these matters as follows:
 The White Paper in no way expresses the will of the people of India, has been more or less condemned by almost all the Indian political parties, and falls far short of the Congress goal, if it does not retard the progress towards it. The only satisfactory alternative to the White Paper is a constitution drawn up by a Constituent Assembly, elected on the basis of adult suffrage or as near it as possible, with the power, if necessary, to the important minorities to have their representatives elected exclusively by the electors belonging to such minorities.
 The White Paper lapsing, the Communal Award must lapse automatically. Among other things it will be the duty of the Constituent Assembly to determine the method of representation of important minorities and make provisions for otherwise safeguarding their interests.
 Since, however, the different communities in the country are sharply divided on the question of the Communal Award, it is necessary to define the Congress attitude on it. The Congress claims to represent equally all the  communities composing the Indian Nation and, therefore, in view of division of opinion it can neither accept nor reject the Communal Award as long as the division of opinion lasts. At the same time it is necessary to redeclare the policy of the Congress on the Communal question.
 No solution that is not purely national can be propounded by the Congress. But the Congress is pledged to accept any solution falling short of the national, which is agreed to by all the parties concerned, and, conversely to reject and solution which is not agreed to by any of the said parties.
 
 16-6-1934, “Manifesto of Congress Parlimentary Board”, 29-7-1934 and “Letter to N. C. Kalkar”, 17-8-1934
 
 Judged by the national standard the Communal Award is wholly unsatisfactory besides being open to serious objection on other grounds.
 It is, however, obvious that the only way to prevent untoward consequences of the Communal Award is to explore the ways and means of arriving at an agreed solution and not by any appeal on this essentially domestic question to the British Government or any other outside authority.

               DEAR 	MAHATMAJI,   LETTER FROM N. C. KELKAR libtech_646_footnote  	“KESARI” 	OFFICE, 	POONA 2,  June 	22, 1934 
  The 	people in the Indian States desire to ascertain your individual 	opinion on certain matters affecting themselves, so that we may move 	the Congress to consider, in the light of your opinion, the 	desirability of defining its policy on certain questiions more 	precisely than at present and modifying it somewhat on certain 	others.  The 	first question that 	we would 	bring to your 	notice in 	this connection 	is the necessity 	of the 	Congress taking up 	for solution 	problems pertaining to 	the States. 	The Congress 	has now given 	up its 	traditional policy 	of “keeping 	itself unspotted” 	from the States. 	It recruits 	members in the 	States and 	brings them 	under the 	control of 	its district 	and provincial 	committees. The accession 	of strength 	that it has thus received 	from the States 	is by no means 	negligible; nor 	are these members 	sleeping partners 	in the Congress 	activities, although 	these activities 	 concern  mostly British 	India alone. On the 	other hand, even 	in such 	movements as 	civil disobedience, 	they have proved 	good comrades-in-arms 	and have cheerfully 	borne their 	share of the 	burden, realizing that 	British India and 	Indian India are 	essentially one and 	indivisible and 	that the concerns of 	one are necessarily 	the concerns 	of the 	other also.  We 	think that time has now arrived for the Congress to respond to this 	spirit of good comradeship exhibited by the States’ people by 	putting all its weight and prestige behind their efforts at 	self-emancipation. At the Madras (1927) and Calcutta (1928) sessions 	the Congress no doubt pleaded for the establishment of democratic 	swaraj in the Indian States and extended its sympathy to the 	inhabitants thereof. The Calcutta resolution is well worth quoting 	here is exteno.  
 The Congress urges no the ruling Princes of the Indian States to introduce responsible government based on representative institutions in the States, and to issue immediately proclamations or enact laws guaranteeing elementary and fundamental rights of citizenship, such as rights of association, free speech, free Press and security of person and property.
 This Congress further assures the people of the Indian states  of  its  sympathy with and support in their legitimate and peaceful struggle for the attainment of full responsible government in the States.
 We make no doubt that a similar resolution will be reiterated at the sessions that will be held hereafter. But may we not hope that the Congreesmen in British Indian will lend active help to the people in the Indian States in achieving political freedom even as the Congressmen in Indian India gave a measure of help to British Indians in their attempts to realize their destiny? Of the two, British Indians are much the more advanced, but in fact help has flown far more from the States’ people to British Indians than from British Indians to the States’ people. Do you not think it desirable to advise British Indians, in the name of the Congress to support actively, even by undergoing suffering if necessary, all legitimate movements for the establishment of popular government in the Indian States under the aegis of their rulers? Such comradeship shown on both sides, it appears to us, will cement the two Indians far more firmly than any formal federation can.
 Another question, of even greater urgency, on which the Congress must determine its policy is its attitude towards those parts of the White Paper scheme which relate to the Indian States. The authorities of the Congress have declared the scheme to be unacceptable because it does not satisfy the aspirations of the Indian people. May we say that the provisions concerning the States are far from acceptable to the States’ people and may we hope that the actual acceptance or otherwise of these provisions will be made to depend upon their wishes? The future constitution of India which, according to the Congress intentions, is to take the place of the White Paper constitution, will be based upon the principle of self-determination given effect to by  a Constituent Assembly. Is it implied that the federal scheme that will be evolved by this Assembly will be the result of an agreement between the people in British India on the one hand and those in the Indian States on the other?
 While on this subject it would be well to refer to the apprehensions that have arisen in the mind of the Indian States’ people by some passages in your speeches at the Round Table Conference. You pleaded earnestly in this Conference with the rulers of the Indian States for allowing the States representatives in the Federal Legislature to be chosen by election and for allowing the fundamental rights of the States’ people to be written into the federal constitution and placed under the protection of the Federal Court. But your pledings on this occasion have given rise
 
 to an impression that if the Princes did not agree, as they did not and they do not agree, you would accept a constitution in which provisions of the kind that you suggested did not find a place. If this impression is well-founded, we cannot help saying, and saying it straightout, that you have done a grave wrong to the States’ people. If you think that nomination by the Princes, for instance, must be acquiesced in, if necessary, in the existing circumstances, we will only beg you to refer the matter to the States’ people themselves in order to ascertain what their wishes are in this respect. The right of self-determination of the Indian States’ people is no less sacred than that of British Indians.
 But it has been explained to us that in expressing your views in favour of the election of the States’ representativs and the protection of the fundamental rights of the States’ people in the way you did, you wished it to be understood by the rulers of the States that if they did not agree to do what you urged upon them, you would not admit them into the federation. You meant these to be essential conditions of federation, but you did not express yourself in this categorical manner only because, at the time you spoke, federation was still shrouded in uncertainty. If this be your meaning, we would entreat you to make it clear beyond the possibility of doubt, for we know that the rulers of the States are putting a ditterent interpretation upon what you said. They are representing that you are ready to put up with nomination by the Princes, for instance, for an indefinite length of time. It is necessary that your meaning should be made plain, for the Swarajist Conference at Ranchi made it known that their party (which is now only a wing of the Congress) would follow the lines of your speeches in framing the future constitution. Since, in the final determination of the Congress policy on these points your personal views plays such a decisive part, we are anxious to know whether election of the States’ people and Declaration of Rights in their interest are, in your opinion, merely desirable features of a federation or essential conditions thereof. There are various other matters connected with the federal constitution which require careful consideration on the part of the Congress, but we do not wish to trouble you with them at the present moment. We would only beg you to give us an unequivocal statement of your views on the point raised in this letter.
 Yours sincerely,

 RESOLUTION ON SWADESHI libtech_647_footnote
 Doubts having arisen on the Congress policy in regard to swadeshi, it has become necessary to reaffirm the Congress position on it in unequivocal terms.
 Notwithstanding what was done during the civil resistance struggle, no competition is permissible on Congress platform and in Congress exhibitions between mill-made cloth and hand-spun and hand-woven khadi. Congressmen are expected to use and encourage the use of only hand-spun and hand-woven khadi, to the exclusion of any other cloth.
 In regard to articles other than cloth, the Working Committee adopts the following formula for the guidance of all Congress organizations:
 The Working Committee is of opinion that the activities of Congress organizations relating to swadeshi shall be restricted to useful articles manufactured in India through cottage and other small industries which are in need of popular education for their support, and which will accept the guidance of the Congress organizations in regulating prices and in the matter of the wages and welfare of labour under their control.
 This formula must not be interpreted to mean any modification of the unbroken policy of the Congress to promote the swadeshi spirit in the country and to encourage the personal use of only swadeshi articles. The formula is a recognition of the fact that the large and organized industries which can or do command State aid are in no need of the services of Congress organizations or any Congress effort in their behalf.

 LETTER FROM JAWAHARLAL  NEHRUlibtech_649_footnote
 ANAND  BHAWAN, ALLAHABAD,
 August 13, 1934
 MY DEAR BAPU,
 After just six months of absolute seclusion and little exercise I have felt rather lost in the anxiety, excitement and activity of the past 27 hours. I feel very tired. I am writing this letter to you at midnight. All day there have been crowds of people coming. If I have the chance I shall write to you again, but I doubt if I shall be able to do so for some months. I am, therefore, going to indicate to you briefly how I have reacted to the various major Congress decisions of the last five months or so. My sources of information have naturally been strictly limited but I think that they were sufficient to enable me to form a fairly correct idea of the general trend of events.
 When I heard that you had called off the C. D. movement I felt unhappy. Only the brief announcement reached me at first. Much later I read your statement and this gave me one of the biggest shocks I have ever had. I was prepared to reconcile myself to the withdrawal of C.D. But the reasons you gave for doing so and the suggestions you made for future work astounded me. I had a sudden and intense feeling, that something broke inside me, a bond that I had valued very greatly had snapped. I felt terribly lonely in this wide world. I have always felt a little lonely almost from childhood up. But a few bonds strengthened me, a few strong supports held me up. That loneliness never went, but it was lessened. But now I felt absolutely alone, left high and dry on a desert island.
 Human beings have an enormous capacity for adapting themselves and so I too adapted myself to some extent to the new conditions. The keenness of my feelings on the subject, which amounted almost to physical pain, passed off; the edge was dulled. But shock after shcok, a succession of events sharpened that edge to a fine point, and allowed my mind or feelings no peace or rest. Again I felt that sensation of spiritual isolation, of being a perfect stranger out of harmony, not only with the crowds that passed me, but also with those whom I had valued as dear and close comrades. My stay in prison this time became a greater ordeal for my nerves than any previous visit had been. I almost wished that all newspapers might be kept away from me so that I might be spared these repeated shocks.
 Physically I kept fairly well. I always do in prison. My body has served me
 
 well and can stand a great deal of ill-treatment and strain. And being vain enough to imagine that perhaps I might yet do some effective work in this land to which fate had tied me, I looked after it well.
 But I wondered often enough if I was not a square peg in a round hole, or a bubble of conceit thrown about hither and thither on an ocean which spurned me. But vanity and conceit triumphed and the intellectual apparatus that functions within me refused to admit defeat. If the ideals that had spurred me to action and had kept me buoyed up through stormy weather were right—and the conviction of their rightness ever grew within me—they were bound to triumph though my generation might not live to witness that triumph.
 But what had happened to those ideals during these long and weary months of this year when I was a silent and distant witness, fretting at my helplessness? Setbacks and temporary defeats are common enough in all great struggles. They grieve but one recovers soon enough. One recovers soon if the light of those ideals is not allowed to grow dim and the anchor of principles holds fast. But what I saw was not setback and defeat but that spiritual defeat which is the most terrible of all. Do not imagine that I am referring to the council-entry question. I do not attach vital importance to it. Under certain circumstances I can even imagine  entering  a legislature myself. But whether I function inside or outside the legislature I function as a revolutionary, meaning thereby a person working for the fundamental and revolutionary changes, political and social, for I am convinced that no other changes can bring peace or satisfaction to India and the world.
 So I thought. Not so evidently the leaders who were functioning outside. They began to talk the language of an age gone by before the heady wine of N. C. O. and C. D. had fired our heads. Sometimes they used the same words and phrases but they were dead words without life or real meaning. The leading figures of the Congress suddenly became those people who had obstructed us, held us back, kept aloof from the struggle and even co-operated with the opposite party in the time of our direct need. They became the high priests in our temple of freedom and many a brave soldier who had shouldered the burden in the heat and dust of the fray was not even allowed inside the temple precincts. He had many like him had become untouchables and unapproachables. And if he ventured to raise his voice and criticize the new high priests, he was shouted down and tol that he was a traitor to the cause because he spoilt the harmony of the sacred precincts.
 And so the flag of Indian freedom was entrusted with all pomp and circumstance to those who had actually hauled it down at the height of our national struggle at the bidding of the enemy; to those who had proclaimed from the house- tops that they had given up politics—for politics were unsafe then—but who emerged with a jump to the front ranks when politics became safe.
 And what of the ideals they set forth before them, speaking as they did on behalf of the Congress and the nation ? A pitiful hotch-potch, avoiding real issues, toning down, as far as they dared, even the political objective of the Congress, expressing a tender solicitude for every vested interest, bowing down to many a declared enemy of freedom, but showing great truculence and courage in facing the advanced and fighting elements in the Congress ranks. Is not the Congress being rapidly reduced to a magnified edition of that shameful spectacle, the Calcutta Corporation during the last few years ? Might not the dominant part of the Bengal Congress be called today ‘‘the society for the advancement of Mr. Nalini Ranjan Sirkar’’, a gentleman who rejoiced to entertain Government officials, Home Members and the like, when most of us were in prison and C. D. was supposed to be flourishing
 ? And the other part probably a similar society for a similar laudable object ? But the fault does not lie with Bengal alone. Almost everywhere there is a similar outlook. The Congress from top to bottom is a caucus and opportunism triumphs.
 The Working Committee is not directly responsible for this state of affairs. But none the less the Working Committee must shoulder the responsibility. It is the leaders and their policy that shape the activities of the followers. It is neither fair nor just to throw blame on the followers. Every language has some saying about the workman blaming his tools. The committee had deliberately encouraged vagueness in the definition of our ideals and objectives and this is bound to lead not only to confusion but to demoralization during periods of reaction, and to the emergence of the demagogue and the reactionary.
 I am referring especially to the political objectives which are the special province of the Congress. I feel that the time is overdue for the Congress to think clearly on social and economic issues but I recognize that education on these issues takes time and the Congress as a whole may not be able to go as far at present as I would like it to. But it appears that whether the Working Committee knows anything about the subject or not it is perfectly willing to denounce and to excommunicate people who happen to have made a special study of the subject and hold certain views. No attempt is made to understand those views, which, it is notorious, are held by a very large number of the ablest and most self-sacrificing people in the world. Those views may be right or wrong but they deserve at least some understanding before the Working Committee sets out to denounce them. It is hardly becoming for a reasoned argument to be answered by sentimental appeals or by the cheap remark that the condition in India are different and the economic laws that apply elsewhere do not function here. The resolution of the Working Committee on the subject showed such an astounding ignorance of the elements of socialism that it was painful to read it and to realize that it might be read outside India. It seemed that the overmastering desire  of the Committee was somehow to assure various vested interests even at the risk of
 talking nonsense.
 A strange way of dealing with the subject of socialism is to use the word, which has a clearly defined meaning in the English language, in a totally different sense. For individuals to use words in a sense peculiar to themselves is not helpful in the commerce of ideas. A person who declares himself to be an engine-driver and then adds that his engine is of wood and is drawn by bullocks is misusing the word engine- driver.
 This letter has become a much longer one than I expected and the night is already far spent. Probably I have written in a confused and scrappy way for my brain is tired. But still it will convey some picture of my mind. The last few months have been very painful ones for me and, I take it, for many others. I have felt sometimes that in the modern world, and perhaps in the ancient world also, it is oft preferred to break some people’s hearts rather than touch other’s pockets. Pockets are indeed valuable and more cherished than hearts and brains and bodies and human justice and dignity.
 There is one other subject I should like to mention. That is the Swaraj Bhawan Trust. I understand that the Working Committee recently considered the question of the unkeep of the Swaraj Bhawan and came to the conclusion that it was not responsible for it. As however it had already made a grant about three years ago and this had not been paid yet, although expenses were incurred on the strength of it,  a fresh grant was sanctioned. This will probably be enough for some months. In regard to the future, the Working Committee was evidently anxious not to be saddled with the burden of maintaining the house and grounds. This burden amounts to Rs. 100 a month, which includes taxes, etc. The trustees, I understand, were also a little frightened of the burden and suggested that parts of the house might be let in the ordinary way to raise money for the maintenance. Another suggestion was made that part of the grounds might be sold off for this purpose. I was surprised to learn of these suggestions, as some of them seemed to me to be contrary to the letter of the trust and all of them against its spirit. As an individual trustee I have only one voice in the matter but I should like to say that I have the strongest possible objection to any such misuse of the trust property. The very idea of the wishes of my father being flouted in this way is intolerable to me. The trust represented not only his wishes but also in small way a memorial to him and his wishes and his memory is dearer to me than a hundred rupees a month. I should, therefore, like to assure the Working Committee and the trustees that they need have no anxiety on the score of the money required for maintenance of the property. As soon as the funds, now granted by the Working Committee for some months, are exhausted, I shall make myself personally responsible for the maintenance and no further grant need be made by the Working Committee. I would also beg the trustees to respect my feelings in this matter and not
 to break up the property or to hire it for the sake of hiring it out. I shall endeavour to maintain the Swaraj Bhawan property till such time as it is put to some worthy use.
 I have not the figures by me but I believe that even thus far the Swaraj Bhawan has not been, in any sense, a financial burden on the Working Committee. The grants that have been paid to it will probably not be much in  excess  of reasonable rent for the quarters occupied by the office of the A.I.C.C. This rent could have been reduced by occupying smaller and cheaper quarters. At the same time in the past the A.I.C.C. has paid as much as Rs. 150 a month for rent of an upper floor only in Madras.
 Perhaps some part of this letter might pain you. But you would not have me hide my heart from you.
       [PS.]  Yours 	affectionately,  JAWAHAR     I 	received your short note in Alipore Jail and I sent an answer. But 	the 
  Superintendent 	suppressed that answer.  A 	Bunch of 	Old Letters, pp. 	112-7. God	Good  Physically 	I kept fairly well. I always do in prison. My body has served me  well 	and can stand a great deal of ill-treatment and strain. And being 	vain enough to imagine that perhaps I might yet do some effective 	work in this land to which fate had tied me, I looked after it well.  But 	I wondered often enough if I was not a square peg in a round hole, 	or a bubble of conceit thrown about hither and thither on an ocean 	which spurned me. But vanity and conceit triumphed and the 	intellectual apparatus that functions within me refused to admit 	defeat. If the ideals that had spurred me to action and had kept me 	buoyed up through stormy weather were right—and the conviction of 	their rightness ever grew within me—they were bound to triumph 	though my generation might not live to witness that triumph.  But 	what had happened to those ideals during these long and weary months 	of this year when I was a silent and distant witness, fretting at my 	helplessness? Setbacks and temporary defeats are common enough in 	all great struggles. They grieve but one recovers soon enough. One 	recovers soon if the light of those ideals is not allowed to grow 	dim and the anchor of principles holds fast. But what I saw was not 	setback and defeat but that spiritual defeat which is the most 	terrible of all. Do not imagine that I am referring to the 	council-entry question. I do not attach vital importance to it. 	Under certain circumstances I can even imagine entering a 
 legislature myself. But whether I function inside or outside the legislature I function as a revolutionary, meaning thereby a person working for the fundamental and revolutionary changes, political and social, for I am convinced that no other changes can bring peace or satisfaction to India and the world.
 So I thought. Not so evidently the leaders who were functioning outside. They began to talk the language of an age gone by before the heady wine of N. C. O. and C. D. had fired our heads. Sometimes they used the same words and phrases but they were dead words without life or real meaning. The leading figures of the Congress suddenly became those people who had obstructed us, held us back, kept aloof from the struggle and even co-operated with the opposite party in the time of our direct need. They became the high priests in our temple of freedom and many a brave soldier who had shouldered the burden in the heat and dust of the fray was not even allowed inside the temple precincts. He had many like him had become untouchables and unapproachables. And if he ventured to raise his voice and criticize the new high priests, he was shouted down and tol that he was a traitor to the cause because he spoilt the harmony of the sacred precincts.
 And so the flag of Indian freedom was entrusted with all pomp and circumstance to those who had actually hauled it down at the height of our national struggle at the bidding of the enemy; to those who had proclaimed from the house- tops that they had given up politics—for politics were unsafe then—but who emerged with a jump to the front ranks when politics became safe.
