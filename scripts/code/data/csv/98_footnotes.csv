At last, becoming desperate, she picked up his watch and held it 	before him to draw his attention. But it was no good. Noting her 	predicament, Manibehn Patel tactfully intervened.”"

All of a sudden someone from the crowd roughly elbowed his way towards them. Manu Gandhi, thinking that he was coming forward to touch Gandhiji’s feet, remonstrated saying something about it being already late for the prayer and tried to stop the intruder by thrusting back his hand. He violently pushed her away, causing the notebook, the spittoon and the mala, which she was carrying in her hands, to fall down. As she stooped down to pick up the scattered things, he planted himself in front of Gandhiji and fired in quick succession three shots at point-blank range. The last words Gandhiji uttered were “Hey Ram”. A spreading crimson spot appeared on the white clothes. The hands which had been raised in namaskar to the gathering slowly came down.  The  limp  body  softly  sank   to   the   ground.   Gandhiji   breathed   his   last at 5.17 p. m."
