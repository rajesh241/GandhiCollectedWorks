libtech_797_footnote,"1A.E. Chotabhai, domiciled in the Transvaal since 1899 and  registered lawfully under Act 36 of 1908, brought his minor son aged 15, whose name appeared in his father’s registration certificate, in January, 1910. On the boy’s attaining majority, his application for separate registration under Act 36 of 1908 was rejected by the Registrar of Asiatics. Chotabhai appealed to Magistrate Jordan who dismissed the appeal and ordered deportation. Chotabhai then moved the Provincial Court where Justice Wessels in Chambers dismissed the application but restrained the order of deportation pending appeal to the higher Court. The Full Bench of the Transvaal Division of the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal with a dissenting judgment by Justice Mason. Finally on January 25, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa ruled that, although Act 36 of 1908 provided only for registration of minors resident in the Transvaal at the commencement of the Act or born within its boundaries, it did not follow that minors entering lawfully after that date were to be excluded from the registration provided for under the earlier Act 2 of 1907, and that it appeared improbable that the Legislature would allow Asiatic minors free entry into the Transvaal but allow the Registrar no discretion to permit them to remain in the country on their attaining majority. The appeal was upheld. The case, in its various stages, was reported in several issues of Indian Opinion between August 1910 and April, 1911; vide also “Cable to S.A.B.I.
