The Wardha road is being built at Jamnalalji’s cost. The village road was proposed by the villagers themselves. They had given a written undertaking signed by no less than 70 people, each of whom had agreed to bring cartloads of stone for three days, the other expenses to be met by Gandhiji, at whose disposal Jamnalalji had placed all the profits accruing to him from the village, for the public good of the village. But when the work was actually begun the workers were hard put to it in persuading the signatories to keep their pledge. From 15 to 20 people had kept their promise. The rest had not. But Gandhiji could not break his pledge. He saw the thing through. He explained the whole situation to the villagers.”"
