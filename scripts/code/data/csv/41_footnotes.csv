Humble surrender to 	God is 	the only 	escape from sin, and all 	fasting, except 	when it 	is undertaken to 	help that surrender, 	is useless. 	I would 	suggest a better 	remedy. Go 	and apologize 	to the 	man you were angry with, 	ask him to 	prescribe the 	penance for you and do 	that. That 	will be much 	better expiation than 	fasting.’ The 	friend went and 	did likewise. But 	what should the 	man who has been wronged 	do in 	this case? Simply 	forgive? Forgiveness, we 	have been told, is 	the ornament 	of the 	brave, but 	what is 	that forgiveness? 	Passivity? Taking the 	blow lying down? Is 	that the meaning 	of not 	resisting evil? 	This was the subject of 	a talk 	one evening and 	I summarize it briefly :”"

The 	very day that I wrote to 	you giving the points of agreement and disagreement between the 	various parties, Mr. 	Jinnah announced that it 	 was wrong 	to say 	that anything had 	 been agreed upon by 	the Muslim 	League which had not yet 	formally appointed its 	representatives to 	the Conference. 	He added 	that he 	was no 	doubt personally of 	the opinions 	he had 	expressed, but 	he felt 	that, in 	the absence 	of definite 	authority from his 	League, he 	was not competent 	even to 	bind himself 	with those 	opinions. Thus it 	was that 	the long 	sittings and 	elaborate discussions 	occupying ten days came 	practically to 	nothing. It 	was also found that the 	attendance at 	the Conference 	was thinning 	away from day to day 	until it 	came down to 	14 on the 21st. The 	Executive of 	the Muslim 	League is meeting 	on the 26th 	and Mr. Jinnah 	has promised 	to do his best to bring 	them round to his 	point of 	view. In 	all these 	circumstances, I thought 	it was 	futile to 	go on with the 	Conference and 	suggested that a 	sub-committee be 	appointed to 	go into the 	whole question and 	make its 	report as 	soon as 	possible to 	an adjourned sitting 	of the Conference. This was agreed to and the Conference was 	adjourned to the 8th 	March, a 	committee of 	20 being appointed to 	enter upon 	their work 	at once. 	We have 	a large 	field to cover, 	but will 	either be able 	to get 	on better 	after the 26th 	or give 	up the 	attempt.
