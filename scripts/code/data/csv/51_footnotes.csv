It was most tiresome, but inevitable. Going out of this besieged house was out of the question and headache and temperature made conditions worse. The Sikh friends, who had now realized everything, were genuinely sorry for having called Gandhiji and themselves suggested that he should not go to the Sikh League.”"

For this reason I am sending you today through my publisher, Simon & Schuster, New York City, a copy of my book This Ugly Civilization. ‘It would make me very happy to have you read it. In any event, I wish you would look over the several references made to you, which you will find paged in the index. I am very confident my analysis of the diseases from which industrialism suffers is unusal, and that the remedy I propose would utilize in a totally new way the very machines which have destroyed India’s prosperity for the purpose of restoring her to economic independence and self-sufficiency.

In last December the cloth merchants of Poona entered into an agreement with the Swadeshi Sabha that they would put seals on the British cloth in their stock, that they would not import foreign cloth and would not order cloth from mills boycotted by the Congress. They took assurance from the Sabha that it would not picket their shops. These terms were entered into under pressing circumstances. All merchants without exception entered into this agreement. Some 80 shops have their British cloth sealed till the Gandhi-Irwin Settlement and 50 shops are yet remaining. We stopped to seal the cloth as we thought it would run counter to the terms of settlement. But as the agreement was made before the Settlement of Truce terms and only its execution was left we do not think it would affect the Truce. We know that in Delhi the agreement prior to the Gandhi-Irwin Settlement has been allowed to stand as it was. If our agreement stands the vigilance committee would see that not an inch of foreign cloth comes to Poona hereafter. However, we would like to know from you whether we should proceed with our work or should give it up and allow the merchants to break their seals. The matter is very urgent and we hope it will claim your early attention.”"

libtech_400_footnote,"1I then 	got on to the more 	difficult question of 	what seemed to 	me failure   on 	the part 	of the 	Congress to 	observe the 	general spirit of 	the settlement. 	I repeated 	what I 	had told Gandhi 	when I 	first met 	him that, if 	a settlement 	was to 	be a merely 	paper one 	without any 	intention on 	the part of 	Congress honestly to 	try to 	find a 	solution of 	constitutional problems, 	then it 	was better 	not to 	have one at 	all and that 	 it was not possible 	for Government 	to stand 	by and watch Congress 	definitely organizing 	for a 	fight with 	no real wish to obtain 	peace. I mentioned 	in this 	connection various 	points that 	I myself 	regarded with uneasiness, 	e.g., Pandit 	Jawaharlal’s circular 	No. 12; the message 	to the 	peasants of 	Rae Bareilly; 	what appeared 	to be a 	movement in 	the United 	Provinces to replace 	a no-tax 	campaign as part 	of the 	civil disobedience 	movement by similar 	campaign on economic 	grounds; various 	speeches of Pandit 	Jawaharlal; reference to 	a “truce” with a 	preconceived idea 	that no 	final settlement 	would be 	attained; talks 	of a 	future war 	and reference to 	Government as 	opponents and 	enemies. I 	also mentioned the 	way in which 	Congress had 	attempted to 	exploit the 	settlement as 	a victory. 	Gandhi saw nothing 	objection- able 	in circular 	No. 12 	and said that he 	could not dismiss 	the possibility 	that peace 	would not 	ultimately be 	reached. At 	the same time, he 	fully accepted the 	position that it was wrong to refer to 	the settlement as a truce, to talk about a future war, to prejudge 	the issues 	and refer 	to Government 	as enemies 	and opponents. 	He also 	expressed disapproval of the exploitation of the settlement by Congress as a victory."
