The problem 	of Sindi 	village was 	continuing unsolved and 	Bapu suddenly announced 	that he in tended 	to go and live 	in Sindi all 	alone, taking what help 	he required 	from the villagers. 	Everyone was aghast 	at the 	idea, specially 	in view 	of Bapu’s 	state of health. 	I asked 	Bapu that if I 	went instead 	to Sindi, 	would he accept 	the compromise. 	Bapu reluctantly 	agreed.

I felt 	that Sindi was no village 	and that our experiences 	of, and experiments 	with regard 	to, villages 	life could not 	really be 	carried on 	there.

It was only 	when the doctors 	were called—I wired to 	Jivaraj—that it was 	found that he 	had a 	blood-pressure over 	200 (syst.) 	and 120 (diast.). 	He has 	since been having perfect 	rest in bed, attending 	to no correspondence, 	writing nothing, 	dictating nothing.”"
