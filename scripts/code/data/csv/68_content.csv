       Unrevised	WARDHA,  September 	23, 1935  MY 	DEAR AMRIT,  	Your letter to Choudhury has told. He has taken it in the right 	spirit. There was no occasion for apology. And if you cannot call a 	spade a spade to your own people in your own home, which Maganwadi 	is, where could you do so? You must repeat the performance, 	whenever the occasion arises. This size is especially prepared for 	you. But you will give me your criticism on it. For the stinking lot 	you have to pay nothing. Has the stink  gone  with  exposure to the 	sun and the air?  	Puri should send his detailed criticism without delay. He must not 	wait for the time when he comes here. I must not be kept in 	darkness. I 	am eating your apples with vengeance. And I needed them.  They 	and musambis have 	acted like medicine.  	Mira is free from fever. But she is still terribly weak and the 	digestive apparatus does not respond as it should. In spite of big 	doses of Eno’s Fruit Salt, she has to take the enema in order to 	get a clearance. But there is no anxiety on her behalf. You won’t 	get full marks as a good nurse, nor Shummy as a good doctor, unless 	between you two [you] make Pyarelal take milk and your excellent 	butter. Has Shummy anything to add to what I have givenlibtech_1_footnotein Harijan on snake bites? Is there an easy way 	of distinguishing a poisonous from a non- poisonous snake? Does he 	recommend any book on it?  	When does he think Kumarappa can be discharged? Here are some 	letters for your guestslibtech_2_footnote(!) Love.    BAPU

 CHI. PURUSHOTTAM,
 I have your letter. If I didn’t know you, I would be displeased to get no letter from you. I console myself thinking that you must have some good reason for not writing to me, either that you want to save my time or to save yours. According to my nature, I would rather that persons like you wrote to me frequently so that I could know them better and hence could also help.
 I have not yet been able to go through the report of the Harijan work in Kathiawar. I do wish to read it. What you write about Chhaganlal has disturbed me. The Harijan work there must not suffer. And we cant’t also afford Jivanlal losing interest in it. Can you make any suggestion? After your letter, it is not possible for me to keep still and do nothing. Can I use the contents of your letter in writing to
 Chhaganlal?
Would it be correct to say that you have completely recovered
 now?         From 	a microfilm of the Gurjarati: M.M.U./II    Blessings 	from  BAPU

That is of course if you think 	that his being with me is not likely to aggravate his disease. This 	is

6,"September 	24, 1935",LETTER TO B.G. KHER,"
         MY 	DEAR KHER,       September 	24, 1935 
  	I ought to have written this to you whilst Swami was here, but I 	simply could not do it and then it escaped me altogether, till I got 	a reminder from Swami yesterday afternoon. I see no contradiction 	between what Thakkar Bapa has written and what I  conveyed to Swami, 	Harijan Sevek Sangh won’t take direct responsibility  of  owning 	the property in Pandharpur, but it will provide the majority of 	trustees and continue to do so, as vacancies occur by any reason 	whatsoever. The idea behind this arrangement is that the Sangh 	should not undertake any financial responsibility. Its burden would 	be fully discharged when it has appointed trustees who are able to 	manage property financially and otherwise. This proposition was  	adopted under my advice. The Sangh has not sufficient workers to 	enable it to take charge of properties that are being offered to it. 	This Pandharpur proposition has been entertained because you and 	Swami  are interested in it and because both of you are connected 	with the donor, who I am sure holds advanced and liberal views on 	untouchability and other matters and who wholly endorses the Sangh’s 	campaign against untouchability. I hope this is sufficiently clear 	and quite satisfactory from the point of view of the Buva. If any 	further elucidation is required please do not hesitate to write to 	me. I understand from Shri Kavde who was here for two days that the 	Buva was expected to be somewhere near Wardha during the first week 	of October. If that does happen I would like you to urge him to pass 	a few days with me at Maganwadi so that I can make his personal 	acquaintance and understand his desire about the management of the 	Dharmashala in Pandharpur. In view of the conversation I had with 	Swami and Shri Kavde I would advise that in drawing up the 	trust-deed you give the 
 trustees full powers of mortgage, alienation, etc., so long as the corpus is used for the exclusive benefit of Harijans. I have explained to  Swami why I consider the possession of this power by the trustees as a vital part of the deed.
 Yours sincerely,

  	I couldn’t write to you because of heavy pressure of work. 	Munshi’s writing is neither seductive nor obscene. I didn’t see 	anything objectionable in his ridicule of brahmacharya. I had 	read nearly the whole of it before writing the Foreword. I had liked 	his effort. The fact is that, having come to know Munshi personally, 	I have developed a partiality for him. He has capacity for 	self-sacrifice. He seems to be a sincere man. This does not mean 	that I like everything about him. But we should regard others in the 	spirit of ahimsa, that is, with a broad mind. In other words, we 	should judge everybody according to his limitations. I hope this 	answers all your questions.

11,"September 25, 1935",LETTER TO CHHAGANLAL JOSHI,"
  
 September 25, 1935
 CHI. CHHAGANLAL,
 I got your letter. Reading about the things that Balvantrai has tolerated doesn’t lessen my grief. Please tell him so, or convey it in a letter, if you have shown him my previous letter. The news that the houses of Bhangis were satisfactorily completed though after much delay, was welcome.
 Can you not, with the help of Dakshinamurti, find somebody in Bhavnagar who would take up debt-relief work among  Bhangis? Valji’s nephew Rasik is studying in Shamaldas College. College students are often found doing silent social work while studying. See if you can tempt Rasik. If he comes forward, he may also be able to draw his friends into the work. The fact that 15 maunds of bones did not give even a basketful of manure means that they were heated more than necessary. The bones should merely be charred, that is, heated till
 they turn black. They should be heated less than wood is when it is turned into charcoal. There will then be hardly any loss of weight in the bones. I performed the process myself and produced manure. The experiment was demonstrated in Maganwadi. The method is now frequently made use of in Nalvadi. The fuel consists of dried stumps of uprooted hedge-plants. Wood should not be used for the purpose, and dry sticks not at all. The material used for fuel should be such as would burn just a little longer than hay, so that when it is burnt up it will leave the bones unburnt. It should be remembered that our aim is not even to heat the bones till they look like charcoal. Charring bones means merely heating them till they turn black. We have to go just a little further than smoking them. Bones heated in this manner lose nothing besides a little nitrogen, and certainly no phosphorus. If the phosphorus in bones is lost, their essence is lost. Collect a few bones and make the experiment yourself several times till you have mastered the process. Did you by any chance try to heat the 15 maunds of bones together at one time?
 More and more bone-mills and flour-mills will  continue  to come up and people will go in for their products. But wouldn’t a true brahmachari remain unshaken in his vow even in the midst of widespread immorality? Going further than that, don’t we see that, though the threat of death hangs over everybody, the whole world strives, and commendably, to stave off the evil day? If in the same way we regard it our duty to do our best, we would go on doing our work fearlessly and with faith and a cheerful mind no matter how often we fail.
 The success of mills lies in being able to pay dividends, whereas ours lies in doing our duty. One who has dedicated himself to a cause doesn’t hope for the reward of his work. A person who travels to Hardwar in a train does nothing very great, but a pilgrim who travels on foot from Kanyakumari to Jamnotri may be said to have achieved something. I say ‘something’ because after all Jamnotri is only a physical goal. Our effort for the revival of village industries belongs to the same class. But real effort consists in striving for an invisible goal. Despite the coming into vogue of aeroplanes, we shall need our legs. Likewise, despite the numerous mills which have sprung up, there will be need for village industries. Just as it would be foolish to neglect cultivating strength of limbs because of the increasing use of aeroplanes, so it would be foolish to neglect village industries because
 of the multiplication of mills. We are trying to save to country from committing such folly. There can be no room for despair in such effort.
 The description of the condition of the  cultivators  in Samdhiyala proves that I am fully justified in giving the first place in our programme to village sanitation. Even this first step in man’s education has come to be neglected. The reason for that neglect is the unforgivable sin of the higher castes in looking down upon the lower castes.
 If Dhiru has gone to Totaramji to learn agriculture or with the noble desire of serving him, my congratulations to him, Rama and you. I never think about Harilal now.
 I have already written to you about the result of my inquiry concerning . . .’slibtech_9_footnotelibtech_10_footnotecharacter. To me his letter seemed to be perfectly sincere. It seems he is connected with several institutions in Rajkot. He has suggested to me that, if I wish, I might make further inquiries to ascertain the correctness of the facts stated in his letter. Narandas has no doubt regarding that, and Bhai Jethalal has produced before me no definite evidence. I, therefore, have made no further  enquiry. However, I am prepared to do so if you produce definite evidence. I have still kept that door open for you. Personally, I have no bias either way in the matter. My condition is like that of a judge who changes his view from time to time as more and more evidence for or against is brought forward. I have sent Narandas’s letter to Jethalal Joshi. Please tell him that he has not even acknowledged it, and, if he has not received my letter, inform me accordingly. I haven’t even kept a copy of Narandas’s letter. The date of posting of my letter can be ascertained from my register. Jethalal lives in the same house where you live. If, therefore, you feel inclined to take up this matter, by all means do so. You must have seen from Narandas’s letter that he does not accept a single charge. It should be borne in mind that. . .s’ character or whether or not he habitually wears khadi is not the only subject-matter of inquiry. It is possible that Narandas’s attitude on that point is not correct. I have not come to any conclusion even about that. The main complaint is against the whole management of
 
 the school and Narandas’s fitness as a teacher.

         BHAI 	MUNSHI,     September 	25, 1935 
  	I add the good wishes of you both to those of many others. But isn’t 	it God’s will that prevails in the end? Who can thwart the decrees 	of Fate? Have you considered what kind of figure I would cut in the 	Sahitya Parishad? When my name was suggested on a similar occasion 	years ago, the late Ramanbhai had remarked that I did not know even 	as much Gujarati as a raw matriculate. I had at that time agreed 	whole- heartedly with him when I heard the remark. As my era had 	already commenced then, others who heard that sincerely meant remark 	had felt hurt, but I saw in it nothing but sincerity of purpose and 	regard 
 for propriety. Our people’s love is blind. They believe that a person who is capable in one field must be so in other fields, too. If the person is weak-minded, he would therefore soon come to grief. Ramanbhai’s remark made in 1915-16 holds true literally even today, and I am therefore shaking in my shoes ever since my name was suggested for the forthcoming session of the Parishad. In cherishing the aspiration to make the Parishad a symbol of Gujarat’s unity and culture, don’t you think you are making its field unlimited? And I see no likelihood of that aspiration being realized through my becoming its President. This is precisely the state of my mind. If even after knowing this all the members desire that I must become the President and if the Parishad is to meet next year, you may give me an opportunity   to   think   again   then.libtech_11_footnoteYou   have   approached   me   as advocate of the Reception Committee, but now please become my advocate and reply to the Committee on my behalf that you are personally convinced by my argument and agree that I should be spared from having to become President.
 Regarding the Advisory Committee for Hansa, I thought I had said my say.libtech_12_footnotelibtech_13_footnoteBut Mahadev gave me your message just now. I see that you have enumerated fifteen languages, from out of which you yourself agree to the exclusion of three, leaving twelve. Fixing an upper limit of 20 for twelve languages, you may  select  whatever names you like. I would find it difficult to make the selection, since I do not know everybody. I was concerned only with the size, and if my argument on that point appeals to you, you yourself should select the agreed number of names. I will accept your selection.

 AGANWADI, WARDHA,
 September 26, 1935
 CHI. NARAHARI,
 I got your letter. We cannot afford to give way to despair in this manner. I can’t explain much in a letter. Find some time after Parikshitlal returns and come over for a while.
 It is true that we are not able to give the girls as much as we ought to. But it is also true that we do not have the necessary women workers. God creates difficulties so that we might overcome them and not run away from them. You acted rightly in relieving Bhagwanji. Puratan may go to a village if he wishes. We may certainly introduce any reforms that you desire and others also that we can think of. While doing so we should bear only one thing in mind. namely, that we must not abandon anything we have started so long as we see no immorality in it. Think over this while you are waiting to come here. Can Anasuyabehn take charge of the younger girls who give you trouble? If she is short of space, can she shift her Bal Mandir to the Harijan Ashram?
 You can do the tanning and the dairy work even there. Where else will you get the facilities of land, etc., which you have there? Valunjkar has been doing his work here so efficiently and intelligently that I am hopeful that he will soon be able to run tanneries at a number of places. He has even undertaken to start one at Nasik. A building is already under construction there and the work will start as soon as it is completed. You will see that, too, when you come here. Valunjkar has resolved to suffer no loss from the very beginning and all kinds of schemes are being thought out with that end in view. I think from the economic point of view the work here will be more successful than Satisbabu’s project. The latter has  already consumed a lot of money by now. The return has yet to come. In Valunjkar’s project very little money has been invested, the hides are being tanned, there is a sufficient number of cobblers for the work and the trainees, too, are making progress.
 Please remember that a servant of the people must display all the four qualities in proper balance, namely, the Brahmin’s wisdom, the Kshatriya’s fearlessness, the Vaishya’s purity of management and the
 Shudra’s capacity for untiring labour. The greatest shortcoming in us all is the lack of the Kshatriya spirit. We lose heart much too soon. We tremble to stand alone. At sight of the tiger of difficulties, whether we are one or many we start running away. Please do not think that any of these charges is directed against you alone. I am explaining to you what I see all around me and even in myself. As for myself, where can   I run away to? My condition, therefore, is like that of a Bania who had got himself tied on the back of a horse. If you have not heard this story, please ask me some time. I will enjoy telling it to you or, if you cannot come in the near future, will write to you.

  	I have not preserved your letter, but the language was so clumsy 	that I had to read it twice to take in its meaning. It is natural 	that you two couldn’t have any such meaning in your minds, but the 	letter did mean that you certainly wanted your money to be used for 	relief work but that I should send you an account showing the 	particulars of individuals to whom it was paid. If Kanti has written 	to you and said that the money received by me was not being used, he 	is not right. It is true that some funds that are lying with me are 	not being used as yet, but if Kanti did write what you think he did, 	you ought not to have sent me at all the money for Quetta relief 	work. If, however, you felt it your dharma to send it, you should 	have quoted Kanti’swords and told me that your money should be 	spent immediately and should not lie with me unused.  	I hope you will see that your error in writing in English was still 	more serious. I was surprised to discover that, after having lived 	with me for so many years, you have not been able to understand and 	see that, however well one may know the English language, one should 	write or speak in it only when absolutely necessary. Since there was 	no incivility anywhere in your letter, you need not have apologized 	for it. If, however, you lose all that you have learnt in the 	Ashram, then will be the time for you to apologize.  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	a photostat of the Gujarati: G. N. 6622.

 train, it should remain good. It should be so well packed that there would be no danger of leakage. If you cannot procure really good ghee, you should stop sending any. One of our men should go to the people who prepare the ghee and teach them how to make it and see that they pack only properly boiled ghee and use clean  tins.  It requires great art to boil the ghee properly. Don’t mind having sent the last sample, I will examine it and let you know.

 Nothing whatever is going on in Wardha. There was nothing, either, when Vallabhbhai was here. When Ghanshyamdas came, Vallabhbhai, too, came to listen to his stories. There was therefore, nothing in our talks except Ghanshyamdas’s stories of his exploits in England and some gossip. This real fact, fortunately, escaped the attention of reporters altogether, otherwise all kinds of speculation would have followed and Ghanshyamdas would have been upset.
 
 Rajaji’s being here at that time was just an accident. He was returning with Lakshmi and was bound to break journey here on his way. As Ghanshyamdas was coming I detained him for two days. I don’t remember anybody having so much as even mentioned the subject of my re-entry into politics. I do not understand how he gave currency to such a wild story.

 You remember that a little over a month ago, I wrote to you asking you whether you would publish a statement giving your views on ‘conversion’.You wrote back to say that it would be easier for you if we could put them in the form of questions or assertions. At the request of the Executive Committee of the Madras International Fellowship, one of our Christian members has prepared the enclosed statement and the Committee has asked me to pass it on to you with the request that you will kindly find it possible to answer these statements in Harijan. Of course you will notice that the questions are framed from the Christian point of view; but the Committee feels that the questions will apply equally well to other Missionary Religions which are engaged in conversion programme. May I hope that you will find it possible to explain your attitude to these questions?
 
PROPOSITIONS
 
 Conversion 	is a 	change of 	heart from sin 	to God. 	It is the 	work of 	God. Sin is separation 	from God.  The 	Christian believes that 	Jesus is the 	fulfilment of 	God’s revelation 	to mankind, 	that He is our Saviour 	from sin, that He alone 	can bring 	the sinner 	to God and thus 	enable him to live.  The 	Christian, to 	whom God 	has become a 	living reality 	and power through 	Christ, regards it as his 	privilege and 	duty to 	speak about Jesus and 	to proclaim the free 	offer which He came on earth to make.  If 	any man’s 	heart is so moved 	by the 	hearing of 	this message 	as to 	repent and 	wish to 	live a 	new life as 	a disciple of 	Jesus, the 	Christian regards it 	as right 	to admit 	him to 	the company 	of His 	professed believers which 	is called 	the Christian Church.  The 	Christian shall 	do all 	in his 	power to 	sound the 	sincerity of 	conviction in 	all such cases and 	shall point out, as 	he can, the 	consequences of 	such a step, stressing the duty a man owes to his family.  The 	Christian shall 	do everything 	in his 	power to prevent 	any  motives 	of self-seeking 	on his 	part and of material 	considerations on the 	part of 	the convert.  Inasmuch 	as Jesus came to give full life, and that as a matter of history 	conversion has 	often meant an 	enhancing of 	personality, the 	Christian shall 	not be 	accused of 	using material 	inducements if conversion 	results in 	the social 	uplift of the 	convert—it always being 	understood that such 	shall never 	be used as a means to an end.  The 	Christian is 	right in 	accepting as 	his duty the care of 	the sincere 	convert—body, soul and mind.  It 	shall not 	be brought 	against the Christian 	that he 	is using material 	inducements, when certain 	facts in Hindu 	social theory, out of 	his control, 	are in themselves an inducement to the Harijan. (But see points 5 and 6.) 
 In order to understand the background to these propositions, the reader should know that the origin of the main question was a discussion I was carrying on with Mr. A. A. Paul on the so called mass conversion of a village predominantly or wholly composed  of Harijans. The reader may later on read more of this ‘conversion’. For the present purpose it is enough that he understands, that it is the method of mass conversion that has to be tested in the light of these propositions. Indeed the ninth proposition almost says as much.
 I have read the propositions several times, and the more I read them the more I feel that they can be applied only to individual contacts, never to the mass of mankind. Take the very first proposition. Sin is defined to be “separation from God”. “Conversion is a change of heart from sin to God. It is the work of God.” So says the author of the propositions. If conversion is the work of God, why should that work be taken away from Him? And who is man to take away anything from God? He may become a humble instrument in the hands of God. Even so he cannot be a judge of men’s hearts. I often wonder whether we are always true judges of our own hearts. ‘Man, know thyself’ must have been wrung out of a desparate heart. And if we know so little of ourselves, how much less must we know of our neighbours and remote strangers who may  differ from us in a multitude of things, some of which are of the highest moment? The second proposition deals with the  Christian belief handed to the believer from generation to generation, the truth of which thousands of Christians born are never called upon to test for themselves, and rightly not. Surely it is a dangerous thing to present it
 to those who have been brought up to a different belief. And it would appear to me to be impertinent on my part to present my untested belief to the professor of another which for aught I know may be as true as mine. It is highly likely that mine may be good enough for me and his for him. A thick woollen coat would be the thing for one living in the cold region of the earth, as a piece of loincloth for another living near the equatorial regions.
 The third proposition too, like the first, relates to the mysteries of religion which are not understood by the common people who take them in faith. They work well enough among people living in the traditional faith. They will repel those who have been brought up to believe something else.
 The other five propositions deal with the conduct of the missionary among those whom he is seeking to convert. They seemto me to be almost impossible of application in practice. The start being wrong, all that follows must be necessarily so. Thus how is the  Christian to sound the sincerity of the conviction of his hearers? By a show of hands? By personal conversation? By a temporary trial? Any test that can be conceived will fail even to be reasonably conclusive. No one but God knows a man’s heart. Is the Christian so sure of his being so right in body, mind and soul as to feel comfortably “right in accepting as his duty the care of the sincere convert—body, soul and mind”?
 The last proposition—the crown of all the preceding ones— takes one’s breath away. For it makes it clear that the other eight are to be applied in all their fulness to the poor Harijans. And yet the very first proposition has not ceased to puzzle the brains of some of the most intellectual and philosophical persons even in the present generation. Who knows the nature of original sin? What is the meaning of separation from God? What is that of the union with God? What are the signs of him who is united to God? Are all who dare to preach the message of Jesus the Christ sure of their union with God? If they are not, who will test the Harijans’ knowledge of these deep things?
 This is my reaction to the foregoing propositions. I hope no Christian who reads it will be offended by it. I would have been false to my numerous Christian friends, if I had hidden from them my true position on the nine propositions.
My own detached view may now be stated in a few words. I
 believe that there is no such thing as conversion from one faith to another in the accepted sense of the term. It is a highly personal matter for the individual and his God. I may not have any design upon my neighbour as to his faith which I must honour even as I honour my own. For I regard all the great religions of the world as true at any rate for the people professing them as mine is true for me. Having reverently studied the scriptures of the world, I have no difficulty in perceiving the beauties in all of them. I could no more think of asking a Christian or a Mussalman or a Parsi or a Jew to change his faith than I would think of changing my own. This makes me no more oblivious of the limitations of the professors of those faiths, than it makes me of the grave limitations of the professors of mine. And seeing that it takes all my resources in trying to bring my practice to the level of my faith and in preaching the same to my co- religionists, I do not dream of preaching to the followers of other faiths. “Judge not lest ye be judged” is sound maxim for one’s conduct. It is a conviction daily growing upon me that the greatand rich Christian missions will render true service to India, if they can persuade themselves to confine their activities to humanitarian service without the ulterior motive of converting India or at least her unsophisticated villagers to Christianity, and destroying their social superstructure, which notwithstanding its many defects has stood now from time immemorial the onslaughts upon it from within and from without. Whether they—the missionaries—and we wish it or not, what is true in the Hindu faith will abide, what is untrue will fall to pieces. Every living faith must have within itself the power of rejuvenation if it is to live.

          WARDHA, 
     MY 	DEAR AMRIT,  September 	28, 1935 
  	I better dictate this letter. These ups and downs in Devdas’s 	health do not trouble me at all. I know that he is getting on there. 	And  I know further that he is in the best of hands. Whoever gave 	the news to Pyarelal did no good turn. Really and truly I have never 	felt better.  	The whole of the last supply of your apples was practically finished 	by me. And I was also taking musumbis. Therefore there is no 	cause for worry, even on that score. Whenever I feel the need for 	fruit I shall certainly take it. I have not left off raw leaves. 	There was for a few days no room left for neem leaves. So 	that was omitted. But then all the vegetables were to be omitted if 	I was taking fruit and the fruit jam. And now I have gone back to 	neem leaves. The bhaji I have been taking in its 	cooked form in order to avoid constipation but I stopped it when I 	was taking apples. You will please therefore not worry about my 	health.  	Now about Ba. If she is not happy there and if she can be spared, I 	think it is no good keeping her there. With all your care and 	attention I am quite sure that Devdas does not need her presence 	there. If, therefore, she feels like coming away to Wardha you 	should let her do so. She is well able to travel by herself. She 	requires some    
 assistance at stations where she alights. That you can arrange without the slightest difficulty at Kalka, Ambala and Delhi. Someone has simply to meet her at the station and put her in the right compartment.
 I am looking forward to your letter giving me your own programme. I should be very much disturbed if you altered your own programe on account of Devdas or Kumarappa. If they cannot stay at Manorville after you leave it, they must shift somewhere else or go to some other hill-station, if a more prolonged stay is necessary. And I do think that both of them should remain in the bracing climate at least up to the end of October if not November. Devdas may even require a longer stay.
 The apples and your letter have just come in. If Ba forfeits her ticket, she should pay the fare, i.e., Devdas.
Love.

 September 28, 1935
 CHI. CHHAGANLAL,
 I got your letter written on Rentia Baras Day. It looks very nice indeed that you are taking part in the uninterrupted spinning programme in the national school. Thanks to Amtussalaam’s efforts, here also spinning is going on daily for 16 hours. Sixteen persons give one hour each by turn. The spinning starts at 5 a.m. and goes on up to 9 p.m. About 3,500 rounds are spun daily. I have suggested some changes in this programme, and my suggestion that one spinning-wheel should be kept systematically working day and night is being discussed.
 It seems you have not correctly understood my articlelibtech_22_footnote. I did not give up the practice under pressure from anybody. When Morarji and Chandulal came here to express their views, their arguments had no effect on my mind or could not make me give up the practice. But when I was faced with the problem of how to save the young man, my attitude changed immediately. I have done many things in my life with the motive of saving other persons. Nor have I accepted it as a
 
 principle never to yield to popular sentiments, though I do oppose doing anything merely to respect such sentiments. My rule is this: Whenever respecting popular sentiments does not involve violation of moral principles or loss of self-respect, they should be respected even at some cost to oneself. For instance, if it was not for popular sentiments, I would most probably wear no clothes. I would see for myself in such practice many moral benefits besides benefit to my health. It would strengthen my self-control. But out of respect for popular sentiments I refrain from taking this very desirable step.
 I learnt about Jivanlal’s resignation only from your letter. You should have given more details. If I am required to decide about it finally any details given by you would have been  useful.  Now  I myself will write to you and ask you for information that I might need if the matter comes before me. You must have received my previous letterlibtech_23_footnote.

         CHI. 	PREMA,       September 	28, 1935 
  	I have no option today but to dictate. I use the right hand only on 	Monday to write for Harijan. On the other days I write with 	the left hand. That takes more time. Besides, your letter calls for 	immediate reply. Do come some time about the 16th. By bits I will 	give you as much time as you need. Will it be all right if I do so 	during my walks? It would be better if you do not fix in advance the 	time of your stay here. You shouldn’t mind if you have to stay on 	for a day or two longer. It would be better to see all the scattered 	activities at leisure and also if our conversations were spread 	over. Prabhavati has collected the yarn spun by me. And I have 	entrusted its dispatch also to her. I read the book about Hitler at 	your suggestion. I read Maxton’s booklibtech_24_footnoteon Lenin, too. I also asked them to send me another 	book on Hitler and I have got it now. Your description of the room 	is     
 interesting. There are many reasons for people to envy you. I am sure that when you know all the circumstances of my renunciation, you also will agree with me.
 Most probably Jamnalalji will return by the 2nd or the 3rd. So far as I remember, I had replied to both your  questions  in  my previous letter. I see no acknowledgement of that letter in your present letter. I, therefore, briefly reply to your questions again.
 There are many objections against approving of compulsory sterilization of people suffering from leprosy. The practice is likely to lead to numerous evils. It is also not right to assume any disease to be incurable. It seems safer to me to propagate the method  of  self- control and be content with whatever results can be achieved  in thatway. I sense cowardice at every step. A spinner who was a coward would cut apart tangled yarn. A good spinner, on the other hand, would undo the tangle with patience and skill and keep the thread whole. A follower of ahimsa would adopt some such method with persons suffering from supposedly incurable diseases.
 Systematic foreign propaganda by us seems to me to be like a bullock-cart competing with a railway train. If we can spend a thousand for propaganda in the cause of truth, the adversary is in a position to spend a crore. I am, therefore, convinced that we should be satisfied with whatever propaganda takes place in the normal course through the work of individuals.

 WARDHA,
 September 30, 1935
 Shri K. S. Savant was with me for nearly a week. He is a Harijan and sculptor by profession, having gone through the full course in the Bombay School of Art. I could not resist his appeal to be allowed to sit in my room and do his work without distracting my attention in any way. He had his heart’s wish and he made the fullest use of the opportunity. Experts alone can judge his art. But I could see that Shri
 Savant had varied gifts. He showed great application all the time he was with me and was entirely absorbed in his work. We found him to be thoroughly sociable and [he] became one of us the moment he came. He deserves encouragement from lovers of art and moneyed men. I wish him every success.

 MY DEAR AMRIT,
 I am sure the apples sent by you are not from your garden. Do you know what railage they mean? It is too much of a good thing. Let me be satisfied with what local fruit I can get here. If they were  needed as medicine, I would have asked you to send them. But they are not. The only fruit, I fancy, I need for the ailing ones is oranges or musumbis. And I have arranged for a continuous supply. This too may be my fancy but if I am to do with the least amount of drugs, I must, so it appears to me, have honey and oranges. And I assure you I am almost extravagant in the use of these articles. Therefore please stop buying apples for me. When you have the next yield in your own garden I shall gladly have my share.
 I expect Ba this evening. She will give me all the latest news about Devdas and Kumarappa though I suppose she will hardly be able to add to the very full information you have been giving me.
 Kumarappa’s brother, J.M., has been here. He is leaving for Bombay this evening. They are chips of the same block, so alike in appearance and their liberal outlook of life and love of the land !
 Hope you are well. No use saying do not overwork yourself. I suppose you have rendered yourself incapable of responding to any such request, advice or even command !
Love.

 Mira is completely free. Did I tell you we had built a little cabin

 You are being obstinate. Nobody can convince a person who is being stubborn. Your behaviour shows that you cannot observe rules. Either things should work out as you wish or else you would be furious. Is this the result of staying so many years with me? You are angry and I am pained. God knows whether it is a folly to be angry or to feel pained. Pain is a sign of attachment. Attachment and anger are signs of rajas. My pain will not be for long.

 Harijanbandhu, 13-10-1935.
 God to make me worthy of the pure love showered and to remove my imperfections in order to make me a true servant of the public. I am aware that the letters and telegrams received are not merely formal but an expression of heart-felt sentiments.
 As the greetings cannot possibly be individually acknowledged, I hope all the friends will be content with this.

MY DEAR JAWAHARLALlibtech_40_footnote,
 Your letters come in with clock-like regularity and they are such a blessing.
 I see that Kamala is putting forth a very brave effort. It will be rewarded. You know my partiality for nature-cure methods. There are in Germany itself many nature-cure establishments. Kamala’s case may be past that stage. But one never knows. I know of cases which were reported to be for surgical treatment but which yielded to nature- cure treatment. I send you this experience of mine for what it is worth.
 Your letter about the wearing of the next year’s crown was delightful. I was glad to have your consent. I am sure that it would solve many difficulties and it is the rightest thing that could have happened for the country. Your presidentship at Lahorelibtech_41_footnotewas totally different from what it would be at Lucknowlibtech_42_footnote. In my opinion it was comparatively plain sailing at Lahore in every respect. It won’t be so in any respect at Lucknow. But those circumstances I cannot imagine anybody better able to cope with than you. May God give you all the strength to shoulder the burden.
 I am going through your chapterslibtech_43_footnoteas speedily as I can. They are to me of absorbing interest. More than that I must not say just now.
This letter carries the love of us to you all.

CHI. PURUSHOTTAM,
 I got your letter. It was a clear one. I received a letter from Thakkar  Bapalibtech_44_footnotelibtech_45_footnotejust  before  I  got  yours.  He  has  placed  the  whole burden on me. I have accordingly written a long letter to Chhaganlal.  I do not wish to put more pressure on Jivanlalbhai. Let him do as much as he can. It is not possible to change Chhaganlal’s methods very much now. He can spend his energy in doing service, and Thakkar Bapa is in love with him. It is natural, therefore, that he should have full confidence in himself. Let him find out a president and carry on the work. Thakkar Bapa’s suggestion is that either Nanalal or Narandas should become the president. But Narandas and Chhaganlal will not team up well. The two follow their own methods of work and, therefore, the one cannot be president over the other. Even if that is possible, however, I wish to get Narandas over here if some other arrangement can be made for his parents. Chhaganlal simply cannot leave Kathiawar at present. I am sending your letter to him. Try and discuss the matter with him to the extent you can. Our duty is to serve the Harijans and we have to solve this problem only with a view to finding how best we can do it. Your own dissatisfaction certainly does not mean that you wish to give up Harijan work. On the contrary you also have the same problem, namely, what contribution you can make to the solution of the difficulty which has arisen.
Write to me from time to time.

Jamnalalji has arrived here. I talked to him. He is eager to know
 your decision. He wishes to merge the Mahila Ashram and the Kanya Ashram into one and hand over full charge to you. This suggestion was mine. If you have already discussed the matter with Jamnadas and if you can get the whole-hearted consent of your parents, send me a wire. It will be enough if you are able to take a decision for coming.

  	I had given up hope of having a letter form you. I think of you 	quite often. If you wish, you can derive some consolation from the 	thought that you are not the only one who avoids writing to me.

Now, if you are not able to study there I wish you joined the 	Vidyapith where at present all facilities are available and many of 	your friends are studying. But I make one condition which you must 	fulfil, and is it you should not be separated from your parents. Try 	to gain as much as you can by remaining wherever they are. Your 	helath is my main consideration in laying down this condition. In 	spite of your staying there, you will be able to improve your 	English by your    
 own effort, although Mathew might leave. Since you are not keen about passing examinations, you can conveniently take up the subjects of your liking taught in Sushilabehn’s school. Moreover, you will be able to have an easy influence on the girls attending that school. I have no fear of your being tempted by the happy-go-lucky tendency of the girls attending the school. Nor do I think you have.

51,,THREE QUESTIONS,"
    
 
 Shri Gopabandhu Choudhury writing from Bari, Cuttack, sends the following three questions:
 In self-sufficing khadi what should be the price of surplus khadi?  If 	a villager 	has cotton 	but no 	spinners to 	give him the requirements 	of his 	family and 	he wants 	to have 	his cotton spun 	for his own family 	requirements by his 	co-villagers or 	neighbouring villagers, 	what should 	be the 	wage? Will 	the proposed living wage 	for commercial 	khadi be 	applicable here? 	Or, will 	it be left 	to mutual 	adjustment?  What 	should be the wage 	when the spinner 	has no cotton 	of her own and she 	spins not 	for wages in 	cash for living 	but for cotton 	and that also till she 	earns a 	quantity sufficient for her cloth need? 
The price of surplus khadi passing through the A.I.S.A. can
 only be the same as that of any other in the same province. Now that for the most part khadi sales, except for the requirements of cities, will be confined to the province where it is manufactured, the prices in different provinces will perhaps vary more than they do now. But there connot be any distinction between surplus khadi and any other. Indeed all khadi can only be surplus khadi, for khadi will not be accepted by the Association or its branches from anyone who is not himself or herself a full wearer of khadi. Of course the rule may have to be relaxed during the transition stage.
 On the analogy of the first answer, there is no doubt that so far as the Association is concerned it must pay all spinners alike. But the Association will not regulate the dealings between spinners themselves. They must be allowed to adjust their own mutual relations. Any other policy must fail.
 In the third case also the same principle applies as in the first two. The thing to remember is that the Association will be responsible for the payment of the minimum subsistence wage where it is itself concerned. If its policy becomes popular and therefore general, no doubt it will be difficult if not impossible for anyone to get things done for less wages. And the co-operation between A.I.S.A. and
 A.I.V.I.A. may beomce so powerful that wages in every other department will at once be levelled up to their standard. The success of the effort will depend upon the hearty response from the buying public. If they will realize that they may no longer exploit the poor villagers on whom depends their existence, the problem of unemploy- ment and semi-starvation will be automatically solved.

 "
52,,VACATE KAVITHA,"
    
Sjt. A. V. Thakkar says in a letterlibtech_53_footnotelibtech_54_footnotereceived last week:
 There is no help like self-help. God helps those who help them- selves. If the Harijans concerned will carry out their reported resolve to wipe the dust of Kavitha off their feet, they will not only be happy themselves but they will pave the way for others who may be similarly treated. If people migrate in search of employment, how much more should they do so in search of self-respect? I hope that well-wishers of Harijans will help these poor families to vacate inhospitable Kavitha.
 Harijan, 5-10-1935
 "
53,,A KNOTTY QUESTION,"
    
 Since the talk of the rise in the wages of spinners khadi-lovers are filled with all kinds of vague fears. For instance, they fear a fall in the public demand for khadi in view of a rise in its price. I am hoping that the public will appreciate the little rise that must take place in the price of khadi. They have hitherto benefited by the continuous redu- ction in prices which hitherto it has been the aim of the Association to achieve by extraordinary effort in the direction. The price of khadi
 
 has been never so low as it is today. And yet the sales have gone down owing to want of propaganda. If some systematic propaganda is carried on without increasing administrative expenses, I have little doubt that the sales of khadi can be increased in spite of the rise that will take place in the prices.
 But it is well to be prepared for the worst. The Association must not be deterred from doing the just thing by the spinners for fear of the public demand falling. It must, however, if need be, remove from its list of spinners those who do not need the support of spinning for their food. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of spinners who spin for gaining a few pice not for buying food, but for buying tobacco, bangles or the like. If there is pressure, these may be told to abstain from competition with those who need coppers for their food. The vast majority of spinners are such. The question, therefore, for workers is to find who are the needy ones in terms of the Association scheme. From the definition will be excluded those petty cultivators who employ labour and who are not ordinarily in want of food and clothing and who are not obliged to sell their holdings or other property to buy food with. But it will strain every nerve to give spinning work or other work accessory to spinning, assuring for every one of the occupations not less than a minimum subsistence wage at the rate of eight hours a day, to all those landless and propertyless workers who would starve partially or wholly but for the work found for them by the A.I.S.A.or the A.I.V.I.A. Conversely, these Asso- ciations will not concern themselvesnot for want of will but for want of sheer abilitywith those who eke out a living in some other way. If these bodies succeed to the full in their mission, they will have not only fulfilled their mission but they will have indirectly helped all the other needy ones and turned their lives of blank despair into those of bright hope.

54,,NOTES,"
    
 TREE COTTON AND SPINNING
 Of Shrimati Kiranprava Chaudhuri of Noakhali, who was good enough to send me a beautiful specimen of khadi woven from yarn of her own spinning, a friend of hers writes:libtech_55_footnote
 I congratulate this sister on her devotion to khadi. Her emphasis on growing tree cotton is supported by several khadi experts throughout India. The experiment is worth making on a fairly large scale all over India. Evidently it does not require any expense worth the name. And if it is true that tree cotton does not need carding, it must mean a great advantage over the ordinary plant cotton. I would like those who spin tree cotton to send me their experiences and if possible samples of their cotton and yarn, as also the seeds.

    MY 	DEAR JAWAHARLAL,  [October 10, 1935]libtech_62_footnote 
  	I wanted to write to you on Sunday but I was so busy that I simply 	could not do it. That was to be in answer to your letter enclosing 	copy of your letter to Agathalibtech_63_footnotelibtech_64_footnote. Yours to Agatha gave me an insight into the working 	of your mind which I would not miss for anything. She fully deserved 	that frankness. I can endorse most of your sentiments. You do not 	know that I have written to her more than once in much the same 	strain though in my own way and my own language. Nevertheless if 	Kamala shows distinct signs of improvement and if you are free to go 	[to] London and the way is open, I would like you to see the big 	ones, open yourself out to them even as you have to Agatha.  	But your letter received yesterday shows that you may not leave 	Kamala’s bedside just yet. After all you have been freed for that      
 purpose and if Providence keeps you chained to Kamala’s bed, we must not grumble. You have gone there to see her through the terrible ordeal. How I wish I was there to share your burden and cheer Kamala! As I saw her for two days in Bombay before her departure, I observed that she never had so much peace of mind as she seemed to enjoy then. Her faith in the benevolence of God, she said, was never so bright as then. Her mental disturbance had vanished and she did not mind what happened to her. She went to Europe because you all wished it; it seemed to be her obvious duty to do so. If she lives, she will live for greater service than she has yet rendered. If she dies, she will do so to come down to earth with a body more fitted for her task than the one she has today.
 It is well too that Indu’slibtech_65_footnoteliterary studies remain suspended for a while. For me, she is having a training that is of far greater value than any she would have in a college. She is having her training in the University of Nature. She may give the finishing touch by completing her literary studies.
 I am going through your chapters with the deepest interest. I should like to finish them at a single sitting as Mahadev did and as Khurshedlibtech_66_footnotealmost did. I have no such good luck. I must reserve my opinion till I have reached the last chapter.libtech_67_footnoteI  am  thankful  that  you have sent them to me.
 I am not going to talk to you about the politics. It is enough for my purpose that you will shoulder the burden, if it falls to your lot. That it will, seems to me to be a foregone conclusion.
 You will read the accompanying to Kamala, if you think fit. Indu used to write to me a few lines when you were not there. Now I suppose she thinks she is absolved from the task !

All I have to say to you 	is to live in unity, taking care to lead a pure life by observing 	chastity of body, mind and speech. You should resort to 	Hindi-Hindustani to communicate with one another and open Hindi 	schools and libraries.  M. K. GANDHI 	From a facsimile of the Hindi: Surinameke 	Pravasi Bharatiyonke Nam         October 	11, 1935  CHI. CHHAGANLAL,  	I got your letter. Encouraged by you, I am pressing Jivanlalbhai. I 	am sending your letter to him. I will write to you after I receive 	his reply.  	If Pranjivan Joshi has already been relieved I will not waste time 	in inquiring into the matter now.  	Let me know the result of your experiments in making manure out of 	bones and carcasses. 
 You shouldn’t have had the difficulty which you had regarding the use of hand-made paper. The argument has often been advanced against the use of khadi and we have solved the difficulty in but one way. Though khadi is relatively costly, those who have understood its importance have found a way of making it cheap for themselves. Many of us, for instance, reduced the consumption of cloth after they started using costly khadi and on the whole effected some saving. Those who could not reduce consumption saved on other items but did not accept defeat. Similarly, when we resolved to use hand-made paper, we reduced writing or included more matter in a given amount of space than previously. We stopped using envelopes costing four or five pice and started using postcards costing three pice only.  I  resumed here the practice of writing on small slips of paper, which I used to follow in jail. On the balance, therefore, our expenditure on postage has not increased.
 I do not know how things are in Delhi. But I hope Malkani has started practising economy. What we give to the Government is in fact given to ourselves, It is, therefore, not right to think that we should spend less on postage because the money goes to the Government. Even when the Government will be in our hands, it will certainly not be proper for public workers to spend extravagantly on postage. In jail, we tried to keep the consumption of everything to a minimum because we thought that all things in the country belonged to us. For, no matter who ran the Government, everything it owned belonged to us, the people. The money that we give to the Government is spent for Government purposes.
 Because the Government money is spent extravagantly when the Government is in foreign hands, it does not mean that such money ceases to be ours. It is our duty of course to check its extravagance. But so long as it continues, it is we, the people, who provide the money in one way or another. Hence the argument of increase in postage should not be advanced against the use of hand-made paper. In propagating the use of such paper, the expenditure on postage may perhaps go up in the beginning. Even them, if the use of hand-made paper is likely to increase through our example we ought not to  grudge the additional expense on postage. Those teachers who see the moral necessity of manual work will themselves find out some crafts which they can take up. Nobody else can advise them in this matter.

68,"October 12, 1935",LETTER TO A VILLAGE WORKER libtech_80_footnote,"
    
 [Before October 12, 1935]
 You will borrow cotton this season, but next year you must grow your own cotton. Anyone will permit you to grow a few cotton trees in his field. The seed should be the tree cotton or devakapas. It lasts for ten to fifteen years and the cotton, I am told, does not need to be carded. I have not used to cotton myself but propose to do so.
 You are right that I did not like your leaving your place even for a couple of days. I did not like it because it is a pastime with you, and the best discipline for you is to settle down quietly and work away uninterruptedly for a year. A villager absorbed in his work has no time to go on friendly visits. We must try to emulate him. You must therefore make it a rule not to move out beyond a radius of ten miles. It is impossible to get under the skin of the villagers until one lives in their midst all the twenty-four hours for an unbroken period. The moment you relax the rule, you will find excuses for going.To be free from filth and the dog nuisance is certainly necessary, but one may not run away from them. Everyone cannot go out of his house and find conveniences for himself. One has also to cultivate that sense of cleanliness in others. One must not therefore shun people. One cannot serve them from a safe distance. I know this is easier said than done, and if you cannot sleep in the midst of these nuisances you will continue to repair to the fields. I do not want you to do anything at the risk of your health.
 Yes, you may have in course of time a grass hut, but it should not be far from the village. The people must be free to call upon us at all hours of the day and night. We must always be within easy call.
 
 The fact that you leave the village at 7 p.m. every day means that you deprive the villagers of the chance of talking to you and seeking your advice after supper, and that you will not hold even an hour’s night- school. You see the difficulty of Ashram inmates serving in the villages. The Ashram life and rules might easily become a luxury. We must realize that the villagers do not enjoy most of the amenities we enjoy with all our much-talked-of simplicity and renunciation. Man is naturally apt to turn every renunciation into a joy. Sannyasa which cannotes the highest renunciation has become today the  biggest  source of laziness and indulgence for many!
 The scavengers will slowly understand your work of love. You must make them understand that you do not want to oust them, but to improve their efficiency. You must also find out for them  more sources of income.
 Because my recent renunciation was a source of pang, it need not have grieved you. The pang was a source of joy, and such pangs are inevitable.libtech_81_footnote

69,,NOTES,"
    
 TO PRIVATE CORRESPONDENTS
 As time advances, my private correspondence too keeps on advancing at an accelerated speed and leaves its adversary for behind. My capacity to overtake this  ever-increasing  correspondence decreases in the same ratio as the increase in the volume of my correspondence. The mischief is aggravated by the new tasks that have come to me unsolicited. The most absorbing and fascinating is the work of village regeneration or, to adopt a current word, rejuvenation. The fascination increases with a growing perception of the difficulty of the work. My mind is living in the villages. They are calling me to bury myself in them. I do not know how this internal struggle will end. Difficulties are already cropping up to prevent such a burial. Much against my will I have been obliged to make a promise to shoulder a burden in Gujarat early next year. I know what it will bring in its trail. God’s will be done. But if a breakdown is not to take place,
 
 I must cut off as much private correspondence as possible and deal with the most necessary part of it through deputy. Then only can I at all hope to cope with the increasing call of Harijan. The extent of its scope has meant much additional burden on both Mahadev Desai and me. If the readers are to receive justice, we must free ourselves for it more than we have done hitherto.
 This is, therefore, written to invite the co-operation of my many correspondents. Let them be assured that I am not tired of the correspondence. I have prized their confidence beyond measure. It has given me an insight into human nature and its ultimate nobility I should not have had otherwise. Such correspondence I have carried on for over a generation. My writings and publication of some of my correspondence provide sufficient help to those who will know my opinion on a given problem. I know that nothing can be a substitute for personal contact. But in the nature of things it is a perishable article, very fragile. I would urge correspondents to deny themselves the temptation of referring to me on all kinds of problems. Let them take the trouble of solving them themselves with such help as writings on ethics and eternal verities can give. They will find that they will do better in the end than if they would make of me a dictionary of reference on every occasion. Any way let my private correspondents not be surprised if they find that they no longer hear from me directly or that their letters remain unanswered or are answered on my behalf.
 DUTY OF SPEAKING GENTLY
A Gujarati correspondent writes:
 Speaking unnecessarily loud affects the health of hearers. In this country and among us, women and children, more than men, are in the habit of speaking much louder than we need and a false sense of delicacy makes most of us, even though we may be aware of the noise and its ill effects, tolerate such speaking which really grates on our ears. We would not protest. This may be a sign of our ahimsa but I would not classify it under ‘courtesy’. Model Montessory schools can be abodes of peace, not so our socalled homes, much less our institutions or our public roads. You advise people not to tolerate insanitation. Cay you not do likewise about noises that are almost  equally injurious to health? I am quite clear that gentle speech should have the same place in our system of education as sanitation. May I warn you that you are yourself often guilty of tolerating
 the vice of loud speaking about you and thus injuring your health and missing the opportunity of educating public opinion.
 I must plead guilty to the charge. What the correspondent says is largely true. I have often tolerated maddening noises which could have been easily avoided. I am well aware that they are injurious to health. The object of giving place to this correspondent, however, is to draw the attention of teachers to this national defect and invite them to make a beginning by restraining their pupils from making noises and speaking loud in class-rooms and outside. In railway  trains  these noises are simply maddening. They are made in total disregard of the feelings of fellow-passengers. Many indulge in loud talks which they can easily carry on in gentle tones. In this connection I am reminded of the meetings of Sikhs in which whenever necessity arises someone on the platform puts up a board which is fastened onto  a  long  bamboo containing the words “Please avoid loud talking” or “Peace Peace”. Some such device can be adopted by passengers who notice such noises.
 WASTE INTO WEALTH
 Those who have been following what is being written in these columns on balanced diet will not have failed to understand the vast importance of bran which we simply throw away and give to our cattle. I do not grudge the cattle what they get. But it seems to me that we are thoughtless about cattle-feeding as about many other things. Cattle do not need bran so much as green fodder and seed cakes which they can easily divide with us if we will revert to the village oil- presses. But we need every ounce of the bran of wheat and rice if we are to become efficient instruments of production not to be beaten on this earth by any race, and yet without the necessity of entering into killing competition or literally killing one another. But I must not prolong what is becoming a heavy preface to a simple recipe which a friend has passed on to me for treating wheat bran. He is obliged to his sister for it. Here it is:
 Grind sufficient wheat coarse to give you one pound of bran which you get by passing the meal through a medium sieve. Add 1 libtech_82_footnote lb. of cold water, eight tolas of pulverized clean gur and half a tea-spoonful of clean salt to the bran and stir well. Pour the mixture in a flat vessel, cover and let it stand for full half hour. Then put a well-fitting tava or dish on the pot
 containing the mixture and stand it on hot coal and heap hot coals on top. Keep the pot between the two fires for full five minutes. Then transfer the mixture onto an iron kadai and roast on a slow fire till the water is fairly dried out. Then take the pot off the chula and let the contents cool.  Then  strain  them through a sieve with clean hands and the contents will drop on a clean cloth or board in the form of threads. Expose these to the sun till thoroughly dry. These can be taken as they are or with hot or cold milk or hot water or whey. Two ounces will make a good breakfast and is claimed to be a valuable aid to remove constipation—the bane of civilized life and precursor of many diseases.
 FOR FOUR RUPEES A MONTH
 Dr. Aykroyd, Director of Nutrition Research at  Coonoor, recently delivered an instructive lecture at Bangalore. From the lecture as published in the daily Press it appears that a well balanced diet need not cost more than Rs. 4 per month. Thus the lecturer said that:
 The dietary requirements of an adult man per day were 16 ounces of ragi libtech_83_footnote, two ounces of soya beanlibtech_84_footnote, an ounce of jaggery, four ounces each of spinach and amaranth, an ounce each of potatoes and colacasia, 1.5 ounces of coconut oil and six ounces of buttermilk—all costing about two annas.

70,,CONSOLATION FOR THE AGED AND THE INFIRM,"
    
 Dr. Sir P.C. Ray is 75 years old. He has been a weakling in body from youth upward. Yet he is foremost among the chemists of the world and retains to the present day the vigour and energy of youth. His greed for service is insatiable. He never refuses to help people in distress, especially the student world. He is so generous that swindlers have been known successfully to have exploited his name. He has not minded this. He takes pride in his prodigality and turns away from those who plead with him to discriminate. He works away till late at night, keeps an open door, and has a smile for everybody. In spite of all this output of service why does he remain so fresh when many of
 
 his contemporaries have either joined the majority or are too infirm to do any work? He gives the answer in a remarkable chapter he has written for the second volume of his autobiography. He had occasion to write to me on the event of my birthday. Without even mentioning (to him) the insignificant event (for am I not a youngster compared to him?), he quietly sends me the ‘foul’ proof of that chapter.libtech_85_footnoteIt is so full of bright hope that I have no hesitation in sharing it with the readers especially old and infirm, though I have no doubt that young people can read it with profit. To the reasons Dr. Ray has given for his energy inlibtech_86_footnoteold   age  I  would  add  his  irrepressible  humour  and  his boyishness. I have seen him shamelessly mount on the shoulders of his bulky friends like Sjt. Jamnalalji or Maulana Shaukat Ali and cracking all kinds of joke, forgetting for the moment that the world knows him as a serious scientist and Principal of a great college of science of which he is virtually also the creator.

 "
71,,THE GREATEST FORCE,"
    
 Non-violence is at the root of every one of my activities and therefore also of the three public activities on which I am just now visibly concentrating all my energy. These are untouchability, khadi, and village regeneration in general. Hindu-Muslim unity is my fourth love. But so far as any visible manifestation is concerned, I have  owned defeat on that score. Let the public, however, not assume therefrom that I am inactive. If not during my lifetime, I know that after my death both Hindus and Mussalmans will bear witness that I had never ceased to yearn after communal peace.
 Non-violence to be a creed has to be all-pervasive. I cannot be non-violent about one activity of mine and violent about others. That would be a policy, not a life-force. That being so, I cannot be indif- ferent about the war that Italy is now waging against Abyssinia. But I have resistedlibtech_87_footnotelibtech_88_footnotemost pressing invitation to express my opinion and give a lead to the country. Self-suppression is often necessary in the inte- rest of Truth and non-violence. If India had as a nation imbibed the creed of non-violence, corporate or national, I should have had no
 
 hesitation in giving a lead. But in spite of a certain hold I have on the millions of this country, I know the very grave and glaring limitation of that hold. India had an unbroken tradition of non-violence from times imm-emorial. But at no time in her ancient history, as far as I know it, has it had complete non-violence in action pervading the whole land. Nevertheless, it is my unshakable belief that her destiny is to deliver the message of non-violence to mankind. It may take ages to come to fruition. But so far as I can judge, no other country will precede her in the fulfilment of that mission. Be that as it may, it is seasonable to contemplate the implications of that matchless force. Three concrete questions were, the other day, incidentally asked by friends:
  What 	could ill-armed Abyssinia do against well-armed Italy, if she were 	non- violent? What 	could England, the 	greatest and 	the most powerful member of 	the 
 League, do against determined Italy, if she (England) were non-violent in your sense of the term?
  What 	could India do, 	if she 	suddenly became 	non-violent in your 	sense of 	the term? 
Before I answer the question let me lay down five simple axioms
of non-violence as I know it:
  Non-violence 	implies as complete 	self-purification as 	is humanly possible.  Man 	for man the 	strength of non-violence 	is in exact proportion 	to the 	ability, not 	the will, of 	the non-violent 	person to 	inflict violence.  Non-violence 	is without 	exception superior to 	violence, i.e., 	the power 	at the 	disposal of 	a non-violent 	person is 	always greater 	than he would have if he 	was violent.  There 	is no such 	thing as defeat 	in non-violence. 	The end of 	violence is surest defeat.  The 	ultimate end 	of non-violence 	is surest 	victory—if such a 	term may be 	used of 	non-violence. In 	reality where 	there is no sense of defeat, 	there is no sense 	of victory. 
 The foregoing questions may be answered in the light of these axioms.
  If 	Abyssinia were 	non-violent, she would 	have no arms, 	would want 	none. She would 	make no appeal 	to the 	League or 	any other 
 power for armed intervention. She would never give any cause for complaint. And Italy would find nothing to conquer if Abyssinians would not offer armed resistance, nor would they give co-operation willing or forced. Italian occupation in that case would mean that of the land without its people. That, however, is not Italy’s exact object. She seeks submission of the people of the beautiful land.
  If 	Englishmen were 	as a 	nation to 	become non-violent 	at heart, 	they would 	shed imperialism, 	they would 	give up 	the use of 	arms. The 	moral force generated by 	such an 	act of  renunciation 	 would stagger Italy 	into willing surrender 	of her designs. 	England would then be 	a living 	embodiment of 	the axioms 	I have 	laid down. The 	effect of 	such conversion 	would mean the greatest 	miracle of all 	ages. And yet if 	non-violence is 	not an 	idle dream, some such 	thing has some day to come to pass somewhere. I live in that faith.  The 	last question may 	be answered 	thus. As I have 	said, India as 	a nation is 	not non-violent 	in the 	full sense of 	the term. 	Neither has she 	any capacity for 	offering violence—not 	because she has no 	arms. Physical 	possession of 	arms is 	the least 	necessity of 	the brave. 	Her non-violence 	is that 	of the 	weak. She 	betrays her 	weakness in 	many of 	her daily 	acts. She appears 	before the 	world today as 	a decaying nation. 	I mean 	here not in 	the mere 	political sense 	but essentially 	in the 	non-violent, moral 	sense. She lacks 	the ability 	of offer 	physical resistance. 	She has no 	consciousness of 	strength. She is 	conscious only 	of her 	weakness. If she were 	otherwise, there would 	be no communal problems, 	nor political. 	If she were non-violent 	in the consciousness 	of her 	strength, Englishmen 	would lose their role of 	distrustful conquerors. 	We may 	talk politically 	as we like 	and often 	legitimately blame the 	English rulers. But 	if we, 	as Indians, 	could but for a 	moment visualize 	ourselves as a 	strong people disdaining 	to strike, 	we should 	cease to fear 	Englishmen whether as 	soldiers, traders 	or administrators, 	and they 	to distrust 	us. Therefore 	if we became 	truly non-violent 	we should 	carry Englishmen with us 	in all we might do. 	In other 	words, we being 	millions would 	be the 	greatest moral 	force in the 	world, and 	Italy would listen to 	our friendly word. 
 The reader has, I hope, by now perceived that my argument is but a feeble and clumsy attempt to prove my axioms which to be such must be self-proved.
 Till my eyes of geometrical understanding had been opened, my brain was swimming, as I read and re-read the twelve axioms of
 Euclid. After the opening of my eyes geometry seemed to be the easiest science to learn. Much more so is the case with non-violence. It is a matter of faith and experience, not of argument beyond a point. So long as the world refuses to believe, she mustawait a miracle, i.e., an ocular demonstration of non-violence on a mass scale. They say this is against human nature—non-violence is only for the individual. If so, where is the difference in kind between man and beast?

72,"October 13, 1935",SPEECH AT A.I.S.A. COUNCIL MEETING libtech_89_footnote,"
    
 WARDHA,
 [On or before October 13, 1935]libtech_90_footnote
 We must once for all dismiss the thought of competing with futile soul-killing economics. Do you know the insidious  way  in  which Japanese fents are glutting the market? Whereas less than five years ago they were a few thousand yards, they amount to millions of yards today. How can you compete with these? No, we must no longer aim at reducing the prices in order to meet this competition. We have all these years thought of the consumer and done precious little for the spinner, forgetting that the Association was a spinners’ association, not an association of consumers. We have to be the true repre-sen- tatives of the spinners which we have ceased to be. The result is that we have simply jogged on and relied on the political upheavals and indulged in a kind of gamble. ‘What is the use of all the fancy advertisements that you have been  giving?’  I  asked  Jerajanilibtech_91_footnotelibtech_92_footnote.  ‘We shall soon end in justifying the charge that we are maintaining the institution in order to provide work for the middle-class unemp-  loyed.’ It is therefore that I suggest that we should no more incur losses in order to exploit the neediest of our fellowmen. ‘In order to give a hundred women a satisfactory wage, you will run the risk of depriving thousands of them of employment?’ is the question that was put to me. I say it is a crisis that it is necessary to produce in order to get rid of a remittent fever. Our goal is to see a spinning-wheel in the
 
 hands of every adult villager and a loom in every village. We may have produced millions of rupees worth of khadi but we have gone nowhere nearer the goal. I ask you to forget the cities and  the consumer in the cities. Concentrate on making the thirty crores of our villagers produce and use their own khadi, and the one crore of the city-dwellers will automatically begin wearing khadi. Do not mind a temporary lull or a breakdown. If there is no demand, do not produce the supply. Where your bhandars are run at a loss close them down, and tell all those who care to have your khadi that you are prepared to get it made for them but only at the revised rates.
 But I do not want to thrust my proposal on you. You may reject it, if it fails to carry conviction. Do not assume on your shoulders heavier responsibility than they can bear. Cut your coat according to your cloth. Let me tell you that in the production centre at Savli there are already spinners who are satisfying the conditions of the new wage and have begun to earn from three to four annas daily. Concentrate on self-sufficing khadi wherever it is possible, and a healthy khadi atmosphere will grow out of it. In Kathiawar, for instance, for a time they made desperate attempts to run several centres and to stimulate the sale of khadi thus produced. They have given it up now, and among the replies that Sjt. Shankerlal Banker has received is one from the Secretary of the Kathiawar Branch to the effect that he has no criticism to offer and no opinion to express on the new policy, inasmuch as all the production in that centre consists of self-sufficient khadi.libtech_93_footnote

73,"February 24, 1872",SIXTY-THREE YEARS AGO AND TODAY,"
    
 From a circular issued on February 24, 1872, we find that cotton used to be consumed in the following quantities in Vadod  in  Kathiawar:
 
           Twine   300    seers     Ropes 							and muzzles    250    ,,     Webbing    46    ,,     Indian-made 							cloth    2,000    ,,       
 
           Mattresses   75   ,,     Sewing 							thread    50    ,,     Wicks 							for lamps    75    ,,     Sacred 							thread    4    ,,          2,800    ,,       
 10,000 seers [of cotton] was sent elsewhere. The same circular states that the spinning-wheel alone was used for spinning and women belonging to the Kanbi, Koli, Rajput, Vania, Brahmin, Khoja, Memon, Darji, Luhar, Suthar, Mochi, Ghanchi, Dhed, Bhangi and all other communities used to engage in spinning. The Dheds alone did the work of weaving with looms. Altogether, 53 spinning-wheels and 10 looms were in operation. The following is a communitywise break-up of the women who did the work of spinning:
 11 Kanbi [peasant]	1 Brahmin
 10 Koli [farm labourer]	4 Rajput
 5 Soni [goldsmith]	1 Bhangi
 1 Pinjara [Muslim carder]	1 Darji [tailor]
 1 Bharwad [shepherd]	1 Luhar [blacksmith]
 1 Khoja [Ismaili Muslim]	2 Mochi [cobbler]
 8 Vania [bania]	3 Memon [Kathiawar Muslim]
 Valand [barber]	1 Bawa [sadhu] Suthar [carpenter]	1 Khavas [a 	mixed caste] 
 The gentleman who has sent this circular writes to say that not even two seers of cotton is spun now at a place where sixty-three years ago they used to spin 2,000 seers, not a single spinning-wheel plies, the few weavers who are there weave millyarn. The production of cotton in Vadod and Kathiawar has increased, not decreased. And the situation that obtains in the large industries is also to be found in the smallest industries. We can easily imagine how  impoverished  the people would become when they do not utilize the raw material grown in their vicinity but instead sell it to others. And this is what we  actually see today. The small-scale industries which once flourished in the villages are no longer there. Hence men and women are unemployed for most of the time. And what else could the idle minds be if not the Devil’s workshops?

  October 	15, 1935  With 	reference to Dr. Ambedkar’s speechlibtech_102_footnoteat Yeoli, Mahatma 	Gandhi said:  	The	speech	attributed	to	Dr.	Ambedkar	seems	to	be unbelievable. If, 	however, he has made such a speech and the       . 	. . Choose any religion which gives you equality of status and 	treatment.” On Ambedkar’s advice, the Conference unanimously 	passed a resolution urging complete severance of the Depressed 	Classes from the Hindu fold and their embracing any other religion 	which guaranteed them equal status and treatment with the other 	members of it. 
 conference adopted the resoultion of complete severance and acceptance of any faith that would guarantee equality, I regard both as unfortunate events, especially when one notices that in spite of isolated events to the contrary, untouchability is on its last legs. I can understand the anger of a high-souled and highly educated person like Dr. Ambedkar over the atrocities as were committed in Kavitha and other villages.libtech_103_footnotelibtech_104_footnoteBut religion is not like a house or a cloak which can be changed at will. It is more an integral part of one’s self than of one’s body. Religion is the tie that binds one to one’s Creator and whilst the body perishes, as it has to, religion persists even after death. If Dr. Ambedkar has faith in God, I would urge him to assuage his wrath and reconsider the position and examine his ancestral religion on its own merits and not through the weakness of its faithless followers. Lastly, I am convinced that change of faith by him and those who passed the resolution will not serve the cause which they have at heart; for millions of unsophisticated, illiterate Harijans will not listen to him and them when they have disowned their ancestral faith, especially when it is remembered that their lives, for good or for evil, are intertwined with those of caste Hindus.libtech_105_footnote

85,,SOYA BEANS,"
    
 
 It has been found that soya beans can be cooked whold and eaten like any other beans. Shri Narhar Bhave of Baroda, who has given his three gifted and gentle sons, Vinoba, Balkrishna and Shivaji, to national service, is himself a careful observer, 61 years old. He is living almost wholly on milk and six ounces of soya beans and is keeping perfect health and strength. He is of opinion that soya beans help him to avoid constipation which milk alone or milk taken in combination with cereals and vegetables could not do. Soya beans have in his opinion helped him also to avoid flatulence which other pulses or milk produced. He has come to this conclusion after an unbroken experience of over ten months. I may add that Shri Bhave used to suffer from gout and corpulence and had a trace of diabetes. He got rid of this triple disability by mere careful dieting. In imitation of Shri Bhave the inmates of Maganwadi including me have been trying soya beans for the last few days. It is too early yet  to  pronounce any opinion for ourselves. Each inmate gets a heaped dessert-spoonful per day. This is how the beans are cooked: Clean the beans of foreign particles or dirt, wash in cold water and soak at least for twelve hours, and not more than eighteen, and drain  off superfluous water. Put these beans in boiling water and cook for fifteen minutes on a quick fire. No salt or soda to be added while cooking. Salt may be added later.libtech_115_footnotelibtech_116_footnoteAt Maganwadi we steam them for two hours. Let those who are interested in food-reform from the poor man’s point of view try the experiment. It should be remembered that
 
 soya beans are a most nutritious diet. It stands at the top of all the known articles of diet because of its low percentage of carbohydrates and high percentage of salts, protein and fat. Its energy value is 2, 100 calories per lb. against 1,750 of wheat and 1,530 of gram. It contains 40 per cent of protein and 20.3 per cent of fat against 19 and 4.3 respectively of gram and 14.8 and 10.5 of eggs. Therefore no one should take soya beans in addition to the usual protein and fatty foods. The quantity, therefore, of wheat and ghee should be reduced and dal omitted altogether, soya beans being themselves a highly nutritious dal. We are just now trying the Manchurian variety. The Baroda beans we have not tried. Maganwadi has its own crop of soya beans. I hope to report the quality of Indian varieties from a layman’s point of view as they come under my observation. Those who have Indian varieties are requested to send me samples with prices.

87,,NOT PATCHWORK,"
    
 
 A correspondent whose earnestness is unmistakable wrote some time ago a long, very long letter declaiming against the anti- untouchability campaign and the methods adopted by the Harijan Sevak Sangh to combat the evil. He called it all patchwork. The letter lay in my file for several weeks, always making room for something which I then considered more important and pressing. With great difficulty I have reduced the letter to readable compass. Here it is:
 I hold that your programme re: ‘untouchability’ is misconceived for the following reasons: You presume that ‘untouchability’ is nine-tenths of the ills of Harijans and its removal the only cure. You feel it a social and religious curse. I respectfully disagree with you. I hold the whole trouble is directly economic. Social and religious aspects that have gained ascendancy in the public view only serve the purpose of sugar-coating. We have been long trained by our ancestors (who knew the proper clue to it) to close our eyes to the bitter pill inside, but it mocks at us grimly in all its naked truth. I believe that ‘untouchability’ is bound to disappear along with the disappearance of the inferiority complex of the Harijan. Remove the causee of  his  poverty, improve his economic conditions, fight for a more equitable distribution of national wealth, make the Harijan feel that he has to revolt against the existing capitalistic exploitation; then a panoramic view of his future will be opened to him and he will then need no outside agency to count the steps of his progress and caution halt at measured intervals.
 You believe ‘untouchability’ is peculiar to Hindu society and confined to our own land. But my view is totally different. It is a universal problem facing every land and the Harijan that inhabits it. So the solution to root out this evil must be one which is common to all lands, and which goes to the root of the matter, and one ought not to be satisfied only with lopping off the topmost branches. After all, what is ‘untouchability’? It is treating a whole race of men as lepers and denying the elementary rights to them. Mere touching or not touching is just a symbol and a symptom of the corroding disease, viz., subjection, and matters little or nothing to the victim so long as the main cancer is not sought to be removed. In this view, ‘untouchability’ is a  universal menace and all oppressed peoples have got to rebel against it. It has taken various guises in various countries with difference in  degree. Everywhere, its basis is economic which is miscalled ‘political’. Indian ‘untouchability’ arose, I believe, out of the conquest of Aryans over the so- called ‘Aborigines’ to whom the present-day Harijan has to trace his ancestry.
 American ‘untouchability’ towards the Negroes is rooted in the land-greed of the white man who first travelled to America in the Mayflower. The Hitlerian hatred of the Jew, the Bolshevik’s hatred of the bourgeoisie, the Chinaman’s fear of the ‘Mikado’ are all traceable to the same source, viz., economic exploitation, euphemistically called ‘Politics’. The Indian ‘asprishyata’, the American ‘lynching’, the Belgian ‘Congo’, the Nazian persecution of the Jews are outstanding examples of this injustice, and world wars are their natural culmination.
 Again ‘untouchability’ or, to speak more correctly, the inferiority complex of the conquered original owners of this land, was  a  bourgeoi political necessity of the Aryans for keeping the comparatively inferior races of the Harijans under eternal subjection solely for economic ends, that is, for permanently maintaining the superiority in status of the conqueror over the conquered. The much-advertised I.C.S. steelframe superiority, the recent uncouth reminder to the African Negro chief Tesh-Kendy by his European masters, the preferential treatment claimed [by] and conceded to those of European extraction are but living reminders of this hiatus which have been carefully conceived to enable smaller but more powerful nations to exploit bigger but weaker peoples.
 This explains and greatly probabilizes the imposition, for economic ends, of cruel disabilities by the conquering Aryan hordes over the vanquished forces of the sons of the soil. Then followed as night did the day the engine of ruthless suppression, and every effort was made to introduce and establish this racial superiority in matters of residence, association, eating and drinking and in every walk of life. Poets sang praises of this system and Puranas sealed it with divine approval. The Harijan, like the Natal Indian, was feared in commercial competition, too, and there came the law ousting him from main business centres and important thriving trades. The impoverished Harijan reduced to mere manual labour became half-naked, huddled in huts, developed insanitation and illiteracy and, to use Arnold’s language, “bowed low and let the storm to pass”. He had of course to pay the penalty for being a conquered nation, as others do.
 You do not believe in the existence of class struggle and are not prepared  to unseat those owners of the so-called vested interests for the mere reason that their ‘status quo’ ought not to be disturbed. You refuse to recognize that the interests of the capitalists and the labourers are bound to clash with each other so long as the inequality in their present position is approved and sought to be maintained.
 The Harijan asks for bread but a stone is your answer. For aught I know about the Harijan, he is least concerned about his ‘touch me not’ trouble. I am sure you realize that the Harijan’s untouchability is too deep to be removed by an occasional inter-dining, demonstrative sweeping in  the  slums, ceremonious entries into the village temples and merciful distribution of
 clothing and sweetmeats, which seem to be the type-design programme that is chalked out for the much tired Congressman. To all appearance,  the programme seems to go on merrily. Details of boys holding scholarships in the till-recently banned schools, instances of temples and wells thrown open, are tabulated in Harijan, but what strikes me most pointedly is: Is the Harijan going to bee satisfied with all this? Can we say that he is on the shortest road to his salvation? I would only wonder what the response would be if the public are asked to give better wages for shorter hours of work and do their duty by the impoverished Harijan.
 To be true to you, I feel compelled to state that the too much stress you have laid on this comparatively minor problem, in preference to their more vital needs, leads the Harijans to self-deception, binds them to the chariot- wheel of capitalistic exploitation, and puts off indefinitely the day of their economic freedom, which their brethren in other countries are striving hard to secure.
 Such argument was heard when I was touring in the South in the Harijan interest. It is well, however, to have it summed up in a letter. The mistake the correspondent makes is in thinking that the struggle against untouchability ends with the remonval of touch pollution. The campaign had to begin with the removal of the impassable religious bar. Those who come under the religious ban are a class apart. To them the taint attaches by birth. Who does not know that these men though they may be economically well off are still treated as social lepers? Thousands of Ezhawas in Travancore and Namosudras in Bengal are very well off and yet to their great sorrow and to the equally great disgrace of the so called savarna Hindus, the former’s possession of the good things of the earth makes no difference in their social status.
 There is no difficulty in admitting that much will remain to be done after the bar sinister is removed. Indeed it is the recognition of this obvious fact that has impelled the Harijan Sevak Sangh to handle educational and economic work among Harijans which the correspondent seems to be little. That work serves the  Harijans tangibly and tests the sincerity of the reformers and brings them in close touch with those whom they are out to serve.
 When untouchability is altogether gone, Harijans will share the benefit with the others of the economic uplift that is silently but surely going on. Harijans contribute, say, 16 per cent of the total population of India. But those who suffer from economic exploitation form at least 90 per cent of the population. It is for that reason that I have said
 in these columns that the missions of the A.I.S.A., A.I.V.I.A. and Harijan Sevak Sangh are inter-related, and that is why the scope of Harijan has been extended.
 The correspondent is wrong in suggesting that I do not believe in the existence of class struggle. What I do not believe in is the necessity of fomenting and keeping it up. I entertain a growing belief that it is perfectly possible to aviod it. There is no virtue in fomenting it, as there is in preventing it. The conflict between moneyed classes and labourers is merely seeming. When labour is intelligent enough to organize itself and learns to act as one man, it will have the same weight as money if not much greater. The conflict is really between intelligence and unintelligence. Surely it will be folly to keep up such  a conflict. Unintelligence must be removed.
 Money has its use as much as labour. After all money is a token of exchange. A person having 25 rupees has, say, 50 labourers per day at his disposal, regarding eight annas as the wage for a day of eight hours. A labourer who has 49 fellow-labourers working  in unison with him is even with the person who has Rs. 25.  The advantage, if any, will be with the one who has monopoly of labour. If both are even there will be harmony. The problem therefore is not to set class against class, but to educate labour to a sense of its dignity. Moneyed men after all form a microscopic minority in the world. They will act on the square, immediately labour realizes its power and yet acts on the square. To inflame labour against moneyed men is to perpetuate class hatred and all the evil consequences flowing from it. The strife is a vicious circle to be avoided at any cost. It is  an admission of weakness, a sign of inferiority complex. The moment labour recognizes its own dignity, money will find its rightful place, i.e., it will be held in trust for labour. For labour is more than money.

88,,DUTY OF REFORMERS,"
    
 I gladly publish the following letterlibtech_120_footnotefrom the Principal, Sanatan Dharma College, Lahore:
 There can be no doubt that there must be a relentless war waged against this vice. I have gone through the gruesome reports enclosed with this letter. These are of a different type from those dealt with by
 
 me in the articleslibtech_121_footnotelibtech_122_footnoteto which the Principal refers. They had reference to cases exclusively of seduction by teachers. The reports now sent mostly deal with cases of unnatural assaults committed by goondas on boys of tender age and then murdered. Though the cases of unnatural assaults followed by murder appear more hidious, I believe that they are more capable of being dealt with than the cases in which boys become willing victims of their teachers. Both require incessant vigilance by the reformer and the rousing of  public  conscience against the commission of this disgusting crime. It is the duty of leaders in the Punjab, in which this crime seems to flourish most, to get together, irrespective of race or creed, and devise methods of protecting the youth of the land of five rivers from criminals whether as seducers or ravishers and murderers. It is no use passing resolutions condemning the criminals. All crimes are different kinds of diseases and they should be treated as such by the reformers. That does not mean that the police will suspend their function of regarding such cases as public crimes, but their measures are never intended to deal with causes of these social disturbances. To do so is the special prerogative of the reformer. And unless the moral tone of society is raised, in spite of whatever may be written in the newspapers such crimes will flourish, if only for the simple reason that the moral sense of these perverts had become blunt and they rarely read newspapers, especially those portions which contain fervent exhortation against such vices. The only effective way I can conceive of, therefore, is for some enthusiastic reformers like the Principal of the Sanatan Dharma College, if he is one, to gather together other reformers and take concerted measures to deal with the evil.

 "
92,,ABOUT SNAKE-BITES,"
    
 
 I give below a summary in my words of the questions put by a Harijan reader and my answers:
 Q. Is there any risk involved in making vertical and horizontal cuts over a [snake-] bite? And, if there is any, is it proper to invite one risk in order to avoid another?
 A. There is no risk at all in making a cut over the bite. It would have been easier to follow if the translator had used the word 'incision' instead of ‘cut’. The only purpose of making an incision is to drain some blood out. Such superficial incision does not hurt much; and anyone who has been bitten does not feel the pain at all and because he gradually tends to lose consciousness the cells in his brain become so insensitive that he has little awareness of what his body is being subjected to.
 Q. Please explain clearly how the tender skin covering the bones escapes injury.
 A. The previous passage explains this. The razor's edge does not reach the bone while making an incision. Instead of the  skin  we should think of layers. We should imagine that there are layers
 
 beneath the skin which we can see and touch. The incision which has to be made is just to open up the skin. In that case the edge of the knife cannot even reach the layer of the skin immediately next to the bone.
 Q. What is meant by ""using the blade of the safety razor after passing it over a flame""?
 A. The blade should be passed back and forth over a lighted match until the latter burns out. This would take only a few seconds.
 Q. Is there no danger of death to the person who sucks [the poison]?
 A. If he has no ulcers in his mouth, there is no danger of death or of any other harm. If he has ulcers, there is no question of his sucking.
 Q. You write of mud-pack remedies, but you cannot give any assurances.
 A. I can give no guarantee whatsoever. Moreover,  who  will permit me to make sufficient number of experiments to give any assurance?
 Q.   The   sixth   question   is   that   I   should   have   writtenlibtech_127_footnoteexhaustively about identifying the different kinds of snakes.
 A. Nothing is gained by putting before the reader something which I find it difficult to understand because even if I understood, it cannot help me in identifying the kinds. Those who [want to] understand this matter more than I do ought to obtain the literature for themselves and go through it; this literature can generally  be  found in libraries.
 Finally, I may add that I am collecting further knowledge about snake-bites and if I find anything more valuable, I shall certainly inform the readers. An experienced doctor, who is an old friend, writes to say that there is no likelihood of anything new and worth communicating coming to light. I may say that Ramanama is the remedy for a bite by a venomous cobra. Luckily, such cobras are few. There is little danger of death if the other bites  are  treated immediately in the manner suggested.

93,,TWO QUESTIONS,"
    
 
 Many questions keep coming up about the new policy of the Spinner's Association, which is being framed. Here are some of them:
 Q. 1.   How can workers prepare themselves to put into effect the new policy?
 The best way is for those who have grown accustomed to the new policy to train workers from among villagers and persons who do not know English. We shall need innumerable workers if the policy of self-sufficing [khadi] is to be made widespread. This poor country cannot afford them salaries if these happen to be large. If workers are trained only from amongst the English-educated persons they would demand large salaries as their needs have increased. They no longer possess a hardy constitution. And, in a sphere where a knowledge of the English language is not essential they cannot be said to be particularly useful. Very often, their usefulness has indeed inclined. For instance, they do not like living in villages and they try to import city-life into the villages. Their bodies are less supple and only in rare cases can they become skilled craftsmen. Even when they learn a craft, they can seldom compete with ordinary craftsmen. I only want to suggest here that we should give up the craze of looking for workers who know English. This does not mean that we should boycott or despite those who know English. We should welcome any such person who is available. They are all right where they belong. The only purpose of saying this is to rid ourselves of the false notion that only those who know English are fit to be workers. If a village worker's services are available, he will bring in greater returns than the amount paid to him. An allowance of not more than Rs. 10 to 15 should be required for such a worker. And he can easily bring in by way of return that amount every month. Organizers should train such workers wherever there are khadi centres and to that extent enlarge their field of work. Workers should acquaint themselves with all the processes starting from growing cotton right up to making khadi. And if those who are in charge of these centres are themselves efficient, they can readily produce such workers at no cost.
 At present, I do not visualize any separate institution for training workers.
 Q. 2. Will the number of private traders increase or decrease with the implementation of the new policy?
 There cannot be any increase in the number of private traders. Making [khadi] self-sufficing will be the principal policy. Private traders have no place in it. They will cotinue for the purpose of selling khadi in the cities. There is very little likelihood of there being an increase in their numbers because, with the growing desire  of craftsmen to add to their earnings, private traders will progressively decrease in number. This is because the latter are impelled by the profit motive. Hence they will not be satisfied. In the new scheme, the ceilling to the seller's earnings will be fixed and whatever profit is there, will go to the craftsmen.

 CHI. NARANDAS,
 Mathew has reached here. He has no work. He says that he will go to Poona at any rate. I won't send him to you. The desire for degrees is becoming universal at present. How, then, can we blame Shardalibtech_129_footnoteand Vijayalibtech_130_footnote? Let them satisfy their desire. Only they should not expect any money from us.
 
 I got Nanubhai's letter. Is it necessary to reply to it? I can't recall his face.
 I was pained and surprised to read about Jamnadas. He had given me a firm assurance here.
 Really speaking the money collected during the Charkha Weeklibtech_131_footnoteshould be utilized in promoting khadi activities. However, do what you think best.
 Lilavatilibtech_132_footnotehas been entrusted just now with the management of the kitchen. I have of course been encouraging her to go to you. At the moment, however, she does not think of leaving this place till December. After I leave in January, she is bound to feel unhappy. Let us see what happens. Mirabehn recovered long ago. (A palatial hut has been put up for her.) She has gone to live in Sindi.
 Devdas has returned to Delhi. He is steadily improving. But he will take some time to recover completely. Ghanshyamdas has kept him at his place. I am sending herewith a letter from Jethalal Joshi. Have you relieved Pranjivan Joshi? If so, on what ground? What is truth in what Jethalal writes? What is the Seva Sangh? What has been Sushila's part in it?

 Mahatma Gandhi said that it was no fault of the religion that Dr. Ambedkar was going to make himself a convert.libtech_134_footnoteCaste Hindus and Harijans had a common religion. The enmity between those two parties was no sufficient reason for him to go against
 
 the religion. Dr. Ambedkar and Harijans might go against the caste Hindus and fight for their equality. It was a fact that the Harijans were molested by the caste Hindus at Kavitha. It should not be the case that from some such stray instances of harassment, men like Dr. Ambedkar should go against the religion. The Harijans of Kavitha might leave the place and go to other places where they would get the necessary environment to pull on. If Dr. Ambedkar was converted, many men from the depressed classes would not follow him. Anyhow the Muslim fold was thought to be a suitable place to go into. The Muslims would not be able to take many depressed classes in their fold; for they would not be able to manage them. Moreover, he said that the water-tight compartment of untouchability had been already loosened through the efforts to the Harijan Sevak Sangh and others. In such circumstances Dr. Ambedkar's threat to change his religion only showed that he was impatient and no one was able to help him in such a situation.

  Bapuna 	Patro10: 	Shri Prabhavatibehnne, pp. 	73-4           October 	22, 1935  	As today's menu was selected by me with some careful thought, and 	especially with a view to the needs of village workers, I must speak 	to you about it at some length. The idea was to provide you with 	food, nourishing and yet within the means of an average villager and 	within the possibility of an eight hours' minimum wage as we have 	fixed it, i.e., three annas.  	We were 98 diners today and the total cost of our food was Rs. 	9-14-3, which means that each meal cost slightly more than six pice. 	Here are the details:

 Vinoba had passed on the suggestion to me that I need not worry about giving all of you rotilibtech_138_footnotelibtech_139_footnotebut might simply give you wheaten porridge (that we have here every morning) and thus save a lot of trouble. No, said I to myself, you young men whom God has given strong teeth must have good hard well-baked bhakharilibtech_140_footnotelibtech_141_footnote, which anyone can make, which one can easily carry on one's person from place to place and which can keep for a couple of days. Before the dough was kneaded it was treated with linseed oil. This rendered it both soft and crisp. Then, as we must have some greens and raw vegetables, we had tomatoes and two chutneys—one made of koth fruit available in plenty in these parts and another made of leaves available in our garden. Koth fruit is known for both its aperient and astringent properties, and jaggery goes well with it and makes a delicious  chutney. The other chutney contained some cocoanut, tamarind and salt to spice the leaves. Green leaves must be eaten by us in some form on other, in order what we may get proper vitamins in our diet. The vegetable chosen was the cheapest available and grows everywhere in our villages. You will see that I allowed the use of tamarind in the preparation of chutney. In spite of the popular prejudice against tamarind, it has been found that it is a good aperient and blood- purifier. I gave copious doses of tamarind water to one of the inmates suffering from malaria with very good effect and have tried it in
 
 several cases of constipation.
 Milk is an essential article of diet. Your menu contained half a pound of milk, but you must have seen that I gave you no ghee. I hope, however, that you did not miss it. For I gave you soya beans and oil. Soya beans are rich in oil (20 per cent) and proteins (40 per cent). Ground-nuts also are rich in oil, but they have the disadvantage of containing too much starch from which soya beans are comparatively free. Milk with soya beans gives us almost all that we need in the shape of fats and there is no need for ghee at all. Why then go to all the wasteful trouble of making ghee. And where procuring good ghee is a doubtful proposition, why have spurious ghee? But milk or buttermilk we ought to have, no matter how little. Medical men say that it helps in the assimilation of the vegetable fats and proteids. Therefore ghee you can omit with impunity. I had recently two little children under my care whose diet I carefully regulated. I cut out ghee from it and found that they were none the worse for the cutting out of ghee. Of course I gave them as much milk as they wanted.
 Our menu has cost us a little more than six pice. It was a full meal and the other meals need not be so heavy  as  this.  They,  therefore, need not cost more than an anna or so.  Milk  may  be omitted for the other meals. Wheat bhakhari, soya bean and chutney should be quite enough. So this is one of the two main things you have to do—to ensure to villagers a balanced diet, and to content yourselves with the same. There may be some who burden their diet with useless articles and many whose diet is badly deficient in vitamins. You have to introduce the right kind of diet to them. You will learn cow-keeping yourselves and encourage cow-keeping among villagers. It ought to be considered a shame that milk is not available in many of our villages. The second main duty is sanitation—a most difficult thing indeed. But if you have succeeded in introducing the right kind of diet and making the sanitation of your village tolerably good, you will have rendered human bodies worthy of becoming temples of God and efficient tools for doing a good day's work.
 Khadi will certainly occupy the centre of the village industries. But remember that we have to concentrate on making the villages self- sufficing in khadi. Out of self-sufficing khadi will follow commercial khadi as a matter of course. The argument you will find elaborated in the columns of Harijan. But on you will depend the success of failure
 of khadi. People have been frightened by baseless scares. You have to restore their faith in khadi and explain to them the new policy.libtech_142_footnote
 You will of course take up any other industry available  in villages and for which you can find a market, care being taken that no shop has to be run at a loss and no article produced for which there is no market. Give eight hours of your day to any home-craft you like and show to the villagers that as you earn your wage, even so can they earn it by eight hours' work. Make Vinoba your ideal here. It is impossible for you to emulate his learning or to have his wonderful memory, but you can certainly emulate his industry and devotion to work. Go not to the villages to write commentaries on the Upanishads, which you may well do in towns and cities. Your work will provide the best commentary as does Vinoba's concentrated work. We have to infect the villagers with our passion for work. We say they have become hewers of wood and drawers of waterlibtech_143_footnotelibtech_144_footnote. In order that they may stand erect and say they shall no longer be mere hewers of wood and drawers of water for us, you have to explain to them the reason for every one of their actions and make them voluntary workers for a living wage. What Vinoba has done should be easier for these simple folks to achieve. I am told a village lad called Gulab has already broken Vinoba's record in spinning.
 You will also not take a companion to work with you.  Our policy is to send a single worker to a village or group of villages. That will enable him to bring his resourcefulness into full play. He may pick out any number of companions from the village itself. They will work under his direction, but he will be mainly responsible for the village under his charge.
 Let us not be tempted by the allurements of the machine age, let us concentrate on rendering our own body-machines perfect and efficient instruments of work and let us get the best out of them. This is your task. Go ahead with it, without flinching. There need be no despair in a field which Vinoba has made his own and where he has given the best of his 15 years. I at least have no cause for despair and that is why you find me settled down here.

 I received your long letter. Do not mind it being so long. I am sending a copy of it to Shankerlal. I would not at any time advise either you or Amba to leave Guleria. I would regard it as humiliating for you to do so. Your description of the three circumstances there is correct. Till a person has spent ten years in the same village, nothing can be said as to whether he has succeeded or failed. I simply do not believe that your stay in Guleria is failing in its purpose. I have such blind faith in your uprightness that I have never believed that you have failed in your purpose in staying there. Nor do I believe that you have lost anything yourself by staying there.
 I am trying to get the Magan spinning-wheel. Only if I do not get it from anywhere will I send for it from you. I am ready to buy ten thousand rupees worth of jaggery. I will pay even a higher price. But you should have the price fixed in advance before proceeding in the matter. Some limit must be fixed for the price. Unless that is done, the business cannot be carried on. The total quantity may be divided into cubes of one pound each and the cubes may be wrapped in paper of good quality. Do not mind if doing so increases the labour charges. I will certainly be able to obtain for it a price upto a certain limit.

110,,ON ITS LAST LEGS,"
    
 Some critics have not hesitated to observe that it was preposterous for me to claim, in answer to Dr. Ambedkar's threat to accept some other faith rather than die a Hindu, that untouchability was on its last legs in spite of Kavitha. Indeed, Kavitha itself supports my claim. Kavitha had gone on ever since its birth living peacefully till an our-zealous worker, not knowing his own limitations, had put up Kavitha Harijans to dare to send their children to the local school, though he knew that there was opposition from some Kavitha savarnas. He had hoped, as had happened elsewhere, that Harijans had successfully asserted their right to send their children to public  schools. But Kavitha savarnas showed that they had not recognized the time spirit.
 Only a few years ago the Kavitha incident would have attracted no notice. There were very few reformers then. The few were to be found mostly in towns and cities. Now, thank God, their number is increasing and presently every village will have its quota. But a few years ago Harijans could not be induced to resist untouchability on any account whatsoever. It was part of their faith as it was of savarnas' faith. These columns contain sufficient evidence of the weekly progress made by the campaign against untouchability. Phenomenal though the progress has been, Kavitha and the like show that it has not yet affected the majority of savarnas in many places. The fact is a warning to the reformers and the Harijans that much has yet to be done before the hard hearts of savarnas are melted.
 Let it be further observed that it was savarna reformers who advertised the Kavitha tragedy and gave it an all-India importance. It has agitated savarna conscience more than it has angered the
 Harijans. I have to note with shame and sorrow that even Kavitha Harijans no longer want to agitate for their rights. They have meekly submitted to the savarna impudence. In spite of all the help offered to them, they would not leave Kavitha. It is easy enough for the few that are there to earn their bread by honourable  toil  elsewhere.  The attempt of the reformers to induce them to leave Kavitha under their protection has failed.
 Even if change of faith, not on account of its inherent inadequacy but because of the unreasoning prejudice of many of its followers, were justified, in the present instance it can but defeat the cause intended to be served. Secession of stalwarts like Dr. Ambedkar can but weaken the defences of Harijans. We know, as a matter of fact, that non-Hindu Harijans, no matter how eminent they may be, are not able to help Hindu Harijans. Indeed, they are a class apart still in their adopted faiths. Such is the hold untouchability of the Indian type has on the people in India.
 Let not Dr. Ambedkar's just wrath deject the reformer, let it spur him to greater effort. For whilst it is true that the number of workers against untouchability has greatly increased, there can be no doubt that the number is yet too small to overtake the prejudice of ages. Nevertheless [with] a movement which has attained the proportions that the anti-untouchability campaign has attained and in which the slightest untoward incident can attract world-wide attention, [untouchability] cannot but be on its last legs. Humanity will not suffer it any longer.

111,,"""DEV COTTON""","
    
 
 Some of the readers of Harijan may recall the periodical publications of khadi bulletins givng all kinds of useful information to khadi workers. It was part of the pioneer work done by the late Maganlal Gandhi who built up the science of khadi. Shri T. Sreenivas of Secunderabad sends me a copy of one of these bulletins called Dev Cotton published in 1923. It is almost prophetic or rather shows how attempts were being made even in the early stages of the movement to work out a scheme or self-sufficing khadi. Now that it is to have the
 first place in the activities of the A.I.S.A. the reader will appreciate the reproduction of the bulletinlibtech_157_footnote:
 Harijan, 26-10-1935
 "
112,,NEW KHADI SCHEME,"
    
 
 The  resolutionlibtech_158_footnoteadopted  by  the  A.I.S.A.   regarding   spinners' wages and khadi policy generally deserves the careful study of every khadi worker. It can produce great changes, if the new policy is properly worked. In order to work it properly, all the instructions issued from time to time from the Centre should be meticulously carried out. Self-sufficing khadi has to receive the first place in all khadi organizations. In a way, self-sufficing khadi and production for sale will go together. Production for sale will be a by-product of self- sufficing khadi, and the latter will ensure the success of the former. As the condition of production is that the workers must be khadi-clad, they will have to make or take khadi for themselves. This they can easily do out of the (for them) very big rise in their wages which they will be receiving without having expected or demanded it. But receipt of wages will depend upon the surplus production which to be of use must command a ready sale. Thus self-sufficing methods will be easy where there are producing centres. For the spinners and other artisans will be more open to conviction than the others with whom workers have never come in touch. But some ask, who will buy khadi at higher prices? In my opinion this betrays ignorance and want of faith and resourcefulness.
 Hitherto we have confined our attention to stimulating demand in the cities: we have been urban-minded. We have never cared to study the localities immediately surrounding centres of production, we have neglected the very producers themselves. Now, before we even tested the latter, we seem to have confidence that they will respond. Why should we not have the same confidence about the people in the surrounding localities? Surely they need cloth for their daily use. Is it too much to expect them to take in some khadi manufactured by their next-door neighbours? I know that those who have made an earnest effort in that direction have never failed. Failure has been with us, not
 
 with the prospective buyers. They are always with us, it does not matter what they buy and use today. If welibtech_159_footnotelibtech_160_footnotewould study the wants of the surrounding localities, we would produce khadi that would suit their taste and arrest their attention. Khadi workers have done that before now with success for the sake of the city-dwellers. Will they now turn their attention towards rural areas? It is not so much the dearness of khadi that turns people away from it. It is our want of faith and resourcefulness. If we have faith, we shall find that the same millions are open to us as they are to the vendors of fents that come to us from the Far East. They rely upon the cheapness of their pieces to produce a demand for their wares. We may rely upon local patriotism and the tastefulness of our wares to tempt the would-be buyers of cloth.
 It is not without full justification that the Council of the A.I.S.A. has insisted upon every khadi organization being self-supporting and hence autonomous. They may no longer rely on the Centre to spoon- feed them. The central fund should be freed for tapping areas we have hitherto neglected.

117,,PROBLEMS CONFRONTING A SANITARY WORKER,"
         	A volunteer who has taken up the task of sanitation in villages has 	written a long letter from which I give the following extractlibtech_163_footnote.  	This letter may be divided into two parts—one relating to the 	incopetence of the ordinary worker and the other  about  the 	difficulties involved in the work of sanitation. It can certainly be 	said that very little progress, if at all, can be made in a task 	which is not done in an enlightened manner.  	A volunteer who does his work with sincerity will indeed come at 	last to do it intelligently. It may so happen that a person may do 	the work entrusted to him through a sense of loyalty to his superior 	but there may be an absence both of sincerity and knowledge. Such 	volunteers continue to give the expected results and we can hardly 	hope for any enlightenment or of any new discoveries resulting from 	their work. Every volunteer should become engrossed in the work 	entrusted to him and keep doing research in it. From experiences 	published in Harijan we find that this has happened in 	certain places. Some are seeking ways and means to do away with the 	indifference of the people, while others are trying to find out how 	night-soil can be     
 disposed of with the least expenditure and in the simplest manner. This is happening in relation to Sindi. The people's indifference persists. There is no response from them. Hence, Mirabehn has as a last resort gone to live there. Underlying this is the conviction that the people's indifference cannot be done away with so long as we do not find out someone to live amongst the people of every village. Methods are being evolved also for the rapid disposal of night-soil.
 There is no end to the difficulties of volunteers; the work of sanitation is more difficult than all other forms of service, as it is regarded as the meanest of tasks. There is a feeling of great disgust attached to it. Very few persons are prepared to do this work. I am of the opinion that there should be only one volunteer for every village. It is possible that this will yield result most quickly. He will realize that he alone is responsible for the sanitation of the entire village. By himself, he will never be able to cope with the entire work of sanitation  if people from the village itself do not come forward to help him. When faced with problems, human beings find out new ways; hence the English saying: necessity is the mother of invention. As in the work of sanitation so too in the task of disposal of night-soil it is difficult to find assistance from the villagers. Let us take the example of Sindi again. People there defecate publicly in their own courtyards. The neighbouring fields are surrounded by fences, so these cannot be used. No one would be prepared to go very far. The village popu- lation consists of labourers. How can the latter find the time to go to a distance? How far can the womenfolk go? If so, nothing need be said of children. Hence, as a last resort, nothing but courtyards remain for the people to make use of. Villagers are not accustomed to have a latrine in evey household. Hence so long as there are  no  public latrines in fair numbers or people are not prepared to make their own, public roads will continue to be used as latrines. In fact, so long as every individual does not acquire a knowledge of sanitation and he does not put it into practice, the practice of using roads as latrines, despite its being unseemly, is perhaps the least harmful from the hygienic point of view and may be tolerated.
 How can a single volunteer living in a village facing such a situation carry out the work of sanitation? He should  set  aside  a certain time each day for this task. So long as he is staying there, he should spend that time in educating the people and keeping the place clean to the extent that it is possible to do it singlehanded. As soon as someone is ready to take up the work of sanitation in the locality, he
 himself should seek out yet another locality in the same village. If he is capable enough he should seek the assistance of the district board and such other authorities for sanitary work. He should find out the best possible use for the night-soil which accumulates every day. He may either sell it to the owners of the fields nearby and use whatever he so earns for further sanitation work in that very area, or, if no one is prepared to purchase it, he should give it away to any farmer who is prepared to use the manure made out of it in his field and demonstrate how useful it is. This is but a trend of thought presented to the reader. I have not been able to put this idea totally into practice myself, nor to make others do so. After all this field of work is but new. Hence, for the present, there can only be an exchange of ideas. Volunteers who are doing this work will adopt from this whatever is worth adopting. They will inform me of any drawback in these ideas, and report to me the experience which they have gained wherever these have been put into practice.

If the people agree to learn some other village or 	home  industry, you may create the necessary facilities to enable 	them to do so, but see that we do not have to bear the expense for 	that. It should be possible to meet it from the sale-proceeds of the 	articles produced.

When I said good-bye to her in Bombay, I did not feel that we were parting for all time, and I naturally said: ‘We are going to meet again in a year's time, if I am out till then.’ I claim to have that hope still and I interpret your reports in that light.

From your standpoint you will be going to England at a safe time.

 DEAR FRIEND,
 I have your very interesting letter. I simply cannot tax my mind about offices. I do not even know that the Constitution is coming. That it has received the King’s assent is not of much consequence. There’s many a slip between the cup and the lip. The inauguration is still far off. Many events may happen to upset the apple-cart, and way should I worry over a thing which is highly problematical? But I can say this, that if the Constitution does actually begin to work and if I find that there is no escape from taking office, that is, if the Congress is represented in the Legislatures, I would not hesitate to say so. Just at present, I can see many an escape from the predicament.
 I do not think we need speculate about the Congress President because Jawaharlal Nehru has definitely written, saying that if the responsibility is entrusted to him, he will shoulder the burden. There should be no difficulty about his return in March.
 You will be welcome whenever you come. From January my movements become uncertain.
 Yours sincerely,

    BHAI 	VALLABHBHAI,  October 	31, 1935 
  	Enclosed is a letter from Parikshitlal. You seem to have read it. I 	think I was wrong in giving my consent. Before I correct myself, 	however, I must have a clear idea of the situationlibtech_179_footnote.  I   think  that,  if Harijans are physically 	ill-treated in a place and if they cannot get redress in any other 	way, they should leave that village and we should encourage them to 	do so. I have accepted and followed this policy for many years, both 	for individuals and groups. I started advocating it in 1906 and gave 	expression to my views in writing in 1908, and since then I have 	given the same advice on all occasions. When the Harijans     
 of Talaja and of the villages near Meerut were terrorized, I gave this very  advice.  In  Talaja,  Pattanisaheblibtech_180_footnoteintervened   on   behalf   of   the Harijans. In the village near Meerut, there was a court case which dragged on for a long time and the Harijans lost it. The lawyers and other advisers were lukewarm and the matter was not pursued. Possibly there are special reasons in the case of Kavitha which make mass migration inadvisable. But what is the harm if the Harijans, all or some of them, leave the place after serving notice on the caste Hindus? If you differ with me about this, please explain your point of view to me. I don't know if there are any special circumstances in Kavitha. You have been there and so will be able to throw plenty of light on the situation. We should not treat the Kavitha chapter as closed. We do not hear that the kind of things which happen in Gujarat ever happen in the other provinces. In Tamil Nad the relations between Nairs [sic] and Harijans are equally bad, but I have not heard of such things happening anywhere else. We must find some remedy.
 Valchandlibtech_181_footnoteis thinking of coming here and bringing Ambedkar with him.
 They have asked me about the programme to be drawn up during my visit there. It should include a tour of the Bhil areas and a tour for public collections for the Harijan Fund.

 October 31, 1935
 BHAI DAHYABHAI,
 I got your letter. If you go to a village and engage yourself in silent service, you will experience peace of mind from the very first day. The people will not be able to rival you in making speeches, but they will be able to follow your example in hard work. If anybody from among the Harijans in Kavitha still wishes to leave the place, he can do so. Parikshitlal is keeping a watch on the situation.
 What you say may be practicable where one latrine is used by one person. But in a place like Santa Cruz, as many as 25 people may be living in one bungalow. The latrine is at a height of 25 to 30 feet so that the stools fall to the ground from that height. Again, this can
 
 
 barely be removed through a dark passage. Now if there are no Bhangis in such a place, how and by whom would the latrine be cleaned? And such cleanliness maintained as you describe?
 What you say about food and drink is correct. But  since  I myself have not been able to reach such an ideal state despite my strenuous efforts, what light can I throw on the subject? May be, in order to reach it many other things are necessary besides right food. Let all of us strive our best to reach it.
May you prosper in the new year.

  	Why do you fall ill so often? I hope you don't think  that devotion 	to one's father means that whenever the latter is  ill  one should 	fall ill, too? Shravana's parents were infirm, but he made his body 	as strong as steel and took them round on a pilgrimage, carrying 	them in a kavad carried across his shoulders. King Lear's 	daughter maintained good health while serving her father. Why have 	you, then, become prematurely old? If not indigestion, you have 	fever, and if not that you have cold, but you are always suffering 	from one thing or another. Why don't you find out the reason and 	make your body as strong as steel?

136,,LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI,"
    
 October 1935
 
CHI. NARANDAS,
 I got your letter. How could you trust Harilal? How can we believe in anything he says when drunk? But I am quite guarded. I am not going to spend a single pie out of public funds for his coming here or for keeping him here. I hope you also have not promised to pay him the [railway] fare from such funds. You know that formerly he had asked me for the fare and I had plainly refused.
 Why do you insist on calling away Kanu against his will? He has settled down here now, his studies are progressing and his health also is improving. He does not at all feel happy in Rajkot. What is then the point in sending for him? He has been here only for fourteen months. He has been entrusted with responsible work. For that reason, too, it will be difficult for him to leave.
 If he is to accompany me on my tour, he wouldn't like to miss even one day from it. Such absence would stand in the way of his acquiring practical experience, and perhaps I may not be in a position to spare him at that time. When he is needed here, I am sure you will not call him away. Hence, the most convenient and the best time for him to go there would be when I am here. Let   Santoklibtech_187_footnote,  therefore, come [here] any day between now and December 31 or she may do so after I return and get settled here, that is, at the earliest after the end of March. If you take into account Kanu's inclination and my convenience, he should be called away only after March, or for a few days just now. Personally he does not wish to leave this place for the present. That also should be borne in mind. But finally your wish is to prevail. I have simply given you the facts which I know, to enable you to come to a decision. You will know from his letter what activities he is engaged in here. Do let me know your final decision. I will carry it out.
 If Jamnadas remains so ill, how will he be able to take up responsible tasks in his present condition? What arrangement has been made for his expenses? What is the expenditure on account of Chimanlal? Is all that met from the Ashram fund? What are his
 
 
 activities there? Send me the figure of the expenditure incurred every month from the Ashram reserves.
 The reasoning behind three yards and two yards of khadi is this: Satis Babu and Jethalal think that any spinner who wishes to consume three yards of khadi for personal use will, if he produces two yards of khadi for sale, realize the cost of the three yards. These figures have no importance. We have made the calculations here on a different basis. I have not gone through them. I will publish the figures when I get time.

  	It is most cheering to find you taking such interest in the spread 	of  the  charkha.  The  scheme  is  being   slowly  	inaugurated.   [The]libtech_191_footnotedemand for khadi is bound to be reshuffled…libtech_192_footnotemay for want of faith of the workers sup…libtech_193_footnotetemporary check. I would like you, therefore, as you 	travel, to sow the seed and create a demand for khadi in the 	immediate neighbourhood of production centres.

Yours sincerely,  M. K. GANDHI  From 	the original: Pyarelal Papers.

Yes; without the slightest hesitation.
 Then what would you say about great saints like Tukaram and Jnanadev?
Who am I to judge them?
 But you would judge Buddha?
 I never said so. I simply said, if I had the good fortune to be face to face with one like him, I should not hesitate to ask him why he did not teach the gospel of work, in preference to one of contemplation. I should do the same thing if I were to meet these saints.

 "
140,,NEED FOR HUMANE CUSTOM,"
    
 Dr. P.C. Ray, who at his ripe age of 75 is exhibiting in the interest of suffering humanity the energy of youth, writes:libtech_196_footnote
 The custom for fine khadi has fallen off even before  the expected or rather threatened rise in prices. When it falls further, if it does, it will do so not because of the rise in prices but undoubtedly because of want of love or humanity in the buyer. Humanity does not search for low prices in a spirit of bargain. The humane in man, even in his purchases, seeks opportunities of service, and therefore wants to know first not the price of the article of purchase but the condition of its producers, and makes purchases in a manner that serves most the most needy and deserving. If a sufficiently large number of men and women were actuated by this spirit of love of fellow beings, there would be an ever-increasing demand for khadi, and now more than ever, because of the knowledge that extraordinary care is being taken to assure to the humblest spinner at least a subsistence wage—a wage which would enable her not merely to eke out a living somehow but which would enable her to get sustaining food.
 Side by side with the attempt to give khadi artisans a subsistence wage there must be an attempt to find a better, i.e., more natural market for khadi. We have hitherto been satisfied with the easy way of obtaining custom only in the big cities—such as Bombay, Calcutta, Madras, etc. This was surely wrong. I have suggested to Dr. Ray that
 
 he should, if his health permits, deliver his message of love to the places surrounding the producing centres. The whole of Bengal wears fine cloth. Why should it not wear fine khadi? Under the new scheme it is possible to cheapen khadi if Bengal will produce cotton not for speculation but strictly for home use. But that day may be far off. For the time being Bengal as the rest of India should buy khadi for humanity's sake, not in a commercial spirit, counting the cost. We do not count the cost and find out what our children or our aged parents cost us. We support them at any cost. Should we do less for our millions of brothers and sisters who are starving by reason of our criminal neglect of them for centuries? We may leave no part of India neglected. The science of khadi requires decentralization of pro- duction and consumption. Consumption should take place as nearly as possible where khadi is produced. All effort should be directed towards that end. We may produce for the demands of the cities, but should never depend upon them as we would on the local market. We must first study the local market and supply its wants. And since all khadi artisans and wherever possible all artisans working under the aegis of the A.I.S.A. or A. I. V. I. A. will be expected to use khadi, a minimum demand will thus always be assured. Satis Babu and Shri Jethalal of Anantpur have made independent calculations and have concluded that self-sufficing khadi will mean two yards of sale outside against three yards of wear by the artisans. If the calculation is correct, self-sufficing khadi to be popular will need considerable support from local markets. Since other industries will go hand in hand with khadi, it may be that self-sufficing khadi will receive help through village industries other than khadi. The test of self-sufficing khadi lies in the fact that it will cost the wearer practically nothing but his labour. Self- sufficing khadi will never spread unless local markets are created all over the country and demand stabilized. In order to  ensure stabilization it is necessary to define areas for every producing centre so as to avoid overlapping and unhealthy competition among workers attached to the same organization.

 "
141,,GHEE,"
    
 Those who can afford it are fond of eating ghee. It enters into the preparation of almost all the sweetmeats. And yet, or perhaps by reason of it, it is one of the most adulterated articles of food The vast
 bulk of it that one gets in the bazar is undoubtedly adulterated. Some, if not most, of it is mixed with injurious fats which non-meat-eaters must not eat. Vegetable oils are often mixed with ghee. This mixture diminishes the vitamin value of ghee when it does not contain rancid oils.When the oils mixed are rancid, the ghee is unfit for consumption.
 At Maganwadi we have been insisting on procuring cow's ghee. It has meant much difficulty and great expense. We have paid as much as Rs. 29 per 40 lb. plus railage.
 This can only be for a rich man's pockets. We are trying as much as we can to approximate the poor man's standard consistent with balanced diet scale. I observed that Dr. Aykroyd had omitted ghee from his balanced diet scale.libtech_197_footnotelibtech_198_footnoteMedical testimony, while it insists on milk or buttermilk, does not insist on butter or ghee as an indispensable part of the daily menu. We have tentatively dropped ghee from our menu, except for those who consider it to be necessary for their health. We are issuing an equivalent in weight of pure fresh vegetable oils. Millions in India never know the taste of ghee. After all it should be borne in mind that those who take milk get some ghee in the purest and most assimilable form. Apart from the question of relish it may safely be said that village workers can with impunity omit ghee from their diet so long as they can procure some milk or curds or buttermilk. At the same time it is the duty of wealthy people and public bodies like municipalities to place at the disposal of the poor people cheap wholesome unadulterated milk and its products. Adulteration of milk or other foods should be as difficult as counterfeit coin or note or postage stamp, and their value should be standardized as is that of postage stamps.
 If half the skill that is today devoted to the management of commercial concerns meant for private gain were devoted to the conduct of dairies for the public benefit and shops for food-stuffs, they could be run as self-supporting institutions. There is nothing to prevent them from becoming so, except the public disinclination to give the requisite skill and capital to such philanthropic concerns. The benevolence of the wealthy is exhausted in the effort to run sadavratslibtech_199_footnote, to misfeed the ever-increasing army of beggars who are a burden on society. For they eat without labouring. It is benevolence misplaced, if it may not be described as mischievous. The difficulty
 
 amounting to impossibility of getting wholesome articles of diet at reasonable rates in every town and village is a great stumbling-block in the way of the village worker. Time is not wasted when village workers attempt to find out by experiments what in spite of this handicap are the indigenous sources of procuring an adequate diet.

142,,NOTES,"
    
 APOLOGIES TO VISITORS
 Maganwadi is taxed to its utmost limit. It has guest quarters with maximum accommodation for 12. They are principally meant for A.
 I. V. I. A. Board members and those who are invited for consultation or otherwise by the Chairman or the Secretary. But wherever I stay people gravitate from all parts. I have made it a rule to ask them so far as possible to share with me what has been put at my disposal. The result is that my abode has become a dharmashala without any private quarters. In dry weather this is no hardship. People sleep on the ample flat roof of the rooms occupied by me and the Board office. In the daytime they spread out anyhow. Living thus it is not possible for me to find comfortable rooms for an unlimited number of visitors. Yet they come without notice and without appointment. Add to this the fact that we are working without servants. Cooking, washing and cleaning are all done by us. The resources  of  Maganwadi  are therefore truly taxed when visitors come as they do without notice. I am obliged to refuse them accommodation or food. The latter is always cooked according to the number known to be resident the previous night. This is all contrary to convention. In an Indian household, a chance comer becomes an honoured guest, and he shares what is prepared for the household. But Maganwadi is not a  household. It is a trust created solely for the service of the semi- starved unemployed or semi-employed millions. We are trying in the best manner we know to husband all our resources to save every pice we can. We have therefore no warrant for providing a lavish table at which all who come may sit.
 Hence even at the risk of being considered rude or miserly, I am obliged to be very strict and turn away those who come without previous appointment. Those who have therefore been, much against my wish, refused hospitality will please extend their sympathy to me
 and excuse me. Future comers will take note of the peculiar position we are in at Maganwadi. I may mention for the convenience of those who must come without notice that within a stone's throw  of Maganwadi there is a well-appointed dharmashala capable of taking in a fair number of guests. It has private quarters too for a limited number. I would like to add that in asking for appointments would-be comers should have mercy on me. It taxes all my strength to cope with the day-to-day work. No appointment should therefore be sought except for the benefit of the tasks which at the moment engage my attention to the exclusion of all else.
 LAJPAT RAI WEEK
 The All-India Achhutoddhar Committee, which was started by the late Lala Lajpat Rai, has decided to celebrate a Harijan Week in the revered memory of the Lion of the Punjab as from 11th November to 17th November. Besides what local committees may arrange, the A. I.
 A. C. has circularized the workers in the Harijan cause all over India to observe certain common features. They are as follows:
 November 11: Prabhat pheris singing songs impressing upon the minds of all the necessity of treating the Harijans as brothers and sisters, and reciting the services of Lalaji in the Harijan cause.
 November 12: Kathas of religious literature, such as Ramayana,  Gita, Bhagawat, etc., to be read in Harijan quarters by purohits and pundits. Other Hindus should be invited to these kathas.
 November 13: Panchayats to be held in Harijan quarters or temples to which all groups of the Harijans should be invited. Speeches emphasizing removal of untouchability among Harijans themselves and other evil habits.
 November 14: Caste ladies to be persuaded to visit Harijan sisters in their quarters and establish social contacts with them.
 November 15: Baby show. Harijan mothers with their babies should be invited to a temple or dharmashala where caste ladies would meet them and award the babies presents and prizes for cleanliness and good health.
 November 16: Games. Caste students should fraternize with Harijan students and play with them indigenous games and end with light refreshments.
 Shri Algurai Shastri who has sent circulars to friends informs me that the programme above sketched is subject to change. Readers should therefore be ready for alterations that may be sent from headquarters. The chief point to remember is that the celebrations
 must be fitting to the great cause and the memory of the illustrious patriot and reformer. Workers and committees should  zealously  devote themselves to the success of the celebrations.

 "
143,,TWO QUESTIONS,"
    
 
 A worker of the Harijan movement has sent me two written questions, of which the first one is:libtech_200_footnote
 There is no dilemma here. When we take a Harijan into our family circle, we should tell him all the rules of our household at the very beginning. He should be told plainly that guests who observe untouchability also visit us and in order not to violate their principles they would be served drinks and other things by us or by the other servants. The Bhangi servant who knows this custom of ours will have no cause to feel hurt. But the above question implies that because of such behaviour a new problem faces the Bhangi. Hence, in such circumstances we should clarify our position to the Bhangi as well as the guest. Then neither is deceived and there is no dilemma.
The second question is this:libtech_201_footnote
 If this question relates to an event in the past, then it is quite pointless. I can only speak for the future. When we invite all communities of Harijans for a feast, they must be informed beforehand that the meals would be cooked and served by Bhangi Harijans only. If we do not make this clear, then we are certainly guilty of practising deception. We should never forget the fact that the poison of untouchability has permeated Harijans as well.

 "
147,,A FATAL FALLACYlibtech_203_footnote,"
    
 Among the questions that a correspondent asked me for discussion in Harijan there was one which I have kept on my file for some time:
 Don't you think that it is impossible to achieve any great reform without winning political power? The present economic structure has also got to be tackled. No reconstruction is possible without a political reconstruction and I am afraid all this talk of polished and unpolished rice, balanced diet and so on and so forth is mere moonshine.
I have often heard this argument advanced as an excuse for
 failure to do many things. I admit that there are certain things which cannot be done without political power, but there are numerous other things which do not at all depend upon political power. That is why a thinker like Thoreau said that “that government is the best which governs the least.” This means that when people come into possession of political power, the interference with the freedom of people is reduced to a minimum. In other words, a nation that runs its affairs smoothly and effectively without much State interference is truly democratic. Where such a condition is absent, the form of government is democratic in name.
 There is certainly no limit or restraint on the  freedom  of thought. It may be remembered that many reformers are nowadays laying the greatest emphasis on a new ideology. How few of us are going in for any reform in our opinions? Modern scientists recognize the potency of thought and that is why it is said that as a man thinks so does he become. One who always thinks of murder will turn a murderer, and one who thinks of incest will be incestuous. On the contrary he who always thinks of truth and non-violence will be
 
 
 truthful and non-violent, and he whose thoughts are fixed on God will be godly. In this realm of thought political power does not come into play at all. Even so it must be obvious that political power or want of it is of no consequence in many of our activities. I would make  a humble suggestion to the correspondent. Let him make a detailed note of all his daily activities and he is sure to find that many of them are performed independently of any political power.  Man  has  to thank himself for his dependence. He can be independent as soon as he wills it.
 The correspondent has raised the bugbear of ‘great’ reform and then fought shy of it. He who is not ready for small reforms will never be ready for great reforms. He who makes the best of his faculties will go on augmenting them, and he will find that what once seemed to him a great reform was really a small one. He who orders his life in this way will lead a truly natural life. One must forget the political goal in order to realize it. To think in terms of the political goal in every matter and at every step is to raise unnecessary dust. Why worry one's head over a thing that is inevitable? Why die before one's death?
 That is why I can take the keenest interest in discussing vitamins and leafy vegetables and unpolished rice. That is why it has become a matter of absorbing interest to me to find out how best to clean our latrines, how best to save our people from the heinous sin of fouling Mother Earth every morning. I do not quite see how thinking of these necessary problems and finding a solution for them has no political significance and how an examination of the financial policy of Government has necessarily a political bearing. What I am clear about is that the work I am doing and asking the masses to do is such as can be done by millions of people, whereas the work of examining the policy of our rulers will be beyond them. That it is a few people's business I will not dispute. Let those who are qualified to do so do it as best as they can. But until these leaders can bring great changes into being, why should not millions like me use the gifts that God has given them to the best advantage? Why should they not make their bodies fitter instruments of service? Why should not they clear their own doors and environments of dirt and filth? Why should they be always in the grip of disease and incapable of helping themselves or anyone else?
 No, I am afraid the correspondent’s question betrays his laziness and despair and the depression that has overtaken many of us. I can
 confidently claim that I yield to none in my passion for freedom. No fatigue or depression has seized me. Many years’ experience has convinced me that the activities that absorb my energies and attention are calculated to achieve the nation's freedom, that therein lies the secret of non-violent freedom. That is why I invite everyone, men and women, young and old, to contribute his or her share to the great sacrifice.

 "
148,,SOME WAYS OF SERVING THE COW,"
    
 Shri Purushottam Narhar Joshi who calls himself a worker in the cause of the cow writes as follow:libtech_204_footnote
 This letter deserves consideration. Only an institution can put into practice the suggestions made in it. Some of them can be implemented by Government authority alone. However, every reader of Harijanbandhu can implement one point. He should use nothing but cow's milk and ghee made from cow’s milk. Cow’s milk is better and more nourishing than buffalo’s milk. Nothing but cow’s milk should be given to children. Ghee made from this is easier to digest. The testimony of doctors and vaids regarding these two points has already been published in Harijanbandhu. Despite this, many people use buffalo's milk and ghee made from it for the sake of their taste. Some others, while prepared to drink cow’s milk, are not ready to use ghee made from it. They claim that the ghee made from buffalo's milk alone is good. It is whiter in appearance and is thicker in consistency. Many people who have become accustomed to its appearance and taste are not ready to give it up for the sake of the cow or the country. In fact the whiteness and the consistency of ghee made from buffalo's milk are themselves points against it. It seems impossible to keep both the cow and the buffalo alive. If the buffalo is to survive, the cow must perish. The buffalo is dying even now. It is because we deliberately permit the slaughter of he-buffaloes that the she-buffalo survives. If, therefore, we remain negligent, we shall be instrumental in destroying both the cow and the buffalo and shall become dependent upon milk and butter imported from countries where thousands of cows are slaughtered daily and not a single cow is even allowed to grow old. Any reader who does nothing beyond
 
 insisting upon what I have suggested will make his contribution to cow-protection and averting this terrible calamity.
 Shri Joshi refers to the Goseva Sangh. That organization is not defunct; there are some members who still belong to it. One may say that its activities as an organization are very few, nevertheless it does continue to exist. A few individual go-sevaks are being trained. A dairy is being run under its auspices. Another receives inspiration from it. At the moment, I am not in a position to point out any tangible result of its activities. Attempts are being made to demonstrate such results. God alone knows what will happen in the future.
 There is no doubt that much can be accomplished if the Indian States start implementing Shri Joshi’s suggestions. Even if the work is taken up on a large scale and in a co-ordinated manner in the States of Kathiawar alone, it cannot but succeed. And once its success is demonstrated, it cannot but spread to other parts. Shri Joshi fails to mention that a tannery is an important instrument in saving the cow. As this has been often repeated in Harijanbandhu,I do not mention it here again. But every go-sevak has to bear this fact in mind.

  	Ghani tells me that ten rupees out of his account are missing and 	that you propose to reimburse the loss from your pocket. That is not 	to be thought of for a single minute. Such things will always happen 	especially where Ghani is involved. He has been brought up in the 	lap of luxury. He is a spoilt child of his family. You must not, 	therefore, worry over the loss.

 DEAR SRINIVASARAO,
 I have a vivid recollection of our meeting at Bijapur but none of your letter. All my ‘secretaries’ were not secretaries but youngsters who were doing their very best to share my burden. Mahadev himself was in the Belgaum jail. But to show how much I value your letters and your co-operation, whenever you can give it to me, I hasten to reply per return.libtech_206_footnote
  The 	story of Rama 	and Ravana is 	to my mind an 	allegory. In 	my preface 	to Anasaktiyoga 	I have 	explained what 	I understand 	by ‘incarnation’. 	What Rama used were spiritual weapons, i.e., satyagraha 	against the material 	weapons of the 	ten-headed Ravana. 	There is 	intrinsic support in 	Tulsidas’s Ramayana 	for this interpretation.  The 	verse you 	quote from 	the Bhagavad Gita, 	in my opinion, 	emphasizes the 	interpretation that 	I have 	put upon the whole 	teaching of the 	Gita, 	namely, that 	when a man 	has lost his 	egotism and his 
 
 
 
 [XVIII. 17]
 Not only did he say this but helped, though himself unarmed, the Pandavas to conquer the Kauravas after a bloody battle in which millions of warriors were killed,  frequently with the power of his brain which proved superior to material weapons, in order to gain their birth-right. Does this not show that Shri Krishna did believe in the destruction of evil rather than in its reform by peaceful methods?  (3)  When Vishwamitra proceeded to snatch away Kamadhenu by force and when she complained  to her master Vasishtha, the latter told her that he was precluded by his vow from getting angry or retaliating, but at the same time permitted her to protect herself against the outrage. Thereon soldiers fully armed cropped up from every hair of hers and routed the army of Vishwamitra with great slaughter. Why did not Vasishtha permit her to be taken by Vishwamitra? Why did he not practise satyagraha to retain her by peaceful means? (4) It is said that Buddha died of poisoned animal food offered   to him by a devotee. We find all his followers to be flesh-eaters. How is this consistent with ahimsa? (5) Is there any instance in history  where  evil— unreformable evil—was conquered by good only by peaceful means?
 intellect remains untarnished, what though he should kill all life. In other words, such a person would be incapable of killing.
  My 	interpretation of 	the version 	of Kamadhenu 	is hat 	the rage of 	Vishwamitra was 	impotent to 	touch even a 	single hair of 	the Kamadhenu. 	It is an illustration 	of the 	famous saying that 	God is the help of 	the helpless.  Eating 	of animal 	food as 	a matter 	of habit 	is not 	inconsistent with the 	observance of 	ahimsa, even as eating 	milk and 	vegetable which 	have also life is not 	inconsistent with 	the practice of 	ahimsa. I 	have elsewhere 	argued that practice 	of absolute 	ahimsa by embodied 	life is an utter impossibility.  Perhaps 	your question 	is not 	properly put. 	There can 	be no 	question of 	conquering evil. Evil 	will always retain its 	quality but 	what we 	endeavour always 	is to induce 	our companions, 	even as 	we try ourselves, to rid 	them and us 	of evil. 	Is not history replete 	with instances 	of men 	and women, the 	most evilminded, being 	reformed by an 	appeal to 	their higher natures? I 	have not entered 	into an 	elaborate argument 	because I assume 	that you will 	take the trouble 	of procuring 	a copy 	of my introduction 	to Anasaktiyoga. 	It is translated 	into Marathi—I believe 	also in Kanarese. An 	English translation 	was published 	in the 	pages of 	Young India, 	but so 	far as 	I am 	aware it 	has never been 	published in 	book form as yet. 
I hope you are keeping well.

            CHI. 	SHARMA,       MAGANWADI, WARDHA,  November 	7, 1935 
  	I have your letter after a long wait. The surprising thing is that 	in America you did not receive even one letter of mine. You should 	have received at least three. I have the dates of posting. These 	shall be given at the end of this letter as they have to be traced 	in the diary. 
 But our agreement stipulated your writing every week irrespective of my writing or not writing. It is possible that I may have nothing much to say while you must always have something new to write about. Anyway, let bygones be bygones. Now I shall expect a letter from you every week. I have also made it a practice to send on your letters to Draupadi and Ramdas; to the latter because of his specific request and to the former just by the way. It has brought forth one result, namely, that Draupadi is obliged to write in reply. Otherwise would she have at all written to me?
 I did not expect you to pay your way so soon in America but I did hold that it would not be difficult to live on modest means. Anyway, now that you are there you may stay on till you are satisfied. You should leave only when you feel that you have nothing further to learn regarding nature cure. The experiences of America will be almost repeated in England. There, too, you will not find much by way of nature cure but it was imperative that you visit the West. Quite a few misconceptions persist until experience drives them out. From this angle I do not regard your trip unproductive.
 Do see Shelton’s place if you have not visited it so far; Govind waxed eloquent over it. His Health School is situated in San Antonio, Texas.
 You must have got the letter for England which I sent at your request.
 You ask me what I meant by saying that you would open out in America. I meant that the slight eccentricity or say a kind of kink that you possessed would be straightened out there and that you would develop the habit of living well-adjusted to others. Your account has been received. You should keep up correspondence with Bhai Brijmohanji but you need not send him an account of your expenses. You must have got the Harijan issues. They have been sent so far to Dr. Holmes's address as also my letters but this letter I am sending to Dr. Kellogg’s address. I have already forwarded to you the letter I received from Dr. Kellogg. What advice can I give you from here regarding your health except that you should be  well  protected against the cold and should walk daily at least ten miles? You should partake liberally of milk and fruit and eat salads prepared  from greens. This much should ensure good health; and keep up the breathing exercises.
 Blessings from,
 BAPU

  	I got your letter at long last after waiting for many days. How dare 	I reproach you? I accept what you give me. I must content myself 	with it. Ambujam also gives me news about you from time to time. You 	are having good experience therelibtech_210_footnotelibtech_211_footnote. Take the best advantage of it. I am sure you will 	perfect your English. The music in that place is also reputed to be 	excellent. Learn it well.

In short, since you have gone to such a distant place prove yourself 	worthy of the great, although  mono-syllabic,  namelibtech_212_footnotewhich you sport. There must be some meaning in your 	owning a name which, the Shastras say, leads to spiritual welfare. I 	want you to justify this belief. You do possess some of the virtues 	symbolized in this syllable. If you acquire a few more, you will 	need nothing else. I will also tell you another thing, in case you 	do not know it. Sanskrit words are spoken with perfect pronunciation 	in Tamilnad as in Maharashtra. Maharashtra is good in repect of 	pronunciation but the quality of music is not so high. In Tamilnad, 	the Sanskrit mantras, etc., are recited melodiously and in a 	sweet voice. You can learn all this with Ambujam's help. All this 	can be learnt with little trouble. It will not be necessary to spend 	much time over it. May this year prove good for you. Now that you 	have started writing, please keep up the practice and write to me 	from time to time.

libtech_213_footnote","
    
 
 Many a time have I rehearsed to myself what I should do if I were a member of a corporation, and when years ago I used to walk through the streets of Calcutta and compare the palaces with their beautiful and sanitary surroundings with the ugliness and want of sanitation of its slums, I used to say to myself that the work and worth of the Corporation of Calcutta should be measured not by the number or beauty of its palaces, but by the condition of its slums, and I felt that then the Corporation had neglected its duties.

159,,MEDICAL RELIEF,"
    
 
 Medical relief as part of village work or social service plays an important part in many reports I receive from numerous organizations. This relief consists of medicines supplied to patients who from far and near flock to any person who advertises himself as distributor of such relief. It means no trouble on the part of the medicine man. He need not have much or any knowledge of diseases and the symptoms. Medicines he often receives free from obliging chemists. Donations are always to be had from indiscriminate donors whose conscience is satisified if they can distribute their charity in aid of suffering humanity.
 This social service has appeared to me to be the laziest form of service and often even mischievous. It works mischief when the patient is expected to do nothing save to swallow the  drug given to him. He  is none the wiser for having received the medicine. If anything, he is worse off than before. The knowledge that he can get for nothing, or for a trifle, a pill or a potion that will correct certain irregularities will tempt him to repeat them. The fact that he gets such aid free of charge will undermine his self-respect which should disdain to receive anything for nothing.
There is another type of medical relief which is a boon. It is
 
 here.
 given by those who know the nature of diseases, who will tell the patients why they have their particular complaints and will also tell them how to avoid them. Such servants will rush to assist at all odd hours of the day or night. Such discriminating relief is an education in hygiene, teaching the people how to observe cleanliness and to gain health. But such service is rare. In the majority of cases mention of medical relief in reports is a piece of advertisement leading to don- ations for other activities requiring perhaps as little exertion or knowledge as medical relief. I would therefore urge all workers in the social field, whether urban or rural, to treat their medical activity as the least important item of service. It would be better to aviod all mention of such relief. Workers would do well to adopt measures that would prevent disease in their localities. Their stock of medicines should be as small as possible. They should study the  bazaar medicines available in their villages, know their reputed properties, and use them as far as possible. They will find as we are finding in
 Sindi that hot water, sunshine, clean salt and soda with an occasional use of castor oil or quinine answer most purposes. We make it a point to send all serious cases to the Civil Hospital. Patients flock  to Mirabehn and receive lessons in hygiene and prevention of diseases. They do not resent this method of approach instead of simply being given a powder or a mixture.

160,,SOYA BEANS,"
    
 
 Inquiries are being made as to where soya beans are to be had and how they are to be sown and in what ways they are to be cooked.
 The leaflet published by the Bombay Health Association was condensed in these columns only recently. I now give below a free translation of the main parts of a Gujarati leaflet published by the Baroda State Food Survey Office. Its cost is one pice:
 Soya beans grow on a plant from one foot to fifteen inches in height. Every pod has on an average three beans. The plant has many varieties. The bean may be white, yellow, blackish, variegated, etc. The yellow variety has the largest percentage of protein and fat. This variety is more nutritious than meat or eggs. The Chinese eat beans with rice. Soya bean flour may be mixed with ordinary flour in the proportion of one to five parts of wheat and turned
 into chapatis.
 Soya bean crop improves the soil. Instead of deriving nitrogen like other plants from the soil, soya bean derives it from the air and thus enriches the soil.
 Soya bean grows in practically all soils. It thrives most in soils favourable to cotton or grain crops. Slat soil improves if soya bean is sown in it. In such soil more manure should be used. Fermented cowdung, grass, leaves and dungheap manure are quite serviceable for this crop.
 Temperate climate suits the bean. It thrives where the rainfall is not more than 40 inches. It should not be sown in water-logged soil. The bean is generally sown after the frist rains, but it can be sown during any season. In the dry season it requires to be watered once a week, or twice if the soil is inclined to dry quickly.
 The soil is best prepared in summer. It should be ploughed up and exposed  to the sun’s rays. Then the clods should be broken up and pulverized.
 The seed should be sown in rows twenty-four to thrity-six inches apart. The plants should be three to four inches apart in their rows. There should be frequent weeding.
 One acre would take from 20 to 30 lb. of seeds. They should not be sown deeper than two inches. One acre will require about 10 cartloads of manure.
 After the sprouting of the seeds there shoud be proper weeding with a light plough. All crust should be broken up.
 The pods are ready for picking in 120 days after sowing. They should be picked as soon as the leaves begin to turn yellow and drop off. They should not be allowed to be on the plants till they open, or else the seeds will drop out and be lost in the soil.
So much for the Gap.
 Now a word as to the results of the experiment being made in Maganwadi.
 It is too early to draw deductions as yet. It may be said that the weight of the inmates has kept constant. In a few cases there has been
a  decided increase—in one case as much as 4libtech_214_footnotelibtech_215_footnoteb. in a fortnight. Ghee
 has been stopped since the close of the first week. The absence of it has yet made no impression on the weight. One ounce of oil is being issued instead. The ration of beans has been increased for the current week from two ounces to three per head. The bean is served both morning and evening. They are soaked for some hours and then cooked well. Water in which it is steamed is strained out and tamarind
 and salt added to it. It makes a very popular soup. To the bean after straining are added linseed or til oil and salt making a tasty dish. In the morning the bean is served with chapati or bhakhari and in the evening with rice. The bean requires to be chewed well. NO ill effect has yet been reported.
 The bean is obtainable in Bombay and Baroda. Negotiations are being carried on for a reduction in the price. Meanwhile small quantities can be had from Maganwadi at three annas per pound, railage extra. This price is prohibitive. By some mistake our beans were received from Baroda by passenger train instead of goods. My advice to senders is not yet to order the beans from Maganwadi Godrej and Co. (Parel, Bombay) supply the beans in Bombay and the Baroda Food Survey Office in Baroda.

 I saw your letter only last night, because Kaka had forgotten [to hand it over to me]. It will be good if you can anyhow persuade Bhai Velchand to start paying Rs. 500 a month. In fact, he should have started doing so as soon as he had decided to do so.
 It  is  good   news  that   Vanulibtech_218_footnotehas   recovered   completely.   Her leaving the Vidyapith is a great act of renunciation. But it will endure only if her attachment for the Vidyapith is dead. I hope you haven't in any way coerced her into taking the step. Otherwise she will always repent it afterwards and will continue to nurse the desire in her heart. If, however, the arrangement that you have made endures, the work being done there will shine out very well.
 It won't be in my hands to arrange where I will stay. I believe it will be done by the Sahitya [Parishad]. See the person in charge and do what may be necessary.

 BHAI VALLABHBHAI,
 You must be strong enough now to talk and shout [in your usual manner]. I went through your letter to Ambedkar. It is apt but is not likely to have any effect on him at present. He cannot  help  abusing me how can he spare you, than? Here, as in London, there are several influences acting on him from behind. The pity of it is that the problem has been given exaggerated importance because of his threats. Even that would’t matter, were it not that instead of explo- iting the situation for constructive work people are going about the wrong way to solve it. Instead of making a determined effort for the eradi-cation of untouchability, they are trying to win over Ambedkar with appeals and entreaties. But let it be; this is the atmosphere in which we have to work. Look where you will, you find nothing but an exhi-bition of fear and weakness.
 Can’t you take some steps regarding Patadi? Is it right for your secretary to preside over any sort of meeting without your permission?libtech_250_footnote

 I have your letter after a long time. Why have you not yet taken up some definite work? In order to be fearless we should love all and adhere to the path of truth. The assertion that goodness is easier to come by is based on the fact that all wish to be known as good people and no one wants to be known as a sinner.

No one can tell when 	ultimately the card was brought here. You must careflly study the 	five postel stamps on it. Examine the dates, and perhaps you will 	solve the mystery of the delay. Such misfortunes are inevitable and 	you are able to stand greater ones.  	I am glad your income is increasing by leaps and bounds. No wonder 	you like Bombay.

185,,NEEM LEAVES AND TAMARIND,"
  	I had your letter. I get no time. Restore your health by any means. 	It is good to act as Dr. Ansari says. In the last analysis, God is 	our only doctor.  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	a microfilm of the Hindi: Courtesy: National Archives of India and 	Anand T. Hingorani         	In answer to certain questions Dr. Aykroyd, Director of Nutrition 	Research, sends the following interesting replies:  You 	ask about food values. 	Data on this 	point are being 	rapidly gathered here 	and elsewhere 	in India, 	and I 	hope that at 	no very distant 	period an authoritative 	book or 	pamphlet giving 	the chemical 	composition, vitamin, 	potency, etc., of 	all common 	foods will become 	available for those 	interested in 	dietetics. I 	have little doubt that 	you are right 	in stating 	that in practice 	different vegetable fats 	and oils produce 	different physiological effects. This 	is probably 	due to 	their chemical make-up, 	but unfortunately 	we are 	not yet in  a 	position to 	correlate chemical 	composition and dietary 	effect in this 	case. In all 	probability some 	research worker somewhere in the world will soon 	enlighten us.  We 	have analysed neem 	leaves in 	the laboratory. 	As compared 	with a 	number of 	other green vegetable 	previously investigated, they 	have a high 	nutritive value. Both 	mature and tender 	leaves are rich 	in protein, 	calcium, iron and 	vitamin A 	activity and 	are superior in 	these respects to 	amaranth leaves, 	coriander leaves, 	drumstick leaves, lettuce, murraya leaves, and 	spinach. This 	perhaps explains the 	tradition of 	their high 	nutritive value. I 	believe that 	modern laboratory 	investigations in 	China have 	not infrequently domonstrated that 	herbs and other 	types of food 	recommended in ancient 	Chinese books are 	rich in vitamins, etc.  With 	regard to vitamin content, tamarind and lemon are roughly similar, 	except that the latter is richer in the antiscorbutic vitamin C. 	Tamarind plup, unlike lemon, contains a good deal of tartaric 	acid—about 14%; the chief acid 
 in lemon is citric acid. Otherwise the two fruits resemble each other in food value. Tamarind is stated to contain a laxative principle. I can offer nothing in support of the popular belief that it induces fever and rheumatism.
 The reader should know that I have been making extensive experiments in neem leaves and tamarind. Neem leaves have been taken with impunity by several. My difficulty has been to make them palatable. Taken in the form of chutney  containing  sufficient tamarind pulp and salt or lemon and salt, it is least objectionable. Some take two to three tolas of whole leaves with relish. I am unable to say definitely what effect the taking of leaves produces on the system. I have been tempting volunteers to try them because of the high merit attributed in Ayurveda to them and because of their decidedly good effect on Shri Bhansalilibtech_256_footnotelibtech_257_footnote. Their common use would enable the poor people without extra cost to take the green leaves upon which modern diet experts lay much stress. That the use of the leaf produces no ill effect can be stated with perfect confidence.
 Of the good effect of tamarind I can write with equal confidence. One ounce of pulp taken with meals has in several cases induced free movement of bowels. It can be mixed with vegetables or rice or dal. It can be eaten as jam when mixed with sufficient quantity of gur. I have used it with beneficial effect for reducing fevers by giving it in the form of tamarind water. In no case have I found it to have induced cold or rheumatism or boils as many people believe it does. There is hardly a man or woman in the South who does not eat tamarind in some shape or form. It is the base for its famous rasam.
 Village workers will have to find out cheap, effective and harmless substitutes for the expensive yet useful articles one uses in cities and which one cannot get in the villages for love or money. Tamarind neem leaf are such substitutes.libtech_258_footnote

 "
186,,CASTE HAS TO GO,"
    
 I gladly publish Sir Govindrao Madgaonkar’s open  letterlibtech_259_footnotein this issue. My own position has been often stated in these columns. It may be summed up as follows:
 
  I 	believe in 	varnashrama of 	the Vedas 	which in my opinion 	is based on 	absolute equality of 	status, notwithstanding 	passages to the 	contrary in 	the smritis 	and elsewhere.  Every 	word of the 	printed works passing 	muster as ‘Shastras’ 	is not, 	in my opinion, 	a revelation.  The 	interpretation of 	accepted taxts has 	undergone evolution, 	and is 	capable of 	indefinite evolution, 	even as the 	human intellect and 	heart are.  Nothing 	in the Shastras which is 	manifestly contrary 	to universal 	truths and morals 	can stand.  Nothing 	in the 	Shastras which 	is capable 	of being 	reasoned can 	stand if it is in conflict with reason. Varnashrama 	of the Shastras 	is today 	non-existent in practice.  The 	present caste system is the very antithesis of varnashrama. 	The sooner public 	opinion abolishes it the better.  In 	varnashrama there 	was and should 	be no prohibition 	of intermarriage 	or inter-dining. 	Prohibition there is 	of change of 	one’s hereditary 	occupation for purposes 	of gain. 	The existing 	practice is, therefore, 	doubly wrong in 	that it 	has set up 	cruel restrictions 	about inter-dining 	and intermarriage 	and tolerates 	anarchy about choice of 	occupation.  Thought 	there is 	in varnashrama no 	prohibition against 	intermarriage and 	inter-dining, there 	can be 	no compulsion. It 	must be 	left to 	the unfettered 	choice of the 	individuals as 	to where he 	or she will marry or 	dine. If 	the law of 	varnashrama was 	observed there 	would naturally 	be a 	tendency, so 	far as 	marriage is 	concerned, for 	people to 	restrict the 	marital relations to 	their own 	varna.  As 	I have repeatedly said 	there is 	no such 	thing as 	untouchability by 	birth in 	the Shastras. 	I hold 	the present 	practice to to 	be a sin 	and the greatest blot 	on Hinduism. 	I feel 	more than ever that 	if untouchability lives, Hinduism dies.  The 	most effective, 	quickest, and the most 	unobtrusive way 	to destroy 	caste is for 	reformers to 	begin the 	practice with 	themselves and 	where necessary 	take the consequences 	of social 	boycott. The 	reform will 	not come by reviling 	the orthodox. 	The change 	will be 	gradual and 	imperceptible. The 	so-called higher 	classes will 	have to descend 	from their 	pedestal before they can 	make any 	impression upon the so-called lower classed. Day-to-day experience of village 
 
 work shows how difficult the task is of bridging the gulf that exists between the city-dwellers and the villagers, the higher classes and the lower classes. The two are not synonymous terms. For the class distinction exists both in the cities and the villages.
 Harijan, 16-11-1935
 "
187,,AWFULNESS OF CHILD-MARRIAGE,"
    
 The Anti-Child-Marriage Committee has published a useful and instructive bulletin on child-marriage. I copy the main paragraphs below:libtech_260_footnote
 The Census Report for India of 1931 gave the following figures of the number of girls who are married under the age of 15 by age groups;
         Age 						group   Percentage 						married     0 						to 1   0.8     1 						” 2   1.2     2 						” 3   2.0     3 						” 4   4.2     4 						” 5   6.6     5 						” 10   19.3     10 						” 15   38.1      
 Thus nearly one girl in 100 girls of less than one year of age is married and the same horrible fact is repeated in all the other age groups under 15.
 One consequence of this is the almost unbelievable number of child widows in the country.
 The figures are:
 Age group	Actual number of widows
 
           0    to   1   1,515      1   ”   2    1,785      2   ”   3    3, 						485      3   ”   4    9,076      4   ”   5    15,019      5   ”   10    1,05,482      10    						”   15    1,85,339      
 
 
 Another consequence of child marriage is the number of young mothers who die in childbirth. 2,00,000 deaths in child birth is the yearly average for India. This works up to 20 deaths per hour, and a vast number of these deaths occur to girls in their teens . . . .
 Lastly, child-marriage affects not merely the mother but the child and therefore the race. In India out of every, 1,000 children born, 181 die. This is the average; there are places in India where the average goes up to 400 per, 1,000. . . .
 The figures should cause us all to hang our heads in shame. But that won’t remedy the evil. The evil of child-marriage is at least as extensive in the villages as in the cities. It is pre-emi-nently women’s work. Men have no doubt to do their share. But when a man turns into a beast, he is not likely to listen to reason. It is the mothers who have to be educated to understand their privilege and duty of refusal. Who can teach them this but women? I venture to suggest therefore that the All-India Women’s Conference to be true to its name has to descend to the villages. The bulletins are valuable. They only reach a few of the English-knowing city-dwellers. What is needed is personal touch with the village women. Even when, if ever, it is established, the task won’t be easy. But some day or other the beginning has to be made in that direction before any result can be hoped for. Will the All-India Women’s Conference make common cause with the All-India Village Industries Association? No village worker, no matter how able he or she is, need expect to approach villagers purely for the sake of social reform. They will have to touch all spheres of village life. Village work, I must repeat, means real education, not in the three R’s but in opening the minds of the villagers to the needs of true life befitting thinking beings which humans are supposed to be.

MY DEAR AMRIT,
 Your description of the village visit is consoling and stirring. In Sindi we have nothing but apparent disappointments to register. Your reports is therefore a good set-off. I hope the progress will be  sustained.
 So you did not or could not go to Saharanpur? You should, if you can.
 You must not expect a long letter from me. Only I love to talk to you on Mondays, the day I use the right hand for writing.
 
 Even before you come here, you hold the pistol to my head and say when you must leave here. You will be somewhat just, if you also told when at the latest you will reach here.

If they 	did the latter 	he had naturally no suggestions to make. If they would work under the All-India       
 Village Industries Association he would give them his own idea of the educational needs of the villagers. He Said:
What they need is not a knowledge of the three Rs, but a
 knowledge of their economic life and how they can better it. They are today working as mere automatons, without any responsibility whatsoever to their surroundings and without feeling the joy of work. We are entirely responsible for this sate of things, as we have had no intimate contact with them. We have indeed studied their Politico- economic condition, as did the late Romesh Chandra Dutt. But whilst we have been told of the state to which they have been reduced, they do not know how they themselves can partly or wholly remove their poverty. Now I think it is possible to show them how to double their income. You will say they are heavily taxed. That they are, but I am not cancerned with that problem at the present moment. Our present policy is to leave all politics or politico-economics alone. You will therefore begin with a study of their social, hygienic and moral condition. You may use magic lantern slides for the purpose. You have to show them that untouchability is no part of religion, and that the idea of superiority of status is foreign to any true religion. Just as  a healthy man does not regard an unhealthy man as inferior to him in status, even so a teacher or a merchant may not regard a scavenger as inferior to him. You have to teach them these  fundamentals  of  religion and ethics. Then you will teach them geography  and history—you will begin with the history of their own village. Now I would teach them the three Rs as a means for imparting a knowledge of these things, but you do not need to make them matriculates or graduates for this purpose. A knowledge of English may be a source of income in these days, but it is not necessary to add to the health of one’s mind or body. All our energy has been sapped in mastering a foreign language and in reading tons of books which in no way help us to keep ourselves physically and morally fit or to serve the villagers. You will thus see where I bring in a knowledge of the three Rs. It comes in at the end, and at the long end at that, and not in the beginning, and then, as a help to things permanent. You cannot more usefully pass an hour every night with them than by teaching them the laws of health, social morals, and the way of a strenuous life of easy labour.

202,,FEAR COMPLEX,"
    
 
 Many workers are so frightened of village life that they fear that if they are not paid by some agency they will not be able to earn their living by labouring in villages, especially if they are married and have a family to support. In my opinion this is a demoralizing belief. No doubt, if a person goes to a village with the city mentality and wants to live in villages the city life, he will never earn enough unless he, like the city people, exploits the villagers. But if a person settles in a village and tries to live like the villagers, he should hve no difficulty in making a ‘living by the sweat of his brow’. He should have  confidence that if the villagers who are prepared to toil all the year round in the traditional unintelligent manner can earn their living, he must also earn at least as much as the average villager. This he will do without displacing a single villager, for he will go to village as a producer, not as a parasite.
 If the worker has the ordinary size family, his wife and one other member should be full-time workers. Such a worker won’t immediately have the muscle of the villager, but he will more than make up for the deficiency by his intelligence, if only he will shed his difference and fear complex. He would be doing productive work, and not be a mere consumer, unless he gets an adequate response from the villagers so as to occupy the whole of his time in seving them. In that case he will be worth the commission on the additional production of the villagers induced by his effort. But the experience of the few months that the village work has gone on under the aegis of the A.I.V.I.A. shows that the response from the villagers will be very slow and that the worker will have to become a pattern of virtue and work before the villagers. That will be the best object-lesson for them which is bound to impress them sooner or later provided that he lives as one of them and not a patron seated amongst them to be adored from a respectful distance.
 The question, therefore, is: what remunerative work can he do in the village of his choice? He and the members of the family will give some time to cleaning the village, whether the villagers help him or not, and he will give them such simple medical assistance as is within his power to give. Every person can prescribe a simple opening drug or quinine, wash a boil or wound, wash dirty eyes and ears, and apply
 a clean ointment to a wound. I am trying to find out a book that will give the simplest directions in the ordinary cases occurrring daily in the villages. Anyway these two things must be an integral part of village work. This ought not to occupy more than two hours of his time per day. The village worker has no such things as an eight hours’ day. For him the labour for the villager is a labour of love. For his living, therefore, he will give eight hours at least in addition to the two hours. It should be borne in mind that under the new scheme propounded by the A.I.S.A. and A.I.V.I.A. all labour has an equal minimum value. Thus a carder who works at his bow for one hour and turns out the average quantity of cards will get exactly the same wage that the weaver, the spinner or the papermaker would, for the given quantity of their respective works per hour. Therefore the worker is free to choose and learn whatever work he can easily do, care being always taken to choose such labour whoes product is easily salable in his village or the surrounding area or is in demand by the Associations.
 One great need in every village in an honest shop where unadulterated food-stuffs and other things can be had for the cost price and a moderate commission. It is true that a shop, be it ever so small, requires some capital. But a worker who is at all known in the area of his work should command sufficient confidence in his honesty to enable him to make small wholesale purchases on credit.
 I may not take these concrete suggestion much further. An observant worker will always make important discoveries and soon know what labour he can do to earn a living and be at the same time an object-lesson to the villagers whom he is to serve. He will therefore have to choose labour that will not exploit the villagers, that will not injure their health or morals but will teach the villagers to take up industries to occupy their leisure hours and add to their tiny incomes. His observations will lead him to direct his attention to the village wastes including weeds and the superficial natural resources of the village. He will soon find that he can turn many of them to good account. If he picks up edible weeds, it is as good as earning part of his food. Mirabehn has presented me with a museum of beautiful marble-like stones which serve several useful purposes as they are, and I would soon convert them into bazaar articles if I has leisure and would invest into simple tools to give them different shapes. Kaka- saheb had given to me split bamboo waste that was destined to be burnt, and with a rude knife he turned some of it into paper knives
 and wooden spoons both salable in limited quantities. Some workers in Maganwadi occupy their leisure in making envelopes out of waste paper blank on one side.
 The fact is the villagers have lost all hope. They suspect that every stranger’s hand is at their throats and that he goes to them only to exploit them. Divorce between intellect and labour has paralysed their thinking faculty. Their working hours they do not use to the best advantage. The worker should enter such villages full of love and hope, feeling sure that where men and women labour unintelligently and remain unemployed half the year round, he working all the year round and combining labour with intelligence cannot fail to win the confidence of the villagers and earn his living honestly and well by labouring in their midst.
 ‘But what about my children and their education?’—says the candidate worker. If the children are to receive their education after the modern style, I can give no useful guidance. If it be deemed enough to make them healthy, sinewy, honest, intelligent villagers, any day able to earn their livelihood in the home of their parents’ adoption, they will have their all-around education under the parental roof and withal they will be partly earning members of the family from the moment they reach the years of understanding and are able to use their hands and feet in a methodical manner. There is no school equal to a decent home and no teachers equal to honest virtuous parents. Modern high school education is a dead weight on the villagers. Their children will never be able to get it, and thank God they will never miss it if they have the training of the decent home. If the village worker is not a decent man or woman, capable of conducting a decent home, he or she had better not aspire after the high privilege and honour of becoming a village worker.

203,,A GREAT SOCIAL WORKER,"
    
 In the death of Shri G.K. Deodhar the country has lost one of its great social workers and an uncompromising and faithful friend of Haijans. He was one of the foundation members of the Society fonded by Gokhale. He was President of the Maharashtra Provincial Harijan Sevak Sangh. There was not a famine or a flood in the country which did not claim the attention of this servant of humanity. Thought he
 could easily become a rich man, he chose poverty as a life principle for a public worker. His tireless energy was contagious. He never spared himself when social service was demanded of him. His was a life of spotless purity. He was the soul of the Poona Seva Sadan which he loved and for which he laboured so well that from a little thing it has today grown into an institution of the kind second to none in all India. I tender my respectful condolences to the family of the deceased.

207,,DEATH OF A TRUE HARIJAN SEVAK,"
    
 There are only a handful of persons in Kathiawar who have no trace of the feeling of untouchability in their veins and are engrossed in the service of Harijans despite being orthodox. Among them the celebrated Harijan Govindji Parekh of Amreli was a leading personality. The late Harilal was the soul of Amreli. There could seldom be a public welfare activity in Kathiawar in which Shri Harilal Parekh did not have a hand. One and all needed his services and his advice, and everyone found it acceptable. In many ways, his was an exemplary life; we should perpetuate his memory by learning all that we can from it.

 Harijanbandhu, 24-11-1935
   AN APPEALlibtech_275_footnote  
 WARDHA,
 November, 24, 1935
 A sum of about Rs. 29,000 is needed for this year’s work of the Harijan Sevak Sangh of Gujarat. Fifty-seven schools and  three ashrams are being run with the Sangh’s help. The Sangh is under the supervision of no less a public worker than Thakkar Bapa. Shri Parikshitlal Majmudar is giving his devoted services to it. According to me the expenditure of Rs. 29,000 a year in nothing. If we regard the service of Harijans as our dharma and if everybody who earns Rs. 500 a year decides to spare even Re.1 this charitable activity, we can get several Lakhs of rupees annually. But we don’t yet have such religious awareness. Moreover, not all caste Hindus regard untouchability as contrary to dharma and, therefore, accept service of the Harijan as their dharma. Hence it doubly becomes a duty of those who regard the service of Harijans as their dharma to sustain the work of such service.
 Eradication of untouchability is not one man’s job. Neither can it be done only with the help of money. Money can be regarded as a form of energy for the work of service. If every caste Hindu who looks upon eradication of untouchability as his dharma regularly contributes to the fund according to his capacity, then the work being done at present can be kept up and those in charge of it will be saved from financial worries.
 I shall be going to Ahmedabad in the second week of January for the Gujarati Sahitya Parishad. I am hoping to collect at that time from Gujaratis the sum mentioned above. It was suggested to me that I should appeal for help from friends outside Gujarat [also] but I rejected the suggestion. If I did that, it would be a disgrace to Gujarat and so to me. No one can say that Gujarat is  among  the  poor provinces in the country. It has, on the contrary, helped  other provinces in their time of need. It has never begged for anything from other provinces, and rightly too. Why shouldn’t it, then, contribute for such a noble activity? It is true that it has to contribute to many funds. It   is  also   true  that   the   farmers  of   Gujarat  have   suffered   many
 
 Harijanbandhu, 8-12-1935.
 calamities and borne great losses. But I firmly believe that such arguments cannot be advanced as excuses for not doing one’s dharma. I, therefore, hope that all friends, men and women, will work hard and collect the small amount mentioned above and thus relieve Thakkar Bapa, other workers and me of the worry. The burden of most of the activities in Gujarat is generally borne by Sardar. I know that he has had to collect money for many of them. I have, therefore, deliberately not put this burden on him. But he cannot,  for  that  reason, remain unconcerned till the money is collected.  Nobody should think that eradication of untouchability is Thakkar Bapa’s and my concern only and not his. I hope that Gujarat will not send me back empty-handed.

  	I got your letter. When I say that one per cent doubt remains, what 	I mean is that I am ready to listen to and think over what Father or 	you may say. If I didn’t have even this one per cent doubt, there 	would be no need at all for me to here anybody. Please don’t 	forget this, that before I discussed the matter with You I used to 	doubt the truth of what . . . and his friends said. After my long 	and patient talk with you, my attitude towards . . . became more 	favourable. Your story is something like this: you were bitten by a 	snake, but you did not feel the effect of poison although you 	already knew from experience the nature of the poison. Just as this 	wouldn’t be a plausible story, so is your story of [the effect of] 	. . .’s touch not plausible. The poison of a lustful man’s touch 	is far more than that of a snake. And if a snake, while lifting its 	young one with its teeth. accidentally bites it with its fangs, the 	young one also would feel the effect of poison. Since a child is 	easily influenced by its parents, if they pour poison into it the 	child cannot but feel its effect. Please, therefore, know that it is 	your own testimony that proves  the innocence of . . . to the extent 	of 99 per cent. And that is why I have told you, and I repeat here, 	that you should continue to write to me and keep me informed about 	everything. If you continue to help me, the remaining one per cent 	doubt also can be cleared. After your testimony, I cannot bring 	myself to find . . . guilty. Nor can I bring myself to believe that 	you are telling a brazen lie. Till, therefore, I get further 	evidence, the one per cent will remain in your favour.

He wants me 	to explain this with illustrations.  	Castes are numerous. They are man-made. They undergo constant 	change. The older ones die and new ones spring up. Castes based on 	occupations are to be found all over the world. It is only in India 	that there are restrictions, as regards intermarriage and inter- 	dining, which defy reason. This is very harmful. It stands in the 	way of the community’s progress. It has nothing to do with 	religion.  	Varnas are just four and not numerous. They have been sanctioned by 	the Shastras. Whether or not people are conscious of them, they do 	exist all over the world as we see. There are everywhere these four 	classes: one to impart knowledge of god for the welfare of      
 the world, another to protect the people against manifold dangers, a third one to carry on the work of farming, etc., to sustain the community and one class to work for these three classes. There is no feeling of high and low in this division. But since this is not understood as a great law of nature, there has been confusion in it, that is, these four functions are no more confined to the respective varnas. Instead men have been taking up any occupation they choose with a view to achieving their selfish ends. At one time in India people used to consciously folllow this  law  and  thus  lived  in  peace.  One accepted the calling of one’s own varna and  was  satisfied  in  its pursuit for general welfare. There was no unhealthy competition among people to jump from one varna to another for the sake of money or fame. At present this significance of  the  varna  system seems to have disappeared even in India. Destructive competition is on the  increase,  everyone  takes  liberty  of following  any  profession and the meaning of varna has been restricted to unnatural and meaningless restrictions on intermarriage and inter-dining. And that is why the country has stopped progressing. Hinduism will once again shine forth if such senseless restrictions are abolished, the pristine
 varna system is resurrected and the distinctions of high and low are banished. This would be to the good of India as well as the whole world.

222,"November 30, 1935",DISCUSSION WITH G.D. BIRLA libtech_286_footnote,"
    
 [Before November 30, 1935]
 G.D. BIRLA: That friend in charge of the tannerylibtech_287_footnote, you say, is working for a mere pittance. It is highly commendable.
GANDHIJI: He is a brahmin and a graduate. He does not accept
 more than eight annas a day. His wife also works else where the whole day for a bare living wage.
 Yes: All that surprises me, but I do not know how long this can go on in this machine age.
I have no such fear, because I have the conviction within me that
 when all these achievements of the machine age will have disappeared these our handicrafts will remain; when all exploitation will have ceased, service and honest labour will remain. It is because this faith sustains me that I am going on with my work. After all where is there any cause for despair? What are a few years in the vast stretch of eternity? A study of human origins would carry us back to millions of years. Indomitable faith in their work sustained men like Stephenson and Columbus. Faith in my work sustains me, but there is also added to it the conviction that all the other things that seem to challenge my faith are doomed. Don’t you see that if India becomes industrialized, we shall need a Nadirshah to find out other worlds to exploit, that we shall have to pit ourselves against the naval and military power of Britain and Japan and America, of Russia and Italy? My head reels to think of these rivalries. No, I am clear that whilst this machine age aims at converting men into machines, I am aiming at reinstating man- turned-machine to his original estate.
 I quite see your invincible faith. But you seem to forget in your enthusiasm that you will not be with us until eternity. You are getting old. Why not make large collections and spread your work over a large area?
No. I do not believe in collecting more than I need.
 But supposing you constructed twenty, even ten, model villages?
 If it is such an easy thing, you might do so with your money. But I know it is not easy. You cannot bring a model village into being
 
 by the magic wand of money. And I believe in making a full return for whatever money I receive from the public. And then I am against raising any more central funds now. There are so many  Harijan schools and ashrams in Gujarat requiring an annual budget of Rs. 29,000.libtech_288_footnotelibtech_289_footnoteWhy should I ask you for work in Gujarat? Is it not the duty of the Gujaratis to find money for the Harijan work in Gujarat? If they cannot find it, they had better close down their institutions rather than ask for outside help.

223,,AN INTERESTING POINT,"
    
 
 The Council of the Harijan Sevak Sangh met last week at Wardha. In view of my article “Caste Has to Go”libtech_290_footnotesome members raised the question whether in the pages of Harijan which was issued under the aegis of the Harijan Sevak Sangh I was justified in airing my views on the Sangh, or whether I could express views which went beyond the official policy of the Sangh, or lastly whether the Sangh could extend the scope of its objective.
 I gave it as my opinion that I was free as an individual to advocate in the pages of Harijan views which I may know to be contrary to the views of some members or maybe in advance of the official policy of the Sangh. In my opinion, any member of  the  Sangh is entitled to the same freedom so long as his views do not in any way tone down the Sangh’s objective. Its policy represents the highest common factor between the views of the moderate reformer and those of the radical. We have in the Harijan Sevak Sangh both the sections well represented. There are sanatanists who would restrict removal of untouchability to the mere touch. There are others who would extend it to inter-dining and intermarriage. The membership pledge lays down the minimum which every member has to subscribe to and practise in his or her own life. It does not prevent any member from going further so long as he or she does not advocate the advanced view as the policy of the Sangh. At its very origin  all sections of Hindus had met and, in order to carry the largest number of Hindus with them, that representative gathering passed a compre-
 
 hensive resolutionlibtech_291_footnotelibtech_292_footnotethat would secure the hearty assent of the Largest number present. The wisdom of the course was justified in that there was, thanks to Pandit Malaviyaji, practical unanimity. It is obvious that  if the resolution had contemplated the suppression of advanced views and practice by members acting in their individual capacity many members would not have subscribed to such restriction. But on the other hands not even a majority of the members of the board could change the constitution so far as its objective is concerned. That can only be done by a general representative meeting of Hindus convened specially for the purpose. Therefore whilst the most cautious refor- mer may rest secure about the fundamental policy of the Sangh, the extreme radical is in no way hampered in his advocacy, as an individual, of the views which in his opinion may promote the purity and health of Hinduism.
 It may be mentioned, in passing, that the views expressed by me in the article “Caste Has to Go” have been often expressed in these columns though under different headings. Moreover the article does not deal with the relations between caste Hindus and Harijan Hindus. It deals with reform only among caste men or savarnas. When untouchability goes, untouchables will occupy precisely the same position as caste men. And whatever rule or custom then governs caste men will govern Harijans who are no longer Harijans. If, therefore, caste remains as it is now, there will be no intermarriage and no interdining between Harijans and caste men. But if caste goes in its present form, as it will some day, there will most undoubtedly be intermarriage and inter-dining between Harijans and caste men  as there will be between caste men and caste men. And if varna remains, as I hope it will, occupations will be restricted as they were in the past; intermarriage and inter-dining will not be restricted even as they were not in the past. Whaterver happens it will happen not because of the activity of the Sangh as a body but because of other forces which the Sangh can neither regulate nor control. Its members as individuals will no doubt take their due share in moulding those forces according to their predilections.

  "
224,,THE IDEAL AND THE PRACTICAL,"
    
 
Shri Gopabandhu Chaudhry writes:libtech_293_footnote
 In the article “Need for Humane Custom”libtech_294_footnoteyou refer to a calculation that “self-sufficing khadi will mean two yards of sale outside against three yards of wear by artisans, etc.” . . . But the reading of the article leaves an impression that the success of self-sufficing khadi entirely depends upon the sale of khadi. But is this a correct ideal?It not the ideal of self-sufficing khadi this that in a majority of cases the spinners will spin their own cotton or purchase their cotton and pay the weaver from their earnings from other village industries or agricultural labour?
 Otherwise, when our aim is to make every home in the village self- sufficient, where will the extra two yards for outside sale produced by the spinners sell?Will the demand of the cities be possibly so large?
 . . . Self-sufficing khadi ought to thrive independently on its own merits, as there is enough unutilized land to grow the cotton required and unemployed leisure to spin the yarn.
 The ideal no boubt is for every family to grow, spin, weave and wear its own cotton, just as it it for every family to own land and grow its own corn, cook and eat it. But we know that every family won’t and can’t realize the ideal; we know, too, that success will not attend the worker immediately he begins to preach  the  unadulterated message of self-sufficing khadi. What Gopabandhu Babu has himself suggested is itself an intermediary stage, that of a householder buying enough cotton, spinning it himself, having the yarn woven and paying the charges from his savings. But there are million who have no  savings and there are millions who purchase their cloth without performing any of the processes. To spin for oneself and pay for cotton and weaving out of the proceeds of some other industry is an intermediate stage. To spin extra and from the proceeds of that labour to pay for weaving is yet another intermediate stage and perhaps the easiest both from the workers’ and the weavers’ points of view. In working out this stage we have ready-made khadi centres. There the workers have to induce spinners and other artisans to wear khadi if
 
 they are to continue to get work through the All-India Spinners’ Association agency. There are many among them who depend for their maintenance entirely on their labour spent on spinning, weaving, carding or dyeing. These can only wear khadi if they work at producing surplus khadi and command the sale of such products. This ought not to be difficult, if in spite of the rise in the spinners’ wage the existing demand for khadi continues.
 In practice all the stages will be worked simultaneously. What the new scheme does is to put the emphasis on the right spot and state what the goal is in unmistakable terms. Khadi workers will no longer concentrate on increasing sales and reducing the price of khadi. They are henceforth to concentrate on people  becoming  self-sufficing about their cloth requirements at least to the extent of spinning. They will have to establish personal touch with the artisans, befriend them, know their wants and help them, progressively to improve their economic condition by making the best possible use of their leisure hours consistently with equal opportunity for all. This ought to be a good enough programme for the most ambitious worker. The most difficult task will be on the one hand to open the eyes  of  understanding of the millions and persuade them to use their leisure hours for their own betterment and on the other to persuade  the buying class—the city people and the middle men—to realize that in the long run it pays them if they buy village manufactures even  though their cost may be apparently some what higher than they have hitherto paid and even though the appearance be not quite what they have been used to. It pays them because it raises the material condition of the people and therefore their purchasing power. The new scheme is therefore calculated to draw the best out of the whole of the nation irrespective of ‘caste, colour or creed’. The question ultimately resolves itself into this: Have we for this task  workers enough of the requisite purity, self-sacrifice, industry and intelligence?
 Harijan, 30-11-1935
 
  "
225,,AN EXPERIENCE,"
    
 A correspondent who has for years been wearing khadi made out of his own yarn writes:
 This year I had 80 yards of khadi of 50 inches width. It cost me twenty rupees in round figures. People want my khadi at 10 as. per yard. i.e., Rs. 50
 for the whole piece. Thus if I want to use three yards for myself I need to sell only 1libtech_295_footnote yards. If I keep for myself 20 yards and sell the rest, besides paying for
 my own khadi, I would make a profit of Rs. 17/8.
 I know this correspondent. He stands in an exceptionally favourable position becuase his yarn is a fine, even and strong. Weavers weave it at reasonable rates, and the khadi being therefore strong and fine-looking is greatly in demand. Everyone having faith and patiene may verify the truth of the statement by making the experiment himself. Strong, even and fine yarn is the secret of successful khadi.

226,,NEED FOR CARE,"
    
 Apropos of my reproduction of Dr. Aykroyd’s letterlibtech_296_footnoteon  neem leaves and tamarind, the reader will appreciate the following further letterlibtech_297_footnotefrom the Director of Nutrition Research.
  I 	think there is 	a certain 	danger in publishing 	small items of dietetic 	knowledge apart, as 	it were, from their 	scientific context. Ignorant readers are 	apt to 	make faulty 	interpretations. For 	example, on 	rereading the 	paragraph in 	my letter 	of Novermber 	6 relating 	to neem 	leaves, which 	you wish 	to publish 	in your 	paper, I 	think it 	might possibly give 	the impression that 	everyone should 	consume great quantities of 	this vegetable as 	a cure for 	all human ills. 	Actually, the small 	series of analyses 	we have 	carried out 	to date 	show neem leaves 	to be somewhat 	richer in 	certain food 	factors than 	a number 	of other 	leafy vegetables, 	but it 	is only a 	question of 	degree. In 	a word, 	it would 	be better, 	for purposes 	of popular 	education, to stress 	the value 	of all 	green leafy 	vegetables rather 	than to single 	out one particular 	vegetable for special 
 
 commendation. I should therefore prefer the paragraph, which refers to the bitter variety of neem leaves (Azadirachta Indica) to read as follows:
 QUEESTION: What is the nutritive value of neem leaves?
 ANSWER: Neem leaves resemble other green leafy vegetables in com- position. Both mature and tender leaves are richer in protein, calcium, iron and carotene than amaranth leaves, coriander leaves, drumstick leaves, lettuce, marraya leaves and spinach. Their composition makes them valuable as a supplement to a diet largely composed of cereals, and in this respect they resemble the leafy vegetables in general.
  The 	paragraph relating to 	tamarind and 	lemon might be modified 	as follows: 
 With regard to vitamin content, tamarind and lemon are roughly similar, except that the latter is richer in the antiscorbutic vitamin C. Tamarind pulp, unlike lemon, contains a good deal of tartaric acid—about 14%; the chief acid in lemon is citric acid. Fresh tamarind, which is more solid than fresh lemon, contains a somewhat higher percentage of protein, corbohydrate and minerals than lemon; in the dried state tamarind yields about 3% protein and 73% carbohydrate (by difference). Tamarind is stated to  contain  a  laxative principle. I can offer nothing in support of the popular belief that it induces fever and rheumatism . . . .

So far as I am concerned, I shall require to be satisfied that no new obligations are taken by the central organization. Provinces may frame their budgets in any manner they like (1) so long as they do not run a single store at loss, (2) so long as they pay the minimum wage to all the artisans whom they employ — the minimum wage being fixed for each province in consultation with the centre, and (3) so long as the budget convincingly shows that the provincial organization can be run without loss.
 You suggest that no interest should be charged. But it has been suggested by others that Per cent should be charged for covering expenses of the centre.

 In my opinion no harm can come out of seeing Satyavati. After all, your aim is justice. But she should hold an authority from the workers. The best thing would be to take all the complaints to an agreed arbitrator with the initial condition that there should be no future strike.

  	I had your previous letter. It did not particularly call for a 	reply, hence I saved my time for some other work. Now I shall not 	treat your letter of the 29th ultimo in the same manner.  	Do continue to post me with your bitter- sweet experiences. It would 	be a mistake to regard the experiences at Sindi as fully    
 comprehensive. I fail to see a reflection of my own experiences in the picture that I form in my mind by putting together Mahaev's description of the experiences at Sindi. There is a restraint  in Mahadev's description, hence the bitter experiences included in it are like sugar refined in a factory. I can summarize my experience of Sindi in one sentence. Justice has not yet been done to Sindi. But willy-nilly I happen to be its director. And what sort of a director? I used to pay only short visits. Now I visit the place daily and stay there for a few minutes. I have not mixed with the people. Mirabehn tried hard to do it. But she had gone there only to stop me from settling down in the place.libtech_302_footnotelibtech_303_footnoteShe had not set her mind on it. She was staying under my   pressure.  Now  Gajananlibtech_304_footnotelibtech_305_footnoteis  there  but  it  is  also  only  an experiment. Hence it is likely you are mistaken in placing Sindi in line with the others. I can say that for me [the work at] Sindi is vast enough.
 We have done nothing about. Vadaj. A separate ashram has come into being at Nalawadi. it cannot be said that it has any appreciable impact on the people of Nalawadi. It is a different kind of activity. We have not yet mastered the art of living in a village. We still have to learn the way of mingling with them. Hence Nalawadi, Vadaj and Sindi, and all the three are different things. Your experiment is the fourth and it is in line with the experiments that are now being carried on. Let us see what finally comes out of it. I am therefore closely watching your work. I am intentionally forgoing the temptation of taking more work from you.

 woman who wanted my approval. I should simply say to her: My remedy is of no use to you. You must go to others for advice.
 Mrs. Sanger cited some hard cases. Gandhiji said:
 I agree, there are hard cases. Else birth-control enthusiasts would have no case. But I would say, do devise remedies by all means, but the remedies should be other than the ones you advise. If you and I as moral reformers put our foot down on this remedy and said, ‘You must fall back on other remedies’, those would surely be found.
 Both seemed to be agreed that woman should be emancipated, that woman should be the arbiter of her destiny. But Mrs. Sanger would have Gandhiji work for woman's emancipation through her pet device, just as believers in violence want Gandhiji to win India's freedom through violence, since they seem to be sure that non-violence can never succeed.
 She forgets this fundamental difference in her impatience to prove that Gandhiji does not know the women of India. And she claims to prove this on the ground that he makes an impossible appeal to the women of India—the appeal to resist their husbands. Well, this is what he said:
 
 
 My wife I made the orbit of all women. In her I studied all women. I came in contact with many European women in South Africa, and I knew practically every Indian woman there. I worked with them. I tried to show them they were not slaves either to their husbands or parents, not only in the political field but in the domestic as well. But the trouble was that some could not resist their husbands. The remedy is in the hands of women themselves. The struggle is difficult for them, and I do not blame them. I blame the men. Men have legislated against them. Man has regarded woman as his tool. She has learned to be his tool and in the end found it easy and pleasurable to be such, because when one drags another in his fall the descent is easy . . .libtech_309_footnotelibtech_310_footnoteI have felt that during the years still left to me if I can drive home to women's minds the truth that they are free, we will have no birth-control problem in India. If they will only learn to say ‘no’ to their husbands when they approach them carnally! I do not suppose all husbands are brutes and if women only know how to resist them, all will be well. I have been able to teach women who have come in contact with me how to resist their husbands. The real problem is that many do not want to resist them. No resistance bordering
 upon bitterness will be necessary in 99 out of 100 cases. If a wife says to her husband, ‘No, I do not want it’, he will make no trouble. But she hasn't been taught. Her parents in most cases won't teach it to her. There are some cases, I know, in which parents have appealed to their daughters' husbands not to force motherhood on their daughters. And  I have come across amenable husbands too. I want woman to learn the primary right of resistance. She thinks now that she has not got it . . .
 Mrs. Sanger raises the phantasmagoria of “irritations, disputes, and thwarted longings that Gandhiji's advice would bring into the home.”	She cited cases of
 great nervous and mental breakdowns as a result of the practice of self-control. Gandhiji spoke from a knowledge of the numerous letters he receives every mail, when he said to her:
The evidence is   all  based  on  examination  of  imbeciles.   The
 conclusions are not drawn from the practice of healthy-minded people. The people they take for examples have not lived a life of even tolerable continence. These neurologists assume that people are expected to exercise self-restraint while they continue to lead the same ill-regulated life. The consequence is that they do not exercise self- restraint but become lunatics. I carry on correspondence with many of
 
 these people and they describe their own ailments to me. I simply say that if I were to present them with this method of birth-control they would lead far worse lives.
 He told her that when she went to Calcutta she would be told by those who knew what havoc contraceptives had worked among unmarried young men and  women. But evidently for the purpose of the conversation, at any rate, Mrs. Sanger confined herself to propagation of knowledge of birthcontrol among married couples only The distinction that Gandhiji drew between love and lust will be evident
 from the following excerpts from the conversation:
 When both want to satisfy animal passion without having to suffer the consequences of their act it is not love, it is lust. But if love is pure, it will transcend animal passion and will regulate itself. We have not had enough education of the passions. When a husband says, ‘Let us not have children, but let us have relations”, what is that but animal passion? If they do not want to have more  children  they should simply refuse to unite. Love becomes lust the moment you make it a means for the satisfaction of animal needs. It is just the same with food. If food is taken only for pleasure it is lust. You do not take chocolates for the sake of satisfying your hunger. You take them for pleasure and then ask the doctor for an antidote. Perhaps you tell the doctor that whisky befogs your brain and he gives you an antidote. Would it not be better not to take chocolates or whisky?
 MRS. S. No I do not accept the analogy.
 G. Of course you will not accept the analogy because you think this sex expression without desire for children is a need of the soul, a contention I do not endorse.
 MRS. S. Yes, sex expression is a spiritual need and I claim that the quality of this expression is more important than the result, for the quality of the relationship is there regardless of results. We all know that the great majority of children are born as an accident, without the parents having any desire for conception. seldom are two people drawn together in the sex act by their desire to have children. Do you
 think it possible for two people who are in love, who are happy together, to regulate their sex act only once in two years, so that relationship would only take place when they wanted a child? Do you think is possible?
 G. I had the honour of doing that very thing and I am not the only one.
 Mrs. Sanger thought it was illogical to contend that sex union for the purpose of having children would be love and union for the satisfaction of the sexual appetite
 
 was lust, for the same act was involved in both. Gandhiji immediately capitulated and said he was ready to describe all sexual union as partaking of the nature of lust.
 I know, from my own experience that as long as I looked upon my wife carnally, we had no real understanding. Our love did not reach a high plane. There was affection between us always, but we came closer and closer the more we or rather I became restrained. There never was want of restraint on the part of my wife. Very often she would show restraint, but she rarely resisted me although she showed disinclination very often. All the time I wanted carnal pleasure I could not serve her. The moment I bade good-bye to a life of carnal pleasure our whole relationship became spiritual. Lust died and love reigned instead. . . .
 Mrs. Sanger is so impatient to prove that Gandhiji is a visionary that she forgets the practical ways and means that Gandhiji suggested to her. she asked:
 Must the sexual union take place only three or four times in an entire lifetime?
 G. Why should people not be taught that it is immoral to have more than three or four children and that after they have had that number they should sleep separately? If they are taught this it would harden into custom. And if social reformers cannot impress this idea upon the people, why not a law? If husband and wife have four children, they would have had sufficient animal enjoyment. Their love may then be lifted to a higher plane. Their bodies have met. After they have had the children they wanted, their love transforms itself into a spiritual relationship. If these children die and they want more, then they may meet again. Why must people be slaves of this passion when they are not of others? When you give them education in birth- control,you tell them it is a duty. You say to them that if they do not do this thing they will interrupt their spiritual evolution. You do not even talk of regulation. After giving them education in birth-control, you do not say to them, ‘thus far and no further’. You ask people to drink temperately, as though it was possible to remain temperate. I know these temperate people . . . .
 And yet as Mrs. Sanger was so dreadfully in earnest Gandhiji did mention a remedy which could conceivably appeal to him. That method was the avoidance of sexual union during unsafe periods confining it to the “safe” period of about ten days during the month. That had at least an element of self-control which had to exercised during the unsafe period. Whether this appealed to Mrs. Sanger or not I do not know. But therein spoke Gandhiji the truth-seeker. Mrs. Sanger has not referred to it anywhere in her interviews or her Illustrated Weekly article. Perhaps if birth-
 controllers were to be satisfied with this simple method, the birth-control clinics and propagandists would find their trade gone	libtech_311_footnote

Doubtless I can be useful in that way and I am accepting your invitation in the hope that I may be instrumental in doing something in that direction. Keep my burden as light as possible. It is a matter of consolation to me that you are the Chairman of the Reception Committee. I take it for granted that the Parishad would not be meeting at least this year. If it is scheduled to meet some time in January or after that, there will be no inconvenience. But it will suit me if it is scheduled for as early as possible in the new year.

249,"December 7, 1935",DISCUSSION WITH A VILLAGE WORKER libtech_326_footnote,"
  
 [Before December 7, 1935]
 [VILLAGE WORKER:] Why are we laying such an emphasis on khadi and wholesome food-stuffs, when you know that even before the advent of the British, khadi was there and our good food-stuffs were there, and yet we were in no better case? [GANDHIJI:] This question was discussed threadbare in the
 columms of Young India and Navajivan if you read them. But I shall
 sum up the reply for you. We had khadi, but we did not know its significance; we were self-contained, but without realizing its nec- essity. There was little intelligence behind khadi and our handicrafts, and we little realized that they sustained us. Therefore, when they were lost to us we did not miss them, and today when an attempt is being made to restore them, some of us are wondering what use there could be in their restoration.
 Then that means that political education and propaganda is needed, and you have tabooed this.
No political propaganda is needed to teach people the lesson of
 self-help, of reform in their diet, and of throwing off their inertia and making the best of their idle hours.
 My difficulty is this, that though people in our villages are working like asses from morning until night without an hour's respite they do not get enough to eat. And you are asking them to labour still more?
What you say is news to me. The villages I know are those in
 which quantities of time are being wasted. But if as you say there are people who are being overworked, I am asking such people to accept nothing less than a living wage for nothing more than eight hours' work.
    ones?  But 	why not accept the machine with all its good points, eliminating the 	bad   I 	cannot afford to keep our human machines idle. We have such 
  	an amount of human power lying idle that we have no room for other 	power-driven machines.  Introduce 	the power-driven 	machines and get them 	to work 	for only 	as long 	as is needed for our purposes. How 	do  you mean? Supposing X   produced  all  the   cloth we needed, 	in mills specially constructed for the purpose, and gave work    
 to say three million men, also distributing all the profit between them, what then? Then these three million men will be having all the money that used to be distributed between 300 million a hundred years ago.
 No, Sir, I propose that our men should not work more than is necessary for our purposes. same work is indeed necessary for all of us, but why should we work, say, more than a couple of hours a day and not devote the rest of our time to pleasant occupations?
 So you would be satisfied if our men were to work only for one hour a day?
 That should be worked out. But I should certainly be satisfied.
 Well there's the rub. I should never be satisfied until all men had plenty of productive work, say, eight hours a day.
 But why, I wonder, should you insist on this eight hours' minimum?
 Because I know that millions will not employ themselves in work for the sake of it. If they did not need to work for their bread, they would lack the incentive. Supposing a few millionaires from America came and offered to send us all our food-stuffs and implored us not to work but to permit them to give vent to their philanthropy, I should refuse point-blank to accept their kind offer.
 That would be because the offer would hurt your self- respect?
 No, not only because of that; but especially because it strikes at the root of the fundamental law of our being, viz., that we must work for our bread, that we eat our bread by the sweat of our brow.
 But that is your personal view. Would you leave the organization of society to society itself, or would you leave it to a few good guides?
I should leave it to a few good guides.
 Which means that you are for a dictatorship.
 No, for the simple reason that my fundamental principle is non- violence and I should not coerce any individual or community. Guidance is not dictatorship.
 Harijan, 7-12-1935
 "
250,,EVIL OF CREDIT SALES,"
  
 Whilst the whole policy of the A.I.S.A. about khadi is being overhauled, it is well to remind those who are in charge of the numerous khadi depots that the custom of selling khadi on credit has on the whole resulted in loss rather than gain to khadi. The temptation to give credit to friends, acquaintances and monied men is no doubt very great. Often it offends them if credit is refused when, they
 contend, no risk is to be run. These good people do not realize that it is wrong to expect a salesman to make invidious distinctions. Numerous complaints are received from managers of khadi depots about friends and well-to-do men not discharging the debts incurred by them. To issue processes of law for the recovery of debts is a thankless and expensive task and often means more worry than it is worth. Hence even at the risk of offending and even losing some customers the safe course is never to depart from the golden rule of ‘no credit sales’.
 Let the khadi workers realize that the mission of khadi is not to be confined to the cities, it has to spread among the millions of villagers who are waiting to hear the call. We do not know how to reach them. We have hitherto tried the roundabout way. We shall not find the direct and the true way in the vain attempt to show ever- increasing sales in the books of city depots. Let them know that it is the surplus khadi that is to find its way to cities. The vast quantity has to be made and used by the villagers themselves. The true way to reach the villagers is to concentrate on them in their own cottages.
 City sales, therefore, car be no index of the progress of the mission of khadi. Khadi statistics of the future have to show the progress made from year to year in the villages. If a large number of workers are to be freed for the spread of khadi in the villages, we must reduce our labours in the cities. One way of doing it is religiously to do away with credit sales and confine our attention to those who really want khadi and appreciate the virtue of cash payment. Credit sales  invariably mean increase in prices for they involve more work, i.e., more expenses. Considered from all points of view credit sales have nothing to recommend them except the doubtful convenience of a few customers. But khadi exists not for the convenience of the few. It is intended for the benefit of all. In restricting khadi sales, therefore, to cash transactions the A. I. S. A. seeks the welfare not only of the hungry millions but also of the city buyers of khadi.

He seems 	to have 	worked at 	high pressure 	all these 	months and Dr. Jivraj 	and Dr. Gilder who 	examined him two days ago are definitely of opinion that he must 	have    a couple of 	months' rest. 	This he has 	agreed to 	do. For ten days now he 	has been in 	bed resting and 	sleeping, never 	reading or writing 	or dictating. 	But you will 	be surprised to 	know that he 	continued to 	do his reading 	on the 	commode even 	during these 	days! And he 	finished the 	9th Part of 	your magnum 	opus—which it 	really is— 	this evening.  And 	as soon as 	he finished it 	he called me 	to his bedside and 	asked me 	to send you 	his impressions. If 	he had been well he 	should have 	written himself or 	dictated something 	but he 	did not want 	to strain 	himself in the 	teeth of 	the doctors' 	advice and so 	told me 	in Gujarati in 	a minute or 	two what he 	felt. What I 	say will, therefore, be 	in my 	language and not his. He said: It 	is needless to say that it is a brilliantly written book, and a  	great literary production. There are parts where I  have  my 	fundamental differences with you and which I would like to 	criticize, but I will not do so as it is scarcely necessary or 	useful. For when all is said and done it is a highly introspective 	narrative containing an expression of your innermost thoughts and 	convictions. Even if you could be persuaded to moderate or soften 	that expression, I should not attempt it, as it would result in 	taking away from its naturalness, if not aslo its truthfulness. 	After all we are helpless actors in the mighty flow of events, we 	have to act according to our lights allowing or expecting the events 	to correct us where we err. There is just one thing where perhaps I 	might make a helpful suggestion. The attack on the Liberals seems to 	have been overdone. It seems to obtrude on the reader's attention 	over and over again and sometimes mars the grace and beauty of the 	narrative. Not that there is any venom in anything that you have 	said; far from it; but you should not be even unconsciously guilty 	of doing an injustice to them. What you have said about Sastri 	leaves that impression on me. These friends served the country in 	their time according to their lights, and whilst we may    
 have our serious differences with them we do not exactly serve the cause of the country by publicly pillorying them. If you have not, therefore, already sent the book on to the publishers, you might alter these portions. . . .
 Yours affectionately,
 MAHADEV

     DEAR 	PADMAVATHI,  December 	26, 1935 
  	I wrote one letter to Devdas yesterday after my so-called illness. 	This is the second letter. Your letter of 20th November last has 	been lying on my head all these days. But I did not want to 	disregard doctor's warning.  	Your love for Kantilibtech_335_footnotelibtech_336_footnoteis very great. May he prove worthy of it. Personally I 	have no objection to the betrothal being announced. But it may not 	be in Saraswathi'slibtech_337_footnotelibtech_338_footnoteinterest. She must  have  the  right  of refusal when 	she grows to her full age. As you yourself tell me she knows very 	little of the understanding between you and Kanti or, say, between 	us. Her mind should be left free and unfettered.  	Do ask Saraswathi to write to me some lines on the strength of the 	old connection.      
 I am getting better. Love.

 [ Before December 27,1935]libtech_340_footnote
 A dear friend on seeing Rajendra Babu's letter asking for a pamphlet, among others, on the philosophy represented by the name ‘satyagraha’ asked me if I would write such a pamphlet. Rajendra Babu who knew my preoccupations did not make any such demand upon my time. I, therefore, pleaded my inability when the suggestion came to me. Another suggestion was then put forward that  some friend who knew my writings should make relevant extracts from  them and prepare the booklet required. I readily endorsed it. The result was the following pages prepared after much labour of love. The workers desire to remain unknown. I glanced through  the manuscript and I felt that the work was ably done. I believe that it will enable the reader to appreciate the very important implications of satyagraha. The fascination of the doctrine as an epitome of non- violence is daily growing on me, and I doubt not that if an individual or a nation adopts it as a plan of life, it will promote their happiness and peace and it would be their highest contribution to the attainment of the world peace after which we are all hankering.

264,,ANSWER TO “THE COSMOPOLITAN libtech_343_footnote,"
  
 [1935]libtech_344_footnote
 Not to believe in the possibility of permanent peace is to disbelieve the godliness of human nature. Methods hitherto adopted have failed because rock-bottom sincerity on the part of those who have striven has been lacking. Not that they have realized this lack. Peace is unattainable by part performance of conditions, even as a chemical combination is impossible without complete fulfilment of the conditions of attainment thereof. If the recognized leaders of mankind who have control over engines of destruction were wholly to renounce their use, with full knowledge of its implications, permanent peace can be obtained. This is clearly impossible without the great Powers of the earth renouncing their imperialistic design. This again seems impossible without great nations ceasing to believe in soul- destroying competition and to desire to multiply wants and therefore increase their material possessions. It is my conviction that the root of the evil is want of a living faith in a living God. It is a first-class human tragedy that peoples of the earth who claim to believe in the message of Jesus who they describe as the Prince of Peace show little of that belief in actual practice. It is painful to see sincere Christian divines limiting the scope of Jesus' message to select individuals. I have been taught from my childhood and tested the truth by experience that the primary virtues of mankind are possible of cultivation by the meanest of the human species. It is this undoubted universal possibility that distinguishes the humans from the  rest  of
 
 God's creation. If even one great nation were unconditionally to perform the supreme act of renunciation, many of us would see in our lifetime visible peace established on earth.

271,"January 11, 1936",INTERVIEW TO YONE NOGUCHI libtech_351_footnote,"
  
 [Before January 11, 1936]
 It was in the teeth of the doctors' advice that Gandhiji made an exception in favour of Japan's poet Yone Noguchi and invited him to visit him. He said:
 He is not going to discuss anything with me. I shall simply have the pleasure of listening to him.
 So the poet came and saw Gandhiji in his bed lying with a wet-earth bandage on his head. Gandhiji said:
I sprang from Indian earth and so it is Indian earth that crowns
 me.    NOGUCHI: 	In fundamentals, we are the same, in the virtue of negation, of 
  simplicity, 	of the unification [of] poetry with life, and I am here to give you 	a few words of adoration.  On 	Gandhiji asking him his impressions of his visit to India, he said: 	“India has deeply interested me. So many things I have seen that I 	had never dreamed of seeing. Sometimes I have had disappointments, 	too. In the exhibition at Nagpur I found a new India, people very 	busy working” He asked Gandhiji if he knew  anything 	about Japan. Gandhiji said:  	Nothing except through Edwin Arnold whose descriptionslibtech_352_footnoteof Japanese life I read exactly 45 years ago with 	great avidity as they were appearing in his letters published weekly 	in an English journal. He had married a Japanese wife and all that 	he wrote he did with intimate sympathy.  NOGUCHI: 	You are right, Arnold's book is true even today. Without love and 	sympathy you cannot give a correct picture of a people.  GANDHIJI: Yes, and it is 	easiest to see the darker side. You must have seen our darker side, 	as we know the darker side  of Japan through Japan's traffic and 	trade rivalry. But it is best to see the brighter side, and Japan's 	brighter side I know through Kagawalibtech_353_footnotelibtech_354_footnote.  Kasturba 	came and she was introduced to the poet. Gandhiji said: Don't 	you think, she is the picture of a Japanese woman? NOGUCHI: 	Yes, she is like my mother.      
 Gandhiji was apparently unsatisfied with the very little that the poet said about India. So he said once again:
 Yours is the most hospitable country in the world, I know. I
hope you found my country at least a second best.
 NOGUCHI: Yours is the most hopitable.
 He perhaps did not want to tax Gandhiji in his weak condition. He said: “I have nothing to ask you since your life is an open book to me. You have had nothing to conceal.”
 But as he was leaving he just asked if Gandhiji would give him any message for Japan. Gandhiji said:
My message is included in the message you have received from
 our poet Dr. Tagore. His message includes all the messages that many of us can give.
 Gandhiji requested the poet to visit Ahmedabad and also arranged through Seth Ambalal Sarabhai an invitation to him.

    MY 	DEAR REBEL,  February 	13, 1936 
  	Your rebellious letter have all been delivered to me. I must not 	attempt a long reply. Prabha went yesterday to Patna to join her 	husband. I felt it would be wrong to keep her any longer when I was      . 	. . I had always 	been torn between 	the longing 	for the countryside 	and the longing 	 to be with Bapu. Now I 	had hoped that the time had come when the two longings could be 	fulfilled. The 	situation however became 	very painful. 	If living 	in Segaon 	was to 	mean perpetual separation 	from Bapu, my 	health and 	nerves would not 	be able 	to endure 	it. Already 	my health 	was giving 	way under 	the strain 	which was seriously 	aggravated by 	other people telling me 	that if 	I did 	not stay permanently in 	Segaon, Bapu's 	blood-pressure would get 	worse. When Bapu became 	aware of the fact 	that my nerves 	were giving 	out, he 	said, if 	I could 	not live in Segaon 	he would 	himself go 	there.”  
 almost a discharged patient. The capacity to stand discussions, etc., will come slowly. That fatigue is no new thing. The disinclination came on me a year ago or even earlier.
 Kanti and Kanu are looking after me and they are doing it quite efficiently. Manibehn is guiding them. And Manibehn is an adept in these things. In neatness she is not to be beaten. Ba is still in Bombay nursing Lakshmilibtech_401_footnote.
 God willing, we leave here on 19th giving two days to Bardoli and then we proceed to Wardha. We (Sardar and I) reach Delhi about seventh or eighth March. Your letters are partly responsible for the delay in coming to Delhi. For all your recent letters have warned me against going to Delhi before the end of February. And Sardar would take no risk.
 Hope Shummy is quite well. Looking forward to having an account of your doings in the villages when we meet.

  	I have your letter. I do not think you have quoted me correctly. But 	 that  does  not  affect  your  argument.   My   letterlibtech_404_footnoteof   yesterday anticipates most part of your 	argument and answers it. I do not think you need go to Segaon by way 	of penance. You should go there only if you cannot be happy 	otherwise. Whilst I am in Maganwadi you can render all the personal 	service you like, only letting Ba share what she likes. When I go to 	Segaon, as I must, if you are not there nobody of the present 	company can be with me. I must make new friends and co-workers in 	Segaon. You can settle in any other neighbouring village if you 	like, so as to be near me. I do not contemplate much 	travelling—certainly none outside India in the near future. “I 	do not ask to see the distant scene, one step enough for me!” My 	heart is in the villages. I want an excuse for going there. Of my 	own volition I lack the courage to go or to combat the argument of 	friends. But if you can persuade yourself to leave Segaon, as soon 	as I return from     
 my convalescence, I would love to go to Segaon not  as  any punishment to you but as a welcome God-given opportunity  for going to a village. The rains won't worry me in the slightest degree. I should find for myself all the comfort I may need there. Hence I would like you not to disturb yourself on my account. You should go to Segaon only if you feel the impulse to do village work. If you do not, you should quietly setle down in Maganwadi. Your hut is there. If you need better arrangement you have but to ask. In fine, you must do nothing in violation of the inner voice, whatever it may be. I am getting on. Yes, we halt for two days at Bardoli, reaching there on 23rd, D. V.

ASHRAMlibtech_410_footnote","
       [February 16, 1936]libtech_411_footnote  	Though I have been having rest for the last two months or more I 	have been constantly thinking of the rules and vowslibtech_412_footnotelibtech_413_footnoteof 	our Ashram. Quite a number of the Ashram inmates, old and young, 	have given up or have failed to live up to the vows of the Ashram 	and I wondered if that meant that there was anything inherently 	defective about those vows. But I came to the conclusion that there 	was no such thing and that it was well that we had kept those vows 	in front of us and tried, each according to his or her ability, to 	observe them, and that there was absolutely no cause for regret that 	the vows had been taken. I am devotee of the Gita and a firm 	believer in the inexorable  law  of karma. Even the least little 	tripping or stumbling is not without its cause and I have wondered 	why one who has tried to follow the Gita in thought, word and 	deed should have any ailment. The doctors have assured me that this 	trouble of high blood-pressure is entirely the result of mental 	strain and worry. If that is true, it is likely that I have been 	unnecessarily worrying myself, unnessarily fretting and secretly 	harbouring passions like anger, lust, etc. The fact that any event 	or incident should disturb my mental equilibrium, in spite of my 	serious efforts, means not that the Gita ideal is defective 	but that my devotion to it is defective. The Gita ideal is 	true for all time, my understanding of it and observance of it is 	full of flaws. The same is the case about the vows. The vows are 	true for all time, our observance of them has       
 been defective. The very contemplation of those vows is a source of perennial joy to me.
 I know that several inmates of the old Satyagraha Ashram are staying here. They must be living here for some purpose; it can be none other than service of the Harijans. If they cherish the old vows and insist on their observance, they will be thereby rendering a service to the Harijans. Monetary help is not the only way to serve  the Harijans. Our spirit of service and self-purification may take that concrete shape, but that is not the only shape it can take. We can, for instance, never render monetary help to the extent that Government can do. The essence of our help consists in our passionate desire to help and suffer for them, and that desire can come only out of self- purification, out of the observance of the vows we have been endeavouring to keep all these years. That will be the measure of our service to them, and of our capacity to make them true ‘Harijans’— men of God.

And today I had a look at them. The bowl is made in Germany. The 	razor of course is foreign made, your dharma and mine lies in making 	do with things made in our villages (not even in our cities). For 	this reason and in pursuance of the ideal of non-possession I manage 	without many things. So while on tour I shave with whatever razor I 	can get hold of. In Wardha there is a nationalist barber who shaves 	me with a village-made razor. Such being the situation, how can I 	make use of your bowl and things? Also we must spend every     
 pie with the utmost care because it belongs to the poor, but you go on lavishly spending on me. These thoughts strike me most poignantly here in Bardoli. Hence this letter. Here they have built a hut for me under a mango tree. The walls are of dried stems of tuver in a framework of bamboo. Khadi has been used where found necessary. Not a single pie has been spent in making the hut. When I leave here all the building material of the hut will be returned to its original users. You will also be happy to see the hut. The village industry movement includes such activities.
 I shall find some use for the things I have accepted. It will suffice if this incident remains a guide for the future. Not only should you not incur any unnecessary expense on my account, but anything you buy for me should be of village manufacture. The same consideration should apply to whatever you buy for yourself or for the Majoor Mahajan.
 I am keeping fit. Here, too, I have enough leisure, so there is no cause for worry.

 [February 21, 1936]libtech_431_footnote
GANDHIJI: Is the prejudice against colour growing or dying out?
 DR. THURMANlibtech_432_footnote: It is difficult to say because in one place things look much improved, whilst in another the outlook is still dark. Among many of the Southern white students there is a disposition to improve upon the a attitude of their forbears, and the nigration occasioned by the World War did contribute appreciably to break down the barriers. But the economic question is acute everywhere, and in many of the industrial centres in Middle West the prejudice against the Negro shows itself in its ugliest form. Among the masses of workers there is a great amount of tension, which
 
 is quite natural when the white thinks that the Negro’s very existence is a threat to his own.
   law? G. Is the union between Negroes and the whites recognized by    CARROLlibtech_433_footnote Twenty-five States have laws definitely against these unions, and I 
  have 	had to sign a bond of 500 dollars to promise that I would not 	register any such union.  DR. 	T. But there has been a lot of intermixture of races as for 300 	years or more the Negro woman had no control over her body. Did the 	South African Negro  take 	any part in your movement?  G. No, 	I purposely did not invite them. It would have endangered their 	cause. They would not have understood the technique of our struggle 	nor could they have seen the purpose or utility non-violence.  This 	led to a very interesting discussion of the state of Christianity 	among the South African Negroes and Gandhiji explained at great 	length why Islam scored against Christianity there. “We are often 	told”, said Dr. Thurman, “that but for the Arabs there would 	have been no slavery. I do not believe it.” G. 	No, it is not true at all. For, the moment a slave accepts 	Islam  	he obtains equality with his master, and there are several instances 	of this in history.  The 	whole discussion led to many a question and cross-question during 	which the guests had an occasion to see that Gandhiji‘s principle 	of equal respect for all  religions 	was no theoretical formula but a practical creed. “Is non-violence 	from your point of view a form of direct action”inquired 	Dr. Thurman.  G. It 	is not one form, it is the only form. I do not of course confine the 	words ‘direct action’ to their technical meaning. But without a 	direct active expression of it, non-violence to my mind is 	meaningless. It is the greatest and the activest force in the world. 	One cannot be passively non-violent. In fact‘non-violence’ is a 	term I had to coin in order to bring out the root meaning of ahimsa. 	In spite of the negative particle ‘non’, it is no negative 	force. Superficially we are surrounded in life by strife and 	bloodshed, life living upon life. But some great seer, who ages ago 	penetrated the centre of truth, said: It is not through strife and 	violence, but through non-violence that man can fulfil his destiny 	and his duty to his fellow creatures. It is a force which is more 	positive than electricity and more powerful than even ether. At the 	centre of non-violence is a force which is self-acting.    
 Ahimsa means ‘love’ in the Pauline sense, and yet something more than the ‘love’ defined by St. Paul, although I know St.  Paul's beautiful definition is good enough for all practical purposes. Ahimsa includes the whole creation, and not only human. Besides, love in the English language has other connotations too, and so I was compelled to use the negative word. But it does not, as I have told you, express a negative force, but a force superior to all the forces put together. One person who can express ahimsa in life exercises a force superior to all the forces of brutality.
 Q. And is it possible for any individual to achieve this?
 G. Certainly. If there was any exclusiveness about it, I should reject it at once.
 Q. Any idea of possession is foreign to it?
G. Yes. It possesses nothing, therefore it possesses everything.
 Q. Is it possible for a single human being to resist the persistent invasion of the quality successfully?
G. It is possible. Perhaps your question is more universal than
 you mean. Isn't it possible, you mean to ask, for one single Indian for instance to resist the exploitation of 300 million Indians? Or do you mean the onslaught of the whole world against a single individual personality?
 DR.T. Yes, that is one half of the question. I wanted to know if one man can hold the whole violence at bay?
G. If he cannot, you must take it that he is not a true
 representative of ahimsa. Supposing I cannot produce  a  single instance in life of a man who truly converted his adversary, I would then say that is because no one had yet been found to express ahimsa in its fulness.
 Q. Then it overrides all other forces?
G. Yes, it is the only true force in life.
 DR.T. Forgive the weakness, but may I ask how are we to train individuals or communities in this difficult art?
G.  There is  no  royal road, except through living the creed  in
 your life which must be a living sermon. Of course the expression in one's own life presupposes great study, tremendous perseverance, and thorough cleansing of one's self of all the impurities. If for mastering of the physical sciences you have to devote a whole lifetime, how many lifetimes may be  needed  for  mastering  the   greatest  spiritual
 force that mankind has known? But why worry even if  it  means several lifetimes? For if this is the only permanent thing in life, if this is the only thing that counts,then whatever effort you bestow on mastering it is well spent. Seek ye first the kingdom of Heaven and everything else shall be added unto you. The Kingdom of Heaven is ahimsa.
 MRS.T. How am I to act, supposing my own brother was lynched before my very eyes?
 G. There is such a thing as self-immolation. Supposing I was a Negro, and my sister was ravished by a white or lynched by a whole community, what would be my duty?— I ask myself. And the answer comes to me: I must not wish ill to these, but neither must I co-operate with them. It may be that ordinarily I depend on the lynching community for my livelihood. I refuse to co-operate with them, refuse even to touch the food that comes from them, and I refuse to co- operate with even my brother Negroes who tolerate the wrong. That is the self-immolation I mean. I have often in my life resorted to the plan. Of course a mechanical act of starvation will mean nothing. One's faith must remain undimmed whilst life ebbs out minute by minute. But I am a very poor specimen of the practice of non- violence, and my answer may not convince you. But I am striving very hard, and even if I do not succeed fully in this life, my faith will not diminish.
 “We want you to come to America”, said the guests.
 MRS.T. We want you not for white America, but for the Negroes; we have many   a problem that cries for solution, and we need you badly.
 G. How I wish I could, but I would have nothing to give you unless I had given an ocular demonstration here of all that I have been saying. I must make good the message here before I bring it to you. I do not say that I am defeated, but I have still to perfect myself. You may be sure that the moment I feel the call within me I shall not hesitate.
 DR.T. Much of the peculiar background of our own life in America is our own interpretation of the Christian religion. When one goes through the pages of the hundreds of Negro spirituals, striking things are brought to my mind which remind me of all that you have told us today.
G. Well, if it comes true it may be through the Negroes that the
 unadulterated message of non-violence will be delivered to the world.libtech_434_footnote

309,"February 22, 1936",SPEECH AT VILLAGE WORKERS’ MEETING libtech_435_footnote,"
  
 BARDOLI,
 February 22, 1936
 
 The first question was about the duties of the village workers. The only duty of the village worker was to serve the villagers, said Gandhiji, and he could best serve them if he kept the eleven vowslibtech_436_footnotein front of him as a beacon-light.
 The other question was about the livelihood of the village worker. How was he to earn it? Was he to draw an allowance from an institution, or to earn it by labouring for it, or to depend upon the village for it? The ideal way, said Gandhiji, was to depend upon the village. There was no shame therein, but humility. There was no scope for self-indulgence either, for he could not think of a village which would encourage or tolerate self-indulgence. All that the worker need do was to work for the village all his working hours, and to collect whatever grain and vegetables he needed from the village. He might collect a little money too (for postage and other monetary expenditure) if he should need it, though Gandhiji did not think he could not do without it. The village would willingly support him if he had gone there at the invitation of the village. He could conceive an occasion when the villagers might not be able to tolerate his views and withdraw their support, as, for instance, they did when he admitted untouchables in the Satyagraha Ashram in 1915. Then he should work for his living. It was no use depending on an institution.
 The third question was about body-labour. The village worker was in the village to do as much body-labour as possible and to teach the villagers to outgrow idleness. He might do any kind of labour, but give preference to scavenging. Scavenging was certainly productive labour. He liked some of the workers' insistence on devoting at least half an hour to work entirely of service and of a productive kind.
 
 Scavenging certainly came under that category. Also grinding; for money saved is money got.
 The fourth question was about maintaining a diary. Gandhiji had no doubt that the village worker must be prepared to account for every minute of his waking hours and must fill them with work and mention it distenctly in his diary. A real diary was a mirror of the diarist's mind and soul, but many might find it difficult to make a truthful record of their mind's activities. In that case they might confine themselves to a record of their physical activities. But it should not be done in a haphazard way. Simply sayng, “Worked in the kitchen” would not do. One may have whiled away one's time in the kitchen. Specific items of work should be mentioned.
 The fifth question was about work among Dublas who work more or lesss as serfs in certain parts of Gujarat. Service of Dublas, said Gandhiji, meant readiness to share their toil and their hardships, and to get into touch with their masters and to see that they dealt with them justly and kindly.
 Summing up, Gandhiji said:
 The village worker will leave politics alone. He may become a Congress member, but he may not take part in an election campaign. He has his work cut out for himself. The Village  Industries Association and the Spinners' Association were both created by the Congress. and yet they work independently of the Congress. That is why they and their members steer clear of all Congress politics. That is the non-violent way.
 He will also leave village factions alone. He must go and settle there determined to do without most of the things he does not do without in a city. If I sit down in a village I should have to decide what things I should not take with me in the village, however inherently harmless those things may be. The question is whether those things will sort well or ill with the life of an ordinary villager. He will be incorruptible and stand like a rock against the inroad of temptations and save the village from them. Even one pure soul can save a whole village, as one Vibhishanalibtech_437_footnotesaved Lanka. Sodom and Gomorrah were not destroyed so long as there was one pure soul left in them.libtech_438_footnoteThat is why I said long ago that I would far rather that India perished than sacrifice truth in order to save it.

  	Kumarappa handed me your welcome longish letter at the station. The 	prescription for flit is twice welcome. I needed it. It will duly 	appear in Harijan without your name. The parcel will 	arrive in due 	course. How wise of me to have let you cut out libtech_439_footnotelibtech_440_footnoteyard!

Perhaps then we should cease to be. So you see, if I certify 	your art, it will be a feather in your cap. But then you will have 	to sport a cap to wear the feather!  	This shows how well I must be in spite of the journey. I am sorry 	you can't come to Savli.  	We shall see, when we meet in Delhi, what you will or can do in the 	nature of service.

  	I got your two letters together. You caused me a little anxiety, for 	you were told to write immediately after reaching, were you not? You 	may certainly go to Mother, if there is nothing for Jayaprakash that 	you might have to do, that is, if there is no service to render him. 	You may visit your other relatives, if you have to. However, you 	ought to stay with him if he accepts your services and eats the food 	you cook. You may come to me after seeing your elders if he is not 	at all in need of your services and you can gain your freedom 	gladly. Before coming, however, it should be clear that you will 	come not to render me any special personal service but to do the 	task that I might assign to you. Is this clear?  	The language you write is good enough. You have secured a good 	command over Gujarati.  	Mind you preserve your health. You should insist on Jayaprakash 	following the remedies needed for his health.  	We reached Wardha safely yesterday. We are putting up  at Kanya 	Ashram. Kanti and Kanu look after me.

  "
322,,NOTHING WITHOUT GRACE,"
  
 
 By the grace of medical friends and self-constituted gaolers, Sardar Vallabhbhai and Jamnalalji, I am now able by way of trial to resume to a limited extent my talks with the readers of Harijan. The restrictions that they have put on my liberty and to which I have agreed, are that, for the time being at any rate, I shall not write for Harijan more than I may consider to be absolutely necessary and that, too, not involving more than a few hours' writing per week. I shall not carry on private correspondence with reference to correspondents' personal problems or domestic difficulties, except those with which I have already concerned myself, and I shall not accept public engagements or attend or speak at public gatherings. There  are  positive directions about sleep, recreation, exercise and food, with which the reader is not concerned and with which therefore I need not deal. I hope that the readers of Harijan and correspondents will co- operate with me and Mahadev Desai, who has in the first instance to attend to all correspondence, in the observance of these restrictions.
 It will interest the reader to know something about the origin of the breakdown and the measures taken to cope with it. So far as I have understood the medical friends, after a very careful and painstaking examination of my system they have found no functional derangement. Their opinion is that the breakdown was most probably due to deficiency of proteins and carbohydrates in the form of sugar and starches, coupled with overstrain for a prolonged period involving long hours and concentration on numerous taxing private problems in addition to the performance of daily public duty. So far as I can recollect I had been complaining for the past twelve months or more that, if I did not curtail the volume of ever-growing work, I was sure to break down. Therefore when it came, it was nothing new to me. And it is highly likely that the world would have heard little of it but for the over-anxiety of one of the friends who, on seeing me indisposed, sent a sensational note to Jamnalalji who gathered together all the medical talent that was available in Wardha and sent messages to Nagpur and Bombay for further help.
 The day I collapsed I had a warning on rising in the morning that there was some unusual pain about the neck, but I made light of it and never mentioned it to anybody. I continued to go through the
 daily programme. The final stroke was a most exhausting and serious conversation I had with a friend whilst I was having the daily evening stroll. The nerves had already been sufficiently taxed during the preceding fortnight with the consideration and solution of problems which for me were quite as big and as important as, say, the paramount question of swaraj.
 Even if no fuss had been made over the collapse, I would have taken nature's peremptory warning to heart, given myself moderate rest and tided over the difficulty. But looking back upon the past I feel that it was well that the fuss was made. The extraordinary precautions advised by the medical friends and equally extraordinary care taken by the two ‘gaolers’ enforced on me the exacting rest which I would not have taken and which allowed ample time for introspection. Not only have I profited by it but the introspection has revealed vital defects in my following out of the interpretation of the Gita as I have understood it. I have discovered that I have not approached with adequate detachment the innumerable problems that have presented themselves for solution. It is clear that I have taken many of them to heart and allowed them to rouse my emotional being and thus affect my nerves. In other words they have not, as they should have in a votary of the Gita, left my body or mind untouched.  I verily believe that one who literally follows the prescription of the eternal Mother need never grow old in mind. Such a one's body will wither in due course like leaves of a healthy tree, leaving the mind as young and as fresh as ever. That seems to me to be the meaning of Bhishma delivering his marvellous discourse to Yudhishthira though he was on his death-bed. Medical friends were never tired of warning me against being excited over or affected by events happening around me. Extra precautions were taken to keep from me news of a tragic character. Though, I think, I was not quite so bad a devotee of the Gita as their precautions Lead me to suppose, there was undoubtedly substance behind them. For I discovered with what a  wrench  I accepted Jamnalalji's conditions and demand that I should remove from Maganwadi to Mahila Ashram. Anyway I had lost credit with him for detached action. The fact of the collapse was for him eloquent enough testimony for discrediting my vaunted detachment. I must plead guilty to the condemnation.
 The worst however was to follow. I have been trying to follow brahmacharya consciously and deliberately since  1899.  My definition of it is purity not merely of body but of both speech and
 thought also. With the exception of what must be regarded as one lapse, I can recall no instance, during more than thirty-six years' constant and conscious effort, of mental disturbance such as I experienced during this illness. I was disgusted with myself. The moment the feeling came I acquainted my attendants and the medical friends with my condition. They could give me no help. I expected none. I broke loose after the experience from the rigid rest that was imposed upon me. The confession of the wretched experience brought much relief to me. I felt as if a great load had been raised from over me. It enabled me to pull myself together before any harm could be done.libtech_449_footnotelibtech_450_footnoteBut what of the Gita? Its teaching is clear and precise. A mind that is once hooked to the Star of stars becomes incorruptible. How far I must be from Him, He alone knows. Thank God, my much- vaunted Mahatmaship has never fooled me. But this enforced rest has humbled me as never before. It has brought to the surface my limitations and imperfections. But I am not so much ashamed of them, as I should be of hiding them from the public. My faith  in  the message of the Gita is as bright as ever. Unwearied ceaseless effort is the price that must be paid for turning that faith into rich infallible experience. But the same Gita says without any equivocation that the experience is not to be had without divine grace. We should develop swelled heads if Divinity had not made that ample reservation.

 SALVI,
 February 29, 1936
 The truth is that I have come here after opening the exhibition. I thought that first I would see the exhibition and then tell you what was worth seeing there. Just now you have heard the reports of those who have brought exhibits from other parts.
 When I was told that an exhibition was to be held here I had an impression that there would be things produced in Savli and the neighbouring villages. They would not be numerous. Khadi work is being carried on here. Fine khadi is made. The Harijans get their livelihood from it, because most of the workers are Harijans. From this point of view I feel the lack of the different processes and types of khadi. The reason given for this is—and it may be a correct one—that we would see Savli closely, study it well and would try to measure in a better way Savli's capacity in khadi production.
 For the last two or three months efforts were being made for the members to meet here. For this reason I had expected that you would try in the mean time and exhibit articles made here. Had this been done, all of us would have had the opportunity to see what Savli could do. But this criticism should be borne in mind for the future. The sessions of our Sangh will always be held in villages. On such occasions we should undertake a study of the local industries and the products to explore the potentialities of the place  and  content ourselves with exhibiting only the things that it can produce. We must also see that we do not confuse the aims of such exhibitions with those of a museum. There can be a display of ancient things which have no connection with our economic life. But such museums should be where they belong; they have no place in our sessions. Our duty is to concentrate on only those industries and crafts which are capable of
 
 being revived. Now when you go and see the exhibition, also note what things are not there and what could have been included.
 A circular had been sent to you about what you were to bring when coming here. It asked you to bring a lantern, writing material, postcards, envelopes, stamps, etc. The circular was appropriate because these things are not available in villages. More than 80% of the villagers are illiterate. So who would store these things for sale? It would have been an unnecessary expenditure if lanterns  were provided by the Sangh.
 The circular also mentioned that it was difficult to procure milk in Savli and cow's milk was practically unprocurable. Those who needed cow's ghee were instructed to bring their own supply. After coming here you would have discovered that buffalo's milk has been provided for you. You would hardly know that your milk supply comes from Chandalibtech_452_footnotelibtech_453_footnotelibtech_454_footnoteand vegetables from Nagpurlibtech_455_footnotelibtech_456_footnote.  I think it is sinful. It was our duty to have had cows here instead of getting milk and vegetables from such a long distance. So many of our people live here. They could always have kept some cows. Of course it would have meant some expenditure. It is possible that less expenditure is incurred in procuring milk from Chanda. But the higher expenditure would not have been improper. We should have also had vegetables grown here. We should have informed the farmers two or three months in advance that three to four hundred of our people were coming to stay here for a week. We would require so many maunds of vegetables daily and they should right then plan their farms to meet the needs. They would have gladly welcomed your suggestion and would have thanked you for having decided to have the session at Savli.
 It is better to do without milk or vegetables for a week if such local arrangements are not possible. Arrangements should be made for sick persons or people like me who cannot do without milk or vegetables and that, too, from the supply that is locally available. A pertinent question is: why should they take the trouble of coming such a long distance? We should keep it in mind that we should be able to benefit the villagers to the maximum from our stay there. At least we should try to do so. We should try and get the necessary things made there. If we incur an expenditure of Rs. 3,000 over such a
 
 
 session, we should try and see that we benefit the local people to the same extent by our body-labour purchasing power.

 SAVLI,
 March 1, 1936
 I shall devote one hour every day to the session. During that time I can speak for about half an hour at the most, and the remaining half hour will be spent in listening to your questions and so on. I have already received some questions from you and the Presidentlibtech_458_footnotehas also raised some questions in the course of his speech. I shall first reply to his questions. If my reply raises any further questions in your minds, you are free to ask them.
 The first question concerns the subsistence wages. In my view we cannot formulate any exact rule about it. We can no doubt say that we shall not go beyond a certain limit. For instance, the Sangh has set the limit of Rs. 75 as monthly wage. According to me even this is too much, because our field of activity is in the villages. And we cannot allow Rs. 75 or Rs. 50 in the villages. Nor is so much money needed there. True, all people cannot go to the villages. They have their own difficulties. Then, there are some people who are good workers and whose ideas and actions are acceptable and whom  we  would  not permit to leave the field of service. And they cannot maintain themselves on low wages either. To such people we can give even Rs.
 75. But we give this reluctantly and they too accept it reluctantly. This, however, is not a matter to be considered by others. But, if one person can carry on with Rs. 5, why should he demand Rs. 50  Merely  because some other parson is getting Rs. 50? The person earning Rs. 50 or Rs. 75 has either poor health or has some other handicaps which the person earning Rs. 5 does not have. This should not be considered a matter of competition at all. Let a person take only what he needs. For instance, Mirabehn can manage with very little. But I told her that she should definitely take milk and fruits. Because of this her monthly expense goes up to Rs. 10 or 15. But Gajanan who works in her place
 
 in Sindi has such habits that he requires almost nothing compared to Mirabehn. This does not make him envy Mirabehn. And it should not make him envious. Thus, no one should accept more than his  minimum requirements. Any person who has lived in a city so far and has now gone to a village but has not been able to adjust himself to village life may take higher wages for some time.
 The next question deals with body-labour. What I have said earlier includes my reply on this point also. Each person will function within his own individual limits. We cannot lay down more than this. Let every man put in the maximum body-labour he can. One worker wrote to me that he managed to earn his livelihood in the village; but all his time was spent in doing body-labour. He had resolved to take to spinning and also planned to make a living by spinning. But he found no time to do anything else. I have written to him that, if he continues his work with devotion, people will have a lesson to learn even from this. If the people of the village desire to accept his services, he can educate their children, clean up the garbage and in return earn his bread from them. If he puts his heart in his work, he will be able to earn his livelihood. But he must take only what is necessary. He may be able to have sweets, ghee, fruits, etc., if he asks for them. But he should not accept these things even if the people offer them on their own. I go round with the thought of the village in my mind, and so other problems do not arise for me. There can be no question at all of drawing the maximum out of public funds.
 PRESIDENT: What should be the lowest limit of body-labour, so that, if a particular worker is not able to put in that much work, he would be justified [in withdrawing himself and thus] cease to be a drain on public funds?
 GANDHIJI: I have understood your question. But it is not possible to set the same limit for all workers. In fact, each one of them should put in as much labour as he can. Let him earn whatever wages he can, and supplement the deficit from the funds of the Sangh. If his needs are not so great that it would be disturbing to others when they know about them, he should not hesitate to meet them from the Sangh. I cannot set any limit. I would not set any limit if the management were in my hands. I do not also wish to determine which type of work should be regarded as body-labour. I can only say that writing a book is not body-labour.
 The third question—a very difficult one—relates to the family. Members should help the President in solving this problem. And the
 
 President also should be alert in the matter. We have changed our way of life. We have given up the old tradition. Nevertheless, we are born in the cities. We have got our parents, wives and children. They have been all brought up in the old tradition. They have not changed their way of living. We wonder what right we have to compel them to accept the way of life we have accepted. And we want to educate our children in the old method which we have discarded. That is the reason why the workers are worried about the future of their children. They wonder if they would be able to educate their children so as to make them lawyers or doctors. On the one hand, a member of the Sangh lives in poverty and on the other he feels that his duty to his wife and children is different from what he has accepted for himself. He believes that sacrifice is his dharma but not his family's. Renunciation is regarded as a duty in old age. At the root of this idea is the traditional Hindu sentiment that we should renounce the world in old age. That is why we want to educate our children in the old way. But we have given up the belief that renunciation is a duty only of old age, not imperative for youth. We have accepted it as our duty,  even  in  youth,  to renounce all pleasures and serve the country. If we believe that  sacrifice is man's dharma and that our pleasures should be consistent with the dharma of renunciation, then it becomes our duty  to recognize the appropriateness of this dharma for our wives  and children as well. If they insist on having more than this, let us tell them that we can give them only this much, that we can give them only the food that we ourselves eat; that what we consider proper for ourselves, we consider proper for them too. What more could be done? Right from my South Africa days I have adhered to this ideal. There is nothing wrong in wanting to reduce one's income. And any ideal which is right for us is also right for our children. All problems would be easily solved if we acccept this. But the conflict arises when we believe that our wives and children have a different dharma to follow. We must go as far along this path as possible. If, out of an impulse, we have gone too far, there should be no hesitation in retracing our steps. The Sangh should carry on with whatever means it may be having. Let us keep an eye on our resources and fix the maximum limit. But, in doing this, we shall have to look to the country as well. We are bound to be affected by whatever may be happening in the country. And it is our goal to take the country along with us. We must always try to pursue our activities taking the country with us. I cannot lay down any rule in such matters. These are matters concerning the individual and
 they depend on his sincerity. The highest limit of Rs. 75 has been set. Whether or not that amount should be drawn is a matter for individual decision.
 JAMNALALJI: But, from the point of view of an organization, it becomes necessary to make some rules. It would not be a good rule that the organization should give what an individual considers proper to demand. One who is engaged in public work should also think of one's market value.
 G. I think from the public viewpoint it is difficult to clarify the matter any further. A person's market value may be Rs. 25 merely because he knows only Marathi and Sanskrit and is ignorant  of English. But why should we put his value merely at Rs. 25? Take the example of a woman spinner. She would not earn even a pice in the market. But we have decided to pay her three annas. The question of market value arises in the case of a lawyer or a doctor. He charges whatever fee he desires. But we should not make such distinctions. We may make some distinction if the lowness of one's wages is due to one's special quality. For instance, if the needs of Gajanan are fewer than those of Mirabehn, he has no need to take as much as Mirabehn. If a person who is a B.A. LL.B. and another with a knowledge of Marathi-Sanskrit have similar functions to perform, they should be valued at the same rate.
 J. But, if a person who can earn only Rs. 25 outside can get Rs. 40 from the Sangh, he would remain with the Sangh merely because of the temptation to get Rs. 40 even at the cost of degrading his soul.
 G. That is correct. But it depends on the firmness of the organizers of the Sangh; if there were any such person in the Sangh, they should convey it to him that he does not possess the abilities he was supposed to possess. But take the example of Ravishankerbhailibtech_459_footnotelibtech_460_footnote. He may not have any market value but he is a great worker.
 J. What would be the correct policy with regard to the education of children and medical treatment?
 G. The education of the boys certainly deserves our consideration. I have already said that the dharma which is proper for us should also be considered proper for our families. The children should not be converted to another dharma. If I have considered it my dharma to maintain myself through body-labour, it would be as good as converting my son to another dharma if I try to make him a
 
 barrister. I can only give him training in body-labour. Along with this, I should give my children whatever education I can within the income limits I have set for myself.
 Let me now come to the point of medical treatment. Take the example of Timmappa. It is true that once we have gone  to  the villages, we should adjust our whole life accordingly. But we must also look to the results of our experiments. What was the result of Timmappa's not taking milk for a few days? He had to spend on railway fare to go to Bombay. He had to be under obligation to a doctor. But even that was a mistake. When we go to a village and live in poverty, we must avail ourselves only of such medical facilities as the poor villagers can command for maintaining their health. Even if you tell me that I do not follow this precept myself, I cannot conceal my ideal, though I may accept the charge. He who remains continuously ill should send in his resignation.
 RAJENDRA BABU : Why do you stress so much the condition of the worker maintaining himself by body-labour? This would leave little time for service. It may be all right to set an example to the people but setting an example is not enough. The need for advice and consultation cannot be ruled out. A worker's usefulness is very much reduced by overmuch insistence on physical labour.
G.   This  involves  the   question  of  reforming  the   entire indian
 society Every human being should maintain himself only through physical labour. I consider it a divine law. That is the reason why I have fixed that ideal. Now, the question is about intellectual development Yes, it is a relevant question. But, if I could have power over the world, I would make physical labour compulsory for everybody. Exceptions would have to be made even here, for example,in favour of sannyasis and such others. People would themselves make the means of livelihood available to them. Whether you call it society or people or State, the meaning is the same. I am not making any new or original point. Ruskin, in his Unto This Last (translated by me as Sarvodayalibtech_461_footnotelibtech_462_footnote) has said the same thing. Our Shastras also stress the same point. It may not be clearly mentioned, but it is there by implication. I am not well-versed in the Shastras. Vinobaji and Kakasaheb can talk with authority citing references from the Shastras. But I  found the point clearly expounded in  Unto This Last
 
 6-6-1908; [V], 13-6-1908; [VI], 20-6-1908; [VII], 27-6-1908; [VIII], 4-7-1908; [IX],
 18-7-1908.
 and that very night I transformed my life. The gist of Ruskin's argument is that a doctor or a lawyer should take the same wages as a labourer.
 R. What should the present members do to pursue that ideal?
 
 G. All the present members have this ideal before them. But in the pursuit of that ideal they may follow some honest occupation or take their wages from the Sangh. But the Sangh should give wages only to those whose services it values. It should not give the wages as a favour. The Sangh should not make anyone dependent on it. This Sangh is not to produce parasites. It may become dependent on them by taking the maximum work from them.
 DEVSHARMAJI: Is not the limit of Rs. 75 too high?
 G. All the better if it could be brought down. As for me I have decided upon Rs. 15 as the limit. you may lower it from Rs. 75 to Rs. 50 if you wish. But it does not seem likely.

326,"March 3, 1936",327. LETTER TO DR. M. A. ANSARI,"
 March 3, 1936
 DEAR DR. ANSARI,
 Having obtained some dispensation from medical friends, I am able to write this to you. I hope to reach Delhi on 8th. I hope you will prevent people from coming to the station. I am not in a fit state to face crowds and cut my way through them. I should love quietly to be taken to Birla's new Harijan Home.
 This must—could—have been written by Mahadev. I have taken up this letter to tell you that as soon as I received your great booklibtech_463_footnoteon regeneration, I began to read it and finished it the day following. I have called it great because it is evidence of much research and great labour. There is hardly a superfluous word in it.
 But as I was reading it, I asked myself, “Does this book take mankind upward? Is it in need of that kind of regeneration? What is revival of youth worth if you cannot be sure of persistent physical existence for two consecutive seconds?”
 
 Is mere physical restoration the end of true medical science? I wonder!
 I asked myself these questions, because you were the author of the book I have ever known you as a seeker of God. When you can spare a few moments, I would like to know from you how this form of regeneration harmonizes with a search after God.

        DEAR 	FRIEND,       March 	3, 1936 
  	I thank you for your letter. I attach no value to my son's letter of 	recantation, and if the job he has received is the price for his 	recantation, it is a premium put upon sin.libtech_464_footnotelibtech_465_footnoteAs 	my son is continuously under the subtle influence of drink he has 	become incapable of coherent thinking or constancy to his words. 	Nevertheless, if he is faithful in the performance of the job given 	to him, it is so much to the good. I can only hope that he only 	appreciates the extraordinary kindness that has been shown to him by 	you and others and that he makes good use of the money he is 	receiving.  Yours 	sincerely,  M. K. G.  From 	the manuscript of Mahadev Desai's Diary. Courtesy: Narayan Desai   "
328,"March 	3, 1936",LETTER TO PRABHAVATI,"
           CHI. 	PRABHA,         SAVLI,  March 	3, 1936 
  	I got your letter this morning. I read it immediately after having 	my meal, had a few rounds and am now writing this reply at 8.30.  	I tore up your letter soon after reading it. What was so 	confidential init that you had to doubly reassure yourself? Indeed, 	there was nothing private at all. And how could you have so private 	a    
 thing as that? I shall, however, carry out your wish so long as you mark your letter confidential and ask me to tear it up. Your going has of course lessened my anxiety because the going meant following the law of truth, and not to go would have been, I feared, its violation. But that had no relation to the blood Pressure, which had already been going down and so went down by itself. I was not so much worried about your staying on, as I knew all the time that you would at last do the right thing only, and you did so quite promptly. As for the blood- pressure, however, things will go on as they have been going. It had reached 188/110 at Wardha and once it went up to as high as 212/120, but the same day again it fell to 188/108. I don't know what it now is. It cannot, therefore, be said at all that the blood-pressure went down because of your going. You may come when you can, after staying there as long as you have the duty to stay on. Happiness ever goes with dharma. And there alone lies peace of mind. Never have any doubt that there can be no happiness in the violation of dharma.
 Why do you want to be exempted from taking milk? Your good lies only in taking it. Of course, you have freedom to reduce its quantity when you cannot digest four lb. of it. There will be no difficulty in digesting four lb. of milk as long as you have regular exercise and sleep. As for fruit, take what is easily to be had. It will be good if Jayaprakash follows the same diet as yours.
 Keep your diary day after day. I follow your point about  studies. You may do what you can. Study Hindi grammar. Send for anything you need from here. I shall leave here on the 6th, hoping to reach Delhi on the 8th. I shall be spending at least a fortnight there.
 You must have written, I think, to Swaruprani and others about Kamala. Ba is in Bombay, Rajaji, who has gone to Bombay, may perhaps come here.
 We have a fairly good gathering here. The weather is fair and they see that I get good peace and rest.
 It seems one of your letters has been lost in transit. I have noted that. I know it is unlikely that you would avoid writing out of laziness. The fear is you might grow melancholy, but you ought not to under any circumstances. Doesn't Mother Gita teach us to endure cheerfully the situation that we happen to be in?
 Blessings from

329,"March 3, 1936","SPEECH AT GANDHI SEVA SANGH
MEETINGIII","
  
 SAVLI,
 March 3, 1936
 Ramnarayanjilibtech_466_footnotelibtech_467_footnotehas passed on a letter to the President. He showed it to me, and I read it too. Then I wished to know what this committeelibtech_468_footnotefor Gandhian thought was, who were the persons constituting it, what were its powers and so on. Then I was informed about all that happened yesterday. I was told at the same time that this committee was not a body authorized by this session. This session does not function by passing resolutions. When the occasion arose,  a suggestion was made, and then those who favoured the suggestion formed a committee. At first I felt that I should not involve myself in this matter. I felt also that since I had not been able to be present at the discussion, I was not entitled to express any opinion. Nevertheless,  I do have an opinion on the subject and I consider it my duty to express it even if it should be considered an impertinence on my part. I wish to make clear to the committee its scope. If it undertakes any work, it should only be one of collecting my thoughts and beliefs. If it does   anything   more,   I   am   afraid   the   misgivingslibtech_469_footnotelibtech_470_footnoteexpressed   by Ramnarayanji are bound to come true.
 I have conceived no such thing as Gandhism. I am not an exponent of any sect. I never claimed to have originated any philosophy. Nor am I endeavoring to do so. Several people said to me
 
 that I should write a  smritilibtech_471_footnotelibtech_472_footnoteof Gandhian thought. I told them that I could not presume to vie with the ancient law-givers. I have no such plans. The right to codify my thoughts cannot belong  to  me. Whatever is lasting will take shape after I am gone. Without any elaborate scheme I have simply tried in my own way to apply the eternal Principles of truth and non-violence to our daily life and problems. Like a child I did whatever occurred to me on the spur of the moment during the course of events.
 Then I realized that what I was doing were experiments in truth. In doing so I have sometimes erred and learnt by my errors. Life has thus become for me a series of experiments in truth. In my pursuit of truth I came across the method of non-violence. By instinct I have been a votary of truth, but not non-violent. As the Muni Jinavijayaji once rightly observed, I was all for truth and was capable of sacrificing non-violence for the sake of truth. I confessed to him that it was true. For me “there was no dharma higher than truth” and “no dharma higher than the supreme duty of non-violence.”libtech_473_footnotelibtech_474_footnoteThe word dharma in my opinion has different connotations as used in the two statements. In other words it means that there cannot be an ideal higher then truth and there cannot be any duty higher than non- violence. A man can pursue truth only by constantly adhering to this duty. There is no other means for the pursuit of truth. For the sake of truth one should not hesitate even to witness the ruin of one's country. One may even leave one's country. Paul Richard  has  severely  criticized me in this regard. He had pointed out  the  difference between my ideas and those of Manusmriti. I do not regard it as dharma to have to resort to untruth either for the sake of argument or to protect the cow. This statement is correct. However, I do not think this is a subject which can be discussed academically.
 Well, all my philosophy, if it may be called by that pretentious name, is contained in what I have said. You will not call it Gandhism; there is no ism about it. And no elaborate literature is needed about it. All that I have written is but a description of whatever I have done. And my actions alone are the greatest exposition of truth and non- violence. Those who believe in these can propagate them only by following them in practice. They call for no books. My work is there for them to emulate. But it may be said that this, too, is not permanent.
 
 
 A caustic critic once observed that the spinning-wheel would be so discredited that when I died the wheels would serve to  make  the funeral pyre. That, however, has not shaken my faith in the spinning- wheel. I will not despair even if you all forsook me. My faith will grow all the more. Indeed, I have never despaired nor have I had to repent. I do not regret the long struggle that I have put up nor the amount of money and the number of lives lost. Whenever I went to the villages I have returned with my vessel full of hope. But how can I convince the world that one cannot communicate this confidence with the help of books? Silent work alone can provide it. Hence no one should yield to the weakness that he would be  helpless  if  the committee did not supply literature. The workers complain that  pundits from the government and other circles go to the villagers and criticize our ideas. They misguide the people. What can we do, then, since we do not have their superior knowledge?
 It is a real difficulty. But where is the need for books? Tell the villagers that you are there in their midst to serve them with your wheels, your brooms and buckets. Let them accept your service if they will. Must we then, you will ask, work away in silence, without bothering about our critics? Yes; I should not mind even your taking a vow of silence. Write if you feel you cannot do without it. But let not your real work suffer because you are busy writing books.
 This, however, is the ideal. This committee was not  so  imperative. But now that it has come into being it will not be inconsistent with our work. There are no grounds for Ramnarayanji's misgivings. All we need is a little vigilance. I can understand your desire for some authoritative publications explaining the things we are striving to do. These you may have without entering into  a controversy. The committee should function quietly without much ado. It will only spread poison, if it sets about to work with pomp and show. And of course it shall have to be self-supporting.
 I should be satisfied if your Sangh became a register of workers who have complete faith in all activities which are a concrete expression of truth and non-violence, or rather simply of non- violence (for the practice of non-violence is impossible without acceptance of truth). Thus let no member say that he believes in truth and non-violence, but does not believe in handicrafts or khadi and service of the villagers therethrough, or that he believes in truth and
 non-violence but does not believe in Hindu-Muslim unity, or in the removal of untouchability. If your meet such a one you may tell him that it is possible that he is a believer in truth and non-violence according to his own conception, but not according to Gandhiji's conception of them, and that he cannot therefore be a member of the Sangh. Beyond this, your  Sangh has no credal, regional or institutional limitations. Your members may belong to any caste or creed, any race or nation.
I agree with the President regarding this.libtech_475_footnote
 There is no need to repeat that everyone should follow the ideal of celibacy. Of course it is not possible to ride two horses at a time. Those who are not married or, though married, are living like unmarried ones can serve better. But it is no possible to have a rigid rule regarding this. Moreover, there is no need for it. It is good if we get workers who do not wish to marry but if tomorrow Gajanan or Surendra wants to get married, he can do so and still remain a member of the Sangh. If their expenses increase they can take them from the Sangh. It is a personal question. Hypocrisy and unchastity will creep in if we form a rule for it.
 Some of the shortcomings shown by the President are shortcomings of the whole of India. It is necessary for us to be alert about them. Those who are worshippers of truth and non-violence and want to serve India and humanity cannot afford to be lazy. Those who waste time waste truth, non-violence and service as well. This applies to cleanliness, too. If we are alert, do not waste time and observe cleanliness, we will not be lacking in knowledge. What we call lack of knowledge is actually lack of concentration. Mother Gita says that one who worships with faith will automatically gain knowledge.libtech_476_footnote
 The  President  has   shown   three   angles.libtech_477_footnotePossession   is  really mental. I have a watch, a rope and an undergarment. I am possessive,
 
 
 if I feel unhappy without them. A person can keep a large blanket if he needs one; if he is not distressed when it is lost he is not possessive.
 What the President has saidlibtech_478_footnotelibtech_479_footnoteis enough. There is no need to say more.libtech_480_footnote
 I see that there is a tendency to believe that these programmes are mutually exclusive or antagonistic. Much of our misunderstanding arises out of this belief. The worker in the constructive field looks down upon the political programme and vice versa. But really there is no such opposition. I had thought that it was clear by now to every worker that there was no absolute division between the so-called political and the so-called constructive programmes. In our method of work there are no watertight compartments. Nevertheless I do maintain that for the sake of efficiency it is necessary for one to confine oneself to one item at a time or such items as conveniently run together. The governor of the Bank of England exercises considerable influence on the politics of England, but he never busies himself with what are called active politics. He has hardly the time to follow the debates in the House of Commons. But he is at least as important a member in the English public life as, say, a noted member of the House of Commons. As a general rule I would suggest that the members of the Sangh should occupy themselves with work which brings no kudos and which is ordinarily not liked by workers.
 We have different programmes, such as the Spinners' Association, the Harijan sevak Sangh, the Village  Industries Association and goseva, which I have not yet placed before you. But one connected with goseva can also become a member of the Sangh. Those who wish may even take part in more than one activity. It is a matter of one's capacity. As for me, I can attend to other things even as I work for the Charkha Sangh Everybody cannot do the same. For example, take the Parliamentary Boardlibtech_481_footnotelibtech_482_footnote. Even this I have brought into being. But would I ever join it? Today I cannot even think of entering the Legislatures. However, it is not a matter of principle. We must do whatever may be necessary at a given time. And tomorrow, if I deem it
 
 my duty to go to the Legislature, I may very well do it. It was I who started the civil disobedience movement. But I instructed the Hindi propaganda workers in South India that they should not court imprisonment, as the work would suffer. Only Anna (Shri Harihar Sharma) from among them went to jail and that, too, with my permission. I had told Shankerlal [Banker] that the work of the Spinners' Association was as valuable as courting of imprisonment by thousands of men. Except for a few days in the beginning, jail-going became another name for taking rest. Those who remained outside faced a number of hardships and those who had gone to jail returned strong and sturdy. Once they went in, they violently defied the jail rules. What good did such people do by going to jail? It is a mistake to make a distinction between the constructive and the political programmes. In my opinion, political work also is constructive work. I once wrote in Young India that even civil disobedience was constructive work according to me. But from the point of view of the world, it may be described as destructive. In reality, they are two branches of satyagraha, and hence are akin. One cannot be complete without the other. But some people wonder how goseva, removal of untouchability or propagation of Hindi could be called political activities. Would these things bring swaraj? But it is my belief that swaraj cannot be attained without these. Many Congressmen, too, do not have faith in them. It is also our task to inspire such faith in them. These people do not consider these activities political. Hence, they describe them as constructive. A large number of people are ready to take to activities which they regard as political. Hence, we must consciously abide by a particular rule.The whole thing will break down if we do not observe the rule. That is the reason why the work is going on well in Gujarat. Today we have imperfect faith in these things. The plant is tender. We have to tend it with great care. It is my belief that if we could do these four or five things well, swaraj is as good as in our hands. It would also increase our efficiency. I am reminded of an incident. There was some discussion about the constructive programme at a meeting. Saprulibtech_483_footnotelibtech_484_footnote, Chintamanilibtech_485_footnotelibtech_486_footnoteand  Pallibtech_487_footnotewere also present there. Chintamani was very critical of the constructive programme. Pal replied to him. He was considered my
 
 opponent; but his sharp intellect grasped the thing. Of language he was a master. He explained, much better than I could have done, that with it the prestige of the country would go up. He said we had come across something which would give us the strength that we would not derive from all our other works and all the journals. What he expressed in a beautiful language I conveyed in my uncouth language. My faith in the constructive programme is probably ten times it was then.
 The work of the Parliamentary Board is also my creation. But, if you wish to go to the Legislatures for this reason, I shall not allow you to do so. Today, I shall send Bhulabhailibtech_488_footnotethere. He has faith in that work and he is also capable. What would I do with Satyamurtilibtech_489_footnotehere? If I have to attain swaraj through music, I would send Khareshastrilibtech_490_footnoteor Balkoba. And, if your faith in the constructive programme is deep enough, you must do only that work. Such is my faith in goseva. I even dream of the cow. Let us all concentrate on our own work and our own place. Let that be our dharma. And even if another's dharma appears to be best we should understand that it is fraught with danger.

 SAVLI,
 March 4, 1936
 Before replying to the questionslibtech_491_footnotelibtech_492_footnoteI wish to say a few things on my own. I have of course no right to say anything. But it is my habit to express my opinion on whatever I hear. I am no doubt very eager to listen to your discussion. But I have held back my eagerness. Even so, things are conveyed to me by jailor (the Sardar), sometimes light- heartedly and sometimes solemnly. Why have we all gathered here? Why are we wasting our time? I hear that votes were taken on the question of the wages for the members of the Sangh. Four hours were spent in unnecessary arguments over it, although it was self-evident. Where was the need to argue about it? Jamnalalji raised the question,
 
 because he has to find the money. But we must tell him that we do not expect wages. I do not know what Gandhism is. But I do not know the Gandhian teaching. Let us try to carry on our  work  without  money. Where there is non-violence, not even a cowrie is needed. Yes, I was telling you that we are arguing without a concrete resolution. Even this would be all right in a way. Everyone is engrossed in his own work. Where is the need for a resolution? Even so, some resolutions can be necessary. I cannot say what these resolutions  should be as I am not able to fully participate in the session. If you cannot think of any resolutions and if there are going to be just arguments, do stop the exercise at once. Or, let some definite programme be formulated. Let something or the other be achieved here. Put back the money that has been spent here. Observe Savli very closely. So many of us who are workers have gathered here and if we do nothing for Savli, it would be a very harsh comment on the session. Mahadev is much pained by this thought. The sad condition as in Savli is to be found everywhere—there is dirt, there is the problem of water, there are quarrels. Let us do our utmost to remedy these things. There was a suggestion that there should be an eight-hour spinning programme one day. But it was voted out. The pretext was the difficulty about obtaining so many charkhas. If so many charkhas were not available, we could have carried on with half the number?
 Some could have done carding, while others did the spinning. But leaving aside the charkhas, let us at least clean up the filth in the village. I am reminded of Balasore. The Sanitary Inspector of the town said that, if only he could have 50 men, the local tank could be cleaned. I appealed to the people and 50 men volunteered. Many such tasks are waiting to be done in Savli. You can take up some such work. You have spent Rs. 4,000 on the session. Do some work here worth Rs. 4,000. We have long passed the age of resolutions. So, what new outlook will you take back with you from this session?
 The most difficult question is the one of village industries. Then there is the question of health. Yes, let us not talk about the debts of the villagers. Let us not take up that burden. But let us at least improve their health. That, too, is the business of the Congress. But now it is getting late. So I leave this subject here, and come to the other questions.
 Q. How can lifelong interest in work be developed among the workers?
 A. The Gita has furnished the  answer:  through  constant practice.
 Q.	Can person who has taken the vow of non-possession become a trustee
 A    Yes, he can. There can be no objection to this on principle.  If I have given a different opinion in the case of Vinobaji, there must have been a personal reason.
 Q.	What is your view about the position Dr. Ambedkar has taken?
 A. Had I been in Dr. Ambedkr's place, I would have been as angry. In his position, may be, I would not have been a believer in non-violence. When overcome by anger, a person does  whatever comes to his mind. Whatever Dr. Ambedkar does, we must bear it in all humility. Not only that, it would be a service to Harijans. If he really hits us with shoes, we must bear even that. But we should not be afraid of him. There is no need to kiss Dr. Ambedkar's feet  to convince him. That would be a disservice. If he and the othr Harijans who have no faith in Hinduism embrace another religion, that too would make for our expiation. We deserve such treatment. Our task [now] is to wake up to the situation and purify ourselves. There is no need for flattery. That is why I expressed my sorrow at his announcement and suggested self-purification. I did nothing more.
 Q.	What are the points of similarity and difference between your point of view and socialism?
 A. There are quite a few similarities. I too desire that everything should be considered as belonging to God. I too believe that all wealth belongs to the people. But the difference lies in that the socialists advocate collective effort, whereas I believe that the beginning should be made at once in our individual conduct. If we have such faith, we should dedicate to society at least our own property. One cannot be a socialist so long as one retains even a cowrie for oneself. They want to achieve their aim through legislation. Legislation implies coercion. If they are not saying all these things now, it is because that is not within their power. They are virtuous because they are weak. Socialists, that is Communists, want to use force, but they are helpless. But we are believers in democracy.
 Q.	What is the difference between your views and those of Pt. Jawaharlalji?
 A. We have many differences, and they are well known too.  The position as revealed in our correspondence still remains. But in spite of our differences we respect each other and desire to work together as far as possible.
 Q.	What should be the limits of the worker's individual service?
 A.	A very fine criterion for this is to be found in the sloka which lays down that for the good of the family the individual may be sacrificed. An individual may be served only as far as it does not hamper service of the society. Suppose that my son is ill, my mother is ill, or my wife is ill, but I am expected to preside over a meeting at Lucknow. In such a situation, I would leave my son, mother and wife in charge of my brother, etc., and go.
 Q.	Can people who believe in non-violence take unfertilized eggs?
 A. It is a personal matter. Those who have no objection can take such eggs. The reason why we should take a neutral attitude on this point is that these days the Hindus' definition of non-violence is confined to the matter of food. I have regarded it as of secondary importance. If you say that we have to do it in order to live, well, strictly speaking, it would be an act of violence to eat even a single morsel. In such things we can have no rules which would be equally applicable to all. I have myself given cod liver oil to some boys in the Ashram. Doctors frequently prescribe alcohol and meat. They have even started prescribing glands. If anybody objects, the Doctors cite the authority of Manu and do not hesitate to tell a lie to save the life of a patient. Throughout the world only a section of Hindus has restrictions about non-vegetarian food on religious grounds.  And these are confined to some Vaishyas, Jains and a few Brahmins. Shall we then abandon the Muslims, Parsis, etc.? I have seen many non- vegetarians who believe in non-violence and many vegetarians who believe in violence. Some abstain from non-vegetarian food because
 
 they do not relish it; it is not in their upbringing. When I took meat out of a sense of duty, I had a bad time of it. Let not the vegetarians feel proud. Non-violence is a unique thing. It is a matter of feeling, not merely of external behaviour.
 Q.	What should be done to check the increase in births among poor women?
 A. Our duty is to explain to them the duty of self-control. Artificial measures would be as good as death. And I do not think the village women will take to these measures. Why, Premabehn herself is a maiden with a mind completely free from passion. On her own she is a votary of brahmacharya. She should work with this faith. Women like her will have quite an impact. We must try to get milk for the village children.
 Q. Women may be willing to exercise restraint to keep births in check. But what should be done if men use force?
 A. This is a question of a women's true dharma. Premabehn has grasped it fully. I am a worshipper of the satis. But I do not wish to push them down the well. Draupadi has shown what a woman's true dharma is. Even if the husband falls the wife must not. It is pure lechery to stand in the way of a woman when she desires to abstain. If he forces himself on her, it is her duty to make him desist even by slapping him. She should close her door to the lustful husband. She must refuse to be the wife of a sinful husband. We must inculcate such courage in women.
 Q.	What is the duty of the middle-class women in the matter of birth-control?
 A.  Whether it be the midle-class or the aristocracy, indulgence  is in our hands. But we cannot have control over the consequences. It is not for us to ask whether we shall be successful. Our task is only to teach them the dharma of truth. If the middle class women wish to adopt the latest birth-control measures, we must advise them against it. Self-control alone can be the remedy. Premabehn should place before them her own example.
 Q.	What should a wife do if the husband has syphilis?
 A. In such circumstances not even any birth-control measures can protect the wife. She must regard such a husband as impotent and remarry. But for this women should have sufficient education to be self-reliant.
 Q. Like the socialists you also believe that ‘all land belongs to the Lord’.  But today one man tills the soil and another exploits him. We want to resolve this conflict of interests with the help of non-violence. And one does have to resort to evil practices if one wants to earn wealth. Under the circumstances, is it not sinful to accept financial help from the rich?
 A. All that we can do is to try to undestand the principle as fully as possible. But God alone fully observes the [ideal] dharma. We are but imperfect and limited souls. Therefore I do not hesitate to receive money from the rich in spite of my belief that piling up wealth is the opposite of dharma. I do not consider it wrong to  accept  money in this way because I believe that thereby I only serve the rich and society in general. Up to this point I can also hold my own vis-a- vis the socialist. But I must counter his arguments only with silent service. Those who believe that it is wrong to collect money from the rich should act up to their belief. But for the Sangh it is dharma although it seems the opposite of it. I am crazy about body-labour. It includes everything. “What more need be said for the wise?”

336,"March 5, 1936","SPEECH AT GANDHI SEVA SANGH
MEETINGV","
  
 
 SAVLI,
 March 5, 1936
 For the past two days I have been trying to get acquainted with each one of you. But I have failed. I had a desire to meet every one of you and resolve your doubts. That would have satisfied you as well as me. I have grown rather fond of meeting people individually. But I found I should overcome this temptation if I wanted to work. You exercised restraint and thus put a check on this fondness. None of you sought to meet me and with great reluctance I gave up my desire.
 I had to restrain myself a great deal today. It pained me that I could not say anything at the wedding of Krishnadas.  I  did not address even a few words to the newly-married couple. Some day one will have to suffer even physical separation. Then why should we not prepare ourselves for it right from now on? The relationship between you and me should be so lasting that it would not be affected by physical separation.
 Let me now reply to Prabhudas Gandhi's questions. He  has  asked me how we can become one with the poor. This means that he has been trying, but has not succeeded so far. The conclusion to be drawn is that it is only with difficulty that such a state can be attained. We have lived on urban life, and we still have a lingering desire for that life. On the other hand, the desire to serve the villages is growing.
 I cannot prescribe any method for becoming one with the people. Nor do I have one. If Vinoba has suggested something, I am not aware of if. One cannot say to what extent oneness with the poor in a broad sense is possible. Some may be able to attain it in full, and some partially and some not at all throughout their life. But we must attain that oneness at any rate in our own hearts. Once the heart has begun to experience such oneness, the mind would automatically follow, and we would gradually progress in that direction. Whether or not we succeed is in the hands of God. What really matters is the effort.
 His second question is whether we should make it a rule that Rs. 4 out of Rs. 15 should be sent direct to some poor person every
 
 month. It is not up to me to make such a rule. Nor is it necessary. Even after giving away that amount it cannot be said oneness would have been established between us. An external act is no proof of the inner reality. If any such rule were to be enforced by the State, people
 would seek to evade it.
 Q. So long as we do not put an end to economic exploitation of our rural masses and bring them concrete financial gain, they will continue to be indifferent towards us. How can we help them?
A.	We face all these difficulties not because the village people
 do not understand us, but because we are not able to understand them. It is a pity. Even I have not been able to explain my ideas fully. Our work has just begun. It is not even a year since it started. We do not have enough experience to serve the people. I myself have not been able to settle down in a village so far. But I have done some research. In South Africa I lived in the midst of many villagers and I have experienced their difficulties. I also know from experience that we have not yet thought about the reasons why we have not been able to inspire confidence among the villagers. We must discover these reasons. We are working and spending money in the hope that the villagers will accept what we say. When we understand these people they, too, will cling to us. Till then, let us scavenge for them, distribute some medicines and teach them the laws of sanitation. Let us not go there as physicians. Let us be satisfied with giving the medicines which they accept. Let us not expect any further rewards. Let us not be worried whether or not we give financial help, whether or not they are indifferent. I have repeatedly told the village workers that they should not feel disappointed. Have they not turned themselves into sweepers? And a sweeper is satisfied even with the left-overs. Let us also go to them with such an attitude. If they abuse us, let us bear it in silence. If they beat us, let us bear that also. It is not that they are not coming forward because their economic conditions are not good. They would not come even if you offered them money. They would take the money and also expect us to do the scavenging for them. That is all. Let us work so that the sick are given medicines. Let the people defecate wherever they choose. Let us not even ask them to avoid a particular place or go elsewhere. But let us go on cleaning up without a word. That is non-violence. Protecting their health, showing them the way and going on cleaning up is the only path we have to follow.
 
 Some day they are bound to understand. If this does not work, then there is no such thing as non-violence.
 Q.	Is it or is it not necessary to do something more than this?
 A. We may if we can. But it is not necessary to connect the two. They are two independent services. Even if we cannot take up the service that would bring them economic benefits, let us at least take up the first one. And let us not worry if we can do nothing more.
 Q.  Can a village worker, with a view to making consumer articles available  to the villagers at low prices, run a shop and sell betel leaves, bidis, tobacco, fish, tea, etc.?
 A. We can resort to every means to put an extra pice into the villagers' pockets. But whether or not a village worker can open a shop depends on his own capacity and resourcefulness. I cannot lay down any hard and fast rule as to the articles a village worker may have in his shop. Let each worker fix a limit for himself in accordance with his own ability. He will have to compete with the village shopkeepers and also consider the habits of the villagers. If I go to the villages and find that the people cannot do without tobacco and bidis, I would sell these, too, even though I consider tobacco worse than alcohol. A habit that has been entrenched for thousands of years cannot go in a day. My work has not been directed towards making people give up smoking. Ideal is one thing, practice is another and what other people can do is yet another.
 Q.	Then would you sell liquor also?
 A. No. I would not sell liquor. I  would  not give  them something which they hate and which even the drink addicts consider evil. But if I went to England and found that I could not rid people of this habit, I would sell liquor. And if there are people who eat meat or fish and want them clean, I would supply these, too, with my own hands.
 Let my words not be taken literally and misinterpreted. I shall certainly try to make people give up things which are considered bad. But I would give them those things till I could persuade them to give them up and continue with my work. It is very difficult to run a shop. A resourceful man like Lakshmidas can do much. The path of village organization is arduous. There is no royal road. He who serves sincerely will find the right way.
 Q.	Should we not use bullock-carts instead of motor-lorries to transport the goods made or produced in the villages?
A.	This is a ticklish question. I have no answer to it which can
 touch your heart. I shall only say that I am helpless. Motor-vehicles are invading the villages day after day. The question involved is that of service of the cow. We must continue our efforts in good faith. Shall I lay down the principle? If we do not try to understand aright this question of service to the cow we might start eating beef. Even today if the doctor advises, people would not mind taking beef as medicine. You cannot carry on with buffalo's milk. I have seen beef being consumed in the name of medicine even in Vaishanva families. But let us remember that if the cow perishes, we shall perish, too. The motor-car has been invading the villages. If this goes on, India will become another South Africa. I do not favour small holdings. But at the same time I do not wish to see that any single individual should own twenty or twenty-five thousand acres of land. Today service to the cow is more expensive than a motor-vehicle. But this question is similar to the question of khadi. I have sold khadi cloth worth two annas a yard at 17 annas a yard. I am talking of an ideal. Our duty is to carry on work with faith in our heart.
 RAJENDRA PRASAD: But is it a proven fact that it is cheaper to use a motor-car?
 A. Absolutely not. The question of expensive or inexpensive is not correct. The law of demand and supply is not a human law, it is a devilish law.
 Q.  Would it be proper, in the light of your definition of swadeshi, to procure  for Bombay rice from Ahmedabad or wheat from Khandwa? Will it not be proper to fix   a ceiling on profit in respect of every commodity?
A.	Limits should be fixed both as to the quantum of profit and
 the distance. Let us not get all our rice from Bombay. Sitarama Sastri sends rice to Bombay. In fact, it should be [sold] in Guntur District. The proper thing would be to utilize rice where it is grown. My definition of swadeshi is old but it is valid. Only by following it can we evolve a new kind of economics. True economics must follow ethics. Even if we fail in this we shall have succeeded.
 Q.	The village workers employ middle-men instead of taking the help of the villagers. Is this proper?
A.	There should be direct dealings as far as possible.
 
 Q. Hand-pounded rice, hand-ground flour, oil, etc., can be made in cities also. Would you call them village industries?
A.	Today we seem to be going in the wrong direction in the
 name of dietary reform. There is not enough milk in the villages. So Dr. Tilak recommends that milk powder should be brought from Bombay. It is a terrible thing. We must never do it. We must stop the exploitation of villages by all possible means. We must persuade the villagers not to sell milk.

 SAVLI,
 March 6, 1936
 Q.  With regard to the policy adopted by the Sangh last year under your advice   on the question of the States, has not the time come, according to you, when the Sangh should concentrate more on the work in the States and make concerted efforts in the direction?
A.	I have forgotten what I had agreed to. But I am quite clear
 about my attitude on the subject. We should no doubt make concerted efforts in the matter. But how can I say what kind of effforts should be considered concerted? Trying to do well what can be done through the State should be considered concerted efforts.
 Q. Would you adopt the same policy of co-operation even in the States where Englishmen or their people have been appointed Prime Ministers, army commanders, police officials, etc., and where the administration is carried on in a large measure along British lines?
A.	There can be no change in our policy even if the entire staff
 of the States consists of Englishmen. I can well imagine the difficulties that would arise in such a situation. But there could be no solution to it. Even if all the officials were Englishmen the administration could still be carried on in the name of the State.
 Q. Is there now any change in your opinion that there should be no British interference in the affairs of the States? If not, why did you allow Shri Manibhai and Shri Jamnalalji to act as they did?
 A. Whatever Shri Jamnalalji and Shri Manilalji have done has been with my consent. But my policy in that matter is the same as it was. Through a policy I arrive at a principle; but I do not wish to restrict the field of its operation. Even in my dreams I do not wish for British interference. But those who wish for such interference under exceptional circumstances have fixed their own limits. Everyone has a right to fix his own lmit; and if somebody comes to consult me, I can even fix the limit for him keeping in mind the individual concerned. Someone asked me if, under the same circumstances, another person could do what Shri Jamnalalji was doing. I told him to come to me with Jamnalalji and then I would answer. Only when a person has full understanding of the situation, can he fix the limit after deciding the extent to which the principle can be applied in the given situation. His conduct cannot serve as an example to others. The qualification of the person also to be considered. I can say that in letting Jamnalalji or Manilalji go it was not my intention to seek interference. But even supposing that the principle was set aside, it should be attributed to my failing rather than made a precedent. He who is firm must adhere to the principle.
 Violent and non-violent activities are going on side by side. God is their witness. People see only the effects. We shall see the causes. The way I have been practising non-violence appears to be a novel thing. The Jains and the Buddhists also experimented in non-violence. But that non-violence has become restricted to  diet.  Political  and social activities also are inspired by both violent and non-violent forces. On the surface they do not appear to be different. But the difference lies in their motivation. There would be no trouble if we remember this point in everything we do. And there would be no difficulties.
  Can 	newspapers concerned only 	with the problems 	of the 	States be 	run in 	accordance with your policy? 
 A. I am afraid such newspapers are not run in accordance with my policy. But how can I convince those whose point of view is altogether different? In my view, there is no need to have different newspapers for the States. Our work will not be done through newspapers. My advice would be that we work in silence. Let us do whatever the officials of the States permit us to do. If we cannot work like this, let us withdraw. We will achieve in the States what we achieve in British India. It is like the rule of three. The States' people are slaves
 of slaves. Those who work according to my idea cannot be slaves. But those who follow the path of non-violence must proceed after great thought. Whatever we may be able to do there must be done in such a manner that no British interference would be possible at all. India will not attain swaraj through agitation carried on in the States. Maulana Abul Kalam Azad once said that the whole country was a gurudwara. That very moment it occurred to me that the whole country was a prison. And the States are doubly so. The facilities available in the States are those available in a jail.
 I wish to tell you a couple of things. I spoke without authority earlier, I shall speak without authority now also. I heard with a sense of pain that the committee for Gandhian thought which had been formed has ceased to exist. Since it had not come into existence as a result of any resolution of the Sangh but voluntarily, it was within its right to wind itself up. But I hear that the committee has broken up because I was not in favour of it. But I could have been consulted. I was just here. If anybody says that I desire this and I desire that, do not believe it. It is my misfortune that my words can be interpreted in two or more ways. I do try to speak and write a language from which only one meaning can be drawn. But language is an imperfect instrument. And then I am no master of language. Where shall I find the power to put down in writing all that is in my mind? My words affect different people in different ways. I did not mean to say that you should not propagate my ideas. I do not believe it is [your] duty to explain my views. But I do have the vanity to believe that my ideas are right. And because of this I am also keen on explaining them to my colleagues. I possess the faculty of speech also. And that necessarily results in some propaganda. I also wish that my ideas are propagated. But I had a feeling that you were being pretentious. I wanted to avoid it. It was not that I did not want the committee to be formed. The committee could have been formed, but it should have been as I wanted it to be. I am bound to express my views so long as I am alive. What then is the harm in forming such a committee? This committee can be instrumental in propagating my thoughts and my words. So I wish the committee is formed again and functions within its limits. Is it ever possible that any work with which Kakasaheb is associated would be considered worthless by me? I had no apprehension that the committee would do any wrong. But why
 
 
 should I not caution you? And even if one believes that I wanted to undo the work of the committee, why did other members join me in undoing the work and why did it become necessary for Kakasaheb to carry it all on his own?
 MAHADEV DESAI: Who gave you the information that the committee had broken up? It has only been adjourned. It can become active any time it is desired.
 A. I am making these observations from something that I have heard. It is a happy thing if it has not broken up. Kakasaheb gave me the assurance that he was to do the work all by himself. Now the committee should give him its co-operation.
 Another thing which I want to say relates to the functioning of the Sangh. When I said that every worker of the Sangh should work with the pickaxe during the day and at night there should  be discussion for some two or three hours, I did not mean that the Sangh should be wound up. You are so many and you are also efficient; I would, therefore, say nothing on such an occasion. I am old and close to death. My memory also has grown weak. Hence, I say whatever I can remember. What I said has been only to encourage you in your work, and your progress. So do not think I want to criticize, rather think that I want to explain something to you. Try to learn something new from it. The Sangh is proceeding on right lines today. I am not so completely deprived of my reasoning as to suggest its winding up at such a time.
 There is a new point, but I shall deal with it if there is any time left. I shall speak about the next session. Let the next session be held at a place which is not so far away from a railway station that one cannot reach there either on foot or by a bullock-cart. As for me it does not matter if the place is even fifty miles away. But then the condition should be that everyone should walk to the place. The luggage too should be taken in a bullock-cart, not a motor-car. If some handicapped persons like me do not come, let them stay away. But I shall definitely come. You may provide for me a bullock-cart or carry me on your shoulders. I shall not fight shy of either. We have to go and put that village into shape. Let us select areas where there is no doctor or engineer. If there is paucity of water, let us dig wells. If there are no cows there, let us get cows for them. I would even insist that we should drink only cow's milk. Let us not give up milk on any account. If I pour out my heart to you about goseva, I could make you cry and break down myself. My heart is so full of sorrow.
 I would insist that we should have only cows. How can we serve India if we cannot insist even on this much? When one calls me obstinate I feel that I have some kind of insistence. And all that I insist upon is that we should not take buffalo's milk but only cow's milk and should never give up milk. I shall be content even to die while  insisting on it. Let us find out a village where cow's milk will be available, where it would be possible to procure green vegetables, pure water, etc., and start our preparations right from now on. Let us not be worried if the place is far away. We shall serve the people living nearby and get new experiences every moment. I have placed before you what according to me is the most correct point of view. If the session is to be held, let us start the preparations right from today. Let us make a close study of the village. We have been passing through a long period of degradation. We have no strength to raise ourselves. All the work of the Congress is not being carried on according to my wishes. When I say this, I am not criticizing the Congress. But will they ever hold the Congress session in an obscure place?
 Even if we can get eleven months to make our preparations for the next session it would not be too long. The place should provide enough work for the workers. If there is dearth of cows we should bring some from the surrounding areas. We should look after these cows while we are there and if the people of the village are prepared to keep them we may leave these cows with them. Otherwise we should take them back.
 If we work in this manner we shall derive greater benefit than from a long speech. I am sayng all this from the point of view of the purest ideal. This is not a matter of money. It is a matter of intelligence. The session is to be held twelve months hence. I can invite you to Segaon. But I am not allowed to do so. Whoever desires to invite the session, must do so within a month. We ourselves must perform the functions of the doctor, engineer, mason, carpenter, etc. I cannot understand how you can put up with buffalo's milk. Arrangements should, therefore, be made for cow's milk and green vegetables.
 I wish to mention to you another subject. First I thought that Vinoba should discuss it. But since I have some time, I shall myself mention it. It is my nature to share a good thing with everyone. This thing arose many years back. Chhaganlal may be a witness to this. I was then in the midst of the Zulu War. Chhaganlal can tell you the
 
 year.
 
 
CHHAGANLAL GANDHI: 1906.
Yes, it was during that time and a great thing it was. Look, this is
  	how the Divine play goes on. I realized there that one who wishes to 	serve the world must practise brahmacharya.  A  married  	couple should also observe brahmacharya, by which I mean 	cessation of reproductive activity. I believe that those who 	procreate cannot be called brahmacharis. Hence I placed this 	ideal of brahmacharya before Chhaganlal and others. I was 	quite young then and a young person can do anything. If I ask all of 	you to practise brahmacharya, would that be practicable? It 	is only an ideal. So I myself preside over many marrriages. While 	laying down the ideal, I do see that people will indulge in 	pleasure. I was under the impression  that  brahmacharya and 	procreation were contradictory.  	But on Thursday Vinoba brought to me a problem. It was a quotation 	from the Shastras. I had not realized its significance earlier. It 	has filled my heart with a new light. I lost myself in pondering 	over it. I am still under its spell. The scriptural interpretation 	of brahmacharya is perfect. An avowed brahmachari is 	one who has practised it since birth, who has not lost semen even in 	a dream. But I did not know why a person who cohabits for the sake 	of procreation was considered a brahmachari. 	Yesterday this great truth flashed on my mind. The couple 	which, in a state of marriage, withdraw into privacy and cohabit for 	the purpose of procreation are brahmacharis in the right 	sense of the word. What we call marriage today is but its outward 	form. What we call pleasure is only dissipation. Although I 	maintained that the motive behind marriage was procreation, what I 	meant to convey was that neither party should dread having children 	or make efforts to avoid this natural consequence of the sex act in 	which both should be willing partners.  	I did not realize that it had a greater purpose. But this also was 	not the perfect marriage. The perfect marriage is founded on 	brahmacharya. When can a marriage be called perfect? In a 	perfect marriage a couple may have children when they are necessary 	and cohabit only when they need a child. That is to say, procreation 	ought to be looked upon as a duty and sexual union resorted to for 	that purpose only. Apart from this they should never engage in the 	sex act. Nor should they allow themselves privacy. If a man controls 	his semen, except on the occasion of such purposeful cohabitation, 	he is 
 as good as an avowed brahmachari. Just imagine, how many occasions for such cohabitation can there be in a lifetime? In the life of a healthy and virile man or woman, there may be only one such occasion. Why should such persons not be looked upon as avowed brahmacharis? This truth, of which I had only a glimpse earlier, is now as clear as daylight. Those who are married should think of it. I had mentioned this subject earlier also; but I had not so much faith then. I used to think that it was impracticable. Today I think it is practicable. It might be different in the animal world. But it must be a rule in the married life of man, that no couple should  procreate without the need for a child nor should they cohabit without the  object of procreation.

 Gandhi Seva Sanghke Dwitiya Adhiveshan (Savli) Ka Vivaran, pp. 78-82
 "
338,,A CONTRAST,"
  
 
 Savli is a little village in the District of Chanda, C.P. It has a large Harijan population, and Harijans are for the most part devoted to khadi production under the aegis of the Maharashtra Charkha Sangh. Member of the Gandhi Seva Sangh and some other workers met there between 29th February and 6th March. In the Hindi notices sent to the invitees, among the things they were to bring were lantern, writing material, postcards, envelopes, postage stamps and soap. The notices mentioned that it was difficult to procure any milk in Savli and cow's milk was practically unprocurable. Those who would take no ghee other than cow's ghee were advised to bring their own supply. On reaching Savli, it was further discovered that for the 300 men and women gathered there, milk had to be brought all the way from Chanda, a distance of 34 miles, and fresh vegetables from Nagpur, a distance of over 120 miles.
 Savli is a typical village. The difficulties mentioned above are to be met with in most of the villages of this land.
 India worships the cow, and cow's milk is unprocurable in the majority of our villages! She has a climate fit enough everywhere for vegetable growth, and fresh vegetables are not to be found in many of her villages! It is no wonder that writing material and stationery are scarce in the thousands of our impoverished villages. The villagers are
 mostly illiterate and those who can write have not money enough to invest in writing material or stamps. It is profitless to find out whether the villages of India were always what they are today. If they were never better it is a reflection upon the ancient culture in which we take so much pride. But if they were never better, how is it that they have survived centuries of decay which we see going round us and of which Savli is but a type?
 The task before every lover of the country is how to prevent this decay or, which is the same thing, how to reconstruct the villages of India so that it may be as easy for anyone to live in them as it is supposed to be in the cities. Indeed, it is the task before every patriot.  It may be that the villages are beyond redemption, that rural civilization has had its day and that the seven hundred thousand villages have to give place to seven hundred well-ordered cities supporting a population not of three hundred millions but thirty. If such is to be India’s fate, even that won't come in a day. It must take time to wipe out a large number of villages and  villagers  and transform the remainder into cities and citizens.
 However, those who believe in the possibility of village reconstruction have to follow out their programme logically and truthfully and not be satisfied with any make-believe. For them Savli is an eye-opener. Any village ought to be able easily to accommodate a party of 300 men and women with perfect comfort and give them fresh open air, fragrant grass and good rich milk from healthy cows and fresh vegetables and fruit in addition. Surely there is something radically wrong if many of these things have to be brought from cities.
 There is no trick of magic that can bring about this change overnight. But with patience and perseverance, the programme of reconstruction can be carried out without much difficulty. But nothing can be done if ardent workers do not settle down in villages with the fixed determination of reconstructing their villages in the right manner.

 [Before March 9, 1936]
 While giving his blessings to the outgoing graduates, Sardar Patel at first read out a message from Mahatma Gandhi sent to the outgoing graduates in which he had asked them to lead a life of truth, purity and service and to never forget that the institution to which they were bidding farewell was founded by the late Swami Shraddhanand who died while serving the nation to his last breath.
 The anniversary of the Gurukul concluded when a message from Mahatma Gandhi asking the public to give liberal donations to the Gurukul was read out by Sardar Patel. In that message, Mahatmaji had expected everybody present there to fill the coffers of the Gurukul which was run by contributions from the public.

   MY 	DEAR JAWAHARLAL,  March 	9, 1936 
  	So you return leaving Kamala for ever in Europe. And yet her spirit 	was never out of India and will always be your precious treasure as 	it will be of many of us. I shall never forget the final talk that 	wetted our four eyes.  	Heavy responsibility awaits you here. It is laid on you because you 	are well able to bear it. I dare not come to you, as I would have if 	my body had regained its original elasticity. There is nothing 	organically wrong with me. The body has even gained in weight. But 	it has lost the vitality it seemed to have only three months ago. 	Strange     
 to say, I never felt any illness. And yet the body had become weak and the instrument registered high blood-pressure. I have  to  be careful.
 I am in Delhi to rest for a few days. If your original plan had been carried out I would have remained in Wardha for our meeting. It would have been quieter there for you. But if it is the same thing to you, we may meet in Delhi where I should be till 23rd instant at least. But if you prefer Wardha I can return there earlier. If you come to Delhi, you could stay with me in the Harijan quarters newly built in Kingsway—quite a good place. You will tell me, when you can, the date of our meeting. Rajendra Babu and Jamnalalji are or will be with you. Vallabhbhai also would have been but we all thought it would be better if he stayed away. The other two have gone there not for political discussion but for condolence. The political discussion will take place when we have all met and when you have finished domestic work.
 I hope Indu bore well the grief of Kamala’s death and the almost immediate separation from you. What is her address?
 May everything be well with you. Love.

 Gangabehn has written to me about you. I think that Vaidya Jugatram's advice to you is right. For the present at any rate your diet should be milk and fruit. You may take glucose with it. At present it will be good not to take anythng made of when or other cereals. In place of milk, you may take churned curds, which will be easier to digest and will cause no gas. A healthy cow's milk if taken fresh soon after milking does not cause any gas; this may be taken in small quantities. Instead of taking milk and fruit together, you should take them at intervals separtely. For the present, take only juicy fruits, such as oranges, mosambis, grapes, pomegranate, pinapple and papaya. Take care that the curds are not sour. If Jugatram agrees, you would do well to take about ten bulbs of garlic. Recently I have heard much about the good that garlic does. It appears to help much in  the digestion of milk. Dr. Talvalkar's brother prepares an essence  of  garlic. In my recent illness, I could take twenty-five big bulbs of garlic a day. I do not take them now as there is no need to do so. One may add glucose to milk and to fruit juice. Do not take buffalo's milk. It is likely to prove heavy for you. If you find even cow's milk heavy, have a goat at your place and take its milk.

  	Ever since I left Ahmedabad I have been intending to write to you 	but could not, as it was left out or forgotten at the time of 	writing the few letters that I am permitted. Today, however, early 	in the morning I made a note of doing this. The reason for the 	letter is the pain caused to Bhai Mavalankar, who had put his entire 	trust in you and held you in great respect. Now, that confidence 	being no longer there, he writes to Sardar that you have yourself 	given him cause to 
 lose his faith in you, as you neither consulted him nor so much as informed him of your going to Bombay. He feels aggrieved in the matter, has even begun doubting the purity of your motives, and repents that he put so much trust in you. You should explain to me all that has happened, as Mavalankar writes that he helped you in the nick of time trustfully though several friends had warned him against you. You should remove the doubts in Mavalankar's mind and see that you do not lose such an open-hearted and disinterested friend as he. You should not lose the faith your creditors put in you. No matter if you have to turn a penniless beggar, you ought not to lose your credit for truthfulness. I shall be waiting for your reply by return of post. I hope Motibehn is doing well.

 I read your book carefully and liked it although the attack on me which it carries betrays considerable ignorance regarding me. That can be removed but I am enchanted with your study. after these preliminaries I may say that I find in it no remedy for our problem. Your solution does not suit the conditions in this country at least for the present. The goal you aim at is almost the same as that desired by me and many Congressmen. But our method of attaining it differs from yours. Your method in my opinion is not practicable in this country. I am not so attached to my own method that I cannot see the merits of anyone else's. But I am unable to appreciate your solution in spite of all sincere effort.
 Your speech at the Bengal session had been travelling with me and I read it only today. I like your resolution regarding the committee of experts. Have you anyone in mind who can do justice to the work? Have you taken any further step in this respect? Your book has given rise to many thought with more to come but I cannot write anything just now on that topic. Prabha writes that you are totally negligent of your health; this is not good.

Hingorani       	A co-worker who is a careful reader of my writings was disturbed to 	read that I was likely to approve of the 'safe period' method of 	birth-control. I endeavoured to make it clear to the friend that the 	safe period method did not repel me as did the use of contraceptives 	and that it was open largely only to married couples. But the 	discussion of the topic led us into much deeper waters than either 	of us had expected. The fact that my friend was repelled by the safe 	period method as much as by that of contraceptives showed to me that 	he believed in the possibility of ordinary persons practising the 	restraint imposed by the smritis, i.e., that the union 	between husband and wife was permitted only when the parties really 	desired to have children. Whilst I knew the rule I had never 	regarded it in the light that I began to do at the discussion. All 	these long years  I  had regarded it as a counsel of perfection not 	to be carried out literally and that so long as married couples 	carried on intercourse by mutual consent but without special regard 	to the desire for progeny, they were carrying out the purpose of 	marriage without breaking any positive injunction of the smriti. 	But the new light in which I viewed the smriti text was a 	revelation to me. I understood now as I never had done before the 	statement that married people, who strictly observed the    
 injunction of the smritis, were as much brahmacharis as those who were never married and lived chaste lives.
 The sole object of sexual intercourse according to the new light was the desire for progeny, never gratification of the sexual instinct. Simple gratification of the instinct would be counted according to this view of marriage as lust. This may appear to be a harsh expression to use for our enjoyment which has hitherto been regarded as innocent and legitimate. But I am not dealing with custom. I am dealing with the science of marriage as propounded by Hindu sages. Their presentation may be faulty, it may be altogether wrong. But for one like me who believes in several smriti texts as inspired and based on experience, there is no escape from a full acceptance  of  their meaning. I know no other way of finding the truth of things and testing certain old texts in accordance with their full meaning no matter how hard the test may appear and how harsh its deductions may sound.
 In the light of what I have said above, birth-controls by contraceptives and the like is a profound error. I write thus with a full sense of my responsibility. I have great regard for Mrs. Margaret Sanger and her followers. She impressed me much by her great zeal for her cause. I know that she has great sympathy for the women who suffer because they have to bear the burden of carrying and rearing unwanted children. I know also that this method of birth-control has the support of many Protestant divines, scientists, learned men and doctors, many of whom I have the hounour of knowing personally and for whom I entertain high regard. But I should be false to my God who is Truth and nothing but Truth, if I concealed my belief from the reader or these great advocates of the method. Indeed, if I hid my belief, I should never discover my error if my present belief is one. Moreover, its declaration is due to those many men and women who accept my guidance and advice in many moral problems including this one concerning birth-control.
 That birth requires to be regulated and controlled is common cause between the advocates of contraceptives and the like. The difficulty of control through self-restraint is not to be denied. Yet there is no other way of attaining the end, if mankind is to fulfil its destiny. It is my innermost conviction that if the method under discussion gains universal acceptance, mankind will suffer moral
 
 deterioration. This I say in spite of the evidence to the contrary that is often produced by the advocates of the method.
 I believe I have no superstition in me. Truth is not truth merely because it is ancient. Nor is it necessarily to be regarded  with  suspicion because it is ancient. There are some fundamentals of life which cay not be lightly given up because they are difficult of enforcement in one's life.
 Birth-control through self-control is no doubt difficult. But no one has yet been known seriously to dispute its efficacy and even superiority over the use of contraceptives.
 Then, I feel that full of acceptance of the implication of the injuction of the Shastras as to the strictly confined use of the sexual act makes the observance of self-control much easier than if one regards the act itself as a source of supreme enjoyment. The function of the organs of generation is merely to generate progeny obviously of the highest type possible for a married couple. This can and should only take place when both parties desire, not sexual union  but  progeny which is the result of such union. Desire for such union, therefore, without the desire for progeny, must be considered unlawful and should be restrained.
 The possibility of such control for the ordinary man will be examined in the next issue.

DEAR SATIS BABU,
 Profulla gave me a sorrowful account of you and Hemprabha . He says both of you are ailing and full of anxiety. I had a brief card from Hemprabha in reply to my inquiry.
 Do please give me a full account of your condition and doings. Both of you are devotees of Gita and Ramayana. Of anxiety therefore
 
 you should have none. From ailments we can hope to be free, if we would take reasonable care ourselves.
 Throughout my illness, I have never ceased to think of you. And how is the mad pujari of yours? How is Arun ? Where is he? What is he doing? What is Charu doing? What about the Harijan work?   I know nothing of your many activities.
 I am well and hope to be in Delhi till 23rd instant at least. Love.

  	After I had written the letters today, I remembered your inquiry 	regarding the diet for diabetes.

Salt may be added to the porridge. Or, one may grind the sifted 	wheat pieces into flour and make chapates out of it. One may take 	milk, curds, leafy vegetables, green peas, gourd, and sour fruits 	but no sweet fruits. The main food should be milk and vegetables, 	and this should restore one's health fully.

  	I read your letter to Mahadev. You sound as if your staying in 	Maganwadi was a punishment. If you have knowingly stayed there, you 	must consider it your duty to stay there like that.  One  who 	follows religion with proper understanding always finds great joy 	before which other pleasures are insignificant. Other pleasures 	cannot ever be called joys. This joy does not depend on anything 	external. Hence, outside worries cannot ever diminish that joy. You 	will have passed the test only when you derive such joy from your 	pursuit of duty.  	None of you is going to be inconvenienced if I can manage to go to 	Segaon. But, as you say, when that ‘if’ is removed, everything 	will fall in place. Hence, instead of thinking about the future 	steps let one step be enough for the present. Thus, you will find 	contentment. When one step is taken, the next step will be right 	before you, is there any doubt about it?  	I understand about the Kumarappa brothers. It is sufficient that you 	have done your duty.

 MURABBI BHAI,
 I had decided in the presence of Kashi to write to you regarding Chi. Krishnadas’s marriage. Yesterday I remembered the decision which I had forgotten because of my change of place. Such a marriage must be the consequence of the merits of the couple and their elders. The ceremony was performed by a true Brahmin, Ravishankar Maharaj, amidst the blessings  of numerous  loving friends. Instead of Krishnadas having to go to the place of the bride’s father, the latter came with his daughter to meet Krishnadas at his place of duty. The bride wore a white sari woven from yarn spun by Krishnadas himself. For other ornaments she had garlands of yarn spun by Kashi and me. Vinoba, Krishnadas’s guru, was of course present, and the very next day the couple joined the guru in doing their work of service. The bride did not have even a grain of gold as a wedding ring. The expense on the wedding is not likely to have been even so much as two rupees. I found the bride truly gentle. Never had  I witnessed such a wedding before. The other marriages I attended
 
 had been simple enough, but nowhere else did I find the holy atmosphere of this one. I take it that this information will give satisfaction to you both.

 MY DEAR SHUMMY,
 Amrit has given me your message and something more  her tears. She felt most miserable as she was labouring through the message.
 Amrit has told me so many things about your great love for her that I could and would not believe that a coolness had sprung up between you two and that too owing to my having entered Amrit’s life. She tells me that my way of looking at life had begun of affect hers as early as 1915. For me her affection and co-operation are a precious treasure. But I want neither at the cost of abiding  love between you two. You alone, I am aware, have [stood] by her through thick and through thin. My own connection with you all must, if anything, tighten that bond, never weaken it. So you will tell me what you will have me to do. This I can say that I shall never be guilty of weaning her from her present public activites. I would love to make them purer, i.e., I would have her to work in a much more detached manner than she has hitherto done. But in all my doings about Amrit, you shall be my guide. If ever I differ from you I shall tell you. But where the supreme good of Amrit is a common cause there can be no difference. She is too tender a flower to be allowed to wither.
 You must look after yourself and her village work. Love.

 It is no strain for me to write to you. Dr. Ansari has allowed considerable latitude, I assure you. I am going very slowly and very cheerfully. But no amount of care would keep this body intact when its time-limit is reached. We merely infer, and probably after the event, that it happened because of such and such circumstances. But our inference is based on probability. Hence I think we should not worry about our own likes, or those of dear ones.
 Mahadev has smelt in your letter a dislike for him. I have combated the view but I know you will tell me frankly whatever the matter is. Your letter does exclude him. Your conversation led me to think that you wanted me to be with you all alone. Gosibehn spoke to me differently. She gave me details about the place, too. I could understand your first proposal.

That would means saving the expenses    
 that we might then have to incur. Do think over this. Does Jawaharlal take interest in this? He might choose to come if it takes place towards the end of April. And what if we made him the President? He will of course have a pleasant time as an honoured guest. Let someone else be Chairman of the Reception Committee. What about Jajuji, if at all you consider the Reception Committee necessary? Or, why not you yourself?

 "
386,,BIRTH-CONTROLII,"
  
 There is nothing in our society today which would conduce to self-control. Our very upbringing is against it. The primary concern of parents is to marry their children anyhow so that they may breed like rabbits. If they are girls, they are married at as early an age as they conveniently can be, irrespective of their moral welfare. The marriage ceremony is one longdrawn-out agony of feasting and frivolity. The householder’s life is in keeping with the past life. It is a prolongation of self-indulgence. Holidays and social enjoyments are so arranged as to allow one the greatest latitude for sensuous living. The literature that is almost thrust on one generally panders to the animal passion. The most modern literatuee almost teaches that indulgence in it is a duty and total abstinence a sin.
 Is it any wonder if control of the sexual appetite has become difficult if not almost impossible? If then birth-control through self- restraint is the most desirable and sensible and totally  harmless  method, we must change the soical ideal and environment. The only way to bring about the desired end is for individuals who believe in the method of self-control to make the beginning themselves and with unqunenchable faith to affect their surroundings. For them the conception of marriage I discussed last week has, it seems to me, the greatest significance. A proper grasp of it means a complete mental revolution. It is not meant merely for a few select individuals. It is presented as the law of the human species. Its breach reduces the status of human beings and brings swift punishment in the shape of multiplicity of unwanted children, a train of ever-increasing diseases
 
 and disruption of man as a moral being responsbile to his Maker. Birth-control by contraceptives no doubt regulates to a certain extent the number of newcomers and enables persons of moderate means to keep the wolf from the door. But the moral harm it does to the individual and society is incalculable. For one thing, the outlook upon life for those who satisfy the sexual appetite for the sake of it is wholly changed. Marriage ceases to be a sacrament for them. It means a revaluation of the social ideals hitherto prized as a precious treasure. No doubt this argument will make little appeal to those who regard the old ideals about marriage as a superstition. My argument is only addressed to thsoe who regard marriage as a sacrament and woman not as an instrument of animal pleasure but as mother of man and trustee of the virtue of her progeny.
 My experience of self-control by fellow-workers and myself confirms me in the view presented here. It assumes overwhelming force from the discovery in a vivid light of the ancient conception of marriage. For me brahmacharya in married life now assumes its natural and inevitable position and becomes as simple as the fact of marriage itslef. Any other method of birth-control seems useless and unthinkable. Once the idea that the only and grand function of the sexual organ is generation possesses man and woman, union for any other purpose they will hold as criminal waste of the vital fluid and consequent excitement caused to man and woman as an equally criminal waste of precious energy. It is now easy to understand why the scientists of old have put such great value upon the vital fluid and why they have insisted upon it strong transmutation into the highest form of energy for the benefit of society. They boldly declare that one who has acquired a perfect control over his or her sexual energy strengthens the whole being, physical, mental and spiritual, and attains powers unattainable by any other means.
 Let not the reader be disturbed by the absence of many or even any living specimen of such giant brahmacharis . The brahmacharis we see about us today are very incomplete specimens. At best they are aspirants who have acquired control over their bodies but not their minds. They have not become proof against temptation. This is not because brahmacharya is so difficult of attainment. Social environ- ment is against them, and the majority of those who are making an honest effort unknowingly isolate the control of the animal passion from all other passions, whereas the effort to be successful  must include control over all the passions to which man is prey. Whilst
 brahmacharya is not impossible of attainment by the average man and woman. it must not be supposed that it requires less effort than that required by an average student who has set his heart upon becoming a master of any one of the sciences. Attainment of brahmacharya in the sense here meant means mastery of the Science of Life.

 "
387,,LIMITATION OF REFORMERS,"
  
 Ever since Dr. Ambedkar has thrown his bomb-shell in  the  midst of Hindu society in the shape of threatened conversion, frantic efforts have been made to wean him from the proposed step. Dr. Ambedkar’s threat has had its repercussions on Harijans, too, who are at all literate and are able to read newspapers. They have begun to approach Hindu institutions or reformers with a demand for posts, scholarships or the like, accompanying it with the statement that the writer might, in the event of refusal, be obliged to change to another faith, aid having been offered on behalf of the representatives of that faith.
 Without a doubt these threats are a portent and a matter of grave concern to those who care at all for the religion of their forefathers. But it will not be served by coming to terms with those who have lost faith in Hinduism or for that matter in any religion. Religion is not a matter of barter. It is a matter for every individual to decide for himself to which faith he will belong. It does not lend itself to purchase in any shape or form. Or if such an expression can be used in connection with things of the spirit, religion can only be purchased with one’s own blood. If therefore any Harijan wants to give up Hinduism, he should be entirely free to do so.
 There must be a searching of heart for the reformer. Has his practice or that of his neighbours caused the defection? If it has and if it is found to be improper, it must be changed.
 It is an admitted fact that the conduct of a vast number  of Hindus who call themselves sanatanists is such as to cause the greatest inconvenience and irritation to the Harijans all over India. The wonder is that many more Harijans than already have, have not left Hinduism. It speaks volumes for their loyalty or for the innate  virtue  of  Hinduism that millions of Harijans have clung to it in spite of the
 inhumanities to which in the name of that very faith they have been subjectd.
 This wonderful loyalty of Harijans and their unexampled patience render it imperative for every savarna Hindu to see that Harijans receive the same treatment that every other Hindu does. The course before savarnas is, therefore, on the one hand not to interfere with Harijans wishing to leave the Hindu fold by trying to keep them within it by the offer of bribes in the shape of finding employment or
 scholarships and, on the other hand, to insist on full justice being done to Harijans in every walk of life. Indeed reformers should anticipate the Harijans’requirements and not wait till they begin to complain. The Harijan Sevak Sangh is the biggest institution for the removal of untouchability. It has wisely adpoted a most liberal policy of giving scholarships to deserving students. It employs as many Harijans as possible. But it is in no sense a bureau for finding  jobs  for unemployed Harijans. Generally speaking, there, is no dearth of jobs for Harijans who are fit for the jobs for which they offer themselves. The greatest hardship felt by thousands of Harijans is want of pure water for drinking and domestic use, denial of access to public schools and other institutions, constant pinpricks in villages and, last but not least, denial of access to temples of worship. These disabilities are stern realities in the lives of the vast mass of Harijans. If they as a mass give up Hinduism, they will do so becasue of these common  disabilities which brand them as lepers of Hindu society. Hinduism is passing through a fiery ordeal. It will perish not through individual conversions, not even through mass conversions, but it will perish because of the sinful denial by the so-called savarna Hindus of elementary justice to Harijans. Every threat of conversion is, therefore, a warning to the savarnas that if they do not wake up in time, it may be too late !
 One word to the impatient and needy Harijans. They must not use threats when they approach Hindu institutions or indviduals for help. They should rely upon the strength of their case commanding a hearing. The majority of Harijans do not know what change  of religion can mean. They mutely suffer the continuing degradation to which savarnas in their selfishness have consigned them. They must be the primary care of Hindu reformers whether they complain or do not. Those who are enlightened enough to know and feel the degradation and know also what change of religion means, are either
 too good Hindus to desert their ancestral faith and deserve every help they need, or being indifferent as to religion may not claim help from savarna Hindus in exhange for their condescending to remain in the Hindu fold. I would, therefore, plead with enlightened Harijans for their own sakes not to seek material betterment under threat of conversion. And whilst reformers must on no account yield to threats, they must ceaselessly strive to secure justice for Harijans at the hands of savarna Hindus.

It is of course my own fault that I did not gather full 	infomation in advance. You may now do as you think fit. Indeed, I 	like Rajendra Babu's suggestion. He himself may even attend the 	function, and perhaps Jawaharlal too would. The latter may even 	agree to preside.

  	After all, you didn’t write to me. Anxiety or thinking about 	youcall it what you 	likepersists every day. I 	regard it as wrong that you should ignore your ailment.

It 	helps greatly in eliminating viruses in the bodyin 	relieving one of gas. This was the remedy prescribed by Dr. Ansari 	for Navin.

Rao 	Bahadur Rajah was much exercised over the irresponsible talk of mass 	conversions and wondered if intensive religious propaganda among 	Harijans could not be undertaken. He instanced      
 1
 the formation of bhajan parties to travel from cheri
 2
 to cheri singing bhajans and
  giving 	kathas , 	and wondered if the Sangh could not send some parties from the 	North. Gandhiji said:  	Whilst parties could be sent from the North, there is no need for 	the South to depend on the North. The South has its inexhaustible 	treasures of religious songs and it should be the easiest thing to 	organize bhajan parties from the province itself. I have 	heard soul- stirring bhajans of Thyagaraja, and Sjt. 	Rajagopalachari and  Dr.  Rajan would give you many a tip in this 	behalf. For Malabar you connot think of a better guide than the poet 	Vallathol Narayana Menon. I assure you there is a lot of musical 	talent even among Harijan boys of which we have not availed 	ourselves. During the Harijan tour in Bhavnagar I came across a 	Harijan boy who kept audiences spellbound by his simple songs. In 	her indigenous kindergarten school for Harijan children Anasuyabehn 	has an infant prodigy who wields his tabors as an expert and she has 	equally good songsters.  	Dr. Ambedkar has every reason to be bitter for he has had to suffer 	humiliations and insults which should make anyone of us bitter and 	resentful. If it is permitted to be bitter and to vent one’s 	wrath, there is no reason why he should not do so. What he fails in 	my opinion to realize is that it is not the fault fo Hinduism but of 	Hindus.  RAJAH: 	But has he to suffer those humiliations even now? Those must be a 	thing of the past.  GANDHIJI: 	Those particular humiliations are a thing of the past, but 	even now he would not be welcomed in an orthodox Brahmin‘s house.  R. 	But why should he want to enter an orthodox Brahmin‘s house?  G. It 	is not that he wants to enter it, but he resents the attitude. Even 	that refusal he would not resent if the rest of the savrnas were 	 on their best behaviour. Thus if an orthodox Hindu minister were to 	invite a number of Hindus, including Dr. Ambedkar, to dinner, and if 	he discriminated agianst the Doctor by asking him to sit apart, it 	is the duty of the rest of the Hindus to leave that house along with 	Dr.       
 Ambedkar. If we all did so Dr. Ambedkar would easily feel like one of us.
 
    it.  I see. But, Mahatmaji, we have made rapid strides and we shall see the end of    G. There is no doubt. The monster of untouchability has been 
  	laid low, only he is so huge that even whilst he is in his 	death-throes he  is capable of much mischief. But I cherish the 	dream when every one of the Harijans will be ransomed and brought up 	to the same levels as the tallest among the so-called high-class 	Hindus. Dr., Ambedkar once pointedly asked me if when untouchability 	was removed the highest status that persons like him aspired to 	would be that of a Shudra. I said to him that if he would be classed 	as a shudra evey other Hindu would also be so regarded. Varna today 	has become a means of arrogating to oneself a higher status. The 	real varna of my conception does not exist today. In the purest type 	of Hinduism a Brahmin, an ant, an elephant and a dog-eater 	(shvapaka) are of the same status. And because our philosophy 	is so high, and we have failed to live up to it, that very 	philosophy today stinks in our nostrils. Hinduism insists on the 	brotherhood not only of all mankind but of all that lives. It is a 	conception which makes one giddy, but we have to work up to it. The 	moment we have restored real living equality between man and man, we 	shall be able to establish equality between man and the whole 	creation. When that day comes we shall have peace on earth and 	goodwill to men.  Rao 	Bahadur Rajah wondered if under the new Constitution the Harijans 	might identify themselves with any of the Partiesthe 	Congress Party, the Justice Party and  so 	on. Gandhiji. . . said:  	You must not identify yourselves with any party.  My  views about 	the existing system of government have not changed, but with the 	peculiar disabilities that you have suffered for ages I would not 	expect you to identify yourselves even with the most forward party 	in India. You will accept whatever is given you by Government, but 	you will not sacrifice your self-respect. You will similarly endorse 	whatever is good in the Congress programme, e. g., prohibition, 	abolition of the salt tax, and say to the world that you would not 	allow the Harijans to be in any way isolated from the poor of India 	whose interests are identical with yours. Whilst you will join no 	party you will    
 under no circumstance whatsoever sell the country. If you can do this, Harijans will be the greatest factor in India. When these Harijans  awake, they will become an irremovable force.

399,"March 27, 1936",DISCUSSION WITH HARIJAN SEVAKS libtech_498_footnote,"
  
 [March 27, 1936]
 
 3
 HARIJAN SEVAKS : We received our inspiration from Swami Shraddhanandji.
 GANDHIJI: Not only you, but many of us received inspiration from the noble life of the late Swamiji. . . .
 Why don’t you take some steps to counteract the vicious propaganda of the
 4
 missionaries? Why not have Hindu missionaries for counter-propaganda?   Of  course,
 Mahatmaji, you are there enough to cover the whole field. But pracharaks are needed.
 Let me explain to you. The Sangh was not created for that purpose. Our object was to end the disabilities of Harijans and to put them on the same social level as the rest of the Hindus. As for propaganda that you have in mind, the best propaganda is that of personal example. Let every Harijan sevak lead a model life of purity and simplicity, clothe the Harijans with love and, I am quite sure, no counter-propaganda will be necessary.
 But there are places where the missionaries rush to the scene, do nothing but provide a few amenities like a water-pipe or a good road and make the recipients declare that they are Christians. The poor recipients often do so, but beyond the declaration they do nothing. They share in the life of their Harijan brethren, celebrate the same Hindu festivals, and remian Hindus in every respect, except perhaps for census purposes.
True. They will remain Harijans and even the missions will not
 set much store by them. Our duty is to work hard amongst  the orthodox Hindus and to get them to admit the Harijans in their fold as their kith and kin and to end the disabilities they suffer from.
 But how are we to persuade the orthodox? May we storm their fortresses? There are local board wells, for instance, which have been thrown open to the Harijans but the orthodox people will not allow them to use them. May we advise the Harijans to defy the opposition and challenge them to do their worst?
You might, where you are fearless and where you are sure that
 
 there will be no clash and that the Harijans will not be cowed down. But the opposition is melting away gradually everywhere and I trust no storming will be necessary.
 When untouchability is no more, Mahatmaji, what varna will you assign to
  us?   Who am I to assign a 	varna to you? But if I had the power, I 
  	should declare that we are Hindus, all of the same varna. As I have 	made it clear over and over again there is no real varna today. When 	we have come to our own, when we have cleansed ourselves, we may 	have the four varnas according to the way in which we can express 	the best in us. But varna then will invest no one with a superior 	status or right, it will invest one with higher responsibility and 	duties. Those who will impart knowledge in a spirit of service will 	be called Brahmins. They will assume no superior airs but will be 	true servents of society. When ineqaulity of status or rights is 	ended, every one of us will be equal. I do not know, however, when 	we sahll be able to revive true varnadharma. Its real revival would 	mean true democracy.  What 	we want today is not that the caste Hindus eat with us or have 	marital ties with us. We want rights of true citizenship, equal 	opportunities.  I 	want my son to have the liberty to be a vakil 	or a barrister or a 	doctor according to his own wish You 	know there is no legal bar against your son being anything  	he likes. There is custom, hard prejudice and blind superstition. 	That the Snagh is trying its best to fight. Dr. Ambedkar is a 	barrister and now a professor. But blind orthodoxy will not treat 	him as equal with the savarnas. You cannot force them by 	legal enactment. You can do it by education, by converting the 	orthodox. There was, for instance, a Harijan who used to sell bidis 	in Nasik. So long as no one knew that  he was a Harijan, he had 	very good custom. The moment they came to know that he was Harijan, 	they stopped pruchasing bidis at his shop, How are we to 	compel people to purchase bidis at his shop, otherwise than 	by showing them that it is inhuman and irreligious of them to 	boycott anybody by reason of his birth?  But 	why should we be called Harijans and not Hindus?  	I know that a small section of you resents the name. But you may 	know the genesis of the name. You used to be called ‘depressed 	classes’ or ‘asprishyas’ or ‘achhoots’ 	(untouchables). All these names the vast mass of you naturally 	resented. Some of you sent  their protests to me and asked me to 	find out a better name. In English I 
 had adopted a better word than ‘depressed’, viz., ‘suppressed’, but whilst I was casting about for a good Indian word a friend suggested the word ‘Harijan’ taken from the song of one of the best of our saints . It appealed to me because it best described your condition and still had no bad odour about it. It means a devotee of God, and as God is the help of the helpless, and as it is the helpless who naturally turn to God, I thought you deserved the name better than I for instance. For whilst I have to aspire to become a Harijan you are Harijans in the very nature of things. But you will say, ‘When your objective is to make Harijans Hindus why don’t you start by calling them Hindus straightaway?’ What am I to do so long as I have not succeeded in abolishing untouchability?
 But today, sir, it is an opprobrious term. There is a Brahmin who threatens to hammer us if we call him a Harijan.
 Then he is no Brahmin. You know the word ‘Harijan’ occurs in Tulsidas’s Ramayana? There Lakshmana describes to Parashurama the characteristic of a true Kshatriya. He says:
 (It is the trait of our clan never to use force towards a god, a Brahimin, a Harijan or a cow.) ‘Harijan’ there means a man of God, a devotee, no matter to what caste or varna he belongs. We all have to treasure the beautiful connotation of the word and try to be worthy of the name.
 One more question. You call your Sangh “Harijan Sevak Sangh.” You are unnecessarily exploiting our name. Fourteen annas in the rupee expended by the Harijan Sevak Sangh goes into the pockets of non-Harijans, 2 annas barely goes into the pockets of the poor Harijans.
Now, now, there you are betraying gross ignorance. I can prove
 to you the reverse of what you say. Have you got any proof in support of your statement? I make you a sporting offer. If you can prove what you say, you can come to Wardha, at the Sangh’s expense, with all the evidence in your possession, and if you succeed in convincing me I shall declare myself beaten and do proper penance. In case you fail, I will not ask you to pay back to me the train fare. But I will expect you to publicly apologize for bringing a baseless charge against the Sangh. The Sangh’s books are there open to inspection by anyone, and I tell you the books will convince you that
 
 the truth is the reverse of what you say.
 There is one thing certainly that you can prove. It is that there are a few sevaks who are paid even as much as a hundred rupees per month. But where that is the case, through such a sevak we distribute thousands to Harijans. Also he who is being paid a hundred rupees could easily earn in the market much more than what he receives. I am ready to confess, too, that, there are some who have to be paid as much as their market value but if no volunteer workers are available, or if you cannot get the services of the present staff on better terms, what can be done? I can, however, assure you that our administrative charges do not exceed 15 per cent, and the balance goes for the benefit of the Harijans.

400,,TEMPLE-ENTRY,"
  
 
 The reader will recall the important resolution on temple-entry passed recently by the Harijan Sevak Sangh. No one need run away with the idea that because not much is nowadays heard of the questions it has been forgotten or given up by the Sangh. Pandit Malaviyaji’s visit to Nasik and the vast audiences that gathered round him show that the people as a whole are not averse to the removal of untouchability, though it showed also that orthodoxy was not yet prepared to give up its untouchability. But it is not possible to await developments. The local Sanghs should make a sustained effort to have the existing temples thrown open and even to build new ones, not for Harijans only but for all. If they are situated in healthy localities and have a school, a meeting place and a dharmashala attached to them, they must prove useful and popular among all  classes  of Hindus. There may be public prayers held there every evening or at
 
 1
 Harijans who were present at the meeting repudiated the suggestion and
 admitted that the bulk of the funds went into Harijans’ pockets.
 2
 At the annual meeting held in Delhi from February 6 to 8. It read: “Since any further delay in securing temple-entry for Harijans will result in great harm to Hindu dharma, and since such temple-entry is part of the immediate justice to which the Harijans are entitled, the Central Board of the All-India Harijan Sevak Sangh resolves that effective steps be taken immediately for achieving temple-entry for Harijans and, with a view to achieving this purpose, the Executive Committee be asked to take necessary steps in consultation with Gandhiji”.
 stated periods and religious discourses may be occasionally arranged. If these temples are properly conducted, they would go a long way towards removing the prejudice against the opening of existing temples to Harijans. Care must be taken, where temples are opened to Harijans, that no discrimination is made against them. They must be opened on precisely the same terms as they are opened to the other Hindus.
 It is hardly necessary to state that in different localities different methods may be adopted for securing the desired end. Perfect non- violence must of course be maintained in all cases. An all-India simultaneous movement of the same type is not contemplated. It will vary in intensity and method according to the circumstances in each locality. Nowhere should temples be opened where there is an active minority opposed to the opening. Practical unanimity should be secured before any temple is opened. Thus what is required is sustained effort to convert local public opinion in favour of temple- entry.
 The position in the Hindu States is somewhat different. Where the Prince or his officials are favourably inclined, there should be no difficulty about opening them. The question has assumed a great importance in Travancore. In most other places Harijans are indiffernt about temple-entry. The position is otherwise in Travancore. The vast majority of Harijans of that State are far more advanced then in other places. They have many men belonging to the learned professions. Many have passed through colleges. They naturally chafe under any restriction of their liberty but most of all on the entry into temples. One hears that the large body of savarnas there are wholly in favour of the removal of the bar. Travancore has an enlightened Prince and an enlightened Maharani. Surely the opposition of a few orthodox persons, however influential they may be in their own spheres, cannot be allowed to prevent a much-needed reform which has become long overdue. But Harijan sevaks should by an accurate referendum or some such means show beyond all doubt that a great majority of savarna Hindus are decidedly in favour of the opening of Travancore temples to Harijans precisely on the same terms as themselves. The Maharaja may not march in advance of the public opinion of his State, but I can hardly imagine his flouting clearly expressed public opinion.

  "
401,,FOR THE YOUNG,"
  
 It is the fashion in some quarters nowadays for the young to discredit whatever may be said by old people. I am not prepared to say that there is absolutely no justification for this belief. But I warn the youth of the country against always discounting whatever old men or women may say for the mere fact that it is said by such persons. Even as wisdom often comes from the mouths of babes, so does it often come from the mouths of old people. The golden rule is to test everything in the light of reason and experience, no matter from whom it comes. I want to revert to the subject of birth-control by contraceptives. It is dinned into one’s ears that gratification of the sex urge is a solemn obigation like the obligation of discharging debts lawfully incurred, and that not to do so would involve the penalty of intellectual decay. This sex urge has been isolated from the desire for progeny, and it is said by the protagonists of the use of contraceptives that conception is an accident to be prevented except when the parties desire to have children. I venture to suggest that this is a most dangerous doctrine to preach anywhere; much more so in a country like India where the middle-class male population has  become imbecile through abuse of the creative function. If satisfaction of the sex urge is a duty, the unnatural vice of which I wrote some time ago and several other ways of gratification would be commendable. The reader should know that even persons of note have been known to approve of what is commonly know as sexual perversion. He may be shocked at the statement. But if it somehow or other gains the stamp of respectability, it will be the rage among boys and girls to satisfy their urge among members of their own sex. For me the use of contraceptives is not far removed from the means to which persons have hitherto resorted for the gratification of their sexual desire with results that very few know. I know what havoc secret vice has played among schoolboys and schoolgirls. The introuduction of contra- ceptives under the name of science and imprimatur of known leaders society has intensified the complication and made the  task  of reformers who work for purity of social life well-nigh impossible for the moment. I betray no confidence when I inform the reader that
 
 
 there are unmarried girls of impressionable age studying in schools and colleges who study birth-control literature and magazines with avidity and even possess contraceptives. It is impossible to confine their use to married women. Marriage loses its sanctity when its purpose and highest use is conceived to be the satisfaction of the animal passion without contemplating the natural result of such satisfaction.
 I have no doubt that those learned men and women who are carrying no propaganda with missionary zeal in favour of the use of contraceptives are doing irreparable harm to the youth of the country under the false belief that they will be saving thereby the poor women who may be obliged to bear children against their will. Those who need to limit their children will not be easily reached by them. Our poor women have not the knowledge or the training that the women of the West have. Surely the propaganda is not being carried on on behalf of the middle-class women, for they do not  need the knowledge, at any rate so much as the poor classes do.
 The greatest harm, however, done by that propaganda lies in its rejection of the old ideal and substitution in its place of one which, if carried out, must spell the moral and physical extinction of the race. The horror with which ancient literature has regarded the fruitless use of the vital fluid was not a superstition born of ignorance. What shall we say of a husbandmanwho will sow the finest seed in his possession on stony ground or of the owner of a field who will receive in his field rich with fine soil good seed under conditions that will make it impossible for it to grow? God has blessed man with seed that has the highest potency and woman with a field richer than the richest earth to be found anywhere on this globe. Surely it is criminal folly for man to allow his most precious possession to run to waste. He must guard it with a care greater than he will bestow upon the richest pearls in his possession. And so is a woman guilty of criminal folly who will receive the seed in her life-producing field with the deliberate  intention of letting it run to waste. Both he and she will be judged guilty of misuse of the telents given to them and they will be dispossessed of what they have been given. Sex urge is a fine and noble thing. There is nothing to be ashamed of in it. But it is meant only for the act of creation. Any other use of it is a sin against God and humanity. Contraceptives of a kind there were before and there will be hereafter, but the use of them was formerly regarded as sinful.  It was reserved for our generation to glorify vice by calling it virtue.
 The greatest disservice protagonists of contraceptives are rendering to the youth of India is to fill their minds with what appears to me to be wrong ideology. Let the young men and women of India who hold her destiny in their hands beware of this false god and guard the treasure with which God has blessed them and use it, if they wish, for the only purpose for which it is intended.

402,"March 28, 1936","SPEECH AT KHADI AND VILLAGE
	INDUSTRIES EXHIBITION, LUCKNOWlibtech_499_footnote","
  
 March 28, 1936
 I am glad and thankful to be able to come to Lucknow to open this khadi and other village industries exhibition. I may tell you that I was eager to be here at the opening. Though I know that Dr. Murarilal and Sjt. Shankerlal Banker have devoted themselves heart and soul to organizing it, at the back of it all was my conception. This exhibition, to my mind, brings out concretely for the first time the conception of a true rural exhibition I have nursed in my breast for several years. In 1921 when we met in Ahmedabad in the first year of  the  new  Congress Constitution, we took the first step towards rural-mindedness, and the exhibition organized under the auspices of the Congress held there was the beginning of the process which you find reaching its maturity today after 15 years. I have believed and repeated times without number that India is to be found not in its few cities but in its 7, 00, 000 villages. But we who have gathered here are not villagers. We are town-dwellers. We town-dwellers have believed that India is to be found in its towns and that the villages were created to minister to our needs. We have hardly ever paused to inquire of those poor folks get sufficient to eat and clothe themselves with and whether they have a roof to shelter themselves from sun and rain. Now I do not think any Congress worker has travelled through the length and breadth of India as much as I have done during the past twenty years. That in itself is hardly thing to be proud of. I, however, humbly claim, as a result of those peregrinations, to know the Indian villages more than any other Congress worker or leader. I have found that the town- dweller has generally exploited the villager, in fact he has lived on the poor villager’s substance. Many a British official has written about the
 
 
 conditions of the people of India. No one has, to my knowledge, said that the Indian villager has enough to keep body and soul together. On the contrary they have admitted that the bulk of the population live on the verge of starvation and ten per cent are semi-starved, and that millions have to rest content with a pinch of dirty salt and chillies and polished rice or parched grain. You may be sure that if any of us were to be asked to live on that diet, we should not expect of survive it longer than a month or should be afraid of losing our mental faculties. And yet our villagers go through that state from day to day. The Village Industries Association was formed last year in order to study the conditions in which they lived and the state of their handicrafts, and to revive such village arts and crafts as may  be revived. Simultaneously with the creation of the A.I.V.I. Association was passed a  resolutionlibtech_500_footnotelibtech_501_footnoteto the effect that future exhibitions should be organized by the Spinners’ and the Village Industries Associations. This exhibition I am about to declare open today is the first of that kind.
 As I have told you the whole conception here is mine, and yet I must confess that we are still far from bringing out that conception fully. It is an evidence of the organizers’ wonderful industry, and yet it is not perfect of its kind. It was not humanly possible to achieve it during the time at their disposal. It is no easy job to bring village artisans form their villages. You will find here villagers from South India who perhaps don’t know where they have come to. It is the purpose of this Exhibition to show that even this starving India of the villages is capable of producing things which we town-dwellers may use both to the villagers’ and our advantage.
 This exhibition is not a spectacular show like its predecessors. Those earlier ones were bound to be big shows. They were designed for a different purpose. Congress expenses were generally found out of the takings of the exhibition. The whole outlook was changed last year. We decided not to have things of spectacular interest, but we decided to give the spectators a glimpse of the Indian villager and his craft. This therefore is a vast educative effort. Not that we will have no takings this time. Only they will depened on those Congressmen who are intent on freedom and will win it by rehabilitating the village. If they will establish a living bond between towns and villages, they will
 
 flock to the exhibition and will make a point of studying the various demonstrations in the exhibition.
 This cannot be done by one visit only. You should visit it daily and carefully study every section. If you will do this, you will marvel at the energy and industry expended in organizing it. You will be deeply interested in it if you approach it in a spirit of service. You will find here craftsmen and craftswomen for Kashmir and South India, form Sind and Assam, and learn how they earn their scanty living. You will find that it is within your power to add a little to their income and to enable them to have square meal, if only you will make up your minds to pay for their wares enough to ensure them a living wage.
 You will not expect me to describe all or even one of the numerous sections of the exhibition. It is impossible for me to do so. Let me tell you that you will have an inkling of the inside even from where you are sitting. For in fornt of you are no triumphal arches but there are simply but exquisitely decorated walls done by Sjt. Nandlal Bose, the eminent artist from Santiniketan, and his co-workers who have tried to represent all the villagers’ crafts in simple artistic  symbols. And when you go inside the art gallery on which Babu Nandlal Bose has lavished his labours for weeks, you will feel, as I did, like spending there hours together. But even the other sections will attract you. You may not find in the exhibition anything to amuse you like music or cinema shows but I assure you you will find much to learn.
 In conclusion, I want you all to be voluntary advertising agents of the exhibition so that numbers may be attracted to see it. The exhibition has not been organized for the villagers, it is organized for the city-dweller to enable him to see how the villager lives and what he is capable of. The Reception Committee has spent something like Rs. 35, 000 in order to bring this exhibition into being. The lest that you must do is to enable them to meet the expenses. This you can do if you become their enthusiastic advertising agents. Commission I can promise none, though I dare say you will get it for work dutifully done when you appear before the Great White Throne. I may tell you that I am staying here for some days and expect to visit the exhibition as often as I can. I shall therefore know how you have discharged your trust.
 It is our intention to throw the exhibition open to the people from villages if the expenses are covered.
 You will find in the exhibition many a drawback, but you and I are to blame for them, not the villagers. Let me tell you, however, that the organizers have attempted the stupendous task of achieving in a few weeks the work which should take many months to be properly done. You will therefore bear with us and forgive the shortcomings you will no doubt see.

 The cardinal fact that I see missed in the interview is that it has not been taken into consideration that man is above all an artist and a creator. He is not satisfied with bare necessity, but must have beauty, colour and charm as well .
 . . . He has made every necessity into an art and has spent tons of blood on them. His creative instinct impels him to add to his difficulties and problems and solve them over again. He cannot be ‘simple’ as Rousseau, Ruskin, Tolstoy, Thoreau, and Gandhiji would like him to be. War he must have as its necessary corollary which also he has transformed into a great art.
 To appeal to him [to copy] the example of nature would be in vain, for it is totally incompatible with his very being. ‘Nature’ cannot be his teacher . . .
 . “From an artistic standpoint,” says Nietzsche the iconoclast, ‘nature is no model. It exaggerates, distorts and leaves gaps. Nature is the accident. To study ‘from nature’ seems to me bad sign; thus lying in the dust before trivial facts is unworthy of a thorough artist”. . . To end sexual life when the need of propagation is no longer there, or to enjoin sex-communion expressly with the desire of begetting offspring, is too calculating. too natural, too ‘matter- of-fact’ . . . .
 . . . I do not mean to underrate the value of the discipline of self-control or what is technically knows as brahmacharya. I would always admire it as the
 
 art of the control of the sex instinct carried to perfection. But just as the perfection of other arts does not interfere with the science of life, with the whole life (in the Nietzschean sense of the term), with the proper scheme of all the values of life, so also I will not allow the value of the  ideal  of brahmacharya dominate other values, far less use is as an instrument of  solving problems, such as over-population. I believe it was with an eye to
 such a scheme of values that the scriptures	said,
  or, there is brahmacharya where sexual union occurs only at night (i.e., as opposed to abnormal cohabitation during the day time). Here normal sex-life itself is sopken of as brahmacharya, the rigid conception of which began after we had already topsyturvied the proper scheme of all values of life.
 I gladly publish this letter as I should any such letter that is not full of declamation, abuse or insinuations. The reader should have both the sides of the question to enable him to come a decision. I am myself eager to know why a thing which is claimed to be scientific and beneficial and which has many distinguished supporters repels me notwithstanding my effort to see the bright side of it.
 Thus it is not proved to my satisfaction that sexual union in marriage is in itself good and beneficial to the unionists. To the contrary effect I can bear ample testimony from my own experience and that of many friends. I am not aware of any of us having derived any benefit, mental, spiritual or physical. Momentary excitement and satisfaction there certainly was. But it was invariably followed by exhaustion. And the desire for union returned immediately the effect of exhaustion had worn out. Although I have always been a conscientious worker, I can clearly recall the fact that this indulgence interfered with my work. It was the consciousness of this limitation that put me on the track of self-restraint and I have no manner of doubt that the self-restraint is responsible for the comparative freedom form illnesses that I have enjoyed for long periods and for my output of energy and work both physical and mental which eye-witnesses have described as phenomenal.
 I fear that the correspondent has misapplied his reading. Man is undoubtedly an artist and creator. Undoubtedly he must have beauty and therefore colour. His artistic and creative nature at its best taught him to see art in self-restraint and ugliness in uncreative union. His instinct for the artistic taught him to discriminate and to know that any
 conglomeration of colours was no mark of beauty, nor every sense enjoyment good in itself. His eye for art taught man  to  seek enjoyment in usefulness. Thus he learnt at an early stage if his evolution that he was to eat for its own sake as some of us still do, but he should eat to enable him to live. At a later stage he learnt further that there was neither beauty nor joy in living for its own sake but that he must live to serve his fellow-creatures and through them his Maker. Similarly, when he pondered over the phenomenon of the pleasurableness of sexual union, he discovered that like every other organ of sense, this one of generation had its use and abuse. And he saw that its true function, its right use, was to restrict it to generation. Any other use, he saw, was ugly and he saw further that it was fraught with very serious consequences as well to the individual as to the race. It is hardly necessary for me to prolong the argument.
 The correspondent says well than man makes art out of his necessities. Necessity is not only the mother of invention, it is the mother also of art. We should therefore beware of that art which has not necessity as its basis.
 Nor may we dignify every want by the name of necessity. Man’s estate is one of probation. During that period he is played upon by evil forces as well as good. He is every prey to temptations. He has to prove his manliness by resisting and fighting temptations. He is no warrior who fights outside foes of his imagination and is powerless to lift his little finger against the innumerable foes within, or, what is worse, mistakes them for friends. “War he must have”. But the correspondent is wrong when he says that “as its necessary corollary he has transformed it into a great art”. He has hardly yet learnt the art of war. He has mistaken false war for true even as our forefathers under a mistaken view of sacrifice instead of sacrificing their base passions sacrificed innocent non-human fellow-creatures as many even do at the present day. We have yet to learn the art of true war. Surely there is neither beauty nor art in what is going on today on the Abyssinian frontier. The correspondent has chosen unhappy (for him) names for his illustrations. Rousseau, Ruskin, Thoreau and Tolstoy were firstclass artists of their time. They will live even after many of us are dead, cremated and forgotten.
 The correspondent seems to have misapplied the word ‘nature’. When an appeal to man is made to copy or study nature, he is not invited to follow what the reptiles do or even what the King of the
 forest does. He has to study man’s nature at its best, i.e., I presume his regenerate nature, whatever it may be. Perhaps it requires considerable effort to know what regenerate nature is. It is dangerous nowadays to refer to old teachers. I suggest to the correspondent that it is unnecessary to bring in Neitzsche or even Prashnopanishad. The question for me is past the stage of quotations. What has cold reason to say on the point under discussion? Is it or is it not correct to say that the only right use of the generative organ is to confine it solely to generation and that any other use is its abuse? If it is, no difficulty in achieving the right use and avoiding the wrong should baffle the scientific seeker.

418,,HINDI PRACHAR APPEAL,"
  
 
 The following appeallibtech_518_footnotehas been issued by Sheth Jamnalal Bajaj and others:
 The Dakshin Bharat Hindi Prachar Sabha is the body at present engaged in carrying out Mahatma Gandhi’s work of propagating Hindi in South India, inaugurated by him eighteen years ago at the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan held at Prayag in 1918. Since its inception the Sabha has succeeded in laying the work of Hindi prachar in South India on a firm and sure basis. For the last five or six years it has been functioning in a self-sufficient manner. It is at present operating through its 450 centres in four different provinces with different languages in South India. Besides, the teaching of Hindi is being pushed forth through the various arts schools and colleges through the efforts of the Sabha. The total number of students receiving instruction in Hindi in South India through the agency of the Sabha today stands over 40,000.
 It is now proposed to erect a bhavan for the Sabha to house its various departments. The Madras Corporation has donated three acres and a half of land for the purpose. . . . The scheme would cost one lakh rupees and when completed will include, besides residential quarters for the workers, a college with hostel accommodation for at least 50 for training workers for Hindi prachar work, an arts school where Hindi will be compulsory and a prayer hall and a gymnasium for the use of students and workers of the Sabha and the neighbouring public. . . .
 
 All remittances should be sent to the Treasurer, Dakshin Bharat Hindi Prachar Sabha, 107, Armenian Street or to Indo-Commercial Bank, Madras.
 I heartily endorse the appeal and hope that it will receive adequate response.

 April 5, 1936
 
 Mahatma Gandhi read out a letter from Mr. Narmada Prashad, Secretary of the Sammelan, regretting his absence due to illness and announcing a donation of Rs.
 500. Mahatma Gandhi, speaking [in Hindi], said that these announcementslibtech_523_footnotehad made up for the debt the building had incurred but the building was still incomplete. It was sad to reflect that whereas Mr. Tandonlibtech_524_footnotehad appealed for four lakhs the response had been so small in a matter which concerned what India had declared was its national language. The country was undoubtedly starving. Of course physically crores of people did not even have one meal a day and poverty and hunger in India were worse than in any [other] country in the world. But he used the expression ‘starving’ in a different sense. Even lakhs of donations could not breathe soul into the language. This work could be accomplished if someone was born whose heart overflowed, as Tagore’s had overflowed in Bengal and made Bangalee a living language.  The language never died. Tulsidas and Surdas did not write for the sake of the Hindi language. Their hearts and thoughts flowed out and humanity was benefited. Such a person must be born and create the necessary activity to make the language of 23
 
 crores of people again live.
 The efforts of one or two persons cannot accomplish this work; it can succeed only with the efforts of all the Hindi-speaking peoplelibtech_525_footnotelibtech_526_footnote.

Amounts received by me through the Trust were, 	upon recommendation of Mr. Doull if I remember aright, backed by 	other trustees, sent back for Sorabji’s use as a loan, his policy 	being accepted as received security. The premium for the policy has 	not been paid and probably it has lapsed. I gave this loan with the 	greatest reluctance. But I felt that I could do so. For in those 	circumstances had Parsi Rustomji been alive he would have liked me 	to help Sorabji. Of course no part of the loan has been returned. I 	had years ago small payment for giving prizes to children. That sum 	still is held and prizes are still being distributed annually. 	Beyond that there is nothing to report as there is no money in my 	hands on behalf of the two Trusts.

429,,DANGER FROM WITHIN,"
  
 
 No movement or organization having vitality dies from external attack. It dies of internal decay. This is true at any rate of great all- India organizations like the A.I.S.A. and A.I.V.I.A. or the Harijan Sevak Sangh. I omit mention of others which are no less for all India than these three. I single out the first two for they seek to represent and promote the immediate welfare of the millions of villagers who do not earn enough to keep body and soul together because they have to live in enforced idleness for at least four months in the year for want of work. And I refer to the third because it seeks to represent the despised millions of society. The three causes are thus worthy. They should, therefore, not only be able to survive all external attack but even to thrive on it.
 It is clear that they cannot flourish on mere pecuniary support. They will always need it, but it must come as a direct fruit of honest work. Therefore, what is necessary is character above suspicion, ceaseless effort accompanied by ever-increasing knowledge of the technique of the work and a life of rigorous simplicity. Workers without character, living far above the ordinary life of villagers, and devoid of the knowledge required of them for their work, can produce no impression on the villagers whether Harijan or other.
 As I write these lines instances of those workers who for want of character or simple living damaged the cause and themselves recur to my mind. Happily instances of positive misconduct are rare. But the greatest hindrance to the progress of the work lies in the inability of workers of quality of support themselves on the village scale. If every one of such workers puts on his work a price which village service cannot sustain, ultimately these organizations must be wound up. For the existence of payments on the city scale except in rare and temporary cases would imply that the gulf between cities and villages is unbridgeable. The village movement is as much an education of the city people as of the villagers. Workers drawn from cities have to develop village mentality and learn the art of living after the manner of villagers. This does not mean that they have to starve like the villagers. But it does mean that there must be a radical change in the old style of life. While the standard of living in the villages must be raised, the city standard has to undergo considerable revision, without the worker being required in any way to adopt a mode of life that would impair his health.

430,,UNCERTIFIED KHADI,"
  
 
 The Secretary of the Tamil Nad Branch of the A.I.S.A. writes to Shri Shankerlal Banker:libtech_537_footnote
 The old khadi merchants of Tirupur have started an association for certifying their khadi products.
 Their object is to sell their existing stocks at enhanced rates and allow liberal commission to retail merchants throughout the province and to continue khadi production at old system and pay low wages. Many an old spinner, who is either unable to purchase cotton from us or improve the quality of yarn, may continue to spin for these merchants. We are, however, making arrangements to counteract these merchants’ efforts by vigorous propaganda among the villagers by pamphlets, private talks and lectures about the object and work of our Association and that of these merchants. Our workers go from house to house and teach the spinners how to hank and improve the quality of yarn.
 These merchants still continue to use our name for deceiving the public. Their sign boards, letter-heads, bills, invoices, labels on clothes are all printed as certified by the A.I.S.A. I sent them letters the other day asking them to strike out our name at once. One merchant has replied as follows:
 ‘I am surprised to read your letter dated 2-3-’36. You say that if I do not strike off the words “Certified by A.I.S.A.” within a week you are going to take legal action. The All-India Spinners’ Association is not a registered body. . . .’ Neither you nor anybody else has the right to object or protest.     ’
 I have written to the Press. I am making arrangements to stock A. I. S. A.-certified khadi at every Congress sabha.       Already two committees, the
 Mylapore Congress Committee and the Vedaranyam Town Congress Committee, have taken sales certificates. I hope before long other committees will apply for certificates and arrange to stock and sell khadi. . . .
 I request that you will kindly explain the situation to Mahatmaji and request him to issue an appeal in the Press asking people who cannot spin for themselves to purchase only A. I, S. A.-certified khadi and also to sound a note of warning to the merchants of Tirupur.
 It is certainly wrong of the erstwhile certified-khadi merchants to continue their trade in uncertified khadi after refusing to conform to the new rules about khadi and thus making themselves unfit for
 
 certificates. Their conduct is unpatriotic and unhuman. They ought not to exploit the poor spinners and to a much lesser degree the credulous buyers. I would urge them to conform to the new rules and take out certificates, or if they are not satisfied with the new scale, to take to some other business. It ill becomes them to retort that the
 A.I.S.A. is not a registered body and that therefore they can do what they like. I suggest to the objectors that their defiance of a body which they have hitherto obeyed is a breach of the moral and social code.
 But whilst I hope that my appeal to the sellers of uncertified khadi will bear fruit, I would like the Secretary of the Tamil Nad Branch to acquaint the spinners of the new rules and persuade them not to spin for lower wages. The most effective remedy lies in the hands of the spinners.
 Of course I heartily endorse the Secretary’s appeal to Congress Committees and other lovers of the poor villagers to take out certificates for the sale of khadi and thus render concrete sevice to the toiling spinners. Their active co-operation will largely check the sale of uncertified khadi.

	INDUSTRIES EXHIBITION-II","
  
 LUCKNOW,
 April 12, 1936
 [Gandhiji] appealed to them to go and visit the Exhibition, once, twice, three times, even four times, with their eyes and ears open, and if possible with the eyes and ears of their souls open. They would then see miracles in the Exhibition.
When I toldlibtech_539_footnotelibtech_540_footnoteyou the other day that the Exhibition was not a
 cinema show, I meant  more  than  I  said.libtech_541_footnoteIf  you  move  about  this Exhibition with my eyes and ears, you will spontaneously exclaim, ‘Hurrah! what a splendid exhibition!’
 There may be many young men here who shout ‘hurrah’ on witnessing the dance and gesticulations of a woman. But God has given us eyes not to see and appreciate the dance of a woman, but to recognize the mother in her. The ‘hurrah’ that will spontaneously come to your lips on witnessing the Exhibition with my eyes and ears will be clean and not filthy. We go into raptures no hearing the name of Khuda or Rama in a durgah, mosque or a temple. You can look upon this Exhibition as an equally sacred place. You will not find here anything to captivate you in a sensual way. You have to see it with my eyes. It does not mean you should see it with the eyes of a mahatma. I am only a villager, a simple man. Therefore you have to look at this village industries exhibition with the eyes of a simple villager.
 Anyone who pays a rupee, the charge for seeing the Exhibition four times, can learn four lessons in the bargain. I am sure you have heard about spectacles made of pebble. Now, here you can actually witness them being made. Where else would you go to learn this craft? But then this is a rather difficult job. They also make paper here. You will be amazed at the progress made by the paper industry. Even a lad of ten can make paper if he wants to. If you closely study here the process of paper-making you will be able to pursue the craft in your home. Here you will come across a novelty at every step and stop to marvel at it.
 
 When you go to a cinema show you meet with things there to captivate in a sensual way your eyes and ears. I may tell you that we have tried to boycott from this Exhibition everything that had no educative value. We have tried to make the Exhibition a sacred and holy place, a feast for your eyes and ears, a spiritual feast capable of purifying the senses. I shall tell you why. Do you know Orissa and its skeletons? Well, form that hungerstricken, impoverished land of skeletons have come men who have wrought miracles in bone and horn and silver. Go and see these things not only ready-made but in the making, and see how the soul of man even in an impoverished body can breathe life into lifeless horns and metal. A poor potter has also worked miracles out of clay.libtech_542_footnote
 I have bought from the stall a nice little ink-pot to hold my ink.  I thought its price would be six or seven annas, but I was surprised to learn that it was just one pice. Well, when you look at it you will no doubt wonder if it had not come from Germany or Japan. But the article is village-made. If this is not a wonder, what is?libtech_543_footnote
 Things which I thought would be worth several annas are worth only a copper or a couple of coppers and yet they are delicate little pieces of art. A dear sister purchased the other day a little ‘Krishna’ in ivory. She was not given to worshipping Lord Krishna, but she now tells that she has begun to worship the exquisite little form.
 The Exhibition is thus not a spectacular show, but a kind of fairyland. But our tastes have been so  debased  that  miracles happening before our very eyes appear like so much dust or clay and trifles coming from abroad become exquisite pieces of art; water from a spring in far off Europe with the witchery of an unintelligible name becomes invested with miraculous quality, while the water of the holy Ganges which is said to be a purifier and a natural disinfectant seems to be no better than water from a dirty pool.
 You can, of course, see that craftsmen from distant Travancore, Kashmir and Cuttack have congregated here. These poor people have come here to earn a few coins by exhibiting their crafts. Therefore those people on whom God has bestowed money ought to purchase here something or other. Things are not overpriced here. It is another matter if you yourself pay a fabulous price for a piece which pleases you. The price you pay here will not go to fill the pockets of any rich
 
 commission-agent. It will directly reach the purse of the poor villager to whom all of us are indebted. We are all living at the cost of the villagers. The city-dwellers are exploiting the villagers, and they must repay the debt, at least partially. A link has been built to bridge the yawning gulf between the cities and the villages; we have only to cross this bridge. Patronizing village industries will constitute the crossing of the bridge. This is not a metter of charity; I have placed a purely commercial proposition before you. Those who buy things here  should also return with ‘hurrah’ on their lips; and the craftsmen from Kashmir, Travancore, Cuttack, etc., should also return to their homes saying, “Hurrah, how well the people in Lucknow appreciated our handiwork.’ If you engrave my words on your hearts, I shall also feel that I have been duly paid for my lecture.libtech_544_footnote
 If a vision of the kind I have described to you fails to stir your hearts and urge you to make some little sacrifice for the illfed and the underfed, God help you. Iqbal whose poem “Hindostan  hamara”libtech_545_footnotestill stirs our hearts with emotion must have had some such vision before his mind’s eye when he described India with her eternal sentry the Himalayas, and Ganges the eternal witness of the numerous stages through which our civilization has passed. We attend flag-hoisting ceremonies and are proud of our National Flag. Let me tell you that our pride has no meaning if you do not like things made in India and hanker after foreign ones. It is idle for those whose heart is not stirred at the light of things made by our poor craftsmen and craftswomen and to make a little sacrifice for them to talk of independence for India.

        DEAR 	FRIEND,      [Before April 13, 1936]libtech_547_footnote 
  	Your letter. Wisdom suggests ad experience testifies that one should 	never grieve over the past, however sinful or awful it might have 	been. The past is worth remembering only in order to profit by       
 it, to strengthen the good we might have done and to prevent, with all our might, a repetition of the bad. I hold that determination never to repeat a sin is the best form of repentance. The only remedy I can suggest is to rely upon Ramanama with an undying faith. It will surely give you mental relief and ultimately root out all the evil that may be in you in spite of yourself.

CHI. MANILAL AND SUSHILA,
 I got your letter. I have gone through the article on the Agent’s marriage. It puts forth a good argument but it cannot be said that it is written in good English. Some mistakes have gone undetected. However, it does not matter. I say this only to draw your attention to it. What is essential is clarity of thought although it would be good to write a language faultlessly. Of course a mistake in a foreign language may be excusable.
 We are still in Lucknow. Probably we shall leave here on the 15th. For the present we shall be going to Wardha. I am thinking of settling down in a village near Wardha.
 Nimulibtech_552_footnotelibtech_553_footnote, Krishnadas and his wife Manojna, Prabhudas and Amba, etc., are here at present. Umiyalibtech_554_footnotelibtech_555_footnoteand  her  husband  Shankarlallibtech_556_footnotelibtech_557_footnotelive close to us. Jaisukhlal also has come and has put up near the  Exhibition.

 Kanti, Navin, Kanu, Ba are with me already, and also Jamnalalji, Janakidevi and Madalasa. Thus we have quite a good gathering here. The day after tomorrow, however, most of them will have dispersed.

 I may say I am in fairly good health. I believe Medh is improving steadily.

 Your letter surprises me although I rather like it, too. Your language does not appear to spring from your heart. Perhaps such language comes to you naturally. I am not impressed by the mention of your japlibtech_561_footnotelibtech_562_footnote, etc. You had written a similar letter at Maganwadi. In spite of the several vows you took you were full of sensual aberrations and kept from me the fact. This letter gives no proof of  your frankness. You seem to accept your guilt because you have no option.  I see in it no feeling of remorse although it may be that  I  am  mistaken. Maybe, you have turned a new leaf; on my part, I would of course wish it. Show all the papers to Ramjibhai and confess everything to him. Do away with such figurative and flowery language. Use adjectives sparingly. Your very first sentence irks: “Let us thank the gracious Dweller in the heart for  bringing  in  the fortunate opportunity of confess with humility what was concealed by conwardice”. Why “us”? I see nothing to be thankful for. I have not known such a thing happening to man all of a sudden, as you describe. By saying “If we went into the details I might perhaps win the point”, you weaken your feeling of remorse, if you had any. Do go into the details, if you think you can win the point that way. The saints magnify their own fault if it were as samll as a speck of dust and make it look as big as an elephant. You are, however, not at all obliged to do so; you kept back for long whatever you had [to confess].

 April 14, 1936 Speaking for five minutes Mahatma Gandhi said that the Harijans had all his blessings and asked them to have patience as the demon of untouchability was a long-
 standing one and could not be destroyed in a day. He exhorted them to be clean and
 neat and assured them that he was always with them and was one among them.

 [Before April 16, 1936]libtech_564_footnote
 
“This   book-cover   is   made  by   our  women”,   said   the   lady   from Poland.
 Thanking them Gandhiji asked:
 Is it only the women who spin and weave there, and do the men do nothing?
 Spinning is done exclusively by women. But men are not idlers either. They are engaged in other crafts. For instance this wooden casket is made by our men
Is this a recent revival, or has the movement been on for some
 time? Has it touched the intellectual classes, or is there a gulf between them and the masses?
 No; the intellectuals have taken keenly to it and we have had the movement now for some time. and it is daily growing.
And how do you happen to work togetheryou who must be as
 poles asunder, Poland an agricultural country and France a highly industrialized country?
 We have been working together for several years. There is a village industries movement in France too, and we thought we should go together to India to study things first-hand. We must say we have had much to learn.
 They were contemplating writing a book on India and wanted to know whether they could serve India by doing so.
You could, if you write for Poland and France or say Europe,
but not if you write for India.
 They paused for a moment wondering what Gandhiji meant.
 I shall explain. If you have really learnt somethiing from our villages, you can only give the benefit of that learning to your own people. What I learn from the West I give to my country. Fallen though we seem today, our villages have still to teach something to the world. And if what you say to your people appeals to them, that will have its reaction on us. What I say holds good only if you have really learnt something worthy from our villages. Perhaps the Exhibition has opened your eyes to many possibilities.
 
 I should like to spend weeks there and fill my soul with the atmosphere of the past. You find there workmen actually at workworkmen from Orissa and Kashmir working with their crudest possible tools, if you please, and yet conjuring up with their aid some of the most gorgeous articles in silver and wool. The things you have brought for me are no patch on similar things you will find in the Exhibition. Look at the men from Patan working at their sari of exquisite pattern and design. The work is now confined to only four families whereas hundreds of families used to get their living in the past out of the work. They are so conservative that they would not let their nearest neighbour know the cunning of their craft. But we have drawn some of them out into light. Some of this work can be revived, in all its glory, if we are prepared to pay for it adequately, pay enough to feed them and to keep them in health and comfort. Now that is a nearly perfect Exhibition, i. e., as perfect as it could be looking to the limited time at the disposal of the organizers and to the numerous handicaps they had to contend against. And yet it is  nothing  compared to what it could be, if we could have brought all the representative men and wemen engaged in many other crafts.

 You had a right to tell Jamnalalji what you did about me. But you should have taken me into confidence if you felt hurt. Prabha came to me with your consent as well as Brijkishore Babu’s. I can say nothing about the influence I exercised on her. But by her association with me there has been no waning of her devotion to her father or love for her husband. True, Prabha does not give you conjugal satisfaction, because by her very nature she cannot. She was free from passion even before she came to me. We can only go by what she says. She told me this repeatedly and firmly and I accepted her word. Now tell me what I should do. If you want that Prabha should give up visiting me or writing to me, for your peace of mind I will accept this restriction.

  [After April 17, 1936]libtech_565_footnote  	Mirabehn who is here in your midst came here with the intention of 	settling down for good. But I find that she is not in a position to 	carry out her intention. Even if she stayed on, she could do so not 	without considerable mental struggle. The will is not lacking but 	perhaps the flesh is weak. Now as you know an unbreakable bond of 	common service binds us both, and so I thought it my duty to do what 	she could not do. God willing, therefore, I shall come to stay in    
 your midst. Maybe God will give me the strength that He did not vouchsafe to her.
 But even God’s will is expressed through various agencies and unless I have your goodwill even I may fail in my mission. Ever since my childhood it has been a principle with me that I should not think of inflicting myself on those who view my going in their midst with mistrust, misgivings or apprehension. I should not think of coming here, except to serve you. But in many places my presence and the programme I stand for are viewed with considerable dread. At the back of this dread is the fact that I have made the removal of untouchability a life’s mission.You must have known from Mirabehn that I have cost out all untouchability from myself, that I hold all classes of peopleBrahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya and Shudra, Rajput, Mahar, Chamarall alike, and I regard these distinctions based on birth as immoral. We have suffered because of these distinctions, and this sense of high and low has vitiated our lives. But I may tell you that I should not think of imposing these convictions on you. I should try to do so by persuasion, above all by my own example. I shall try to serve you by cleaning your roads and your surroundings, by trying to render such help as I can if there is illness in the  village,  by teaching you self-help by way of helping you to revive your handicrafts. If you will co-operate with me I shall be happy, if you will not I shall be content to be absorbed among you as one among the few hundreds that live here.
 I hope I shall come to settle here. But it depends on His will. For I did not know that He would move me from India to South Africa, and from South Africa I should come to Sabarmati, and from Sabarmati to Maganwadi,and now from Maganwadi to Segaon.

444,,FOR CHRISTIAN FRIENDS,"
  
 
 DEAR BR. GANDHI
 . . . You have had your name blazoned abroad. . . as one of the greatest philosophers and sacrificial workers on earth. In India you have been proclaimed the Mahatma, and actually worshipped as one of the incarnations of India‘s many deities. . . Your practice also of fasting when sin has been committed. . . has had a tendency to make Indians believe that you can merit
 blessing which can be communicated to others,---but  has  anybody  been loving and courageous enough to write and challenge you as to how personally you are going to obtain atonement for your own sin? All your self-denials and fastings and prayer and good deeds cannot blot out one sin of your early days. For thirty or more years of your life you lived the carnal, self-life, seeking and following your own plans and ambitions without seeking to know God’s purpose for your life or to honour His holy name. . .
 Even if, as you profess to believe, Christ was only one of many incarnations of God, and the   latest  of   them,  you   must   either   accept His
 tremendous claims as of Divine origin, or reject them as only human and fallible. And when He declares as He did to the Jews of His day  ‘If  ye believe
 not that I am He, ye shall die in your sins’ or ‘I am the way, the truth, and the life, no man cometh unto the Father, but by me’, you must either believe Him to have been self-deceived, or deliberately false.       I  pray daily that  Christ
 may grant you a revelation of Himself as He did to Saul of Tarsus, that.     you
 may be used to proclaim to India’s millions the sacrificial efficacy of His precious blood.
 This is a typical letterlibtech_566_footnotefrom an old English friend who regularly writes such letters almost every six months. This friend is very earnest and well known to me. But there are numerous other correspondents unknown to me who write in the same strain without arguing. Since now I cannot for reasons of health write to individual writers, I use this letter as a text for a general reply. Incidentally this effort will enable the readers of Harijan who accpet my guidance to understand the nature of my religious belief.
 My correspondent is a literalist. He gives its literal meaning to every text of the Bible in spite of its clear statement that “the letter killeth, the spirit giveth life”. My very first reading of the  Bible showed me that I would be repelled by many things in it if I gave their literal meaning many texts or even took every passage in it as the word of God. I found as I proceeded with my study of the scriptures of the various religions that every scripture had to be treated likewise, not excepting the Vedas or the Upanishads. Therefore the story of the immaculate conception when I interpret it mystically does not repel me. I should find it hard to believe in the literal meaning of the verses relating to the immaculate conception of Jesus. Nor would it deepen my regard for Jesus if I gave those verses their literal meaning. This does not mean that the writers of the Gospels were untruthful persons.
 
 They wrote in a mood of exaltation. From my youth upward I learnt the art of estimating the value of scriptures on the basis of their ethical teaching. Miracles therefore had no interest for me. The miracles said ot have been performed by Jesus, even in I had believed them literally, would not have reconciled me to any teaching that did not satisfy universal ethics. Somehow or other, words of religious teachers have for me, as I presume for millions, a living force which the same words uttered by ordinary mortals do not possess.
 Jesus then to me is a great world-teacher among others. He was to the devotees of his generation no doubt ‘the only begotten son of God’. Their belief need not be mine. He affects my life no less because I regard him as one among the many begotten sons of God. The adjcetive ‘begotten’ has, for me, a deeper and possibly a grander meaning than its literal meaning. For me it implies spiritual birth. In his own times he was the nearest of God.
 Jesus atoned for the sins of those who accepted his teachings by being an infallible example to them. But the example was worth nothing to those who never troubled to change their lives.  A regenerate outgrows the original taint even as purified gold outgrows the original alloy.
 I have made the frankest admission of my many sins. But I do not carry their burden on my shoulders, If I am journeying Godward, as I feel I am, it is safe with me. For I feel the warmth of the sunshine of His presence. My austerities, fastings and prayers are, I know, of no value, if I rely upon them for reforming me. But they have an inestimable value, it they represent, as I hope they do, the yearnings of a soul striving to lay his weary head in the lap of his Maker.
 The Gita has become for me the key to the scriptures of the world. It unravels for me the deepest mysteries to be found in them. I regard them with the same reverence that I pay to the  Hindu  scriptures. Hindus, Mussalmans, Christians, Parsis, Jews, are convenient labels. But when I tear them down, I do not know which is which. We are all children of the same God. “Verily, verily, I say unto you, not everyone that sayeth unto me Lord Lord, shall enter the Kingdom of heaven, but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven shall enter the Kingdom”, was said, though in different words, by all the great teachers of the world.

 Gandhiji has your letter of the 8th instant. The contents surprised him, inasmuch as an educated man like you does not understand the reason why the price of khadi has slightly gone up. It has been increased in order to enable the poor spinner to have something like a living wage. We are far yet from giving him a real living wage, but the recent increase in khadi [prices] ensures him a wage just enough to secure him two full meals a day. Do you, poor as you are, grudge the little increase to the men and women who are much poorer than you?

 MY DEAR REBEL,
 You are right in saying I worry about nothing and therefore not even about your persistent cough which you so lightly regarded. But not to worry is not to neglect or underrate such information. Why should you be so delicate? Why should the slightest change in the weather upset you? If it is the diet that is at the bottom, you must revert to the old regimen. On no such account may you endanger your health. There are occasions in a person’s life when everything has to be sacrificed. Surely a new regimen suddenly adopted is not such an occasion. My own inclination is always on the side of nature cure. But that you may not adopt unless Shummy co-operates, you believe in it, and you get a proper guide. A guide is obtainable but Shummy may not agree and you may not have faith in it. Mere liking is of no consequence. Please do not play with your ailments. Even a rebel has to submit to the laws of nature.

  	Only idiots can think of idiotic interpretationlibtech_577_footnoteand because you are such a brilliant specimen and 	agent of the A.I.V.I.A., naturally you will like the rest to belong 	to your species. Heaven help poor me—their guide ! ! !  	Do you think anything on earth can be done without trouble? You 	can’t do even your unpacking without trouble. Then what is the use 	of your saying that I should redeem my promise to send you honey if 	it can be done without trouble? I tell you that it cannot be done 	without some trouble. But that trouble is going to be taken and 	honey is being sent. You will cover the expense when you next send 	your cheque. The parcels to follow will be sent to you direct from 	Calcutta or Shillong, V.P.P. if you like. You will tell me when you 	will    
 want the next parcel. Let all eat this honey, if they prefer it to the Australian. I am sure the Shillong honey is any day better than the foreign stuff, if only because it is fresher.
 Your lace, mattress and the reversible sari must be in the box that was being packed for you. You must receive it by this time. I know there was some bungling about it. You are not the only idiot. You may be the princess among them !! Are you?
 I go tomorrow to Nagpur, probably return on 25th, 27th for certain. I go to Segaon, 5 miles from here, on 29th or 30th, returning when required. I go with Sardar on 9th May or about the date no Nandi Hill, Mysore. Mahadev and others accompany me. Or else I would have insisted on Mahadev going to you for a month. We  descend to Bangalore about 1st June and leave it about 10th June. This outing is necessary because Dr. A[nsari] wants Sardar to go to a hill-station. He would not go without me. If I had not to go to Mysore,  I would have passed a fortnight with the sister at Panchgani. I am sorry to disappoint them.
 Of course I inflict myself on you, if I have to come to Simla. I do not think I shall have to just yet. As for you, I shall hold you to the three winter months with me and then you will diet yourself under supervision. What would Shummy say about it?
Love.

  	I did expect that you would send Shivprasad’s letter  after making 	a fair copy. It would be good if, in my old age, I could personally 	teach Vijaya and Manu how to read and write at any rate. I, 	therefore, give some dictation to both of them after the prayer. I 	think that even with my left hand I would write faster than they do, 	more legibly at any rate. But I have found this key for training 	them, and I am holding on to it. My handwriting is none too good, 	either. So I allow the letter as taken down by Vijaya to go, as also 	the one by Manudilibtech_579_footnotelibtech_580_footnote.   That   ‘mission’   became   “machine”    is 	  not    so    very important. But I did sympathize with Shivprasad. 	Although I had expected that you would have a fair copy made if you 	found it too difficult to read. Bablolibtech_581_footnotelibtech_582_footnote, Durgalibtech_583_footnotelibtech_584_footnote, Prabhudayal or, if free, Kanu could have made a copy. 	I must have presumed some such thing. But what can we do, now that 	the arrow has sped from the bow? Let it strike Shivprasad. Why 	should he have asked such questions? Kuruvilla is free to send the 	note prepared by you.  	You will have to accompany me to Hodge’s. Do whatever you can for 	Daniel Hamilton. I will of course try to detain Rajkumarilibtech_585_footnote. When should we reach Nagpur? Decide this if it has 	not already been done, so that I may know when I will have to leave 	Segaon. Please remember and caution other visitors that the wooden 	bridge on the longer route has been pulled down. Hence cars, etc. 	should not take this route.  	Read Moore’slibtech_586_footnotelibtech_587_footnoteletter to Rajkumari and then destroy it.  Jamnalalji  	will  have  arrived  before   Anandshankarbhailibtech_588_footnotedoes.          
 Even if he has not, why not put up Anandshankarbhai at his place? But do what you think best. If there is no reply from Madan Mohanlibtech_589_footnote, make alternative arrangements for his stay in consultation with Jajujilibtech_590_footnoteor Radhakisan. Tikekar is, of course, there. He would be comfortable at his place also. But he is in bad shape these days. Hence it would be better to make some other arrangement.
 I talked to Rambhau and also told him not to have his meals with you. I also asked him to leave Wardha immediately. But what can I do when you yourself are soft? Pyarelal says that he too had scolded him severely. You can tell him on my behalf that he may either leave or take his meals anywhere else he wishes. I knew nothing about the bangles.
 I have read Chopra’s booklet. We do have a copy. It was lent to Mahodayalibtech_591_footnote. It came eight or nine months ago. Its title is likely to be ‘Indian Drugs’ rather than ‘Indian Plants’.

	PARISHAD","
  
 NAGPUR,
 April 24, 1936
 Introducing his printed speech to the audience, Gandhiji said he was out of place in a conference of litterateurs especially as he knew better than anyone else that his knowledge of Hindi literature, and even of Gujarati literature, was nothing to speak of, that his knowledge even of Gujarati grammar was indifferent. But he had been told that it was an impossible task to get together formidable litterateurs, who were like lions safe enough in their own cages, but difficult to keep together and to be made to work together. It had been thought that he as a neutral man and a ‘mahatma’ might be of some service in bringing them together. There he was available to them for what he might be worth, but he wanted to make it clear that he was there simply to initiate the work of bringing [together] the literary men of every province speaking the different languages, and of serving the masses of India by making available to them the best in all the rich languages of our countrylibtech_596_footnote.
 In the course of his extempore speech Gandhiji said that doctors had advised him not to exert himself too much.libtech_597_footnote
 I am here for a brief while for the limited purpose I have told you, but you may know that my heart is neither here nor even in Wardha. My heart is in the villages. For days I have been striving with the Sardar to let me go to a village near Wardha. He is still unconvinced, but my mind won’t rest, and God willing, I hope to go and settle in a village near Wardha in a short while. But that does not mean that I will not do the work I am doing now, or that I shall cease to be available for consultation to friends, or for advice to those who will seek it. Only my address will be a village where I would be living ordinarily. I have been asking all my co-workers who  are  doing village work to go and settle in villages and to serve the villagers. I feel that I cannot do so effectively until I go and settle in village myself.
 Proceeding, Gandhiji referred to the conflict between Hindi (Hindustani) and Urdu which was due mainly because Hindus and Muslims considered each other as enemies. He noticed disputes ever since he returned to India from Africa. In fact there was no cause for dispute because even if Muslims took the vow not to use a single
 
 
 Hindi word they were unable to keep it mainly because the grammatical systems of both were identical. Neither could the staunch advocates of Hindi abolish Persian or Urdu words as could be seen from Tulsidas’s Ramayana which abounded in Persian and Arabic words.libtech_598_footnote
 Gandhiji said that Hindi or Hindustani stood the best chances of becoming India’s lingua franca since it was a comprehensive language and was receptive to outside influences, in that it had absorbed the best from every other literature. He favoured simplification of Hindi and deprecated the tendency to Sanskritize it. He also urged that all current expressions in different languages should be adopted.
 Proceeding, Gandhiji deplored the tendency to translate Hindi books first into English and then into Bengali or other [languages]. If they wanted to revive the vernacular, if they wanted to achieve the object they had in view, they must banish English so far as Indian masses were concerned. He had no desire to underestimate the value of English which was a universal language and had international significance but Hindustani must become India’s lingua franca and the pernicious notion that they could produce excellent literature only in English must go.libtech_599_footnote
 Gandhiji deplored the present state of things where people were, so to say, in a hide-bound way content to remain in their own linguistic and cultural wells, not ready even to acquaint themselves with the language and literature of their neighbouring provinces. A handful of our literary men may be studying different provincial literatures and exchanging the treasures of other provincial languages. But we had to seek do do more . . . .
 We must not only seek to know the picturesque language of the village folk, but also to spread a knowledge of modern useful literature among the villagers. It is a shame that Chaitanya’slibtech_600_footnotelyrics are a sealed book to people outside Bengal and Orissa. Few of us here may know the name of Tiruvalluvar. People in the North are innocent even of the great saint’s name. Few saints have given us treasures of knowledge contained in pithy epigrams as he has done.
 In this context, I can at this moment recall the name only of Tukaram.libtech_601_footnote
 But for that purpose not only the existing literary treasures had to be made available in a language which could be easily learnt by the masses in all  the provinces, but even new literature had to be created—new literature of a healthy and
 
 health-giving type.libtech_602_footnote
 If we were to enter the vast field of Indian literature, should we stop somewhere? In my opinion there should certainly be a limit. I never had the temptation of increasing the number of books. I do not consider it necessary that every book written or published in the language of every province should be introduced to all the other languages. Even if such an attempt were possible, I think it would be harmful. Such interature as fosters unity, morality, valour and such other qualities, and science, should profitably spread to every province.libtech_603_footnote
 Today a plethora of highly objectionable erotic literature seems to be in evidence in every province. Indeed, there are some who say that barring the erotic there is no other rasalibtech_604_footnoteworth the name;  and because the erotic is at a premium, those who insist on restraint in literature are held up to ridicule as devoid of all rasa. They forget that even those who are said to sacrifice everything do not sacrifice rasa. Each one of us feeds himself on some rasa or sacred passion. Dadabhai Naoroji sacrificed everything for the country, but he was fired by the sacred passion of patriotism. That gave him all his inner happiness. To say that Chaitanya was devoid of rasa is to confess innocence of all rasa. Narasinh Mehta, the poet-saint of Gujarat, has described himself as a bhogilibtech_605_footnotelibtech_606_footnote, but his bhoga was that of singleminded devotion to God. If you will not be annoyed, I would go to the length of saying that the erotic is the lowest of all rasas, and when it partakes of the obscene it is wholly to be eschewed. If I had the power I should taboo all literature calculated to promote communalism, fanaticism and ill will and hatred between individuals, classes or races.libtech_607_footnote
 How can all this be achieved? Munshiji and Kakasaheb have cleared our way to a certain extent. Literature of wider appeal can only be spread by a widely [spoken] language. Hindi-Hindustani is such a language compared to the other languages. The reason why Hindi is qualified by the word ‘Hindustani’ is that words originating from the Persian idiom may not be shunned in that language.
 
 
 The English language can never become the medium for all the provinces. If we sincerely hope to enrich Indian literature, to carry the gems hidden in the different languages to the crores of Indian masses, we can do so only through Hindustani. It was with this end in view that Munshi started the monthly Hans with the help of the famous writer Premchandji. It is necessary to make it a success.

466,,A YOUTH’S DIFFICULTY,"
  
 
 A correspondent who prefers to remain anonymous seeks an answer to a question arising out of my articlelibtech_608_footnotein  Harijan addressed to the young. Although it is a sound rule to ignore anonymous correspondence, I do sometimes make an exception when the question put is substantial as in the present case.
 The letter is in Hindi and is longer than it need have been. Its purport is:
 From your writing I doubt if you understand the young mind. What has been possible for you is not possible for all young men. I happen to be married. I can restrain myself. My wife cannot. She does not want children but she does want to enjoy herself. What am I to do? Is it not my duty to satisfy her? I am not generous enough to look upon her satisfying her desire through other channels. I read from the papers that you are not averse to promoting marriages and blessing them. Surely you know or ought to know that they are not contracted with the high purpose that you have mentioned.
 The correspondent is right. The fact that I bless so many marriages, when they satisfy the tests that I have set as  to  age, economy, etc., perhaps shows somewhat that I know the youth of the country to an extent that would justify my guiding them when they seek my guidance.
 My correspondent’s case is typical. He deserves sympathy. That the sole purpose of sexual connection is procreation is in the nature of a new discovery for me. Though I had known the rule, I had never before given it the weight it deserved. I must have till recently
 
 regarded it as a mere pious wish. I now regard it as a fundamental law of married state which is easy of observance if its paramount importance is duly recognized. My object will be fulfilled when the law is given its due place in society. To me it is a living law. We break it always and pay heavily for its breach. If my correspondent realizes its inestimable value and if he has love for her and has faith in himself, he will convert his wife to his view. Is he sincere when he says he can restrain himself? Has the animal passion become transmuted in his case into a higher passion, say, for service of fellow-beings? Does he naturally refrain from doing anything to excite the passion in his wife? Let him know that Hindu science denotes eight kinds of unious which include sexual suggestions made even by signs. Is the correspondent free from these? If he is notlibtech_609_footnotelibtech_610_footnoteand  if  he   is  sincerely desirous that his wife should be weaned from the sexual desire, let him surround her with the purest love, let him explain the law to her, let him explain the physical effects of union without the desire for procreation, let him tell her what the vital fluid means. Let him further engage his wife in healthy pursuits and strive to regulate her diet, exercise etc., so as to still the passion in her. Above all, if he is a man of religion he will try to transmit to his companion his own living faith. For I must confess that the observance of the law of continence is impossible without a living faith in God which is living Truth. It is the fashion nowadays to dismiss God from life altogether and insist on the possibility of reaching the highest kind of life without the necessity of a living faith in a living God. I must confess my inability to drive the truth of the law home to those who have no faith in and no need for a Power infinitely higher than themselves. My own experience has led me to the knowledge that fullest life is impossible without an immovable belief in a living Law in obedience to which the whole universe moves. A man without that faith is like a drop thrown out of the ocean bound to perish. Every drop in the ocean shares its majesty and has the honour of giving us the ozone of life.

  	I  have  written  to   Chimandas.   To   Choithramlibtech_617_footnoteI   wrote   from Lucknow itself. The case of 	Amtussalaam is a difficult one. She is not going to be happy with 	me, too, and I am now going to settle in a village. For the present, 	however, I am going to Nandi Durg with Sardar. He has been confined 	and I am banding jailor to him; I mean he is ill and I am to act as 	his number I am prepared to take Amtussalaam there. It is not good 	morning away from Rukmini's harassment of her. That women encourage 	her in her ways. We must find out a way to reform Rukmini. 	Therefore, consider Amtussalaam's case in this way. Is it necessary 	to have her there? If it is so, keep her there and clip Rukmini's 	wings. If she is not needed she should be sent to me forthwith. I 	sent her there with a view to satisfying her ambition to serve and 	under the belief that she was needed there. She is certainly not to 	be accommodated on the assumption that work may be taken from 	whoever is there. You are fully entitled to do what you think right 	after looking at the question from this angle. I  am  enclosing her 	letter herewith.  	Now about Sastri. He was here and talked about many things. His 	mention of Ganesan's abuses is only an excuse. He is tired of the 	work because he has no energy to raise the funds. On my part I am 	disappointed about him. I believe he is fit for specified desk work 	and can perhaps maintain accounts and carry on correspondence well. 	But he has not the ability to run an institution. He lacks 	initiative, has no self-confidence, no interest in the work, no such 	thing as drive. However, he is a good man and he is honest. I advise 	you, therefore, to relieve him from the Kumbhakonam work and entrust 	the burden to Bhashyam Iyengar. Let him do as he wishes. As for 	Pratapmal, Jagannath Das may take him on if he wants to, but we 	should not shoulder the burden of expenditure. He may carry on by 	raising  funds from Madras or any other place he likes. In no case  	can Ganesan continue. You might share the burden to any extent you     
 choose provided Bhashyam Iyengar and Venkatasubbayya can shoulder the responsibility. You should boldly settle the matter as you wish. See that in whatever you do Sastri and Ganesan are carefully kept out. Sastri may be accommodated anywhere else. I wish you should no more burden me on his account. My heart turns towards the villages. I wrote the part concerning Amtussalaam at Wardha and then had to leave it incomplete as visitors came up. Now I complete it today, the second day, here at Segaon which is five miles  from Wardha. You should take it that I have settled finally when I return here from Bangalore. Till then you may regard it as the Mahatma's imposture.
It is not that Sardar is taking me to Nandi Durg, I am taking him
there.
Is it not enough, considering that I have not written to you for a
 long time, that I wrote all this from a village on country-made paper with a country-made reed-pen and country-made ink?
 I got a long letter from Amtussalaam. I am enclosing my replylibtech_618_footnoteto her, which you should read to her.

     Not 	revised          WARDHA, 
    MY 	DEAR AGATHA,  April 	30, 1936 
  	I have your letter of 17th instant. Nothing less was to be expected 	of Jawaharlal. His addresslibtech_619_footnoteis a confession of his faith. You see from the 	formation of his cabinet that he has chosen a majority of those who 	represent the traditional view, i.e., from 1920. Of course the 	majority represent my view. I would love to kill the New 	Constitutionlibtech_620_footnote      
 today if I can. There is hardly anything in it I like. But Jawaharlal's way is not my way. I accept his ideal about land, etc. But I do not accept practically any of his methods. I would strain every nerve to prevent a class war. So would he, I expect. But he does not believe it to be possible to avoid it. I believe it to be perfectly possible especially if my method is accepted. But though Jawaharlal is extreme in his presentation of his methods, he is sober in action. So far as I know him, he will not precipitate a conflict nor will he shirk it if it is forced on him. But there perhaps the whole Congress is not of one mind. A difference there certainly is. My method is designed to avoid conflict. His is not so designed. My own feeling is that Jawaharlal will accept the decisions of the majority of his colleagues. For a man of his temperament, this is most difficult. He is finding it so already. Whatever he does he will do it nobly. Though the gulf between us as to the outlook upon life has undoubtedly widened, we have never been so near each other in hearts as we perhaps are today.
 This is not for public use but you are at liberty to show it to friends.
 I do not suppose you want anything more in answer to your question.
 The rest from Mahadev. Love.

        CHI. 	PRABHA,       April 	30, 1936 
  	I got two letters from you. I understand what you say about money. 	Of course, your father’s letter is excellent and I noted what he 	had to say about giving you money. Inform him that I have sent it.  	It is all right if you have given up milk for health reasons. But 	you are not to undertake any experiment with a view to giving up 	milk. The fit was probably due to your going without milk. You are 	not to worry at all. As long as you have your parents’ blessings 	and they have not the least dissatisfaction about you, what have you 	to worry about? How does it matter what the world says? You alone 	have to settle your account with Jayaprakash. His is a different 	case. Hence it will not do if you fall ill under the stress of 	worry. The true follower of the Gita is one who can remain 	calm and composed  in  any  situation whatever, and you have to 	become such a one. For  the present, write to me regularly.  	Jayaprakash came to see me yesterday; Patwardhan was with him. He 	spoke to me about your future although he said nothing in reply to 	my letter. He said he wished to put you for three months at the 	school in Banaras where, he said, you might learn the Montessorie 	method. Then he mentioned Patna and asked my opinion about it. I 	told him I had no objection to the proposal. You should have the 
 three months’ experience at the Banaras school, and then we shall see what is to be done. In any case you must maintain your health.
 My stay in Nandi and Bangalore will take up a month, after which I am returning here. I came to Segaon today and shall be here for three days at least. Then again, after another two or three days I shall be leaving for Bangalore on the 8th. I expect Jayaprakash took your luggage with him and you were able to speak to him. Pyarelal alone has accompanied me to Segaon. Ba has not come as she is unwell.

Couldn't you take a tour like that?” [G.] 	 Oh, no. There is no similarity  between   the   two  cases.  	In  	Harijan work the practical and the theoretical aspects were 	combined. Here I cannot combine the two. I have been talking theory 	all these days, talking and giving advice on village work, without 	having personally come to grips with the difficulties of village 	work. If I undertook the tour, say, after passing three seasons in a 	village and among the villagers, a year hence I should be able to 	talk with knowledge and experience which I have not got today. 	Yesterday I went to Sindi to see how Gajanan Naik was working. The 	condition of things there is scarcely better but he is carrying on 	his work, patiently and perseveringly. The moment I saw him last 	morning I said to      
 myself: ‘If I had been working with Gajanan, I should certainly have had intimate experience of the difficulties he is meeting with.’ No. It is clearer to me than ever before that my place is in the village.

 CHI. PRABHA,
 I got your letter quite in time. Kanti will send you your luggage.
 I am sending a money order for Rs. 25. Do not be so careless again. It is likely that there was not so much carelessness as a feeling of shame. If so, such shame, too, ought to be given up.
You should put your time to good use.
 I am concerned about your giving up milk. What is wrong with your health that you should give up milk? You must not let your health suffer.
 My health is good, of course. My weight taken last night was 110-lb., i.e., about the same as at Delhi. The food, too, is nearly the same as there.

485,,FOR WOMEN REFORMERS,"
       	From a serious discussion I had with a sisterlibtech_637_footnoteI   fear  that  my position on the use of 	contraceptives has not yet been sufficiently understood. My 	opposition is not due to their having come to us from the West. I 	thankfully use some Western things when I know that they     
 benefit us as they benefit those in the West. My opposition to contraceptives is based on merits.
 I take it that the wisest among the protagonists of contraceptives restrict their use to married women who desire to satisfy their and their husbands' sexual appetite without wanting children. I hold this desire as unnatural in the human species and its satisfaction detrimental to the spiritual progress of the human family. As against this is often cited the following testimony among others of Lord Dawson of Penn:libtech_638_footnote
 Sex love is one of the clamant, dominating forces of the world.	You
 may guide it into healthy channels but an outlet it will have, and if that outlet  is inadequate or unduly obstructed, irregular channels will be forced. Self- control has a breaking point, and if in any community marriage is difficult or late of attainment, an increase of irregular unions will inevitably result. . . .
 Sex love has, apart from parenthood, a purport of its own. It is an essential part of  health and happiness in marriage.	The attainment of
 mutual and reciprocal joy in their relations constitutes a firm bond between two people and makes for durability of their marriage tie. . . .
 I will pass on to consider the all-important question of birth-control
 . . . . The reasons which lead parents to limit their offspring are sometimes selfish, but more often honourable and cogent. The desire to marry and to rear children well-equipped for life's struggle, limited incomes, the cost of living, burdensome taxation, are forcible motives. . . . Absence of birth-control means late marriages and these carry with them irregular unions and all the baneful consequences.        But say many, ‘Birth-control may be necessary,  but
 the only birth-control which is justifiable is voluntary abstention.’ Such abstention would be either ineffective or, if effective, impracticable and harmful to health and happiness. To limit the size of a family to, say, four children, would be to impose on a married couple an amount of abstention which for long period would almost be equivalent to celibacy, and when one remembers that owing to economic reasons the abstention would have to be most strict during the earlier years of married life when desires are strongest, I maintain a demand is being made which, for the mass of people it  is impossible to meet; that the endeavours to meet it would impose a strain hostile to health and happiness and carry with them grave dangers to morals
 . . .
 Lord Dawson's eminence is not to be denied. But with all due respect to his greatness as a physician, I am tempted to question the
 
 value of his evidence, specially when it is pitted against the experience of men and women who have lived a life of continence without suffering any moral or physical harm. Physicians generally come across those who have so defied laws of health that they have contracted some illness. They, therefore, often successfully prescribe what sufferers should do to become well, but they cannot always know what healthy men and women can do in any particular direction. Lord Dawson's evidence, therefore, about the effect of continence on married people has to be taken with the greatest caution. No doubt the tendency among married people is to regard sexual satisfaction for itself as legitimate. But in the modern age in which nothing is taken for granted and everything is rightly scrutinized, it is surely wrong to take it for granted that because we have hitherto indulged in  the sexual appetite in married life, the practice is either legitimate or healthy. Many old practices have been discontinued with good results. Why should this particular practice be exempt from examination especially in the light of the experience of those who even as married men and women are living a life of restraint with mutual benefit both physical and moral?
 But I object to contraceptives also on special grounds in India. Young men in India do not know what sexual restraint is. It is not their fault. They are married early. It is the custom. Nobody tells them to exercise restraint in married life. Parents are impatient to see grandchildren. The poor girl-wives are expected by their surroun- dings to bear children as fast as they can. In such surroundings, the use of contraceptives can only further aggravate the mischief. The poor girls who are expected to submit to their husbands' desires are now to be taught that it is a good thing to desire sexual satisfaction without the desire to have children. And in order to fulfil the double purpose they are to have recourse to contraceptives !!!
 I regard this to be most pernicious education for  married women. I do not believe that woman is prey to sexual desire to the same extent as man. It is easier for her than for man to exercise self- restraint. I hold that the right education in this country is to teach woman the art of saying no even to her husband, to teach her that it is not part of her duty to become a mere tool or a doll in her husband’s hands. She has rights as well as duties. Those who see in Sita a willing slave under Rama do not realize the loftiness of either  her independence or Rama's consideration for her in everything. Sita was no helpless weak woman incapable of protecting herself or her
 honour. To ask India's women to take to contraceptives is, to say the least, putting the cart before the horse. The first thing is to free her from mental slavery, to teach her the sacredness of her body and to teach her the dignity of national service and the service of humanity. It is not fair to assume that India's women are beyond redemption and that they have therefore to be simply taught the use of contraceptives for the sake of preventing births and preserving such health as they may be in possession of.
 Let not the sisters who are rightly indignant over the miseries of women who are called upon to bear children whether they will or no, be impatient. Not even the propaganda in favour of contraceptives is going to promote the desired end overnight. Every method is a matter of education. My plea is for the right type.

493,"May 3, 1936",494. SPEECH AT A.I.V.I.A. EXHIBITION libtech_649_footnote,"
       WARDHA, 
  May 3, 1936libtech_650_footnote  	As I was coming to Maganwadi I saw the weekly bazaar that is held 	here every Sunday. That bazaar has the raw produce as well as 	manufactures from raw produce exhibited in abundance. This 	exhibition has these exhibited on a very humble scale. I therefore 	wondered how our exhibition compared with the weekly bazaar. The 	fundamental difference is that the exhibition is held entirely with 	a view to service of the village and the townsfolk, whereas the 	bazaar is a business concern in which the villager is exploited. He 	is made to sell his wares as cheap as possible, often even below 	cost price. At this exhibition there is hardly any buying and 	selling. This exhibition is an attempt to educate the residents of 	Wardha in their duty towards the villages surrounding them and to 	educate the villagers in what is possible for them to better 	themselves in every way. The exhibition teaches them how to keep 	their villages clean, what food to eat and how to improve their 	industries and thus earn a little more than they do today. So far as 	the town-dweller in concerned the exhibiton forcibly brings to his 	mind the various ways in which he is exploiting the villager, and 	how best he may serve the villager by going in for his wares. The 	Lucknow Exhibition opened the eyes of those who visited it to the 	wonderful capacity of our village craftsman, and even this will do 	so somewhat. I may tell you here that though the admission here has 	been kept free, at Lucknow it was not free. Reports have been 	published that the exhibition there resulted in a heavy loss. They 	are wrong. The receipts from the sale of tickets exceeded Rs. 	25,000. There were, besides, receipts from stall-holders. It is just 	possible that there will be a nominal profit. Those around Lucknow 	will not see such an exhibition in Lucknow for years to come. The 	Kumbh Mela recurs at long but regular intervals. The Congress and 	the Exhibition may not be held again at the same place, and even if 	it is, it may be held at an indefinitely long interval, especially 	because the tendency, I     
 hope, now will be to select not big cities but small towns for their venue. But local exhibitions like this should be inexpensive annual efforts of growingly educative value. The village oilman has, for instance, deteriorated nowadays. He adulterates the oil with cheap and spurious stuffs. He will learn here how it is profitable to make the oil absolutely pure and unadulterated. The paper-maker will learn here how to make the paper neat and lasting. As time goes we should be able to show improvements in these processes. I know that we have been able to produce little effect, during the year, on our surroundings or on the villages in the neighbourhood. But that does not disappoint me. We have to plod on. Those of you who have come here have to go forth to the villages as advertising agents and to draw the villagers to such exhibitions. The tragedy today is that the town- dweller is becoming increasingly indifferent to the villages, that he even believes that the villages are going to be destroyed in the near future. They certainly will be if we continue to prefer mill-made articles to hand-made. Those of you who have come here have to go out as preachers of the gospel of rural-mindedness.
 A factory employs a few hundreds and renders thousands unemployed. I may produce tons of oil from an oil-mill, but I also drive thousands of oilmen out of employment. I call this destructive energy, whereas production by the labour of millions of hands is constructive and conductive to the common good.libtech_651_footnoteMass production through power-driven machinery, even when Stateowned, will be of on avail.
 But why not, it is asked, save the labour of millions and give them more leisure for intellectual pursuits? Leisure is good  and necessary up to a point only. God created man to eat his bread by the sweat of his brow, and I dread the prospect of our being able to produce all that we wnt, including our Food-stuffs, out of a conjurer's hat.

  	Surely by this time you have had more than one letter from Segaon. I 	am sure in a day or two you would have begun to like the place and 	the life. Ba came with me yesterday. I walked the whole distance. It 	took me full two hours. But then we again missed the way  a little. 	We were all novices without a guide. And I was silent. I can comfortably 	do the whole distance on 1libtech_657_footnotelibtech_658_footnotehours. 	I was none the worse  	for the walk and was ready for the evening walk. Mahadev  and 	Lilavati walked in at 8.30 p.m., and slept on the ground where the 	operations are going on. We all sleep there, surrounded on all sides 	by double trenches supported by the excavated earth. We eat the 	vegetables grown here. We do not therefore get a variety but there 	is more than compensation in the thought that we are taking what is 	grown locally. This restriction, if persisted in, will soon induce a 	cultivation of other vegetables. So much for Segaon.  	Now for the parcel from Lucknow. You wrote to me the other day 	saying you had advice of despatch of parcel by Miss Ala worth    
 over Rs. 600. You even hoped that it won't contain the khes you had sent. Where is that parcel? Instructions together with addresses were duly passed. But everything was topsy-turvy. All were overworked. I am sorry about the parcel having gone to Simla. I know what worry it is to have things wrongly addressed. I had spoken to Khurshed more than once and then to Jerajanilibtech_659_footnote. Let us see what finally happens. You need not send your cheque before the receipt of the parcels. By way of curiosity I would like to know how much extra the wrong address has cost.
 I am sure you should accept   the  Jullundur  nominationlibtech_660_footnoteif  it comes to you. And I take it, you have taken over the college responsibility. These things cannot be put away lightly.
 You are right about Ku. He is coming to Nandi Hill. I shall see what is possible. I shall not have the operation performed unless I am sure that it is necessary and the surgeon knows his work. Bharatan too will be going probably to Kodaikanal.
 Remember the date of my departure, 8th instant. I leave Segaon on 8th morning.

  	You can write to me now. We are leaving on the 8th for Nandi Durg.  	You seem to have gathered good experience. Merely because we doubt a 	man's sincerity we cannot reject his application if he  is prepared 	to sign the Congress Pledge. There will always be men who will 	wangle admission under one or the other pretext. If the majority of 	the members are sincere, ultimately all will be well.  	The report of the Maharashtrian's letter is perfectly correct.libtech_664_footnotelibtech_665_footnoteBut 	his supposition was completely wrong. The correspondent's  letter 	could be interpreted to mean that by resting my hands on girls’ 	shoulders I used to gratify my sensual desire. His words of course 	were different.  	But the truth is that my discontinuing the practice of resting my 	hands on the shoulders of girls has nothing to do with my sensual 	desire. It had its origin in my pampering the body with food while 	doing no work. I had a discharge, but I was awake and the mind was 	under control. I understood the cause and from that time stopped 	taking rest as prescribed by the doctors. And my state now is better 	than it was, if such a state could be imagined. If you wish to ask 	me more questions about this you may, for I have cherished high 	hopes of you. You may, therefore, know from me anything concerning 	myself that you wish to.  	The articles I have written recently deserve careful pondering over. 	If you have understood them, the practice of brahmacharya will 	become very easy. If one is convinced that the genital organs are 	not intended for sex-gratification, wouldn't one's attitude change 	completely? As a man happening to see on the road the blood-stained 	sputum of a consumptive may take it to be a gem and long to pick it 	up, but will come to his senses as soon as he realizes his error, so 	is the case in regard to the function of the genital organs. The 	truth is that this belief has never been held with sufficient 	conviction and clarity.    
 And now the new education denounces it, teaches that moderate sex- gratification is a good thing and asserts its necessity. Think over all this.
 The experience of your friends that you have described is excellent.libtech_666_footnote
 Let this suffice for the present. Probably Lilavati will join you.

 I should be satisfied if you were to follow the gospel of khadi with even a hundredth of Vinoba's faith. We have to demonstrate to the poor that khadi could be had for the price of unginned raw cotton, that is to say, those who produce cotton can have khadi free. That can happen only when we popularize the handginning of cotton, a process which preserves the vitality both of the cotton fibre and of the seed. Jamnalalji would fain close his ginning factory tomorrow, if we were to ask him to do so. But it would have no value. If you were to take upon yourselves to gin all the cotton that you produce it would close down automatically. Vinoba's simile of the lamp was very beautifully expressive indeed. As darkness cannot stand in front of light, even so absence of khadi cannot exist in front of khadi. Your khadi will be infectious only if you will bring to bear on it all the devotion and the perseverance and, above all, the intelligent devotion and perseverance that it deserves. Only thereby will you be able to take it out of a narrow and exclusive groove and succeed in sharing it with those whom you come across.

507,"May 	7, 1936",SPEECH AT A.I.V.I.A. MEETING libtech_684_footnote,"
         WARDHA, 
  May 	7, 1936  	I take it that those who are members of the A. I. V. I. A. know the 	rules of the Association, one of which is that there is to be an 	annual general meeting. Either such a meeting is necessary or it is 	not. If it is, surely it is the duty of every member to attend the 	meeting unless he is unavoidably absent. What I cannot understand is 	that the absentees have not all written to say what prevented them 	from attending the meeting. The feeling on the part of an  	individual  member that his absence alone cannot affect the quorum 	is obviously wrong.  	Our ambition is to make at least one member for each of our 7,00,000 	villages, but our actual membership is 517! And the bulk of the 	members are not present! It is deplorable, but it does not dismay 	me. Let those who are present carry to the absentees at least this 	message that it was their duty to inform the Secretary as to the 	reason of their failure. Failure even to intimate the reason argues 	lethargy, which certainly should disqualify one to be the member of 	an association like ours.libtech_685_footnote  Mahatma 	Gandhi observed 	that the 	duty of 	the workers was to serve 	the villagers 	and if 	they found that the 	atmosphere in 	some place was not 	congenial to 	them for 	the pursuit of 	service owing to 	the hostility 	of local 	officials, nothing would 	be lost 	by their 	shifting their centres of 	work. The 	country was 	wide enough 	to provide ample scope for work in places other than those in which conditions were     p.m. 	had to be adjourned for want of quorum and was held at 8 p.m.  
 rendered difficult owing to extraneous forces. Difficulties occasioned by internal forces it would be the duty of workers, however, to overcemo.
 Some members talk of difficulties created from outside. I think most of them are imaginary. How much have we been able to do where there are no difficulties from outside? Take Sindi and Segaon where Gajanan and Mirabehn have both been working with a zeal and rural-mindedness that every one of us might envy. How much have they achieved that could be shown? The reason is the inertia, the lethargy of our people, the masters. We want them to do something, i.e., to keep their surroundings clean, to eat wholesome food and to regulate their working hours so as to increase their income. They have no faith in all this. They have lost hope of bettering their lot.
 We haveto tackle the triple malady which holds our villages fast in its grip: (1) Want of corporate sanitation; (2) Deficient diet; (3) Inertia.
 In Segaon where Mirabehn is working, all the outside circumstances are more favourable than anywhere else. The zamindars there are Jamnalalji and Babasaheb Deshmukh. They place no obstacles; they, on the contrary, help her. And yet, do you think she gets much co-operation from the people? Not that they are wilfully obstructive. They are not interested in their own welfare. They don't appreciate modern sanitary methods. They don't want to exert themselves beyond scratching their farms or doing such labour as they are used to. These difficulties are real and serious. But they must not baffle us. We must have an unquenchable faith in our mission. We must be patient with the people. We are ourselves novices in village work. We have to deal with a chronic disease. Patience and perseverance, if we have them, overcome mountains of diffculties. We are like nurses who may not leave their patients because they are reported to have an incurable disease.
 The only way is to sit down in their midst and work away in steadfast faith, as their scavengers, their nurses, their servants, not as their patrons, and to forget all our prejudices are prepossessions. Let us for a moment forget even swaraj, and certainly forget the ‘haves’ whose presence oppresses us at every step. They are there. There are many who are dealing with these big problems. Let us tackle the humbler work of the village which is necessary now and would be
 even after we have reached our goal. Indeed, the village work when it becomes successful will itself bring us nearer the goal.libtech_686_footnote
 He hoped to see Segaon become an ideal centre of persistent effort, and he trusted that worker's elsewhere would apply to the work before them the same zest and energy. It was too early to judge the progress achieved, but he hoped that they would also attempt to understand thoroughly the implications of the threefold programme that had been placed before them by the Association. The first part of this was the improvement of sanitary conditions, removal of filth and the eradication of habits which gave rise to uncleanliness. That meant the education of the village population by personal example and steady work.
 The next part of the programme called for a radical change in the dietary of the people so that they might be enabled to draw greater sustenance from the articles of food ordinarily available in villages. This required that the processing of food-stuffs should be done in the villages, as in the past, and that pure food-stuffs should be made available in villages and not be drained away to towns. The last portion of the programme was the utilization of spare time of the cultivators, the revival of dead or dying industries, and teaching all classes of people the right use of leisure.
 All these were difficult tasks, Mahatma Gandhi admitted, and those friends of his were not wrong who warned him that he had now in the evening of his life taken upon his head a heavier responsibility than the promotion of the charkha movement or the removal of untouchability. Both these activities, important as they were, formed only a part of the vast work of rural reconstruction.

	WORKERS","
  
 
 WARDHA,
 May 8, 1936
 I may confess that I was sceptical about the opening of the school.libtech_690_footnotelibtech_691_footnoteWe  had  not  enough  material,  we  had  not  much  practical experience of village work, and I doubted whether we should be able to give the students anything helpful by way of training. I also doubted whether many students would be forthcoming and whether they would be the kind of men we need for village work. I am glad to say that my fears have been so far falsified, and that we have achieved during the brief three months more than was expected.
 But today I propose to speak to you about the ideal of work and life that you have to keep in view and work towards.
You are here not for a career in the current sense of the term.
 
 Today man's worth is measured in rupees, annas, pies and a man's educational training is an article of commerce. If you have come with that measure in mind, you are doomed to disappointment. At the end of your studies you may start with an honorarium of ten rupees and end with it. You may not compare it with what a manager of a great firm or a high official gets.libtech_692_footnote
 You should cultivate the true spirit of humility and  appreciate properly the role you are to play in the life of the rural community.
 Your ambition should be to serve the villagers more intensively and not to look to higher emoluments. You are not less valuable servants of India than members of the Indian Civil Service who draw a remuneration a hundred times higher than what you will get.
 It is a topsy-turvy economics which is fashioning your destiny today when persons draw salaries which are nearly a thousand to two thousand times the average income of an Indian.
 We have to change the current standards. We promise you no earthly careers, in fact we want to wean you from ambition of that kind. You are expected to bring your food-bill within Rs. 6 a month. The food-bill of an I.C.S. may come to Rs. 60 a month, but that does not mean that he is or will be on that account physically or  intellectually or morally superior to you. He may be for all his sumptuous living even inferior in all these respects. You have come to this institution because, I presume, you do not value  your  qualifications in metal. You delight in giving your service to the country for a mere pittance. A man may earn thousands of rupees on the Stock Exchange but may be thoroughly useless for our purposes. He would be unhappy in our humble surroundings and we should be unhappy in his. We want ideal labourers in the country's cause. They will not bother about what food they get, or what comforts they are assured by the villagers whom they serve. They will trust to God for whatever they need, and will exult in the trials and tribulations they might have to undergo. This is inevitable in our country where we have 7,00,000 villages to think of. We cannot afford to have a salaried staff of workers who have an eye to regular increments, provident funds and pensions. Faithful service of the villagers is its own satisfaction.
Some of you will be tempted to ask if this is also the standard
 
 for the villagers. Not by any means. These prospects are  for  us servants and not for the village-folk our masters. We have sat on their backs all these years, and we want to accept voluntary and increasing poverty in order that our masters' lot may be much better than it is today. We have to enable them to earn much more than they are earning today. That is the aim of the Village Industries Association. It cannot prosper unless it has an ever-increasing number of servants such as I have described. May you be such servants.libtech_693_footnote
 He hoped, in conclusion,that this institution would serve to be an agency for forging links between the rural population in different parts of India.

 Elsewhere the reader will find a deeply interesting letterlibtech_694_footnotelibtech_695_footnotefrom an esteemed friend which was read to the delegates who recently assembled in Nagpur and who inaugurated the  Akhil  Bharatiya Sahitya Parishad. There is a similar letter from another Muslim friend enclosing leading articlelibtech_696_footnotelibtech_697_footnoteon the subject in   The  Bombay  Chronicle dated 27th April last. These letters and the Chronicle article generally represent my views on the question of common inter-provincial speech. However, I fear that there are perhaps limitations to my agreement which need to be publicly stated. The limitations if they may be so called are designed to compass the very  end  that  my friends have in view.
 At the outset I must dismiss from consideration the suspicion entertained by some Muslims. The whole atmosphere is surcharged with suspicion. No person's declarations or acts are above suspicion. The best way, in my opinion, for those who sincerely desire full communal unity and have themselves given no cause for suspicion is to act on the square without being swayed one way or the other by the passions of the moment, especially in matters like the Parishad which have nothing to do with the passions. The object of the Parishad is to gather together all that is best in all the languages of India and to
 
 make it available to the largest number of her  inhabitants  and therefore through a speech understood by the largest number. Urdu is undoubtedly one of the many languages and contains treasures which should be the common property of all India. No Indian who wishes to know the Muslim mind or to know all about Islam as it is being interpreted through the Indian medium can afford to ignore Urdu literature. And the Parishad just established will fail in its duty and purpose if it does not unlock for all India the treasures to be found in the current Urdu literature.
 My correspondent has made a mistake which needs to be  cleared. He could not have had before him the full test of Tandonji's speechlibtech_698_footnotelibtech_699_footnotemade not as the friend thinks at Banaras but at Allahabad, or he would not have made the serious mistake of thinking that when Tandonji talked of 22 crores speaking Hindi, he had in mind only those who wrote the modern artificial Hindi. He made it clear that he referred to the vast mass of people of north of the Vindhya including the seven crores of Mussalmans who more or less spoke and understood the language which is evolved from Vrajabhasha  and which has the latter's grammatical structure. The name Hindi given to it is not original. It was given by Muslim writers to what they wrote for the people of the North and what was undoubtedly like that which their Hindu brethren wrote. Later on a bifurcation took place and Hindi written in Devanagari came to be the speech of the Hindus of the North and Urdu written in Arabic or Persian script came to be the speech of the Muslims of the North. It is hardly true as yet to say that Urdu is common to the Mussalmans all over India. I know that the Ali Brotherslibtech_700_footnotelibtech_701_footnoteand I found it difficult to make ourselves understood by the Moplahs of Malabar through our Urdu. We had to have a Malayalee interpreter. We found a similar diffiulty in East Bengal among its numerous Mussalmans. Both Tandonji and Rajendra Babulibtech_702_footnotelibtech_703_footnotetherefore meant the same thing absolutely as my friend when they used the word ‘Hindi’. The use of the word ‘Hindustani’ would not make their position clearer.
 But the writer of the letter is on sure ground when he complains of the writers of the North who write a language which they call ‘Hindi’ but which very few persons even of the North would
 
 
 understand. It is an effort which is doomed to fail like Johnsonian speech.
 Then why insist on ‘Hindi or Hindustani’ and why not simply say ‘Hindustani’, the writer may say. For one simple reason that it would be impertinent for me, a newcomer, to ask an associationlibtech_704_footnoteof  25 years' standing to alter its name when the need for it is not clearly proved. The new Parishad is an offspring of the older Association and wants to cater both for the Muslims and Hindus of the North who speak the common mother tongue, it does not matter whether it is called Hindi or Hindustani. For me either word has the same connotation. But I would not quarrel with those who would use the word ‘Hindi’ if they mean the same speech as I do.
 I do not understand the writer's objection to the adoption of the expression Akhil Bharatiya. It is an expression certainly known to the Hindus all over India. And I make bold to say that even the majority of the Mussalmans of the North would understand it. The Indian culture of our times is in the making. Many of us are striving to produce a blend of all the cultures which seem today to be in clash with one another. No culture can live if it attempts to be exclusive. There is no such thing as pure Aryan culture in existence today in India. Whether the Aryans were indigenous to India or were unwelcome intruders, does not interest me much. What does interest me is the fact that my remote ancestors blended with one another with the utmost freedom and we of the present generation are a result of that blend. Whether we are doing any good to the country of our birth and the tiny globe which sustains us or whether we are a burden, the future alone will show. So far as I am concerned the new Parishad and the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan have the common good of all through a blending of the best in all India’s languages. If they have not, they will perish. But blending to be that must not mean exclusion of everything that has an Aryan flavour any more than that of everything that has an Arabian or for that matter English or any other flavour.
 I may not prolong the argument this week. There are still some important points to be covered. I hope to deal with them next week.libtech_705_footnote

         MADRAS, 
  May 	9, 1936    Declining 	to comment 	on Indian or world 	politics, Gandhiji told an Associated 	Press representative:  	Talk to me about the weather, but politics—no. Having with- drawn 	from politics now, it will not be proper for me to talk about 	politics or politicians.  The 	Mahatma likewise declined to comment on the Abyssinian question, but 	read with interest Pandit Jawaharlal’s rejoinder to the Italian 	Consul-General.  In 	reply to an enquiry about his health, the Mahatma said that he was 	now feeling very much better. The trip was not unpleasant. He had 	been travelling along the coast with a sea breeze blowing. At Wardha 	it was intensely hot, with hot winds    
 continuing till midnight.
 Referring to his visit to Nandi Hills where he will be staying for a fortnight and at Bangalore probably for a fortnight before returning to Wardha, Gandhiji said:
 My jailor (Mr. Vallabhbhai Patel) will be there (Bangalore) half an hour before me to take charge of me. It may be that this time I may have to act as jailor to him (Mr. Vallabhbhai) because it is for his recuperation rather than mine that I am going to Nandi Hills.

515,"May 10, 1936",DISCUSSION WITH C.V. RAMAN AND DR. RAHM libtech_708_footnote,"
  
 [On or after May 10, 1936]libtech_709_footnote
 
 “He has discovered”, said Sir Chandrashekharan, introducing Dr. Rahm, “an insect that can live without food and water for 12 years, and has come to India for further researches in biology.”
 [GANDHIJI:] When you discover the secret at the back of it, please pass it on to me.
 [DR. RAHM:] But I am a scientist and a monk also, and when I decided to come to pay my respects to you, I thought of asking you a question or two. May I do so?
With pleasure.
 Dr. Rahm was perplexed by the many warring creeds in the world and wondered if there was no way of ending the conflict.
 It depends on Christians. If only they would make up their minds to unite with the others ! But they will not do so. Their solution is universal acceptance of Christianity as they believe it. An English friend has been at me for the past thirty years trying to persuade me that there is nothing but damnation in Hinduism and that I  must accept Christianity. When I was in jail I got, from separate sources, no less than three copies of the Life of Sister Therese, in the hope that I should follow her example and accept Jesus as the only begotten Son of God and my Saviour. I read the book prayerfully but I could not accept even St. Therese’s testimony for myself. I must say I have an open mind, if indeed at this stage and age of my life I can be said to
 
 have an open mind on this question. Anyway I claim to have an open mind in this sense that if things were to happen to me as they did to Saul before he became Paul, I should not hesitate to be converted.
 But today I rebel against orthodox Christianity, as I am convinced that it has distorted the message of Jesus. He was an Asiatic whose message was delivered through many media and when it had the backing of a Roman emperor it became an imperialist faith as it remains to this day. Of course there are noble but rare exceptions like Andrews and Elwin.libtech_710_footnotelibtech_711_footnoteBut the general trend is as I have indicated.
 There was held the other day in Bombay a parliament of religions. Now a positive bar to a real parliament of religions is the refusal to accept an equal basis and a mutual regard for one another’s faith. We must not forget that it is a parliament of religions, and not of a few religious-minded men. Did Christianity enter the parliament on a par with the others? When they do not do so openly, they secretly criticize us for our having many gods, forgetting that they have also many gods.
 Dr. Rahm was not perhaps perpared for this reply. He made no answer. He put another question in reply: “If we cannot unite, can’t we fight atheism which seems to be so much on the increase?”
 Sir. C.V. Raman put in: “I shall answer your question. If there is a God we must look for Him in the universe. If He is not there, He is not worth looking for. I am being looked upon in various quarters as an atheist, but I am not. The growing discoveries in the science of astronomy and physics seem to me to be further and further revelations of God. Mahatmaji, religions cannot unite. Science offers the best opportunity for a complete fellowship. All men of science are brothers.”
What about the converse? All who are not men of science are
not brothers?
 The distinguished physicist saw the joke and said: “But all can become men of science.”
You will have to present a  kalmalibtech_712_footnotelibtech_713_footnoteof science as Islam presents
 one.   “Science”, 	said Sir C.V. Raman, “is nothing but a search for truthtruth 	not 
  only 	in the physical world, but in the world of logic, psychology, 	behaviour and so on. The virtue of a truly scientific frame of mind 	is the readiness to reject what is false and untrue. It proclaims 	from the house-tops that there is no virtue in sticking to untruth. 	I think the latest biological discovery is that there is no 	fundamental     
 cleavage between the life of man and the life of the lower creation and that salvation lies in the perfection of the biological instinct for the perpetuation of race—the instinct to sacrifice the individual for the sake of the species.”

           MY 	DEAR IDIOT,       NANDI HILL,  May 	11, 1936 
  	I have just got your letter. We reached here yesterday safe and 	sound. It was Sunday and so though I thought of you, I dismissed the 	talk of a wire. Those who try to approach the villagers have to 	forget that there is such a thing as telegrams. A weekly post is all 	they have and often not even that. In Segaon there is supposed to be 	a weekly delivery but I am told the postman in Wardha hands the 	letters to any Segaon man whom he comes across and whom he trusts 	!!! Your 	letters are all torn [up] after I have read and answered them. I 	hope you got my letterlibtech_716_footnotelibtech_717_footnotewritten on the train in pencil hand. It 
 was 	posted at Madras. I 	walked up the hill from the base. It took me 2libtech_718_footnote   hours, the 
  	distance covered was over 5 miles. I walked very slow. Hence there 	was no fatigue. It was Dr. Ansari who wanted the Sardar to pass the 	summer on a hill. And he himself is no more. Evidently his death was 	quite sudden. For me it is a very personal loss. I relied upon his 	advice in so many matters.  	The pressure put upon you not to resist your nomination to the 	Jullunder Municipality, I quite understand. Idiots being honest 	people and therefore impartial, are always in demand. How could it 	be    
 otherwise—you, a princess among them—not the hereditary one but by right of merit.
 I do not mind your trying to make Simla less insanitary. Only don’t you catch the infection. Why don’t you move the Municipal Committee? Of course, what is true of Segaon and Sindi must be true of the black town of Simla. I suppose you know that the old Indian part of Madras is to this day called black town. It has not occurred to any of the city fathers to change that name, though they give patriotic names to some of their streets. We cannot all of a sudden develop sanitary habits because we heave up to Simla heights. But the M. Committee can, if it will, enforce proper sanitation. Many things are enforced over there. Sanitary enforcement will be least open to objection.
 Well, Nandi Hill is really a model of sanitation, of course enforced from above. The air is beautiful. The calmness is divine. Nolibtech_719_footnotecars or carts or even rickshaws. Only 30 families can live here comfortably. More are not allowed. I do not know a more secluded, cleaner, quieter hill. Sardar is in raptures over the stillness. I know you will love it, if you were here.
 Ku. reaches Wednesday. Love.

        NANDI 	HILL, 
     MY 	DEAR JAWAHARLAL,  May 	12, 1936 
  	The reason why I sent you my replylibtech_720_footnoteto Agatha was to know whether I had correctly 	represented your attitude.  	But I am glad you have gone for me instead. I am not guilty of 	‘supporting a system which involves a continuous and devastating 	class war’ or expressing approval of systems based essentially on  	himsa or ‘of criticizing and condemning people for more or 	less     
 minor faults and praising others who are guilty of far more important failings.’
 It is possible that I am unconsciously guilty of the things you seem to impute to me. If so, you should give me concrete instances. I have already admitted that my method of dealing with things is different from yours as I see it. But there is no difference whatsoever about looking at the existing system.
 Dr. Ansari’s death is a severe blow. For me it was infinitely more than a political friendship.
 I hope you are going to Khali or coming to me to breathe a little cool air.
 Please tell Sarup I had her two notes. I will write to Sir Tej. Love.

 But it is no good crying over spilt milk. What has happened has happened. From this incident too learn if you can a lesson in faith. Even now you are free to come if you want. Only remember this much, that if you come now, come in good faith. What good will it do if you come with a doubtful mind?

  	I send with this a cheque for Rs. 200 received from Sophia Wadialibtech_729_footnote. The receipt need not be sent to her. Send it to me.  	I understand what you say regarding Sastri. I enclose [a report of] 	the work done in Madras in four hours. Jagannathdas had arranged a 	prayer meeting in Kodambakkam, but I refused to go till an assurance 	was given that the institution would be continued. Jagannathdas gave 	the required assurance, which I send with this. Please preserve it. 	I met Pratapmalji also. He, too, has undertaken to solve the 	financial worries, but he asked for somebody who would be able to 	create there the atmosphere that we have in the Ashram. How can I 	find such a person? I met Venkatasubbiah here and discussed the 	problem with him. He and the others expressed their dislike of 	Sastri. Venkatasubbiah says, however, that they will do without 	Sastri and Ganesan. One of the four will visit the place daily by 	turns. This is what I have been able to do. Kindly write from there 	now and ask them clearly to relieve Ganesan. Sastri’s resignation 	has already been accepted. You can mention Jagannathdas’s letter 	and say that you hope that the four of them will carry on the work.  	Since Dr. Ansari had detained Amtussalaam  please accommodate her. 	Malkani, poor man, writes and tells me that he could not tolerate 	the thought that she had to leave because  of Rukmini. The latter 	does not tolerate anybody. But does that mean that  they  should  	all  leave?  I  have  written  a  strong  letterlibtech_730_footnoteto   her. Amtussalaam is not likely to pay 	attention to Rukmini’s words. She will remain happy if you go on 	giving her some work.  	I hope that your letters are opened before they are sent to you. If 	there is any cheque or such things in an envelope, they should not 	follow you from place to place.  	You, too, have been travelling a good deal. It seems you are 	becoming young again. If you share your experiences  with  the 	people, they will be of priceless value to them, Garhwal is a 	‘sealed

 CHI. KRISHNACHANDRA,
 My previous opinions have changed. In the past I insisted on eschewing quinine, etc., but now I do not. There is no harm in taking them as a temporary measure. We do not know all the natural cures and the ones that we know are not effective against all diseases. Neem leaves ought not to be shunned simply on account of their bitter taste; their efficacy is well known. Similarly, some qualities of tamarind also are universally acknowledged. However, there is no such rule that one or the other thing must prove beneficial to everyone. There is no reason, either, to believe that milk no more agrees with you because of the quinine. The rule about forgoing the morning meal [on the day] of the does not apply to those who do not take the evening meal. But you may discontinue the morning meal if it does not suit you. Nor do you need to make it a rule to have a weekly fast. In case of a feeling like indigestion you should of course abstain from food. It is good that the pain in your spine has disappeared. Yes, I do intend to settle in Segaon.

 SPINNERS’ WELFARElibtech_757_footnote
 
 A few points why Khadi Pratishthan, devoted to the khadi work in Bengal, should continue to give work (in a graduated higher scale of wages) to spinners and find sale for their products in conjunction with self-spinning work:
 Khadi 	is never meant to enter into competition with machine- (i.e., mill-) made 
  cloth.    Khadi 		represents ‘back to village’ cry. Village life means simplicity and freedom from contamination of urban  
  	‘civilized 	and refined’ mode of life, i.e., life represented by cinemas, 	race-gambling and other nonsensical things.   In 		the mills the workmen get higher wages, but they are converted into 		so many automata and drudges in the mill area. Half their wages 		again are consumed in drink and prostitution.  The 		poor women (generally widows) who ply the charkha and earn a bare 		pittance are thereby 		enabled to be self-supporting and not dependent on their male 		relatives who really sit idle and make the helpless women dependent on them work like   drudges 	and galley-slaves. Thus the latter are really freed from sweated 	labour.   Those 		who ply the charkha are seldom or never whole-time workers; only 		during the intervals of 		household duties they utilize their leisure hours. So it would be 		wrong to compare their off-time labour with that of the sweated 		labour of the mills.  In 		Bengal there is only one crop (the Aman Paddy) in most parts. That 		gives peasants occupation for barely three months in the year. Even 		where there is second crop 		which gives employment 		for a couple of extra months or so, for seven months they sit idle. 		Hence, if the people could be persuaded to ply the charkha, they 		would have a second occupation or another string to the bow. Thus 		during a failure of crop due to drought or flood (as is often the 		case in Bengal at any rate) plying the charkha would be a 		‘God-send’. The people won’t starve or be dependent on chance 		doles distributed in the relief centres.  The 		spinners are not the only people benefited; along with the spinners 		a large body of weavers find occupation; in fact, on week days 		(especially during the hat 		or village market 		days) the weavers in the khadi centres with their woven dhotis and     
 shirtings eagerly look for payment. Then other subsidiary artisans would be benefited, e.g., the village carpenters, etc., making charkhas.
  A 	unique experiment is going on in the Atral and Talora centres 	(visited by you in 	1925). After 12 years of hard labour, expenses, not to speak of the 	sacrifices of voluntary workers, at last we have got a body of 	willing ‘self-spinners’. I have myself watched with interest and 	joy how the women look forward to the saris, 	bodices, and chadars 	for children, 	supplied in exchange for the yarn

545,"October 11, 1935",A.I.S.A. RESOLUTION libtech_758_footnote,"
 [On or before October 11, 1935]
 
  This 	Council is of opinion that the wages now paid for spinning are 	inadequate, and therefore resolves that they be raised and a 	suitable standard be fixed so that spinners may at least receive a 	minimum wage calculated on the basis of eight hours’ efficient 	work, sufficient at least to procure clothing (20 yards per year) 	and maintenance in accordance with a scientifically prescribed scale 	of minimum food requirements. All concerned should try, as 	circumstances permit, for a progressive rise in the wages scale, so 	as to reach a standard enabling each spinning family to be properly 	maintained out of earning of its working members.  In 	order to guide the A.I.S.A. workers in the execution of the 	principle underlying the foregoing proposition, the following should 	be regarded by all branches and bodies, working in affiliation to or 	in any other way under the Association, as the settled policy of the 	Association until it is altered in the light of further experience 	by the Council: 
  The 	mission of the Association is to make every home in India 	selfsufficing through 	khadi with reference to its clothing requirements, and to promote 	the welfare of spinners who are the least paid among khadi artisans 	and all others engaged in the different cotton processes beginning 	with growing cotton and ending with weaving of khadi.  It 	is therefore imperative that those who work for the production of 	khadi, whether as artisans, sellers or otherwise, shall use khadi 	for their clothing requirements to the exclusion of every other kind 	of cloth. 
 
  All 	the branches and affiliated bodies shall so work the scheme as to 	avoid all losses, 	that is, so as to restrict their production to the demand within 	their own selected areas commencing with their immediate 	neighbourhood and never extending beyond their province except in so 	far as they are called upon by other provinces to meet the latter's 	demand.  In 	order to avoid surplus production, producers may restrict their 	operations only to those spinners who solely depend upon spinning 	for their daily bread for part of the year or the whole of it. 	Branches and other bodies shall maintain an accurate register of all 	the spinners and other artisans employed by them and shall deal 	directly with them. In order to ensure the use of the wages for 	clothing and food, a part or the whole of them may be paid in kind, 	i.e., khadi or other necessaries of life.  In 	order to avoid overlapping, undue competition, or duplicating of 	expenses where there are more khadi-producing organizations than 	one, the area of operation of each shall be previously defined. 	Private certified producers will not be encouraged by the 	Association. Among those that are already certified, those only who 	will work strictly under the same rules that govern the Association 	branches and take all risks without any prospect of recouping 	themselves from the Association will have their certificates renewed 	on the strict understanding that any breach of the rule that may be 	laid down from 	time to time or instructions given will involve automatic withdrawal 	of their certificates.  It 	should be understood that it is the primary and imperatiye duty of all organizations working 	under the Association to promote the scheme of self-sufficing khadi. 	Production of khadi for meeting the demand of cities or of 	khadi-wearers out-side cities who do not spin for themselves is a 	secondary or supplementary duty. No organization will be considered 	bound to produce or sell such khadi.

546,,FOR HINDUSTANI ONLY libtech_759_footnote,"
 That the Hindi-Urdu question is in imminent danger of becoming a communal issue is evident from the speech Mr. Purshottamdas Tandon delivered at the opening caremony of the Hindi Museum at Benares in the first week of this month. He declared that next to Chinese, Hindi was the most widely spoken language in Asia. This means, in other words, that the problem of a common language is solved; it is going to be Hindi, because Hindi is spoken by the majority of Indians. Those who clamour for Hindustani can be outnumbered, therefore they cannot matter. But the counting of heads is no more a remedy than breaking of heads. Whatever Mr. Tandon may have really meant, it seems to me that ground is being prepared for another such indignity as the Communal Award.
 It is only your prestige and the confidence inspired by your personality that can rescue us. I am giving below a number of points which in my humble opinion are rational in themselves and provide a sound basis for a common language. If you consider them and find them worthy, not in your own estimation only but also of the cause they are meant to serve, you may make them known to others. What I am dreaming of just now is that they might become the basis of a public pronouncement by you.
 The points are:
 That 	our common language shall be called ‘Hindustani’, not ‘Hindi’.  That 	Hindustani shall not be considered to have any peculiar association 	with the religious traditions of any community.  That 	the test of ‘foreign’ and ‘indigenous’ shall not be applied 	to any word, but only 	the test of currency.  That 	all words used by Hindu writers of Urdu and Muslim writers of Hindi 	shall be deemed current. This of course shall not apply to Urdu and 	Hindi as sectional languages.  That 	in the choice of technical terms, specially political terminology, 	no preference 	be given to Sanskrit terms as such, but as much room as possible be 	allowed for natural selection from among Urdu, Hindi and Sanskrit 	terms.  That 	the Devnagari and the Arabic scripts shall both be considered 	current and official, and that in all institutions whose policy is 	directed by the official promoters of Hindustani, facilities shall 	be provided for learning both scripts. 
 There may be friends to whom these suggestions will look like Muslim demands.
 
 They are not. But I know that unless an assurance of some such kind is given by you and the Parishad, there can be no question of Muslim literary effort being harnessed in the cause of a common language. So I have submitted these suggestions to you. If they are extravagant, I know you will pardon me, and if they are unjustified, they will not offend you. So far as I am concerned I have only wanted to do my duty, and to show, by an appeal to you, my unlimited respect for your judgment and my confidence in your deep feeling of justice and tolerance.

 "
547,,POPULARIZE HINDUSTANI libtech_760_footnote,"
 
 The All-India Hindi Sahitya Sammelan, the twenty-fifth session of which was held at Nagpur during the week-end, has two main objects before it: to develop Hindi literature and popularize Hindi throughout the country. We shall consider here the latter object mainly. The need for a national language is undeniable. That English cannot possibly be that language is equally undeniable. The popular form of Hindi or of Urdu, generally called Hindustani, has alone the prospect of being a perfect national language if earnest efforts are made to popularize this form in every possible way, particularly by developing Hindustani literature, that is to say, Hindi and Urdu literature without a large admixture of classical words.
 CALL IT HINDUSTANI
 
 Unfortunately, however, this national aim is not precisely understood. Many, who possess wrong notions of purity of language or literary elegance, persist in using too many classical expressions, the Hindus from Sanskrit and the Muslims from Persian and Arabic. Sometimes this tendency is deliberately fostered by communalists, whence has arisen the Hindi-Urdu controversy. Babu Rajendra Prasad much deplored this spirit of exclusiveness both because it hindered the growth of national language and because it widened the gulf between the authors and the common readers. He rightly commended the use of a simple language and at the same time urged the absorption of foreign words wherever necessary. He would have brought out his point more clearly if he had definitely suggested that the language which should be specially cultivated should be Hindustani. That is, we believe, the suggestion made by Gandhiji himself at the Nagpur Conference. The most effective way to end once for all the Hindi-Urdu controversy and to develop a national language is not only to propagate a simple or popular form of Hindi
 
 and Urdu but also to call that language Hindustani, which in fact is its most appropriate name. In order that much confusion and needless controversy regarding the respective claims of Hindi and Urdu may be avoided, may we suggest to the Congress President to issue definite instructions to all Congress organizations that the only national language to be recognized by them should be Hindustani and that Congressmen should not carry on propaganda in favour of either Urdu or Hndi being the national language?
 USE BOTH SCRIPTS
 
 The question of a common script for the national language has come very much to the fore during the last two years or so. Many suggest that the Nagari script should be the national one, with some improvements made therein, as it is the basis of the scripts of all the vernaculars derived from Sanskrit and, therefore, intelligible to a large majority of the people. A few have suggested the use of the Roman script, and the rumour was abroad some time ago that President Jawaharlal had supported it. He has now made it clear that, though he sees some advantage in it, he does not see any chance of its being adopted by any considerable community in the country. Even as regard the Nagari script there is not at present that consensus of opinion in its favour which can justify its exclusive adoption in writing Hindustani. Apart from this the claims of the Arabic script, which is being used in many Asiatic and African and even European countries as well as in India cannot lightly be ignored. In the circumstances the best immediate approach to the problem is for every Indian to learn both the Nagari and the Arabic scripts. That was Gandhiji's suggestion during the N.C.O. Movement and many national schools and colleges loyally followed it. We believe he has not changed his mind on this point.
