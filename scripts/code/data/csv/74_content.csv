 CHI. KRISHNACHANDRA,
 The tongue does not readily utter ‘tu’ libtech_2_footnoteaddressing the boys and ‘ tum’ libtech_3_footnoteaddressing the girls. It is something of a family tradition.
 Make any change you think necessary in your diet but never for the sake of taste. Instead, enjoy whatever you have to eat.
 It would be better not to accept anything even from your uncle. Do not discriminate between big and small books. It would be appropriate to give up collecting even books. Be content with the books available here.
 As you are not coming with me you have to draw your con- tentment from within yourself. Wherever I may be my home is here, is it not? This ought to suffice.

6,,CONGRESSMEN BEWARE !,"
       	I have been inundated with letters and wires complaining of what the 	senders have regarded as the Madras Premier’s terrible, mis- 	deeds. I pick out two which have been the subject of adverse comment 	in many quarters in India. They are his policy about Hindustani and 	his employment of the Criminal Law Amendment Act for abating the 	picketing nuisance.     
 My correspondents evidently think that I am the keeper of the Premier’s conscience and that I have but to send instructions and they will be obeyed. They know my relations with Rajagopalachari. But I am not the keeper of anybody’s conscience, much less of Rajaji’s. Let the reader share the secret with me that nobody among those who regard the Congress acceptance of truth and non-violence as the rule of their lives fights me as strenuously as he does. But he has one essential virtue of a soldier. I became my own general of satyagraha and my first recruit in 1906. When I announced my generalship in 1918 in India, Rajaji was among those who enlisted themselves at the very commencement. It was under his roof that the inspiration of the hartal of 6th April came to me. From that day to this his loyalty to his general has been beyond reproach or compare. And if as general I asked him to give up his premiership he would do so without demur. He may not even agree with my judgment. But in battle he knows that a private has no judgement but his general’s.
 But in spite of the exemplary loyalty that Rajaji gives me in common with many others, I will not issue the instructions my correspondents demand. Let the complainants know that we rarely correspond with each other. I know he has no time and he knows I have equally little for such correspondence. The law of satyagraha forbids such action. If he has to resign, he will do so in the constitutional manner. And there will be no fuss, no complaint. What is more to the point, I have boundless faith in his wisdom, his upright- ness, and his unsurpassed ability as a parliamentarian among Con- gressmen at least. He has to his credit no mean achievements. And those who think that he is wallowing in the constitution gutter are vastly mistaken. We have in our ranks no abler fighter in satyagraha. I see nothing wrong in a satyagrahi winning victories without bluster, without wrangling but by conversion, by carrying conviction. The world will perhaps never know what Congress Premiers have been doing by forcing conviction upon Governors. Rajaji has been in the forefront among these. The greater the peaceful penetration, the greater the virtue of satyagraha. There is little room for tamasha in a fight for truth with truth and nothing but truth.
 It hurts me, therefore, when Congressmen decry him and think that he is so enamoured of office that he is afraid to do the right thing. All Congress Ministers naturally come in for trenchant criticism from those who dislike Congress politics. Whatever is sound in such criticism must be accepted with gratefulness. There is criticism that springs from party motives. Even that has to be borne. But when Con-
 gressmen take up the same cry, it becomes embarrassing. They have their remedy. They can complain to their Provincial Committees, and failing redress they can go to the Working Committee and finally to the A.I.C.C. Surely there is no room for criticism if all these remedies fail. But my greatest complaint against these critics is that they are too hasty or too lazy to acquaint themselves with facts. There is no sin greater than ignorance. I see daily verification of this great saying.
 My first advice then is that my numerous correspondents and those who think like them should first study facts as Rajaji and his Cabinet see them. If then they are not satisfied, they should move for redress in the manner indicated by me.
 I can give no direct help. There are limitations to the use of my influence with Congressmen. My retirement does mean non- interference with individual Congressmen in the discharge of their daily duty and even with the Working Committee except when it seeks my help or advice. Thus when Dr. Khare came to me for guidance, I twice refused, saying that he should approach the Parliamentary Sub- committee. Shri Shukla and Mishra were in urgent need. But to them also I had to say the same thing as I said to Dr. Khare. If I do not observe these broad limitations, my retirement becomes meaningless. Indeed I do not follow the day-to-day doings of Congressmen now- adays, whereas when I was in the Working Committee nothing escaped me and I used to scan everything and give guidance in detail in so far as my health permitted. But now I do not even study all the resolu- tions of the Working Committee.
 Let me now say a word about the two main grievances against Rajaji.
 There is nothing wrong in making a knowledge of Hindustani compulsory, if we are sincere in our declarations that Hindustani is or is to be the Rashtrabhasha or the common medium of expression. Latin was and  probably  still  is  compulsory  in  English  schools.  The study did not interfere with the study of English. On the contrary English was enriched by a knowledge of the noble language. The cry of “mother tongue in danger” is either ignorant or hypocritical. And where it is sincere it speaks little for the patriotism of those who will grudge our children an hour per day for Hindustani. We must break through the provincial crust if we are to reach the core of all-India nationalism. Is India one country and one nation or many countries and many nations? Those who believe that it is one country must lend Rajaji their unstinted support. If he has not the people behind him, he
 will lose his job. But it is strange, if the people are not behind him, that he has his great majority with him. But what if he had not the majority behind him? He must give up office but not his deepest conviction. His majority is worth nothing if it does not represent the Congress will. The Congress is wedded not to a majority; it is wedded to all that which will make this nation great and independent in the least possible time.
 And the picketing? It is insufferable that youngsters or even grown-up people should assail homes and offices and howl unmen- tionable imprecations against those who are shouldering their burden amid the greatest difficulty. Until we have found the correct remedy in terms of satyagraha the Ministers must be permitted to deal with such offences in the manner they consider best. If they are not, the freedom that is possible under Congress Raj will soon dege-nerate into goondaism, pure and undefiled. That is the way not to salvation but it is the easiest road to perdition. And the Minister who is worth his salt will resolutely refuse to be a cause of the country’s perdition.
 Lastly, the Criminal Law Amendment Act. We may not make a fetish of Congress resolutions. The Congress has objection not to the name but to the contents of an Act going under that name, and then, too, not to every word or section of the Act. I have never studied it but I see from Rajaji’s public declarations that it contains a few sections which suit the new situation that the Congress is facing. If such is the case, Rajaji will be foolish if he does not make use of them. But he will be equally foolish, if not something worse, if he does not summarily repeal the obnoxious clauses of the Act without delay. It is a monster created by the fertile brain of the repressor of the country’s liberty. It was used as such against satyagrahis. The sooner, therefore, those clauses go the better for Rajaji and the country. But let Congressmen beware of hanging their trusted servants before they are tried and found wanting.

  	It is just now striking 9. Sushila has not returned and so I feel a 	little worried about your health. For the present let the post come 	unopened. You need not carry any load. I am thinking about future 	arrangements for  Harijan.  I am not at all worried. The 	Great Editorlibtech_7_footnotewill 	do whatever is necessary.  	I am having hearty talks with Mother.

As I see it she will not be 	at peace till Sushila goes to Delhi. It also seems to me that 	although Sushila’s heart is here, she cannot stay here in peace so 	long as  Mother is not at ease. And that is how it should be. 	Children can hardly find peace by making the parents miserable. That 	would re- quire a special reason involving a religious principle as 	it was in the case of Prahlad. Sushila does not have such a reason. 	My idea of Sushila’s good is irrelevant here. Hence I feel that 	Sushila must decide in favour of Delhi. Mother insists that I should 	send a letter to Sushila. So if you brother and sister agree with my 	view I shall send the letter.  	There is no cause for worry about my health. I shall take care of 	it. I certainly do not desire to end my life.  	Mahadev being an invalid I certainly wish to take work from you. But 	can you work like him in your present state of mind? I do not wish 	to burden you. At the same time, we have to decide what you should 	do when Mahadev recovers. If it is necessary for you to be in Delhi 	for the sake of the peace of mind of Sushila and Mother, you    
 must be there. It seems to me that none of us, especially I, have given any thought to Mother. Only this time I have been able somewhat to understand her. I can understand every feeling of hers and I appre- ciate it. Hence, from now on, in whatever I think about the two of you, I shall always keep in mind Mother’s feelings.
Do not hurt her feelings. Talk to her patiently and cheer her up.

 September 12, 1938
 I hear that the inmates of the Ashram have been complaining quite a lot about the way Sushilabehn serves me. One complaint is of partiality. The other is that I am crossing my limits. For instance, I lean on her shoulders while walking, which cannot be part of the service. Even when Krishnachandra is present I prefer Sushila’s shoul- ders to lean on. I let Sushila have her bath just when I am myself having my bath. And I cover myself with her sari when there is no need for it.
 I feel that those who have been talking in this way have betrayed me. It is the clear duty of those who have any grudge in this regard to tell me so at once.
 I have never been conscious of any sin in my physical con-tacts with women. That is why when I accepted service from Sushila, I did not want to exclude my leaning on her shoulders. l con-sider service from Sushila necessary for me if it is available. No one should have the slightest suspicion of partiality in this. I have an im-pression that I had made all this clear when I discussed this matter the last time.
 There are two new points. Why does Sushila have her bath in the same bathroom when I am lying in the bathtub? The suggestion was mine. I have to be in the bathtub for about 15 minutes. If she can get herself ready by that time, it is convenient to me and she can then have her meal early. The bathing arrangement is this: she bathes in the space behind the bathtub and while she is bathing I keep my eyes-tightly shut. I do not know the manner of her bathing—whether she bathes naked or with her underwear on. I can tell from the sound that she uses soap. I have seen no part of her body which everybody here will not have seen. What can be terrible is that she massages me while I am lying naked. So long as I have not become wholly free from passion I have to be very alert while I bear with that massage. In the hospital, an Englishwoman used to bathe me. She had to clean myprivate parts too. It never embarrassed me. For, I have a somewhat different conception of brahmacharya. It is not brahmacharya which cannot bear physical contact with women when it is called for. But this is a digression.
 
 Now about the sari. When I was returning after seeing the patients, I had on only my short dhoti. I felt cold. Therefore I used Sushila’s sari. I did the same thing on a rainy day. There was an umbrella too, but I did not use it. These things are natural with me and Sushila. Let no one complain against Sushila. She is grown up, but so far God has not made her experience passion. This is what she says and I take her at her word. I have been further convinced by many other instances of her behaviour. I know two other such girls. I have not come across a fourth in thousands.
 Now anyone who wants to say anything about this matter should write to me frankly. But no one must discuss the matter among themselves.
 This  must  be  returned  to  me  after  the  following   persons have read it: Pyarelal, Sushila, Chimanlal, Shakaribehn, Sharada, Vasu- mati, Sushila Gandhi, Manu, Kanubhai, Bhansali, Munnalal, Krishna- chandra, Sankaran, Chakraiya, Nanavati, Ba, Mirabehn, Raj-kumari, Amtussalaam, Balwant Singh, Panerkar, Parnerkar’s mother.

 You do sometimes talk as if you were a child without knowledge of the world.
 A common malady does not yield to heroic treatment. Concu- binage is a common malady. Only when women learn self-respect will concubinage go. In this both are equally guilty.
Congress can take up Hindu legislation up to a point.
 Unless you have some hard-working and learned women tackl- ing the problem there will be no solid legislation. I can  guide  a woman or women who have industry, ability and also faith in my ins- tinct. When it is optional, where is the harm? If a husband becomes a leper or contracts that vile disease due to his unfaithfulness,  why should the poor wife be condemned to live with him? You must not raise fine objections. I think infectious disease also should allow a woman. Why do you put an undue strain on either?

From 	a photostat of the Gujarati: S.N. 11647       SEGAON, WARDHA,  September 	13, 1938  DEAR 	KHWAJA SAHEB,  	I am thankful for your letterlibtech_12_footnotelibtech_13_footnoteof 	the 8th instant regarding the political convicts. Much as I should 	like, if only for the trouble you have taken in the matter, to fall 	in with your proposal, it would be a breach of faith on my part to 	do so. For, as you know, I am bound by  a solemn promise made to 	these friends when, at my instance, they suspended their 	hunger-strike. Consistently with that promise I have to make every 	reasonable attempt to secure their early release. This I cannot do 	if I identify myself with your proposal. I 	cannot agree with you that if you fixed a time-limit it would be     
 inconsistent with the reference of the very thing to a tribunal. Surely there is nothing inconsistent with such reference to say that you ex- pect the tribunal to regulate the dates of discharge within a parti-cular period. Under the terms of your reference the judges need never discharge a single prisoner if, in their opinion, the enormity of their crime did not merit any consideration. However theoretical my objec- tion may appear, it is impossible for me to run risks.
 Perhaps the Bengal Government and their advisers have missed one big factor in the consideration of the question of release. These prisoners have no sense of guilt. The crimes, however bad in them- selves, were not committed for personal gain. The prisoners, having changed their views on violence, feel their detention an intolerable hardship. They are fretting for public service. The public estimate also in this matter is of a different character from that of the Government. But since yours is admittedly a Government responsible to the people, you are bound to give considerable weight to public opinion which, so far as one can judge, emphatically demands their release.
 Though you have, and I admit properly, ruled out the idea of exploiting my influence with the prisoners and the public for the pre- servation of public peace, I urge that there is nothing  inherently  wrong in using it if there is a reasonable chance of its telling on the side of public peace. But I may not labour this point.
 For the considerations mentioned by me in this letter and in my previous letters and during the talks between ourselves and between your good self now and Subhas Babu who, in this matter, was acting as my representative, I must regretfully withhold co-operation from the Government in the projected scheme. But that does not in any way mean that I should obstruct you in your endeavour to accelerate the process of discharge. My action will largely depend upon the pace with which the discharges take place. My measuring rod will always be my letter of the 13th April, 1938.
 I trust that in the interest of the common cause the facilities for correspondence and interviews with prisoners which you have hitherto afforded me will be continued.
 I can have no objection to the correspondence that has taken place between us being published. I entertain the hope that this very important question will be kept by all concerned above party politics. I venture also to hope that the Press and the public will write or do
 nothing that may give a violent turn to the agitation that may become necessary to procure the prompt discharge of the prisoners.

25,"September 	13, 1938",LETTER TO MUNNALAL G. SHAH,"
  Narandas 	Gandhi       September 	13, 1938  CHI. 	MUNNALAL,  	With regard to your previous letter, since you had said you would be 	coming over I kept silent. The views that you have expressed are 	correct. As long as you do not hear the inner voice, you should come 	to no decision. You should, however, try very hard to come to a 	definite decision.  	I am not weak-minded in regard to my resolutions. My repu- tation is 	just the opposite of that. But when I myself have a doubt, a 	resolution made in the past cannot be regarded irrevocable. Whatever 	I did here was in the nature of an experiment and there are bound to 	be changes in an experiment. I had no misgiving about my behaviour 	because it was the result of fifty years of disciplined habit. I 	therefore felt that I should make no distinction between Matajilibtech_16_footnotelibtech_17_footnoteand 	Parnerkar’s mother. I have observed that my physical touch has 	some special effect on men and women. Mataji had been deeply pained 	on my account. I could remove her pain by putting my hand on her. I 	had not been able to go to see Parnerkar’s mother, but that is not 	because I did not care for her. As the treatment was being carried 	out under my supervision, I expressed my love for her by putting my 	hand on her and made her feel at once that I had not been 	indifferent to her.  	Is  there  danger  of my being   pierced with  Cupid’s  arrows in 	my letting myself be massaged naked, or in a thousand naked women 	bathing by my side when I am blind? I do feel afraid of my- self in 	letting the pure-minded Sushilabehn massage me. But if I am lying 	blind-folded and those two are bathing, I would feel no fear at    
 all. By all means let those who are as minutely scru-pulous as I am make themselves perfectly blind and permit some Rambhalibtech_18_footnoteto bathe near them. But anybody who lets himself be massaged is sure to be maligned. If he is sure of himself, however, let him by all means copy my example. I think I have replied to all your questions.

  	Shall we say you have a mania for work? That is why I had to write 	severely. We should admire the British in this respect. Don’t you 	know that if you were to be disabled, I would be a bird without 	wings? If you become bed-ridden, I would have to wind up 	three-fourths of my activities. Although I had not apprehended that 	you would fall ill, I had made up my mind as to what activities to 	curtail in case you were bed-ridden and had thus lightened my mind. 	But would not curtailing work in this manner be like a stab in my 	heart? So I wrote to you to take complete rest and recover fully 	soon. Follow me in the matter of hip-bath as much as you do in 	drinking milk. Surely taking hip-bath is not my sole prerogative.  	Sushila did not give Jivaraj’s letter to Shivdas. Now it is being 	sent with Shuaib.  	I sent the letter for Rishikesh directly with Radhakisan. Thus I do 	save your labour. The note about the letter was sent by  an  	oversight. 
 I wanted to send the telegram to Raja yesterday,  but  forgot about it, Here it is:

      CHI. 	PYARELAL,  September 	14, 1938 
  	I have already told you as well that Mother had placed the 	responsibility on me. I see therein her sincerity and efficiency. It 	also shows her faith in me. I must on my part shoulder the 	responsibility.  	As a result, I have started wondering whether Sushila should be 	sacrificed for the sake of serving me. It is an agonizing thought. 	Parents, even should they be on death-bed, get work from paid ser- 	vants rather than hinder the studies of their children. Should I do 	otherwise?  	I am afraid you too have been intoxicated by the idea of serving me. 	Hence, you have been deceiving yourself with regard to Mother’s 	state of mind. Mother has conveyed to me in clear terms that she 	wishes to see Sushila become a doctor. She must have a degree and 	also the financial benefit that the degree may bring. She tolerated 	a son becoming a fakir; she cannot the daughter too becoming a 	fakir. There is much weight in this argument. Moreover Sushila’s 	mind is oscillating between renunciation and pursuit of medical 	skill as the world sees it. You sowed the seed of renunciation in 	her. I watered it. In all this the only thing tying her to me is the 	personal service I take from her. Should I spoil her future by 	accepting her? I hold the view that it is in her interest to stay 	with me. It can hardly be that you agree with the view. Poor Mother 	is not even aware of it. Does Sushila’s boundless love for me 	stifle her? What can I decide in such a difficult situation? Think 	about it if you can. I 	shall keep you informed of whatever I write about Sushila.  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	the Gujarati original : Pyarelal Papers. Nehru Memorial Museum and 	Library.

  	I have sent the mail in the morning so today I was not in a hurry to 	send this. Important letters must be despatched. I understand about 	work. There is no objection to your working in moderation. Are you 	following Sushila’s instructions on walking about on the terrace 	twice a day?  	I have learnt a new thing from Durga: that the remedy for 	scorpion-sting is a bhajan. What kind of scorpion would it be 	that permits one to sing a bhajan? And what a singer she must 	be who can sing a bhajan despite the pain of a 	scorpion-sting?  	I did not ask Shuaib to post Jivaraj’s letter. He was to give it 	to you so that you could send it after affixing the late fee stamp. 	When two persons do a job which should be done by one, it is bound 	to be spoiled. I am making this criticism in order that you may have 	the benefit of our experience here.  	I remember to have sent you yesterday a telegram for Para- 	meshwaran. But the memory of a man of 69 cannot be very trust- 	worthy. On the back of one telegram a reply was written. The remain- 	ing were in a letter. Please do inquire.  	I understood from Sushila that what I had written in my letter to 	Jivaraj was what you desired.  	Behnji was not the cause of my circular. It was Mirabehn. That day 	she had lectured Pyarelal and Sushila. Though warned she had 	misunderstood Amtul Salaam. There was a violent quarrel. I, there- 	fore, thought that if I did not clarify things the poison would 	spread and so I sent round the circular. I see that most of the 	people here, poor fellows, know nothing. So my conclusion is that 	Mira was the sole cause of the ill-feeling which has been generated. 	That is part of her nature. What can we do about it? I will show you 	the circular as also the replies received. You need not worry about 	this matter. Des- pite such shocks, the blood-pressure seems to be 	behaving normally.  Blessings 	from  BAPU

 I gave a massage to Amtul Salaam for a few hours yesterday. If you too fall ill as a result of your foolhardiness I may have to give you a massage too, but it is hardly a very desirable thing. Amtul Salaam has many virtues but she is obstinate in an equal measure.

56,,THE STATES AND RESPONSIBILITY,"
       	The partial success of the people of Mysore, instead of libera- 	lizing the other States, seems, so far as one can conclude from 	known facts, to have stiffened them against the movement for 	internal respon- sible government. I have called the Mysore success 	only partial for nothing has yet been gained in substance by the 	people. The Maha- raja and his cultured Dewan have recognized the 	State Congress, they have instituted an impartial inquiry into the 	recent tragic happenings and appointed a Reforms Committee with 	ample powers. With pati- ence and reasonableness on the part of the 	Mysore State Congress and with real good will and understanding on 	the part of the Mysore Government, we may see a large measure of, if 	not full, responsibility in the government of Mysore.  	But the psychological effect of the Mysore events has been 	exceedingly great. The people of the States have begun to see a new 	vision of liberty. What seemed to them to be a distant goal  now 	appears to be an event to be realized almost in no time. I believe 	that     
 if the awakening among the people is genuine and widespread no repression can possibly stay their inevitable march to their cherished goal.
 I have said enough of the Travancore frightfulness. I can call it by no other name. Here is an extract from a letter from a Travan- corean whose testimony I have never had occasion to doubt. He says:
 A careful study of the Dewan’s statement shows that he is trying to cloud the issue and mislead outsiders who are not aware of the sequence of events that he narrates. Excepting the threats of ‘civil war’ alleged by the Dewan, all the other events or occurrences happened subsequent to the promulgation of the proclamation and the declaration of the State Congress as an illegal body. How post-war occurrences justify the war itself, it is difficult to understand.
 As regards the violence which we all deplore, the stone-throwing and the burning of buses are attributed to rowdies set up by the police according to one version; but without a thorough inquiry, which is impossible under the present circumstances, it is difficult to say what is the truth. Anyhow, do you not think that it is rather surprising that though all these occurrences took place in clear daylight and at meetings at which large numbers of police and military forces were present, it was not possible to prevent any of them or arrest a single one of the offenders? The explanation of the supporters of the State Congress is that the police dare not arrest any as they and their hirelings commit these atrocities. I cannot say how far the explanation can be accepted. A volunteer who was subjected to a severe lathi charge at the Quilon meeting says in an interview to the Hindu correspondent (published in The Hindu of 4th Sept.) that he saw with his own eyes some policemen throwing stones. Such allegations are generally made by the State Congress members. Meetings are being held and speeches made in all parts of the country but the arrests are very few. The present policy seems to be to disperse meetings by force. This leads to firing and death of innocent persons. After the Quilon meeting there was firing again at Puthupally, a village about five miles away from Kottayam. One or two died and some were wounded. The actual number is not yet known. All the provisions of the new Regulation are being openly disobeyed by the people. But the Government are not able to bring the offenders to book as there is only one jail in the State and that is already full.  If the Government desire to arrest and punish all the offenders, then they will have to build more jails as the number willing to  court  arrest  and imprisonment is very large already and is increasing day after day.
 And I am inundated with telegrams describing the fearful repression going on in several parts of Travancore. I do not ask that this testimony should be believed as against the State communiques. But I do suggest that there are, as usual, two sides to the question and that there is a strong case for an impartial inquiry.
 But whether there is an inquiry or not, the duty  of the Travancore State Congress is clear—on the one hand to see that there is no violence of any sort done by them or their sympathizers, and on the other to go on with their programme of direct action till the Travancore Government relent or the last member is accounted for.
 I should like here to state one limitation of ahimsa. If a wrongdoer banks upon the ahimsa of his victim and goes on heaping wrong upon wrong till every one of the victims is crushed, a cry from the surrounding atmosphere rises and the force of public opinion or the like overtakes the wrongdoer. But no satyagrahi should think that he has never to suffer unto death. His victory lies in the defiance by his unconquerable spirit of death and loss of property. The wrongdoer’s certain defeat lies in his utter failure to bend or break the spirit of his victim.
 If the States persist in their obstinacy and hug their ignorance of the awakening that has taken place throughout India, they are court- ing certain destruction. I claim to be a friend of the States. Their service has been a heirloom in my family for the past three genera- tions, if not longer. I am no blind worshipper of antiquity. But I am not ashamed of the heirloom. All the States may not live. The biggest ones can live only if they will recognize their limitations, become servants of their people, trustees of their welfare and depend for their existence not on arms, whether their own or British, but solely on the goodwill of their people. Frightfulness will feed the fire of violence that one feels smouldering everywhere. If the States are badly advised and they rely upon organized violence for resisting the just demands of their people, ahimsa, so far generated in the country as a means of redressing social injustice, will not protect them. If it had grown into a Himalayan oak, it would have passed any test however severe. But, sad to confess, it has not gone deep enough into the Indian soil.
 The Hyderabad communiques have therefore come upon me as a painful surprise. Sir Akbar is a great educationist. He is a philoso- pher. It was a pleasure to read his recent convocation address to the Dacca University. It is passing strange that he  should  have  lent himself to the reactionary declarations which condemn an organi- zation even before it has begun to function. What can be the meaning of communalism in a state which is overwhelmingly one population according to religion? What can communalism mean in, say, Kashmir or the Frontier where the population is predominantly of one faith? The doctrine of minority is a good hobby to ride up to a point. But it
 must be at least numerically a fair minority. Even a minority of one can expect perfect justice. But it has no status in the political field. When a person belonging to an insignificant minority mounts  to power he does so not as a represntative of his group but by sheer merit. The State Congress in Hyderabad can never be communal in the sense in which the word is understood in India. An institution in the Frontier Province need not be dubbed communal merely because it has no Hindu member. Of course an organization may be frankly communal in outlook. But the Hyderabad communiques make  a subtle distinction and aver that there is presence in the State Congress of persons predominantly communal in outlook. What is more, the State Congress has come out with a statement totally repudiating the suggestion of communalism.
 And then comes even the erstwhile progressive Rajkot, Only the other day it had a representative Assembly elected under universal suffrage, and it had complete liberty of speech under its late lamented ruler. One may hope that after the recent display (so far as I can see, wholly uncalled for) of force, the political organization of Rajkot will be not only permitted to function undisturbed but that its demands will be met in a spirit of justice.
 Whatever happens in the three States named or on any other, let the people of the States recognize that their salvation depends wholly on their own strength whose generation in turn depends upon an ex- hibition in action of complete non-violence and truth. They must realize that it is utterly impossible openly to organize along violent lines large masses of mankind deprived of arms and almost from time immemorial brought up as a non-military nation.

57,,ACCUMULATING EVIDENCE,"
  
 A man reaps as he sows. Having written on violence, I  am  getting evidence from all parts of India supporting my statement. The saddest case to come under my observation is that of a Congress Committee having incited the ryots of a zemindari simply to take possession of the lands of that zemindari. This act of spoliation was preceded by speeches of Congressmen reeking with violence. I sent the papers to Dr. Pattabhi Sitaramayya for investigation. He confirms generally the complaints made by my correspondent. I am hoping
 that the District Committee or the Provincial Committee will be able to right the wrong. Failing that, of course, Rajaji’s Government has to give redress. In saying this I do not wish to suggest that the land does not belong to the worker on it. I endorse the socialist theory of possession. But no socialist that I know has defended the usurpation practised in Andhra. If all the land in India is ever to belong to or be possessed by the worker alone, it would be either by a bloody revolution or by equitable legislation. It must be clear to every sane man that the act of confiscation will never last. Had it not been for the Congress Government, the spoliation could never have taken place. The Congress Government will dig its grave if it fails to restore the land to the legal possessor. I may add in parenthesis that the dis- possessed zemindar is reputed to be a docile man with pro-Congress tendencies.
 The other piece of evidence is choice cuttings from the U. P., C.
 P. and Bombay press. The singularity of the U. P. cuttings is that they contain incitement to violence in poems and prose. A lady writer waxes eloquent over the misdeeds of the zemindars and the wrongs of the kisans. She draws a terrible contrast between the opulence of the haves and the penury of the have-nots. Having prepared the ground she invites the kisans to a feast of blood and thunder. “Take any weapon you get hold of, strike and strike hard. Don’t be cowards. It is all yours and you must seize it by your powerful arms.” This is a mild rendering, all too brief, of the red original. Had not the lady’s name stared me in the face as writer, I would not have thought a daughter of India to be capable of incitement to such merciless violence. I must confess that even if I screwed myself up properly I could not fill the three columns that she has done with invective. If no one has had his head turned by the writing, it is certainly not her fault. Fortunately the millions to whom it is addressed cannot read.
 The C. P. and Bombay cuttings contain unthinkable  false- hoods. There is no restraint on the pen. No language is foul enough to blacken the character of persons. Some of the things said are patent inventions. The writings easily come under the law of libel. But what can libel proceedings do? They invite libel proceedings. These advertise the papers. Defence would be an additional opportunity for invention. There are veiled incitements too. And even without incite- ment, why should not youths reading the portraiture of persons in blackest colours take it into their heads to go and kill the ‘lepers’ described in the columns? To many, their newspapers are their Bible. They believe in them. And some of these papers are supposed to
 represent the Congress policy. The evil is on   the increase  during    the
 Congress regime. It is well that what was inside is now coming out. But this is not civil liberty; it is criminal licence. Swaraj will not come by way of falsehoods and violence. And we shall do a double wrong if we do all these things in the name of truth and non-violence. I adhere to the advice I have tendered to the Congress and Congressmen.

  	Where did you learn all this cunning? There are criticisms on three 	heads and still you say it was only for my information. What a way 	of putting things ! But you have the right to write whatever you 	like. Chimanlal had asked me whether or not to give you the figure. 	The expenses here are certainly on a royal scale. I could not 	preserve my health without that. The experiments in ghee, etc., also 	mean some expense. So the expenses here are not a standard for 	anybody to follow. If anyone were to tell me that friends give me 	money and I squander it I would listen and laugh. No doubt there is 	scope for im- provement but it can be effected only if I get a wise 	manager like you. But you are not going to stay here for ever. The 	figure was not given you so that you might pay the amount. You may 	pay only according to your capacity. I have already told you that I 	will not mind even if you do not pay. It would be better, however, 	to pay as long as you can afford.  	It would be  more  accurate  if  you  described me  as  lazy. Would 	you consider Chimanlal, Munnalal, Nanavati, Balwantsinha, Parnerkar, 	Kanu, Sharda and Shakaribehn lazy? The others are only staying 	there. Bhansalibhai certainly cannot be considered lazy. Kri- 	shnachandra is ill but otherwise he is a saintly person. Shankaran 	has to be trained up. I make do with whatever work Anand does. Even 	so, because of my incapacity I put up with some laxity. I have only 	mentioned the names that occurred to me. You may explain to me in 	greater detail giving particular names.  	You did not reply to me. There is no question of your forcing 	anything on me. In spite of my being not free from passion, do you 	and Manudi desire that I should let myself be ministered to by and 	should touch women? This question is an important one. Manudi will 	not understand it but you can. All of you can say: ‘So long as 	Bapu is not free from passion, let him be served only by Sushila and 	Ba.’ Or you can say: ‘When he puts the burden on us, we do wish 	that he would let us touch him. What effect can his passion have on 	us?’ Either stand can be justified. The first is safer from all 	points of view. In fine, the experiment which I had commenced with a 	particular aim 
 can be said to have ended, and I invite the views of you all regarding any new step I may take. I do not want to act in haste. I will do only what I can with objective detachment. I believe you to be wise. You are thoughtful. In such matters you can guide me as a woman. Please, therefore, give me your independent opinion.

66,"September 18, 1938",TO THE READERS,"
  
 [September 18, 1938]libtech_54_footnote
 The readers of Harijan will share my sorrow that Mahadev Desai has become very ill. Drs. Gilder and Jivaraj Mehta, who with their usual kindness came specially to examine him, have come to the conclusion that he must take prolonged rest. He has had the same warnings that I had. The doctors think that prolonged overwork has brought about the illness which, if neglected, may bring about paralysis of all activity. Let the numerous friends of Mahadev not be alarmed over the news of his illness. There is nothing to be alarmed about. Only nature has issued a stern warning which he and I may not disregard except at our cost. I include myself as an object of warning, for if I do not insist on Mahadev’s taking rest, he is quite capable of cheerfully taking his last breath with the pen in his hand. If I am wise and true, he will take the needed rest. Therefore, for the time being, the readers must miss the familiar and copious writings  over  the  initials M. D.
 I am writing this note during the small hours of Sunday mor- ning, having got up at 1.30 a. m. for finishing Harijan work. But I dare not repeat such liberty without the danger of a sudden collapse. I have only limited physical energy left in me. It has therefore to be sparingly used.
 The third person who can do Harijan work is Pyarelal. He has been hors de combat for some time and just now he is convalescing after the recent attack of enteric fever.
 Harijan is not a newspaper, it is a ‘views’-paper representing those of one man. Even Mahadev and Pyarelal may not write any- thing independently whilst I am alive. I am myself daily growing in the knowledge of satyagraha. I have no text-book to consult in time of need, not even the Gita which I have called my dictionary. Satya- graha as conceived by me is a science in the making. It may be that what I claim to be a science may prove to be no science at all and may well prove to be the musings and doings of a fool, if not a madman. It may be that what is true in satyagraha is as ancient as the hills. But it has not yet been acknowledged to be of any value in the solution of world problems or rather the one supreme problem of war. It may be
 
 that what is claimed to be new in it will be proved to be really of no value in terms of that supreme problem. It may be that what are claimed to be victories of satyagraha, i.e.,ahimsa, were in reality victo- ries not of truth and non-violence but of fear of violence.
 These possibilities have always been in front of me. I am helpless. All I present to the nation for adoption is an answer to prayer or, which is the same thing, constantly waiting on God. Such being the case, whilst I am alive Harijan can only be continued so long as I am able to write or Mahadev or Pyarelal can interpret me from week to week.
 The readers need not think that there are not others who can take the place of these two workers. There are. But they are all en- gaged in the respective tasks allotted to them and it would be wrong to remove them from their spheres of work. Satyagraha will not stop for want of Harijan, but it will for want of workers to carry on the mighty constructive programme.
 Therefore, whilst Mahadev’s illness lasts, the readers will over- look the gaps they will notice in the editing of Harijan. This illness in- duces a reflection. I have often expressed the opinion among friends that in the matter of capacity for detachment Englishmen are far in advance of us. No matter how important national affairs may be, they will keep their meal hours and hours of recreation. They are not unnerved in the face of dangers or impending calamity. This may be called working in the spirit of the Gita. Among the political workers in India there are very few who come up to the  Englishmen’s  standard.
 This English detachment is worthy of emulation. That it is used for the exploitation of the so-called uncivilized or semi-civilized races of the earth is another matter. It would be a distinct gain  to  the national cause if the leaders and workers strictly keep their hours. No man is expected to do more than he really can. If at the end of the day there is surplus work left or he cannot get through it without missing a meal or encroaching upon the hours of sleep or recreation, there is mismanagement somewhere. I have no doubt that if we cultivate the habit of punctuality and acting according to programme, the index of national efficiency will go up, our advance towards our goal will be repaid and the workers will be healthier and longer-lived.
 In conclusion, the readers and correspondents will extend their indulgence if they find, as they will more than heretofore, that they
 are not served in time or at all. The correspondence is increasing, the work to do is also on the increase. The capacity for coping with both is diminishing. God’s will be done.

However, I am patiently working at it and have not lost hope that they will be released before it is too late. I am well, considering the strain I am going through.

  	I stopped on the night of Saturday (17-9-38) the experiment 	involving physical contact with women that I had been carrying on. I 	had been thinking of it for some time but I was not able before that       
 date to come to a decision. That night, however, I had an experience that made me decide to discontinue it. While the experiment went on I had a certain freedom. But it has never been my luck to enjoy this kind of freedom. Now my responsibility increases.
 During the experiment I had the opportunity to do a great deal of thinking. I also had some new experiences. I will write about them if I get the time. Writing, however, is not so necessary. It may provide little guidance to others.
 I cannot say that I have become more  nirvikaralibtech_61_footnotelibtech_62_footnoteas a result of this experiment. Some friends had feared that it might result in adding to the vikaralibtech_63_footnotelibtech_64_footnotesince my mind would be perpetually occupied with the thing. Nothing of the sort has happened. It is not my habit to continue to brood over a decision I have taken. The decision works of itself. It is not a burden on the mind—it should not be.
 The stopping of the experiment does not mean that things will go on the way they did before. I cannot say that I shall remove myself somewhere.
 This, however, I can say that I will not deliberately renounce the service of the few sisters in the Ashram, sisters who are so close to me.  I shall take from them the service I require. I had never renounced such physical contact with them as I considered necessary for taking service from them. My practice of resting my hands on their shoul- ders will continue as before. The restriction that I had been observing during the period of the experiment will be slackened. What I wrote about it in Harijan stands as it should. No time limit had been set as regards this practice.
 I must add that in giving up this experiment I felt no joy. I gave it up out of a sense of dharma. I have however been able to discover that the harmless physical contact with women which was habitual with me over many years has not done any harm to my practice of brah- macharya. The imperfection of brahmacharya in me has some other cause. But, as is my nature, when a doubt arose in my mind regarding this it became necessary to make the experiment.

 One day I had a talk with Mother and then this letter began to take shape. Last night I came to the conclusion that if I did not write to you, I should be deceiving you.
I decided to write this yesterday because of Mahadev’s illness,
 If you can, you should work whole-heartedly for Harijan and [other] papers. For this to be possible there is something that needs tobe done. Mother said: “Marry Sharada to Pyarelal. She will agree if I persuade her. But you must take up this responsibility.” My imme- diate reaction was that I do not have that much influence over you these days. Still, should I not convey to you what appears to me in the best interest of you, me and many others? I spoke to Sharada. She is of course willing. I suggested to her that in that case she  should herself write to you. She said: “I do not know how to do it. You may write and I will sign. When I have placed myself in your hands, what is the difficulty?” Sharada does not seek to gratify any sensual desires. She is keen to serve. Seeing that you had suffered a terrible shock, Chimanlal thought of entrusting Sharada to you and, moved by a similar feeling, Sharada went along with the idea. Knowing you as I did, I dissuaded him. This of course you know. Now I am appro- aching you with a different motive altogether. Three or four different people were approached for Sharada. She was turned down because of her weak health. This quite shocked me. In such a state Mother’s suggestion was quite a help. It is our duty to accept the hand of someone whom nobody accepts. What does it matter that Sharada is weak of health? I do not consider her weak. I see many qualities in her. She wants a teacher for husband, somebody who will educate her at home. Such a husband should make her overcome her-desire to be a mother. If he does not do so she has the strength to remain calm.
 You will not be betraying Yoga by accepting the hand of a girl like Sharada. I have already suggested that the Yoga of your imagi- nation whom you have wedded remains what she is. Supposing that Yoga was named Sharada? But if that be not the case, you may not give Sharada a child. So long as you give her knowledge, you give her your love, she will be content. If you can understand this much, my
 task becomes easy. And the broken strings of your heart are made whole again. But if you are not convinced at heart, I would certainly not insist that you should abide by what I say.
 Sushila told me that the assurance I gave you at the time of your fast, which I later withdrew, had not become inoperative. I  have already written you to say that it no longer holds. If you wish you may pursue your fast under my supervision. So, this need not become a hindrance to your Harijan work.
 My statement that you and I had different ideas of dharma represented a conclusion drawn from your letter. My sending blessi- ngs to Yoga on her engagement distressed you. I feel it was my duty to bless her. I was under the impression that you had also taken the same view. I am not convinced in my heart that Panditjilibtech_65_footnotelibtech_66_footnoteor Laksh- mibehnlibtech_67_footnotelibtech_68_footnoteused coercion with Yoga. I did not simply follow the custom in sending my blessings.
 I shall not write anything more now. By accepting Sharada’s hand you will be bringing a cow home. It is just possible that she may turn out a Kamadhenu for all of us. I for one notice such qualities in Sharada. Do not refuse her hand.
 I am not able to break my silence. You have risen from the death-bed. It is a sign from God. You will have truly risen when you come out unscathed from the burning forest in which you are caught and make your full contribution to the yajna of non-violence. My silence will easily end if you accept my suggestion. Right now, it is a refuge for one distressed.

Pyarelal’s room is sufficiently bright. You should strip yourself 	there, plaster your body with mud and walk about for a while. Then 	when the mud is dry take a bath in the opposite room.

 CHI. BALWANTSINHA,
 You must have heard the story about the true mother and the false claimant. The false claimant agreed to having the baby cut up in two with one portion each being given to the two claimants. But the true mother told the judge that if that was the only way out she would withdraw her claim and let the other woman have the baby. It would at least be alive then. Now, let us see who proves to be the true go-sevak. Both of you may be such or both may turn out to be worthless or one true and one false. The problem thus poses three questions for me. Never say die.

Pancholi       [September 23, 1938]libtech_78_footnote  Mahatma 	Gandhi began by thanking the members for expressing their views on 	the questionnaire that he had written out in the last two days. He 	was sure that the members would have read his articles during the 	last two months in the Harijan 	on the increase of 	violence in the Congress organizations. He had thought over the 	subject very carefully.  First, 	said Mahatmaji, he had noticed that several Congressmen, who had      
 joined the Congress and signed the pledge without understanding or believing in the necessity for observing truth and non-violence as essential steps to achieve swaraj, had committed breaches of these two conditions. He had recently noted many Congressmen writing leaflets or making speeches in the name of civil liberty, inciting others to violence. Such speeches and writings, which were retarding the progress of the Congress towards its goal, should be stopped. The Working Committee could do it by defining civil liberty in a resolution. Any incitement to violence in the name of civil liberty should be treated as a breach of Congress discipline and as such severely dealt with by the disqualification of the guilty members from holding offices or posts of responsibility in the Congress. It was open to the Working Committee to accept his suggestion, but he would emphasize the strict enforcement of discipline in the ranks. He would go even to the length of expelling those who committed breaches of discipline from the Congress.
 Gandhiji continued that there should be no compromise with violence or untruth. The Congress today was actually manned by those who had lost faith in the creed of non-violence and the constructive programme of khaddar, [removal of] untouchability, prohibition and Hindu-Muslim unity. The real strength of the Congress depended on these twins, non-violence and constructive programme. When certain power was captured by Congressmen, there was an unhealthy competition to divide the spoils, which indicated that Congressmen were not able to digest power. This unseemly rush to capture committees by violence and corrupt methods would make swaraj a distant dream. This was not the way to win swaraj; this was not the way to work the office-acceptance programme. The ministries had been  accepted  by the Congress in a spirit of service. It was, therefore, necessary to apply the purge, as otherwise the Congress would collapse under its own weakness. Incitement to violence should be checked. Otherwise it would soon degenerate into undignified goondaism.
 So far as Congress organizations were concerned, Mahatma Gandhi suggested that only those who had been in the Congress registers for five years should be eligible to hold offices or posts of responsibility in the Congress. He is reported to have added that the yarn franchise which was abandoned in 1926 should be restored. All office-bearers in Congress organizations should annually contribute 5,000 yards of hand-spun yarn to the Congress. He would make yarn franchise a compulsory clause. He knew that it was found unworkable in 1926 by many Congressmen but he would not care for the volume of Congress membership. He would not mind a fall in membeship of the Congress. Ten thousand true and non-violent Congressmen could bring swaraj and work wonders rather than ten million Congressmen on the rolls committing violence.
 It had been argued, said Mahatma Gandhi, that Congress would cease to be a democratic organization and would be reduced to a closed corporation. Democracy, he said, would not live in the atmosphere of untruth and violence. It would flourish only if truth and non-violence existed. Congressmen should develop a higher degree of non-violence. The Provincial Ministers should soon develop peaceful methods of
 dealing with violence. The Peace Brigade was one of such methods. Until a correct remedy was found, the Ministers would be permitted to deal with offences in the manner they considered best, but they could not depend on the military to quell riots for long. If they were unable to establish peace by non-violent methods in the near future, they should resign their offices. The idea of the military was opposed to the Congress creed of non-violence and should be supplanted by stages.
 When asked how non-violence could check foreign aggression, Mahatma Gandhi is reported to have replied that if India had one crore  of  non-violent volunteers, he was confident that no nation could conquer India. If they failed in their attempt to prevent aggression, then the fault was theirs, not in the philosophy of non-violence but in their methods of practising it. Mahatma Gandhi was convinced that non-violence, if properly applied, could not only solve India’s problems but also the world’s.
 Gandhiji concluded that these were his views. The members could ponder over them and tell him whether they could accept and work them. If they were not in agreement with his views, they were at liberty to reject them.

 "
92,,CORRUPTION IN THE CONGRESS,"
  
 It is difficult to cope with the correspondence that I am having from several places about violence, untruth and corruption in the Congress. Whilst I must continue to publish typical correspondence about the weaknesses of Congresmen, I must issue a warning against hasty deduction being drawn that all is ill with the Congress. I know it is not. But it is true that violence, untruth and corruption have made inroads enough to warrant drastic measures in order to prevent decay overtaking the great organization.
Here are extracts from two typical letters :
  Perhaps 	you are aware how the 	enrolment of 	bogus Congress 	members is 	going on 	unimpeded everywhere, and 	how rich and 	unscrupulous persons 	are controlling 	the affairs 	of the 	Congress organization, 	keeping skilfully 	the genuine 	and devoted 	workers out of 	their way. 	Some are paying the 	membership subscription 	of annas 	4 for 	others under their 	control out of 	their own pockets, 	and some 	are going 	a step 	forward and 	are not paying a 	single pie 	to the 	Congress committees 	and instead 	making the 	primary committees 	under their clutches 	prepare false accounts of their 	apparent collections and 	thereby evading the 	supervising eye 	of the 	sub-divisional as 	well as 	district committees. 
 Primary committees having less than 25 members are not required, under the rules framed by it, to pay anything to higher committees out of the membership fee. The result is that a good many paper committees are being
 set up with less than 25 members to deprive the sub-divisional and district committees of their quota of the membership subscription as also to secure a larger proportion of representation in these Committees.
  It 	is my duty to 	bring to 	your notice the 	open and 	scandalous corruption 	in enrolling 	Congress members. The 	Congress authorities 	here, especially 	the Executives, 	know this state 	of things 	well, but it 	is difficult to 	know why the necessary 	steps are 	not being taken. If 	steps are 	not taken, things 	will go 	from bad to 	worse and the whole 	Congress institution will 	be disgraced 	and the hold 	on people 	will be lost.   Every 		party is 		trying to 		capture the Congress 		office—whether 		Primary, Sub-divisional, 		District or Provincial. 		And for this purpose 		bogus members 		are being 		enrolled by practically 		every group.  There 		are a 		good many names 		of persons 		on the 		Congress rolls, but 		on scrutiny it 		can be 		easily found out 		that there 		are no 		such persons in 		existence at 		all. During 		election time the same 		group of 		persons is 		mobilized at 		elections of 		primary Congress 		committees of different 		wards.  The 		members are 		enrolled sometimes 		without their own 		signatures on 		application forms and 		in most 		cases without taking payment of 		the annual 		subscription of 		four annas.  The 		question arises how 		the account of 		collection of 		subscription by 		the primary, 		sub-divisional and 		district Congress 		committees is 		maintained. In 		almost all 		cases where a group is in possession 		of  the  office  and 		necessarily the 		office account, 		collection of the 		annual subscription 		for all 		the bogus 		members is shown 		to the credit 		side, and at the same 		time nearly the whole 		amount is 		shown to 		the debit side on 		the different 		heads of 		expenses, such 		as travelling 		expense, meeting expense, allowance expense, etc. 		Really they do not collect the subscription and maintain a false account.  
 I do not know how all these corruptions can be stopped. There wil be, I hope, changes of rules at the next A. I. C. C. meeting at Delhi. Some steps should be immediately taken to stop the corruption. Identification of Congress members, signatures of the members on the application forms, actual realization of subscription from the members and true accounts should be enforced.
These statements have been made by responsible parties. The
 letters are meant for publication. But I have  purposely  suppressed the names of my correspondents as also of the province in which the corruption is said to exist.
 It is to be hoped that the Working Committee and the A. I. C. C. will deal with this as well as the other serious questions that will come
 up for discussion and decision. It would be a tragedy if the session of the A. I. C. C. were to be frittered away in orations or mutual wran- glings.

He then at great length stated the whole 	position and asked Gandhiji’s help. The first two paragraphs are 	in reply to that.  All 		I can 		say is that somehow or 		other the 		authorities should be 		made to 		see that in 		Seth Jamnalalji 		and Pandit 		Hiralal they have men 		who are true as steel 		and who believe 		in non-violence 		as their creed.  Surely 		it will be unwise to 		imprison them instead 		of  holding them 		as willing 		hostages for peace. 		To ban 		the Praja Mandal is 		to invite trouble where 		there is none today.   In 	reply to the first two paragraphs, Young said that there was no 	question of imprisoning anyone. That position had not yet arrived 	and he hoped that it would never arrive. To this Gandhiji replied in 	the third paragraph.   You 		will reach that 		stage in 		a moment, 		if you 		have an organization 		which is 		working 		[un]constitutionally 		and with 		which they are 		identified. I 		do not 		think they can surrender 		the right to 		agi- tate for 		responsible government. 		The authorities may 		or may 		 not  grant 		it. But they 		should not 		ban an activity 		which is 		in its nature 		peaceful. You 		may take all 		precautions to 		ensure peace.      
 In reply to this, Young pointed out the activities of the Mandal in enlisting Congress members. He said the Council had a suspicion that the Praja Mandal was only another name for the Congress and after having seen the disturbances in Travancore and Mysore, they were rather afraid of Congress creating trouble in Jaipur. Could not the Praja Mandal keep itself separate from the Congress? The fourth paragraph is in reply to that.
 You 	can’t prevent 	natural affinities. 	People are drawn 
 towards the Congress. You seek its assistance in order to promote peace as Sir Mirza did wisely and as Sir Akbar is already doing and Sir C. P. will do presently.
 In reply to this, Young said, “But what if they start trouble? If their consitution is something different, then there should be no difficulty in recognizing  it but with this constitution, if they start trouble, peace might be disturbed.” The penultimate and the last paragraph are in reply to this.
  You 	can ask them to meet 	you a long 	way as to how 	they should shape their 	activity. You stifle 	opinion if you 	say they may 	not even 	ask for responsible 	government. You should 	shed the fear of 	the Congress.  What 	I have 	suggested is 	this. Don’t interfere 	with their 	objective but 	regulate the 	speed with 	which they 	move. You 	may, for instance, 	regulate the 	demonstrative part of 	their programme. You 	will control 	their language. But 	to ask 	them to change 	their objective is 	like asking a 	man to 	change his religion. 
 In the end, Mr. Young profusely thanked Gandhiji and made a request for taking the notes with him as a sort of souvenir to which Gandhiji agreed subject to his being provided with a copy of the same. The last three lines are in reply to my question whether Sir Akbar had already written for help and whether C. P. also had applied for help.
I whould like you to give me a copy of the notes.
I have Sir Akbar’s letter asking for help.
 More than a hope. He has wired to Pattabhi asking him to meet him. (This is about C. P.)

FOR A. I.
C. C.libtech_85_footnote","
       [On 	or before September 	26, 1938]  	The A. I. C. C. notes with sorrow and dismay the repression that has 	been going on in Travancore for some days. The evidence that has 	come to the Congress office, if it is to be believed, goes to show 	that the movement led by the State Congress in Travancore is 	strictly constitutional and for a constitutional purpose, viz., 	attainment of res- ponsible government under the aegis of His 	Highness the Maharaja. The repudiation published on behalf of the 	State is categorically con- tradicted by the spokesmen of the Stage 	Congress.  	In the circumstances the A. I. C. C. recommends to the Travan- core 	Government for adoption the following policy, viz., assurance on the 	one hand that the State Congress is free to carry on the movement 	for responsible government in a constitutional manner; appointment 	of a commitee containing, among others, representatives of the State 	Congress to explore the possibility of granting responsible govern- 	ment, and an inquiry conducted by a jurist outside the State of 	unim- peachable impartiality into the recent happenings including  	the charges made by the State of provocations justifying the State 	mea-    
 sures including firing on unarmed people resulting in deaths and inju- ries, and an amnesty to the prisoners.
 The A. I. C. C. regrets that the Hyderabad State has issued ordinances which appear to give to the State power  altogether  in excess of requirements.
 The A. I. C. C. has also received complaints of severe repression in the States like Dhenkanal, Talchar and Kashmir. In all these cases the people of the States have appealed to the Congress for advice, guidance and help.
 The A. I. C. C. can but reiterate its policy of non-interference, and, consistently with the resources, to help the people in every way open to the Congress. The policy of non-interference is an admission of the limitations of the Congress. The Congess policy has been one of friendliness to the States. In spite of the declarations of some Con- gressmen to the contrary, the corporate policy of the Congress, so long as it holds by truth and non-violence, must be one of continuous attempt to convert the Princes to the view that their true welfare con- sists in a voluntary surrender of power to the people so as to bring them in a line with the people of the so-called British India, consis- tently with the existence of the constitutional heads of the respective States.

         CHI. 	PYARELAL,     September 	26, 1938 
  	I am quite perturbed by your letter. Of course, the perturbance is 	now gradually diminishing. My interpretation of your letter is that 	you want to say no but have no courage to say no. So you are plan- 	ning to write a long letter. Why should I place such a burden on 	you?  I certainly do not want to force you. Moreover, where is the 	question of coercion in such matters?  	Hence I take your letter to mean that you are unable to agree to my 	proposal. Mother has expressed to me, in a few words, her distress. 	It is an unbearable thought that I should be instrumental inbringing 	about your ruin and now Sushila’s ruin. It is comforting that 	whether happy or unhappy, Sushila remains engrossed in her studies 	and in the hospital work. Hence, if my impression is correct that 	you are 
 unable to accept Sharada’s hand, then it is also your view that my duty is to give up Sushila’s services. Do not misunderstand me. I cannot think of anything else. My heart cries when I look at Sushila. How can I bear to see her life being ruined at my hands?
 If your life can be rebuilt Sushila’s life will be rebuilt too. In that case, am I not solely responsible for her? She too would want to live with us. Mother would be satisfied. But I see darkness all round if your life is not rebuilt. But what can you do about it? Nothing can be achieved by unnatural means. No good can come of it. You will understand the reason for my haste.
 This would mean that Sushila should be free here. I should take possession of my own body. Till Mahadev is ready, you should look after my physical needs and his work in the Frontier [Province] and elsewhere. This much is not beyond your capacity. Once Mahadev is all right, whatever is to be done will be done. There is talk going on about Swami and Chandrashankar. In my view that is not at all right.

113,,FEDERATION,"
       	A well-known correspondent tells me that in London the common talk 	is that Gandhi counts for everything and it does not matter what the 	Congress or Congressmen may say or do. The critics embellish the 	statement by saying that there is a wide difference of opinion 	between Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and myself, and that while he will 	not touch Federation with a pair of tongs, I am prepared to submit 	to it if some trifles are conceded. I have paraphrased in my own 	words a longish letterlibtech_87_footnotegiving details which I may not share with the readers 	at least at the present juncture.  	Evidently my critics know more of me than I seem to know myself. For 	instance I know how little I count among Congressmen; the critics 	know how much I count among them. Whatever influence I still possess 	among Congressmen is solely due to my constant appeal to reason and 	never to authority. But if I had the influence the critics attribute 	to me, I make bold to say that India would have gained her 	independence long ago and there would be no repression that is going 	on unchecked in some of the States. I know the art of winning inde- 	pendence and stopping the frightfulness of which one reads in the 	papers. If I had my way with the Congressmen, there would be no 	corruption, no untruth and no violence amongst them. If I had my way 	with them, they would all be enthusiastic khaddarites and there 	would be no surplus khadi in the A.I.S.A. bhandars.  	But I am going astray. I had intended to write about Federation. In 	the first place, in all my talks, which have been very few, I have 	made it clear that I represent nobody and that I have not even aired 	my views to any Congressman. I have also made it clear that what the 	Congress says and does is of consequence, whatever I may say is of 	no value unless it represents the Congress view. As a matter of 	fact, too, I have said that the Congress will never have Federation 	forced upon it, and that there was no hope of peace in India till 	there was indepen-    
 dence in virtue of a constitution framed by a duly convened Constituent Assembly. I have also made it clear that so far as Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and I are concerned, though we may talk  in  different language, we are one in most things that matter to India. On the question of Federation there never has been any difference of opinion between us. And I have made a rule for myself that so far as the Congress in concerned, if there is an unbridgeable gulf between him and me his view should prevail. And this for the very good reason that I am not in the Congress and he is in the centre of it, and very much in touch with everything relating to the Congress.

114,,NON-INTERVENTION,"
  
 Congress non-intervention in the affairs of the States was con- ceived in 1920 and has been more or less its policy since that time in spite of many onslaughts made on it. But I see that it has become the fashion in the States to quote against the Congress and Congressmen the self-imposed restraint even when there is any attempt to criticize or offer advice or help. It is therefore necessary to examine the impli- cations of non-intervention. It was never regarded as a principle. It was a limitation imposed on itself by the Congress for its own sake and that of the people of the States. The Congress had no sanction behind its resolutions regarding the States. Its advice might  be  ignored, its intervention resented and the people of the States might be harassed without gaining anything. There was certainly a friendly motive behind that policy. It was a wise recognition of the limited capacity of the Congress for doing good. The restraint exercised by the Congress in this and many other ways has given it a prestige and power which it would be unwise for it not to use. Any hesitation in this respect would be like that of the foolish steward who would not use the talents which were placed at his disposal. Up to a point the States are beginning to recognize the power of the Congress be it ever so reluctantly. It is becoming sufficiently clear that the people of the States are looking to the Congress for guidance and help. I think that it is the duty of the Congress to give them the guidance and help wherever it can. I wish I could convince every Congressman that the prestige and power of the Congress are in exact proportion to its inner purity, its sense of exact justice and its all-round goodwill. If the
 people of the States feel safe in entrusting their welfare to the Con- gress, the Princes should feel equally safe in trusting the Congress. All the prestige built up by patient effort of years will certainly be under- mined if the warnings uttered by me to the Congressmen go un- heeded.
 Even at the risk of tiresome repetition let me say to the people of the States that they must not set much store by the Congress help. It is not enough that they are truthful and non-violent. It is necessary also for them to know their own capacity for suffering. Liberty is a dame exacting a heavy price from her wooers. And unless there are many who are prepared to pay the price, the few enthusiasts that are to be found everywhere would do well to conserve their energy. They will do well to undertake constructive service of the people without having an ambitious political programme. The ability to gain political ends will surely come from constructive service. Wisdom and patience will give them a power which in time will become irresistible.

117,"October 3, 1938",STATEMENT TO THE PRESS,"
  
 October 3, 1938 Correspondents have been writing and wiring to me about the events in Travancorelibtech_90_footnote. Shri Changanacheri K. Parameswaran Pillai has
 been specially to see me and acquaint me with the situation. He has erred in giving his version of my talk with him. Whilst the situation remains delicate, every word has to be weighed before it is uttered. Shri Pillai was clear that mob violence in the shape of stone-throwing had occured. He, however, made it perfectly clear that the State Congress people had no part in it and that it was contrary to their wish. I have wires denying mob violence and definitely saying that violence was instigated by agents provocateurs. I am unable to decide between the two opposite versions. But I can say this that satyagraha demands extraordinary caution, even to the extent of suspension of civil disobedience, if the resisters have not full control over forces of violence.
 What exactly should be done I cannot advise from this distance. The responsibility for right decision must be shouldered by local leaders. In coming to their decision they will remember that any the slightest deviation from truth and non-violence, whether in themselves or by connivance in others, is bound to  affect  the  movement adversely.
As   to   the   charges   against   the   Dewan,   I   telegraphedlibtech_91_footnotelibtech_92_footnotethe
 
 imprisoned leaders who were responsible for making them. This is their reply:
 Your kind telegram advising withdrawal of the State Congress memorandum. We consulted T. M. Verghese and others. The Working Committee feels satisfied that the Dewan’s continuance in office is detrimental to the people’s interests. The withdrawal of the memorandum may unmeritedly discredit the State Congress and cause an irretrievable setback to the movement. Pray for support and guidance.
 I appreciate the spirit behind the reply. The leaders would be lowered in my estimation if, for the sake of purchasing their liberty, they withdrew the charges. But if the conviction has gone home that in a demand for responsible government such charges could have only a subordinate place, if any at all, and if they saw with me that persistence in them, especially without the ability to prove them, can but seriously harm the movement, it is their clear duty to withdraw the charges and thus free the movement of the initial blunder and handicap. There is no discredit greater than the refusal to acknowledge errors.
 I have wires alleging tortures by the authorities. It is hard to believe them. I hope they are baseless, and if isolated cases have happened, I should hope that the Travancore Government will prevent any future recurrence.
 I observe that the movement promises to be protracted if only because of violence, whether spontaneous though unconnected with the Congress, or engineered as alleged. I can only entertain the hope that the authorities will relent and magnanimously allow the move- ment to run its course without the ban which I consider to be wholly unnecessary. A movement in itself wholly noble, which claims cul- tured men and women as willing and enthusiastic sufferers, should be fostered. It can never be crushed.

132,"October 4, 1938",STATEMENT TO THE PRESS,"
  
 October 4, 1938 I should have given my opinion on the Bengal Government’s communiquelibtech_107_footnotelibtech_108_footnoteon the question of the release of the political convicts
earlier. But pressure of work made it physically impossible for me to
 do so. Though the Bengal Government have not seen their way to accede to my proposal contained in my letterlibtech_109_footnoteof 13th April last, I gratefully recognize that from their own standpoint they have endeavoured to make an approach to the letter of 13th April.
 But having paid this tribute to the Bengal Government I must say that their rejection of my proposal is a severe disapointment to me. For I claim that my proposal was made after considering and weighing the Bengal Government’s difficulties. The decision seems to me to be due to their failure to recognize three factors.
 However reprehensible the crimes committed by the prisoners were, there can be no doubt that the crimes were not a result of personal or selfish motive, the motive behind them was purely political.
 Whatever the limitations of the Government of India Act, it has transferred power to a parliament responsible to the people and elec- ted under a fairly wide franchise. Apart, therefore, from the decla- rations of non-violence made by the prisoners, the transfer of power to a popularly elected legislature takes the ground from under the feet of the advocates of terrorism.
 In as much as the Congress has chosen to enter the legislatures and even to accept ministerial responsibility, Congressmen are bound to examine the possibilities of the machinery to respond to the popular will. In this particular instance, as we have seen in what may
 
 be described as Congress provinces, the Provincial Governments have been able to release political prisoners. What has been possible in these provinces is possible in Bengal, if the popular will is sufficiently expressed.
 The third factor is the Bengal Government’s reference to the existence of the two well-known parties connected with terrorist methods. The reference seems to suggest that these parties function for their original purpose. I know, and I had given the Khwaja Saheb the required assurance, that the organizations no longer functioned in the old way. Comrades belonging to groups do not change names of their groups or loyalties because the methods which the labels origi- nally stood for have become obsolete. I would, however, advise amalgamation and the use of another name for the combination, if they must preserve their separate status.
 Not only have the Bengal Government failed to take any or adequate notice of these three factors, they have failed to give due weight to the positive assurances of non-violence given by the priso- ners, which those who have been discharged seem to have carried out faithfully.
 I therefore renew my appeal to the Bengal Government to respond to my proposal of 13th April, and release all the prisoners by 13th April, 1939. I do not mind what procedure they wish to adopt. They can have the committee announced by them and through it regulate the dates of discharge of the prisoners. One thing, so far as I am concerned, is undoubtedly common cause if there is to be a com- plete clearance, viz., that the atmosphere of non-violence is retained and that those who are discharged carry out the self-imposed obli- gation about non-violence.
 I would appeal to the Press and the public to restrain them-selves in their criticism of the action of the Bengal  Government  in  the  matter and not embarrass them by bitter criticism.
 It must be said to the credit of the Bengal Government that they have certainly not treated it as a party question. Though the release is an integral part of the Congress programme only, it has more or less become an all parties’ question. And I have no doubt that the quickest method of securing early release is never to allow the question to become a party question.
 I would appeal to the prisoners not to be  disturbed  by  the Bengal Government’s communique. Having been myself a prisoner over half a dozen times under varying circumstances, I know how apart from the hardships of jail life, the uncertainty of his fate gnaws
 into a prisoner’s whole being especially when he is fretting to go out and serve. But I would ask them to treat 13th April or thereabouts as still the last date of their discharge. It is contrary to my nature to import ‘thereabouts’ in fixing time-tables, but the prisoner friends should extend to me the concession due to old age and its physical limitations. I can give this assurance that ‘thereabouts’ does not mean years. It can only refer to months. They will please remember that they will hamper the effort of those who are trying to secure their release by resort to hunger-strike. I have given them myself as a hostage. So long as there is life in me, I hope by God’s grace to stand by my promise not to relax the effort to secure their discharge. There is no rest for me till every one of the prisoners is discharged. They nobly responded to my call for an assurance of non-violence. I will keep my faith.
 Some of my correspondents seem to think that I can work wonders. Let me say as a devotee of truth that I have no such gift. All the power I may have comes from God. But He does not work directly. He works through his numberless agencies. In this case it is the Congress. All the prestige that I have is derived from that of the Congress. The latter derives it from its creed. If Congressmen deny the creed of truth and non-violence, the Congress loses prestige. I assure them that my virtues, real or so called, will not count for anything, if I did not represent the Congress mind.
 Friends of prisoners outside Bengal and sometimes the priso- ners themselves write to me complaining that I confine my attention only to the Bengal prisoners. In a way this is true. I am bound to them by a written contract. But in another way it is not true. I do interest myself in their discharge also. But the full suceess depends largely upon what happens in Bengal. Let them, however, know that  my efforts for their release continue, even apart from the Bengal priso- ners.

           DEAR 	FRIEND,     ON THE WAY TO PESHAWAR,  October 	5, 1938 
  	I am working under great difficulty. Even this I am writing on the 	train taking me [to] Peshawar. Of 	course you will publish the correspondence between us 
 whenever you think it necessary.
 Your latest letter shows that you are on the wrong track. I am not partial to Rajaji. But I know that he is as firm on untouchability as  I am myself. I must therefore trust his judgment as to how to do the thing. From this distance I can’t judge his action.
 Do you not see that the whole of the movement is one of conversion of the sanatani heart? You cannot force the pace except  to the extent that reformers immolate themselves. This  process  is going on vigorously.
 This temple-entry question is a mighty religious reform. I would like you to apply your religious mind to it if you will give your whole-hearted support to Rajaji and make his move a  thorough success.
 Yours sincerely,

Dakshina Bharat Hindi Prachar Sabha has no right to change its 	object. If it exercises that right, its spiritual connection with 	the central institution must also end.

It is also not correct that I have been gradually leaving off the 	use of the word ‘Hindi’. The Congress cannot use any other word. 	But I do not believe that a Congressman working in another 	institution cannot do so.  	I will think about writing when I get the resolutions of the con- 	ference.

D. Satavlekar       	The walk-out at the last A.I.C.C. meeting of the opponents of the 	Civil Liberties Resolutionlibtech_111_footnotewas an unfortunate and hasty act. What was their 	protest against? I understand the President went out of his way to 	let them make as many and as long speeches as they liked. Therefore 	the protest was against the majority refusing to accept amendments 	which cut at the root of the resolution which was re- garded as 	vital to the existence of the Congress in its present form.     
 The walk-out has served one good purpose. It has brought out in clear light the fact that the Congress is not today the homogeneous body it used to be. It has members and parties who have no faith in its creed or its constructive programme, specially khadi and prohibition.
 In these circumstances the Congress must cease to be a compact fighting organization engaged in a life-and-death struggle against the most experienced and organized corporation in the world. It has been since 1920 like an army in action having one will, one policy, one aim and exact discipline. All this must go if the protesters can have their own way. In the first place there can be no amendment of or protest against accepted policies. But even if such is permissible, there should be perfect and willing obedience after the rejection of amendments and protests. Opposition in the Congress is not to be compared to the opposition, say, in the Central Assembly. There the opposition has little in common with the Government. In the Congress there can only be those who willingly and whole-heartedly subscribe to its creed. Those who do not want independence cannot become its memebrs nor can those who do not believe in truth and non-violence, khadi or communal unity or total abolition of untouchability among Hindus or total prohibition of drink and intoxicating drugs.
 It is up to those who do not believe in the fundamental policy of the Congress seriously to consider whether they would not serve the Congress and the country better by remaining outside the Congress and converting the people to their view of conducting the campaign rather than by remaining within and obstructing those who do not see eye to eye with them and yet are in the unfortunate position of having the majority on their side. It is equally the duty of the majority to consider how best to deal with those who will resort to obstructive tactics. My opinion based on experience is that if, after a friendly discussion with the obstructionists (if the use of that word is permissible to describe them), it is found that they believe it to be their duty to continue obstruction, it would conduce to the good of the country to hand over the reins to the minority and themselves follow the existing Congress programme without using the Congress name. All this can succeed beyond expectations if it is done without huff, without malice, without bitterness, and merely to meet a situation that is becoming impossible.
 If chaos is to be prevented, proper measures must be taken in
 time.   PESHAWAR, 	October 5, 1938  Harijan, 	15-10-1938

143,"October 6, 1938",IF I WERE A CZECH,"
       	If I have called the arrangement with Herr Hitler “peace without 	honour”, it was not to cast any reflection on British or French 	statesmen. I have no doubt that Mr. Chamberlain could not think of 	anything better. He knew his nation’s limitations. He wanted to 	avoid war, if it could be avoided at all. Short of going to war, he 	pulled his full weight in favour of the Czechs. That it could not 	save honour was no fault of his. It would be so evey time there is a 	struggle with Herr Hitler or Signor Mussolini.  	It cannot be otherwise. Democracy dreads to spill blood. The 	philosophy for which the two dictators stand calls it cowardice to 	shrink from carnage. They exhaust the resources of poetic art in 	order to glorify organized murder. There is no humbug about their 	word or deed. They are ever ready for war. There is nobody in 	Germany or Italy to cross their path. Their word is law.  	It is different with Mr. Chamberlain or M. Daladierlibtech_112_footnote. They have their Parliaments and Chambers to please. 	They have parties to confer with. They cannot maintain themselves on 	a perpetual war footing if their language is to have a democratic 	accent about it.  	Science of war leads one to dictatorship pure and simple.  Science 	of non-violence can alone lead one to pure democracy. Eng- land, 	France and America have to make their choice. That is the challenge 	of the two dictators.    
 Russia is out of the picture just now. Russia has a dictator who dreams of peace and thinks he will wade to it through a sea of blood. No one can say what Russian dictatorship will mean to the world.
 It was necessary to give this  introduction  to  what  I  want  to  say to the Czechs and through them to all those nationalities which are called ‘small’ or ‘weak’. I want to speak to the Czechs because their plight moved me to the point of physical and mental distress and  I felt that it would be cowardice on my part not to share with them the thoughts that were welling up within me. It is clear that the small nations must either come or be ready to come under the protection of the dictators or be a constant menace to the peace of Europe. In spite of all the goodwill in the world England and France cannot save them. Their intervention can only mean bloodshed and destruction such as has never been seen before. If I were a Czech, therefore, I would free these two nations from the obligation to defend my country. And yet  I must live. I would not be a vassal to any nation or body. I must have absolute independence or perish. To seek to win in a clash of arms would be pure bravado. Not so, if in defying the might of one who would deprive me of my independence I refuse to obey his will and perish unarmed in the attempt. In so doing, though I lose the body, I save my soul, i.e., my honour.
 This inglorious peace should be my opportunity. I must live down the humiliation and gain real independence.
 But, says a comforter, ‘Hitler knows no pity.  Your  spiritual effort will avail nothing before him.’
 My answer is, ‘You may be right. History has no record of a nation having adopted non-violent resistance. If Hitler is unaffected by my suffering, it does not matter. For I shall have lost nothing worth [preserving]. My honour is the only thing worth preserving. That is independent of Hitler’s pity. But as a believer in non-violence, I may not limit its possibilities. Hitherto he and his likes have built upon their invariable experience that men yield to force. Unarmed men, women and children offering non-violent resistance without any bitterness in them will be a novel experience for them. Who can dare say that it is not in their nature to respond to the higher and finer forces? They have the same soul that I have.’
 But says another comforter, ‘What you say is all right for you. But how do you expect your people to respond to the novel call? They are trained to fight. In personal bravery they are second to none
 in the world. For you now to ask them to throw away their arms and be trained for non-violent resistance, seems to me to be  a  vain attempt.’
 ‘You may be right. But I have a call I must answer. I must deliver my message to my people. This humiliation has sunk too deep in me to remain without an outlet. I, at least, must act up to the light that has dawned on me.’
 This is how I should, I believe, act if I was a Czech. When I first launched out on satyagraha, I had no companion. We were thirteen thousand men, women and children against a whole nation capable of crushing the existence out of us. I did not know who would listen to me. It all came as in a flash. All the 13,000 did not fight. Many fell back. But the honour of the nation was saved. New history was written by the South African Satyagraha.
 A more apposite instance, perhaps, is that of Khan Saheb Abdul Ghaffar Khan, the servant of God as he calls himself, the pride of Afghan as the Pathans delight to call him. He is sitting in front of me as I pen these lines. He has made several thousands of his people throw down their arms. He thinks he has imbibed the lesson of non- violence. He is not sure of his people. Elsewhere I reproduce the pledge that his soldiers of peace make. I have come to the Frontier Province, or rather he has brought me, to see with my own eyes what his men here are doing. I can say in advance and at once that these men know very little of non-violence. All the treasure they have on earth is their faith in their leader. I do not cite these soldiers of peace as at all a finished illustration. I cite them as an honest attempt being made by a soldier to convert fellow soldiers to the ways of peace. I can testify that it is an honest attempt, and whether in the end it succeeds or fails, it will have its lessons for satyagrahis of the future. My purpose will be fulfilled if I succeed in reaching these men’s hearts and making them see that if their non-violence does not make them feel much braver than the possession of arms and the ability to use them they must give up their non-violence which is another name for cowardice, and resume their arms which there is nothing but their own will to prevent them from taking back.
 I present Dr. Beneslibtech_113_footnotewith a weapon not of the weak but of the brave. There is no bravery greater than a resolute refusal to bend the knee to an earthly power, no matter how great, and that without
 
 bitterness of spirit and in the fulness of faith that the spirit alone lives, nothing else does.

  From 	the original: C.W. 3637. Courtesy: Amrit Kaur. Also G.N. 6446      A 	Travancore headmaster of a high school writes:  You 	know the political atmosphere of Travancore is very unhappy just at 	present. Even high School pupils are going on strike and picketing 	others. There is feeling among pupils that you are in favour of 	‘students’ strikes’ and even ‘pupils’ strikes’. I would 	like to get a communication addressed to pupils in general about 	your opinion on the matter. It will clarify the situation. I 	 think I  have written often enough against strikes by students  	and pupils except on the rarest of occasions. I hold it to be quite 	wrong on the part of students and pupils to take part in political 	demonstrations and party politics. Such ferment interferes with 	serious study and unfits students for solid work as future citizens. 	There is one thing, however, for which it is the duty of students 	and pupils to strike. I have received a letter from the Hon. 	Secretary, Youths’Wel- fare Association, Lahore, giving copious 	specimens of obscene and erotic passages from the text-books 	prescribed by various universi- ties. They make sickening reading. 	Though they are from prescribed 
 text-books, I would not soil these columns with a reproduction of the extracts. I have never come across such filth in all the literature that I have read. The extracts are impartially given both [sic] from Sanskrit, Persian and Hindi poets. My attention was first drawn to such writings by the girls of Mahila Ashram, Wardha, and recently by my daughter- in-lawlibtech_114_footnotewho is studying in the Kanya Gurukul at Dehra Dun. Though she is not illiterate, she had never come across such obscenity as she found in some of her text-books. She appealed to me for assistance. I have been moving the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan authorities. But big institutions move slowly. Monopolies grow up. Self-interest of authors and publishers prevents reform. The altar of literature claims incense. My daughter-in-law suggested, and I at once fell in with her sugges- tion, that she would risk failure at her examination and omit to learn the obscene or erotic passages. This is a mild strike on her part, but a quite good and wholly effective one for herself. But this is an occa- sion which not only justifies a strrike on the part of students and pupils, it is in my opinion their duty to rise in revolt against such lite- rature being forced on them.
 It is one thing to defend the liberty to read what one likes. But it is a wholly different thing to force on young minds acquaintance with literature that cannot but excite their animal passions and an un- healthy curiosity about things which, in due course and to the extent necessary, they are bound to learn. The evil becomes accentuated when it comes in the guise of innocent literature bearing the impri- matur of great universities.
 An orderly strike on the part of students is the quickest way of bringing about the much-needed reform. Such a strike would not be boisterous. It would simply consist in the students notifying boycott of examinations which require a study of objectionable literature. It is the duty of every pure-minded student to rebel against obscenity.
 The Association asks me to appeal to the Congress Ministers to take such steps as may be possible to remove text-books or passages which are objectionable. I gladly make the appeal hereby not only to them but [to] the Education Ministers in all the provinces. Surely all are equally interested in the healthy growth of the student mind.

146,"October 7, 1938",UNCERTIFIED KHADI,"
  
 Reports have come to me showing that even responsible Con- gressmen use khadi that is sold in uncertified bhandars. No khadi is guaranteed pure that is sold in uncertified stores of which unfor- tunately there is quite a number, and which has increased since the phenomenal rise given by the A.I.S.A. in the wages of spinners.
 It is not often that workers get better wages without asking. And when that happens enough unscrupulous persons will be found who will exploit the poverty or ignorance of the workers, pay them the old low wages, and sell their manufactures at prices lower than those charged under the raised rate of wages. Then again, cloth is sold under the name of khadi which has its warp made of mill-spun yarn. Pure khadi is that khadi which is hand-woven out of hand-spun yarn and for which wages have been paid according to the A.I.S.A. scale. Such khadi can be had only at certified stores.
 Unfortunately Congressmen, out of ignorance or because they do not believe in khadi, buy cheap cloth for make-believe at the uncertified stores and thus thwart the Congress policy about khadi and, to the extent of their purchase, defraud the spinners of the rise in the wages. Let the public realize that every rise in the price of khadi means at least that much more paid to the spinner, I use ‘at least’ advisedly. For the whole of the rise in wages in not charged to the buyers.
 Those Congress leaders who open khadi stores without refe- rence to the A.I.S.A. or without being asked by it, certainly harm their own institution, encourage fraud and violate the Congress policy; whereas it should be the duty and pride of every Congressman to help in every way the effort of the A.I.S.A. to better the lot of the most helpless of humanity.

147,"October 7, 1938",SEVEN COMPLAINTS,"
  
A Muslim friend writes:
 You will be pained to hear that in my province the matters have gone from bad to worse. The Muslims are extremely agitated and invite your immediate attention. A Council of Action is formed and we desire to take a leaf from your own book of truth and non-violence.
  The 	Government is 	persisting in 	the Vidya Mandir 	Scheme.  Mother 	tongue is defined 	as mother 	tongue of the 	area—which is 	divided into 	Hindi and Marathi—thus excluding Urdu.  Urdu 	schools used to be 	inspected by 	Urdu Inspectorate alone; 	the system 	is discontinued.  My 	amendment to include Urdu or Hindustani in the recognized languages 	of the Assembly is turned down.  My 	University Bill demanding 	representation for 	Muslims and 	Depressed Classes 	in the university 	is turned down.  Hon’ble 	Biyani held 	a conference in Chandur in Berar where his 	 procession was 	taken with music past a 	mosque during Juma 	prayers and the flag 	was worshipped.  Your 	title as Mahatma 	is officially 	recognized by a 	Government circular, 	your birthday declared as 	a holiday, and 	consequently the 	Local Board in 	Amraoti has 	issued orders to 	take your image in 	a procession and 	to worship your image. 	Gandhiji, you 	may permit me 	to say, we 	are not idolatrous 	and we 	do not recognize 	you as 	Mahatma or our religious 	and political leader. 
 Whatever the nature of the complaints, if the correspondent and his followers pursue the path of truth and non-violence. all will be well, and it will be found at the end of the contemplated action that both the parties have come closer together and that the cobwebs of misunderstanding have all been removed.
 As to the complaints, I must warn the correspondent and others who expect the impossible from me that while I am ever ready to use whatever influence I may possess for the promotion of good and goodwill, I have grave limitations. I could not live for two days if I shouldered the burden of investigating every complaint against every Congress Minister. For that purpose there is the Parliamentary Sub- Committee created by the Working Committee.
But I can say generally about the complaints as follows:
  I 	see nothing 	wrong in 	the scheme 	as far 	as I 	know. I 	know that the name 	‘mandir’ has 	been objected to 	by some 	Muslims. Shuklaji 	has made it 	plain that if 	Muslim boys 	or their 	parents object 	to attend 	the schools 	merely because they are 	called Vidya Mandirs, it 	would be 	open to 	them to 	attend schools which 	will bear an 	Arabic name. 	But surely 	this is a 	matter for 	adjustment. The 	word ‘mandir’ 	has no 	exclusive religious 	significance. When it 	has and qualifying 	adjective it 	simply means a 	house. Nor 	is such use rare. I do not know what actually has been done. But the mother 
 tongue of an area is surely the tongue which the inhabitants generally speak.
  If 	Urdu inspectors 	have been 	discontinued because 	they know only Urdu, on the face of it, it seems to be wrong.  As 	to the amendment 	about the recognition 	of Urdu 	or Hindustani, 	I do not know 	the merits. The 	same is 	true of 	the Bill.  If 	music was 	played before 	the mosque 	whilst the Juma prayers 	were being said, it 	was certainly 	wrong. But I 	will want very 	strong proof to 	support the allegation.  This 	is a 	complaint and 	an assertion. 	With both I 	am in hearty 	concurrence. It 	was wrong 	to give 	‘Mahatma’ official 	recog- nition. 	I registered 	my protest 	as soon 	as it was 	brought to 	my notice.  I 	would support any 	movement to 	drop altogether 	the use of 	the word 	‘Mahatma’ before 	my name. 	My simple 	name sounds sweet without 	the adjective. 	The latter 	often stinks 	as when 	it is applied 	to promote 	violence or 	untruth, smoking 	or drinking 	or the 	sale  of  spurious 	khadi. To 	declare my 	birthday a 	holiday should be 	classified as 	a cognizable offence. 	The only use of 	my birthday that 	I have 	approved of 	is intensive spinning or 	some such national 	service. That day must 	be all 	work and 	no play. 	I cannot 	imagine any 	Local Board being so 	foolish as 	to issue orders to 	take my 	image in 	procession and 	worship it. 	I am 	hoping that 	my correspondent 	was wholly 	misinformed. I 	should imagine that the 	issue of 	such orders would be 	illegal. As 	to the 	assertion and 	repudiation, I 	tender my 	congratulations to my 	correspondent for them, 	for I 	have never aspired after 	leadership whether 	religious or political.

Courtesy : 	Nehru Memorial Museum and Library         	One must feel happy that the danger of war has been averted for the 	time being. Is the price paid likely to be too great? Is it likely 	that honour has been sold? Is it a triumph of organized violence? 	Has Herr Hitler discovered a new technique of organizing violence 	which enables him to gain his end without shedding blood? I do not 	profess to known European politics. But it does appear to me that 	small nationalities cannot exist in Europe with their heads erect. 	They must be absorbed by their larger neighbours. They must become 	vassals.  	Europe has sold her soul for the sake of a seven days’ earthly 	existence. The peace Europe gained at Munich is a triumph of vio- 	lence; it is also its defeat. If England and France were sure of 	victory, they would certainly have fulfilled their duty of saving 	Czecho- slovakia or of dying with it. But they quailed before the 	combined violence of Germany and Italy. But what have Germany and 	Italy gained? Have they added anything to the moral wealth of 	mankind?  	In penning these lines my concern is not with  the  great  powers. 	Their height dazes me. Czechoslovakia has a lesson for me and us in 	India. The Czechs could not have done anything else when they found 	themselves deserted by their two powerful allies. And yet I have the 	hardihood to say that if they had known the use of non- violence as 	a weapon for the defence of national honour, they would have faced 	the whole might of Germany with that of Italy thrown 
 in. They would have spared England and France the humiliation of suing for a peace which was no peace; and to save their honour they would have died to a man without shedding the blood of the robber.  I must refuse to think that such heroism, or call it restraint, is beyond human nature. Human nature will only find itself when it fully realizes that to be human it has to cease to be beastly or brutal. Though we have the human form, without the attainment of the virtue of non- violence we still share the qualities of our remote reputed ancestor, the orang-outang.
 These are not idle words I am writing. Let the Czechs know that the Working Committee wrung itself with pain while their doom was being decided.libtech_119_footnotelibtech_120_footnoteThe   pain  was  quite  selfish  in  a  way.  But  on  that account it was the more real. For though numerically we are a big nation, in terms of Europe, i.e., in terms of organized  scientific violence, we are smaller than Czechoslovakia. Our liberty is not merely threatened, we are fighting to regain it. The Czechs are fully armed; we are wholly unarmed. And so the  Committee  sat  to deliberate what its duty was by the Czechs, what part the Congress was to play if the war cloud burst on us. Were we to bargain with England for our liberty and appear to befriend Czechoslovakia, or were we to live up to the creed of non-violence and say in the hour of trial for afflicted humanity that, consistently with our creed, we could not associate ourselves with war even though it might ostensibly be for the defence of Czechoslovakia whose very existence was threatened for no fault of hers, or for the only fault that she was too small to defend hereslf single-handed? The Working Committee had almost come to the conclusion that it would deny itself the opportunity of striking a bargain with England but would make its contribution to the world peace, to the defence of Czechoslovakia and to India’s freedom by declaring to the world by its action that the way to peace with honour did not lie through the mutual slaughter of the innocents, but that it
 
 “The Working Committee sends its profound sympathy to the brave people of Czechoslovakia in their struggle to preserve their freedom. Being themselves engaged in a war—non-violent but none the less grim and exacting—against the greatest Imperialist Power on earth, India cannot but be deeply interested in the protection of Czechoslovak freedom. The committee hopes that the better part of humanity will still assert itself and save humanity from the impending catastrophe.”
 lay only and truly through the practice of organized non-violence even unto death.
 And this was but the logical and natural step the Working Committee could have taken, if it was to prove true to its creed. If India could gain her freedom through non-violence, as Congressmen are to believe they can, she could also defend her freedom by the same means, and hence a fortiori could a smaller nation like Czecho- slovakia.
 I do not know what actually the Working Committe would have done if the war had come. But the war is only postponed. During the breathing time, I present the way of non-violence for acceptance by the Czechs. They do not yet know what is in store for them. They can lose nothing by trying the way of non-violence. The fate of Republican Spain is hanging in the balance. So is that of China. If in the end they all lose, they will do so not because their cause is not just, but because they are less skilled in the science of destruction or  because they are undermanned. What would Republican Spain gain if it had Franco’s resources, or China if she had Japan’s skill in war, or the Czechs if they had the skill of Herr Hitler? I suggest that if it is brave, as it is, to die to a man fighting against odds, it is braver still to refuse to fight and yet to refuse to yield to the usurper. If death is a certainty in either case, is it not nobler to die with the breast bared to the enemy without malice against him within?

  	I am glad my wire went to you before your letter and wire came into 	my hands.  	I offer no apology for not telling you anything about the clo- sing 	of the experimentlibtech_121_footnote. 	I had prepared you for it. And then I wrote a notelibtech_122_footnoteannouncing the termination. There was no desire to 	keep it from you. A copy of the note herewith. Mahadev may not have 	it handy. He must read it to you, if you can’t. It is Kanu’s 	hand.  	No apology either for suppressing Mahadev’s letter. Mahadev had 	guessed (wrongly) that something which I forget had happened on the 	basis of your talk with him. As it had not, and as Mahadev had told 	me not to deliver it to you if his guess was wrong, I did the right 	thing. It would have been wrong on my part even to have mentioned 	the thing to you and taken your time [and] my time for nothing. 	Supposing somebody swears at you thinking that you had been pain- 	ting your face every day, I would correct the person but would cer- 	tainly not feel the call [sic] that that person had done you 	an unin- tentional wrong. Now you understand, I hope. I won’t ask 	for your apology.  	I have never enjoyed so much rest as Khan Saheb gives me. No 	visitors, no talks practically even on slips of paper. The result is 	I have been able without effort to write five articles for Harijan.  	You will give me your reaction to the articles on the European 	situation.  	Your estimate of N. N. Joshi is correct. He prevaricates without 	knowing that he is doing so. But he is a good worker. This 	tour has taught me one lesson. I must not put such heavy     
 burdens on you. What I had hoped would be a light thing evidently was a serious drain on your energy. I hope that you will soon regain your lost health such as it is.
 I know that Mahadev & Co. will flourish under your grand- motherly care. I was anxious for M. to accept your invitation. And Shummy is there—first class for such occasions. I shall look forward to your daily bulletin.
 We are flourishing. There is no cold yet. I have never been so fit as I have felt latterly. There is an interruption because the old devil in the shape of animal passion is at me. When he assails me, I do feel worried. But the thing will wear away. So you see the most relevant thing I do share with you. But you are not to disturb yourself over this. It worries without disturbing me or making me morose. I seek the presence of God.
Love.

 Gandhiji told them that though it sounded to him as an overbold statement for them to make, still, as was his wont, he would take them at their word.libtech_125_footnoteHe explained  to them in detail what his conception of the nature and implications of non-violence was. It was comparatively easy to maintain a passive sort of non-violence, when the opponent was powerful and fully armed. But would they remain non-violent in their dealings amongst themselves and with their own countrymen, when there was no extraneous force to restrain or check them? Again, was theirs the non-violence of the strong or that of the weak? If theirs was the non-violence of the strong, they should feel the stronger for their renunciation of the sword. But if that was not the case with them, it was better for them to resume their weapons which they had of their own free will discarded. For it was much better for them to be brave soldiers in arms than to be disarmed and emasculated. He remarked:
 A charge has been levelled against me and Badshah Khan that we are rendering India and Islam a disservice by presenting the gospel of non-violence to the brave and warlike people of the Frontier. They say that I have come here to sap your strength. The Frontier Province, they say, is the bastion of Islam in India, the Pathans are past masters in the use of the sword and the rifle and mine is an attempt to emasculate them by making them renounce their arms and thus undermine the citadel of the strength and security of Islam. I wholly repudiate the charge. My faith is that by adopting the doctrine of
 
 non-violence in its entirety you will be rendering a lasting service to India and to Islam which, just now, it seems to me, is in danger. If you have understood the power of non-violence, you ought to feel the stronger for having put away your arms. Yours will be the spiritual strength with which you can not only protect Islam but even other religions. But if you have not understood the secret of this strength, if as a result of renouncing arms you feel weaker instead of stronger than before, it would be better for you to give up the profession of non-violence. I cannot bear to see a single Pathan turn weak or cowardly under my influence. Rather than that I would that you returned to your arms with a vengeance.
 Today the Sikhs say that if they give up the kirpan they give up everything. They seem to have made the kirpan into their religion. By discarding it, they think, they will become weak and cowardly. I tell them, that is an idle fear and I am here to tell you the same. I have read the Koran with as much care and reverence as I have read the Gita. I have read other important books on Islam too. I claim to have as much regard in my heart for Islam and other religions as for my own, and I dare say with all the emphasis that I can command that although the sword has been wielded in the history of Islam and that too in the name of religion, Islam was not founded by the sword nor was its spread due to it. Similarly in Christianity the sword has been freely used. But the spread of Christianity was not due to its use. On the contrary, the use of the sword has only tarnished its fair name. Millions in Europe swear by Christianity. But contrary to the tea- chings of Jesus, they are engaged in a fratricidal orgy of bloodshed and murder, which is a negation of true Christianity. If you can assimilate what I have been telling you, your influence will travel far and beyond your borders and you will show the way to Europe.
 Today a force of 17,000 British soldiers is able to rule over us because they have behind them the power of the British Government. If Khudai Khidmatgars really felt within themselves the upsurge of soul force as a sequel to their renouncing arms, not even  17,000 would be needed to win India her freedom, because they should have the strength of God behind them. As against it if a million of them professed non-violence while there was violence lurking in their  hearts, they would count as nothing. You should renounce the sword because you have realized that it is the symbol not of your strength but of your weakness, because it does not make for true bravery. But
 if you put away your sword outwardly but there is the sword in your hearts, you shall have begun the wrong way and your renunciation will be devoid of any merit. It may even prove dangerous.
What is the meaning of eradicating violence from the heart?
 He next asked and proceeded to explain that it meant not merely the ability to control one’s anger but its complete eradication from the heart.
If a dacoit inspires anger or fear in my heart, it means that I
 have not yet purged myself of violence. To realize non-violence means to feel within you its strength, otherwise known as soul force, in short, to know God. A person who has known God will be incapable of feeling or harbouring anger or fear within him, no matter how overpowering the cause for it may be.

 [On or before October 15, 1938]libtech_126_footnote
 A Khudai Khidmatgar, Gandhiji told them at one place, had first to be a man of God, i. e., a servant of humanity. It would demand of him purity in deed, word and thought and ceaseless, honest industry, since purity of mind and idleness are incompatible. They should, therefore, learn some handicraft which  they could  practise in their homes. This should preferably be ginning, spinning and weaving as these alone could be offered to millions and in their own homes.
 A person who renounces the sword dare not remain idle for a single minute. An idle man’s brain, as the popular proverb says, is the devil’s workshop. Idleness corrodes the soul and intellect both. A person who has renounced violence will take the name of God with every breath and do his work all the twenty-four hours. There will be no room for an idle thought.
 Moreover, every Khudai Khidmatgar must have an independent means of livelihood. Today many of you have land, but your land can be taken away from you, not your craft or your manual skill. It is true that God provides to His servant his daily bread but only if  he performs bread labour. If you work not, neither shall you eat, is nature’s law and should be yours too. You have adopted red shirts as your uniform. I had hoped you would have adopted khadi too which is the livery of freedom. But I see that very few among you wear
 
 khadi. The reason perhaps is that you have to provide your own uni- form and khadi is dearer. That would not be so if you spin for your- self.
 They should further, he told them, learn Hindustani, as that would enable them to cultivate and enlarge their minds and bring them in touch with the wider world. It was up to them also to learn the rudiments of the science of sanitation and first-aid, and last but not least, they should cultivate an attitude of equal respect and reverence towards all religions.
 It is not the wearing of the red shirt that makes a Khudai Khid- matgar, nor standing in serried ranks but to feel within you  the strength of God which is the opposite of the strength of arms. You have yet only arrived at the portal of non-violence. Still you have been able to achieve so much. How much greater your achievement will be when you have fully entered its holy edifice! But as I have said before, all that requires previous preparation and training. At present you lack both.

 [On or before October 15, 1938]libtech_127_footnote
 ABDUL GHAFFAR KHAN: There are some Pathans in the villages here who perse- cute Khudai Khidmatgars beyond endurance. They beat them, seize their lands and so on. What are we to do against them?
 GANDHIJI: We have to meet their high-handedness with patience and forbearance. We have to meet their atrocities in the same way as we used to meet the Britishers’, not answer violence by violence, nor abuse by abuse, nor harbour anger in our hearts. If we do that it is sure to melt their hearts. If it fails, we shall non-co-operate. If they seize our lands, we shall refuse to provide them the  labour  even though we may have to starve. We shall brave their wrath but refuse to submit or go against our conscience.
 A. K. Would it be permissible for us to lodge a complaint against them before the police and get them punished?
G.  A true Khudai Khidmatgar won’t go to a law-court.  Fighting
 in a law-court is just like physical fighting. Only, you use force by proxy. To  get the police to  punish the aggressor is  only a  form of
 
 revenge which a Khudai Khidmatgar must abjure. Let me illustrate my meaning by a personal instance. At Sevagram some Harijans came to me and told me that unless I could get a Harijan included in the C. P. Congress Ministry, they would offer ‘satyagraha’ by staging a hun- ger-strike.libtech_128_footnoteI knew it was all the doing of a mischief-maker. The Police Superintendent wanted to post some police force as he was afraid that the hooligans might do some mischief. But I said ‘no’ to him and told the Harijans that they need not sit outside in the sun; they could occupy any room they liked in the ashram. I offered to feed them too if they wanted. They chose my wife’s bathroom. I let them occupy it. We looked after their needs and when one of them fell ill, we nursed him. The result was that they became our friends.

 You know that when there are letters for others along with letters addressed to me, I do not read them. This is my nature. There were two letters by you to Sushila in reply to the same letter. I read them. I can give for this no excuse other than curiosity. From your previous letter, I have forgotten everything except the drawing of the moon. Yesterday’s letter I regard as important. I do not know what Sushila wrote to you regarding physical passion, but for me it has become a question of my veracity. You have told her that  my  last  statementlibtech_132_footnoteshould reassure them all. This pricked me. We cannot be complacent regarding physical passion in anybody’s case, but, as for myself, I should say that had I, at the time of my last statement, been having such experiences as I am having now, I would most certainly have not issued it. I cannot say, either, whether I would have stopped my ex- periment. Hence neither you nor anybody else can remain com- placent regarding me. I see no need as yet to withdraw the last state- ment or issue a revised one. This does not mean that any of you should start worrying. For the present, I will not go further than this. I found the time to write this much as being necessary in the interest of truth. You will naturally be curious to know more. But restrain your curiosity.

         October 	16, 1938  	I accept in toto your assurance that you have fully 	understood the principle of non-violence and that you will hold on 	to it always. I congratulate you on it, and I further say that if 	you can put the whole of that doctrine into practice, you will make 	history. You claim to have one lakh Khudai Khidmatgars on your 	register which exceeds the total number of Congress volunteers as it 	stands today. You are all pledged to selfless service. You get no 	monetary allowance. You have even to provide your own uniforms. You 	are a homogeneous and disciplined body. Khan Saheb’s word is law 	to you. You have proved your capacity to receive blows without 	retaliation. But this is only the first step in your probation, not 	the last. To gain India’s freedom, the capacity for suffering must 	go hand in hand with the capacity for ceaseless labour. A soldier 	for freedom must incessantly work for the benefit of all. The 	resemblance between you and the ordinary soldier begins and ends 	with the cut of the uniform and perhaps their nomenclatures which 	you have adopted. But unlike them the basis of all your activity is 	not violence but non-violence. Therefore, your training, your 	preoccupations, your mode of working, even your thoughts and 	aspirations must necessarily be different from theirs. A     
 soldier in arms is trained to kill. Even his dreams are about killing. He dreams of fighting, of winning fame and advancement on the battle- field by the prowess of his arms. He has reduced killing to an art. A satyagrahi, a Khudai Khidmatgar, on the other hand, would always long for opportunity for silent service. All his time would be given to labour of love. If he dreams, it will not be about killing but about laying down his life to serve others. He has reduced dying innocently and for his fellowmen to an art.
 But what shall be the training  that  will  fit  you  out  for  this  sort of work? It must be training in various branches of constructive work.
 With  one  lakh  Khudai  Khidmatgars  trained  in  the  science  of   construc- tive non-violence, he told them, trans-border raids should become a thing of the past.
 You should consider it a matter of utter shame if a single theft or dacoity takes place in your midst. Even the thieves and trans-border raiders are human beings. They commit crime not for the love of the thing itself but because they are driven to it largely by necessity and want. They know no other. The only method of dealing with them that has been adopted so far has been that of employing force. They are given no quarter and they give none. Dr. Khan Saheb feels help- less against them because the Government has no other way of dealing with them But you can make a non-violent approach to the problem, and I am sure you will succeed where the Government has failed. You can teach them to live honestly like yourselves by pro-viding them cottage occupations. You can go in their midst, serve them in their homes and explain to them things in a loving and  sym-pathetic manner, and you won’t find them altogether unamenable to the argument of love. There are two ways open to you today, the way of brute force, that has already been tried and found wanting, and the way of peace. You seem to have made your final choice. May you prove equal to it.

 October 16, 1938
 Gandhiji explained to them that non-violence could not, like the curate’s egg, be accepted or rejected in parts, it had value only when it was practised in its entirety.
 When the sun rises the whole world is filled with its warmth, so that even the blind man feels its presence. Even so when one lakh of Khudai Khidmatgars are fully permeated with the spirit of non-vio- lence, it will proclaim itself and everybody will feel its life-giving breath.
 I know it is difficult; it is no joke for a Pathan to take an affront lying down. I have known Pathans since my South African days. I had the privilege of coming into close and intimate contact with them. Some of them were my clients. They treated me as their friend, philo- sopher and guide, in whom they could confide freely. They would even come and confess to me their secret crimes. They were a rough and ready lot. Past masters in the art of wielding the lathi, inflam- mable, first to take part in riots, they held life cheap, and would have killed a human being with no more thought than they would a sheep or a hen. That such men should have, at the bidding of one man, laid down their arms and accepted non-violence as the superior weapon sounds almost like a fairy tale. If the one lakh of Khudai Khidmatgars became truly non-violent in letter and in spirit and shed their violent past completely as a snake does its outworn skin, it would be nothing short of a miracle. That is why in spite of the assurance of your faith in non-violence that you have given me, I am forced to be cautious and preface my remarks with an ‘if’. My diffidence is only a measure of the difficulty of the task. But nothing is too difficult for the brave and I know the Pathans are brave.
 The crucial test by which I shall judge you is this: Have you befriended and won the confidence of each and all in your locality? Do the people regard you with love or with fear? So long as a single individual is afraid of you, you are no true Khudai Khidmatgar. A Khudai Khidmatgar will be gentle in his speech and manner, the light
 
 of purity will shine forth from his eyes, so that even a stranger, a woman or even a child would instinctively feel that here was a friend, a man of God, who could be trusted. A Khudai Khidmatgar will command the co-operation of all sections of the community, not the sort of obedience that a Mussolini or a Hitler can command through his unlimited power of coercion, but the willing and spontaneous obedience which is yielded to love alone. This power can be acquired only through ceaseless, loving service, and waiting upon God. When I find that under your influence people are gradually giving up their dirty and insanitary habits, the drunkard is being weaned from drink and the criminal from crime and the Khudai Khidmatgars are wel- comed everywhere by the people as their natural protectors and  friends in need, I shall know that, at last, we have got in our midst a body of men who have really assimilated the spirit of non-violence and the hour of India’s deliverance is close at hand.

 Moreover, our refusal to take part in the war on any terms would in itself be a harassment to them. We can, however, adopt  no  other course, that is, if the Congress listens to me.
 But I do not think it desirable that you should divert your mind even to this from your study. You will continue to reflect on  the matter of course, and you will come to definite conclusions. But I think it desirable that you should not waste your time in explaining your views to others.
 Your health causes me worry. You may be certain that there will be no harm at all if for the sake of your health you take one more year. Health, once lost, will not return. You have built up your body with exercise. Your constitution itself is strong. Let it not be under- mined. Come to Segaon. Stay there for some time and build up your body there if you can with good food and rest. Listen to me in this matter and do not be negligent. Do not be over-confident and assume that you will somehow be able to improve your health afterwards.

 MARDAN,
 
  October 	17, 1938  	I have two letters from schoolmasters, besides others from lay- men, 	complaining of students’ rowdyism in Travancore. The Principal of 	C.M.S. College, Kottayam, says that the students blocked the pass- 	age of those who wanted to attend the classes. They twice turned 	away girls who did not listen to them. They rushed at the classes 	and made noises, making classes impossible.  	This violent participation by students in a struggle which its 	authors claim to be absolutely non-violent, makes progress 	difficult, if not impossible. So far as I know, the leaders of the 	movement do not want the students, even if they wish to participate, 	to depart in any way from the non-violent way. Obstruction, rowdyism 	and the like are naked violence. I am credited with influence over 	students. If I have any, I would ask them to observe non-violence in 	thought, word and deed. If, however, the forces of violence cannot 	be controlled by those who are in charge of the movement, it may be 	a question for them whether in the interest of the movement itself 	it is not wise to suspend civil disobedience.  	I must not presume to lay down the law from this distance, but I do 	feel from the evidence before me that the leaders would incur grave 	risk if they allowed students to think that their violence would 	help the movement or that it is secretly liked by the leaders.

It is only when the authorities are compelled to put into prison the 	purest and the most innocent citizens that a change of heart is 	forced upon them. A satyagrahi goes to prison, not to embarrass the 	authorities but to convert them by demonstrating to them his 	innocence. You should realize that unless you have developed the 	moral fitness to go  to prison which the law of satyagraha demands, 	your jail-going will be      
 useless and will bring you nothing but disappointment in the end. A votary of non-violence must have the capacity to put up with the indignities and hardships of prison life not only without retaliation or anger but with pity in his heart for the perpetrators of those hardships and indignities. I would, therefore, today ask you to examine your- selves in the light of my remarks, and if you find that you cannot or do not want to go the full length, to drop your badge of non-vio-lence and request Khan Saheb to release you from your pledge. That will be a species of heroism. But if you have full faith in the creed of non-violence as I have described it, then know it from me that God will arm you with the required strength in your hour of trial.

183,"October 19, 1938","HINDUSTANI, HINDI AND URDU","
    
 It is a great pity that bitter controversy has taken place and still continues regarding the Hindi-Urdu question. So far as the Congress is concerned Hindustani is its recognized official language designed as an all-India language for inter-provincial contact. It is not  to supplant but to supplement the provincial languages. The recent reso- lution of the Working Committee should set all doubt at rest. If the Congressmen who have to do all-India work will only take the trouble of learning Hindustani in both the scripts, we shall have taken many strides in the direction of our common language goal. The real competition is not between Hindi and Urdu but between Hindustani and English. It is a tough fight. I am certainly watching it with grave concern.
 Hindi-Urdu controversy has no bottom. Hindustani of the Con- gress conception has yet to be crystallized into shape. It will not be so long as Congress proceedings are not conducted exclusively in Hin- dustani. The Congress will have to prescribe the dictionaries for use by Congressmen and a department will have to supply new words out- side the dictionaries. It is great work, it is work worth doing, if we are really to have a living, growing all-India speech. The department will have to determine which of the existing literature shall be con-sidered as Hindustani, books, magazines, weeklies, dailies, whether written in Urdu script or Devanagari. It is serious work needing a vast amount of plodding if it is to achieve success.
 For the purpose of crystallizing Hindustani, Hindi and Urdu  may be regarded as feeders. A Congressman must therefore wish well to both and keep in touch with both so far as he can.
 This Hindustani will have many synonyms to supply the varied requirements of a growing nation rich in provincial languages. Hindustani spoken to Bengali or Southern audiences will naturally have a large stock of words of Sanskrit origin. The same speech deli- vered in  the  Punjab will  have  a  large  admixture  of  words  of Arabic or Persian origin. Similar will be the case with audiences com- posed predominantly of Muslims who cannot understand many words of Sanskrit origin. All-India speakers will have therefore to command a Hindustani vocabulary which will enable them to feel at home with audiences drawn from all parts of India. Pandit Mala-viyaji’s name comes uppermost in this connection. I have known him handle Hindi-speaking and Urdu-speaking audiences with equal case. I have never found him in want of the correct word. The same is true of Babu Bhagwandas who uses synonymous words in the same speech, and he sees to it that it does not lose in grace. Among the Muslims at the time of writing I can think of only Maulana Mahomed Ali whose vocabulary was varied enough to suit both audiences. His knowledge of Gujarati acquired in Baroda service stood him in good stead.
 Independently of the Congress, Hindi and Urdu will continue to flourish. Hindi will be mostly confined to Hindus and Urdu to Mus- lims. As a matter of fact, comparatively speaking, there are very few Muslims who know Hindi well enough to be called scholars, though, I expect, in Hindi-speaking parts, to Muslims born there, Hindi is the mother tongue. There are thousands of Hindus whose mother tongue is Urdu and there are hundreds who can be aptly described as Urdu scholars. Pandit Motilalji was one such. Dr. Tej Bahadur Sapru is another. Illustrations can be easily multiplied. There is therefore no reason for any quarrel or unhealthy competition between the two sisters. Healthy competition there always must be.
 From all accounts I have received it seems that, under the able guidance of Moulvi Saheb Abdul Haq, the Osmania University is ren- dering great service to the cause of Urdu. The University has a big Urdu lexicon. Scientific treatises have been and are being prepared in Urdu. And as the teaching is being honestly imparted through Urdu in that University, it must grow. And if, owing to unreasoning preju- dice today, all Hindi-speaking Hindus do not profit by the literature that is growing there, it is their fault. But the prejudice has to die. For, the present disunion between the communities is, like all diseases, only temporary. For good or for ill, the two communities are wedded to
 India, they are neighbours, sons of the soil. They are destined to die here as they are born here. Nature will force them to live in peace if they do not come together voluntarily.
 And as with the Hindus so with the Muslims. It is the latter’s loss, if they will not take advantage of the fruits of the  humbler labours of the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan and the Nagari Pracharini Sabha. It is a pity they have not taken note with pride and pleasure of the big (for the Sammelan) step taken by it in defining Hindi as the language spoken in the north by Hindus and Mussalmans and written in Urdu or Devanagari script. Thus, so far as the definition is concerned, it answers the Congress definition of Hindustani.
 I know that there are some who dream that there shall be only Urdu or only Hindi. I think it will always remain a dream and it is an unholy dream. Islam has its own peculiar culture, so has Hinduism its own. India of the future will be a perfect and happy blend of both. When that blessed day comes, their common speech will be Hin- dustani. But Urdu will still flourish with a predominance of Arabic and Persian words, and Hindi will still flourish with its abundant Sans- krit vocabulary. The language of Tulsidas and Surdas cannot die, even as the language in which Shibli wrote cannot die. But the best of both will be quite at home with Hindustani speech.

184,"October 19, 1938",FOREWORD TO “DADABHAI NAOROJI”,"
    
 UTMANZAI,
 October 19, 1938
 It was on 4th September, 1888, that I sailed from Bombay with three letters of introduction, the most precious being for the G. O. M. of India, Dadabhai Naoroji. The letter was given by a Maharashtrian doctor, a friend of the family. The worthy doctor told me the G. O. M. did not know him personally, in fact he had never even had  the darshan of the G. O. M. “But,” said the doctor, “what does it matter? Everyone knows him and adores him as India’s great son and champion. He has exiled himself for us. I claim to know him by his service of India. You will see that my letter will serve you just as well as if I had known him personally. The fact is, you need no
 introduction to him. Your being an Indian is sufficient introduction. But you are a youngster, untravelled and timid. This letter will give you courage enough to go to the G.O.M. and all will be smooth sailing for you.” And so it was. When I reached London, I soon found that Indian students had free access to the G.O.M. at all hours of the day. Indeed he was in the place of father to every one of them, no matter to which province or religion they belonged. He was there to advise and guide them in their difficulties. I have always been a hero- worshipper. And so Dadabhai became real Dadalibtech_153_footnotelibtech_154_footnoteto  me.  The relationship took the deepest root in South Africa. For, he was my constant adviser and inspiration. Hardly a week passed without a letter from me to him describing the condition of Indians in South Africa. And I well remember that whenever there was a reply to be expected, it came without fail in his own handwriting, in his inimitably simple style. I never received a typed letter from him. And during my visits to England from South Africa I found that he had for office a garret perhaps 8 feet by 6 feet. There was hardly room in it for another chair. His desk, his chair and the pile of papers filled the room. I saw that he wrote his letters in copying ink and press-copied them himself. I have not read Shri Masani’s sketch. But if he has at all done justice to the life so noble and yet so simple, his work needs no introduction from me or anybody else. May it be an inspiration to the
reader even as Dadabhai living was to me."

    Incidents 	of Gandhiji’s Life, 	p. 170  M. K. G. "
186,,DISCUSSION WITH ABDUL GHAFFAR KHAN,"
         [October 19/20, 1938]libtech_157_footnote  An 	important stage in Gandhiji’s Frontier mission was reached when in 	his quiet retreat at Utmanzai he devoted two days to confabulate and 	compare notes with Badshah Khan after his tour of the Khudai 	Khidmatgars in Peshawar and Mardan districts. He asked Badshah Khan:  	What is your impression? How do the Khudai  Khidmatgars stand with 	regard to non-violence?  [A. 	G. 	K.] 	My impression, Mahatmaji, is that as they themselves admitted before 	us, the other day, they are raw recruits and fall far short of the 	standard. There is violence in their hearts which they have not been 	able altogether to cast out. They have their defects of temper. But 	there is no doubt as to their sincerity. Given a chance they can be 	hammered into shape and I think the attempt is worth while. If  we 	could assimilate and put into practice the whole of the doctrine of 	non-violence as you have explained it to us, how much stronger and 	better off we should be. . . .  Gandhiji 	suggested to Badshah Khan that if non-violence was to receive a fair 	trial, the Khudai Khidmatgars must be prepared to go through a 	rigorous course of training in constructive non-violence which he 	had in mind for them.  [A. 	G. 	K.] 	My idea, 	Mahatmaji, is to make 	Utmanzai into 	a model 	village. The spinning 	and weaving 	centre will serve 	as a 	sort of 	permanent exhibition for 	the education 	of the 	villagers. At 	the home for Khudai 	Khidmatgars we shall 	set before 	us the 	self-sufficiency ideal. 	We shall 	wear only the clothes 	that we 	ourselves pro- 	duced, eat only 	such fruits  and  	vegetables  as 	 we  raise  there  and  have  a  small 	 dairy to 	provide us 	with milk. We 	shall deny ourselves 	what we 	cannot ourselves 	produce.  	[G.] Good. May I further 	suggest that the Khudai Khidmatgars should take their due share in 	the building of the huts too that are to house them?     12-11-1938 
 [A. G. K.] That is our idea.
 To train the first batch of workers, Gandhiji suggested that some Khudai Khidmatgars whom Badshah Khan might select might be sent to Wardha, where, besides becoming adepts in the science of khadi, they would also get a grounding in first aid and hygiene, sanitation and village uplift work and in Hindustani. They would also be initiated there into the Wardha Scheme of education so that on their return they would be able to take up the work of mass education. Gandhiji then said:
 But your work will not make headway unless you take the lead and yourself become an adept in all these things.
 Lastly, your work will come to nought unless you enforce the rule of punctuality in your retreat. There must be a fixed routine and fixed hours for rising and going to bed, for taking meals and for work and rest, and they must be rigorously enforced. I attach the greatest importance to punctuality; it is a corollary to non-violence.
 They next proceeded to discuss the modus operandi by which the Khudai Khidmatgars, when they had become sure of their non-violence, would fulfil their mission of coping with the trans-border raids. Badshah Khan was of the opinion that the task was rendered infinitely difficult by the presence of the police and the military who were not fully under popular control and whose presence there brought in all the evils of double rule. “Either the authorities should whole-heartedly co-operate with us or they should withdraw the police and the military from one district to begin with, and we shall then undertake to maintain the peace of that district through our Khudai Khidmatgars.” But Gandhiji held a different view. He remarked:
 I frankly confess that I do not expect the authorities whole- heartedly to co-operate with us. They would distrust our ability, if not our motive. It is too much to expect them to withdraw the police on trust. Non-violence is a universal principle and its operation is not limited by a hostile environment. Indeed its efficacy can be tested only when it acts in the midst of and in spite of opposition. Our non-violence would be a hollow thing and nothing worth if it depen- ded for its success on the goodwill of the authorities. If we can esta- blish full control over the people, we shall render the police and the military innocuous.
 And he described to Badshah Khan how during the Bombay riots on the occasion of the Prince of Wales’s visit, the police and the military found their job gone because the Congress immediately regained control and peace was restored.
 [A. G. K.] But the difficulty is that the raiders are mostly bad characters, who have absconded from British India. We cannot make contact with them because the authorities won’t permit us or our workers to go into the tribal territory.
 [G.] They must, and I tell you they will when we are fully ready. But for that we shall need to have a body of Khudai Khidmatgars who are really and truly servants of God, with whom non-violence is a living faith. Non-violence is an active principle of the highest order. It is soul force or the power of the godhead within us. Imperfect man cannot grasp the whole of that Essence—he would not be able to bear its full blaze—but even an infinitesimal fraction of it, when it becomes active within us, can work wonders. The sun in the heavens fills the whole universe with its life-giving warmth. But if one went too near it, it would consume him to ashes. Even so is it with godhead.  We become godlike to the extent we realize non-violence; but we can never become wholly God. Non-violence is like radium in its action. An infinitesimal quantity of it imbedded in a malignant growth, acts continuously, silently, and ceaselessly till it has transformed the whole mass of the diseased tissue into a healthy one. Similarly, even a tiny grain of true non-violence acts in a silent, subtle, unseen way and leavens the whole society.
 It is self-acting. The soul persists even after death, its existence does not depend on the physical body. Similarly, non-violence or soul force too, does not need physical aids for its propagation or effect. It acts independently of them. It transcends time and space.
 It follows, therefore, that if non-violence becomes successfully established in one place, its influence will spread everywhere. So long as a single dacoity takes place in Utmanzai, I will say that our non-violence is not genuine.
 The basic principle on which the practice of non-violence rests is that what holds good in respect of yourself holds good equally in respect of the whole universe. All mankind in essence are alike. What is, therefore, possible for me is possible for everybody.  Pursuing further this line of reasoning, I came to the conclusion that if I could find a non-violent solution of the various problems that arise in one particular village, the lesson learnt from it would enable me to tackle in a non-violent manner all similar problems in India.
 And so I decided to settle down in Sevagram. My sojourn in Sevagram has been an education for me. My experience with the Harijans has provided me with what I regard as an ideal solution for the Hindu-Muslim problem, which does away with all pacts. So if you can set things right in Utmanzai your whole problem  would  be  solved. Even our relations with the English will be transformed and
 
 purified if we can show to them that we really do not stand in need of the protection for which their police and the army are ostensibly kept.
 But Badshah Khan had a doubt. In every village there is an element of self-seekers and exploiters who are ready to go to any length in order to serve their selfish ends. Would it not be better, Khan Saheb asked, to ignore them altogether or should an attempt be made to cultivate them too.
 [G.] We may ultimately have to leave some of them out, but we may not regard anybody as irreclaimable. We should try to understand the psychology of the evil-doer. He is very often victim of his circumstances. By patience and sympathy, we shall be able to win over at least some of them to the side of justice. Moreover, we should not forget that even evil is sustained through the co-operation, either willing or forced, of good. Truth alone is self-sustained. In the last resort we can curb power of the evil-doers to do mischief by with- drawing all co-operation from them and completely isolating them.
 This in essence is the principle of non-violent non-co-opera- tion. It follows, therefore, that it must have its roots in love. Its object should not be to punish the opponent or to inflict injury upon him. Even while non-co-operating with him, we must make him feel that in us he has a friend and we should try to reach his heart by rendering him humanitarian service whenever possible. In fact it is the acid test of non-violence that in a non-violent conflict there is no rancour left behind, and in the end the enemies are converted into friends. That was my experience in South Africa with General Smuts. He started by being my bitterest opponent and critic. Today he is my warmest  friend. For eight years we were ranged on opposite sides. But during the Second Round Table Conference it was he who stood by me and, in public as well as in private, gave me his full support. This is only one instance out of many that I can quote.
 Times change and systems decay. But it is my faith that in the result, it is only non-violence and things that are based on non-vio- lence that will endure. Nineteen hundred years ago Christianity was born. The ministry of Jesus lasted only for three brief years. His teaching was misunderstood even during his own time, and today’s Christianity is a denial of his central teaching— “Love your enemy”. But what are nineteen hundred years for the spread of the central doctrine of a man’s teaching?
 Six centuries rolled by and Islam appeared on the scene. Many Mussalmans will not even allow me to say that Islam, as the word im-
 plies, is unadulterated peace. My reading of the Koran has convinced me that the basis of Islam is not violence. But here again thirteen hundred years are but a speck in the cycle of Time. I am convinced that both these great faiths will live only to the extent that their followers imbibe the central teaching of non-violence. But it is not a thing to be grasped through mere intellect, it must sink into  our hearts.

187,"October 20, 1938",NOTES,"
    
 MR. AND ESQUIRE V. SHRI, MOULVI, MAULANA, JANAB AND THE LIKE
 Some friends told me on my putting ‘Shri’ before ‘Jinnah’ instead of ‘Mr.’ in my statement made before I visited him in  Bombay that it must have offended him. I demurred and said that if he was offended he would have given me a gentle hint, I would have apologized and used an adjective he liked best. The readers will remember, in the heyday of non-co-operation the terms ‘Mr.’ and ‘Esq.’ were dropped by Congressmen and the nationalist Press, and ‘Shri’ was the title largely used for all irrespective of religion. Though the practice has largely fallen into desuetude, I have never given it up. But for our bad habit, I was going to say slavish mentality, we would never have used ‘Mr.’ and ‘Esquire’ before or after Indian names. In Europe an Englishman never addresses foreigners as ‘Mr.’or ‘Esquire’ but uses the adjectives current in the respective countries. Thus Hitler is never called ‘Mr.’, he is ‘Herr’ Hitler. Similarly Musso- lini is neither ‘Mr.’ nor ‘Herr’, he is ‘Signor’. Why we should have dropped our own nomenclature I do not know. But a moment’s detachment from the prevailing habit should show us that the use of ‘Mr.’ and ‘Esquire’ before or after Indian names sounds ludicrous.
 I must, however, admit that the use of ‘Shri’ before Muslim names, in these days of mutual suspicion, may not please Muslim friends. I have discussed the matter with some Muslim friends. They told me the word ‘Moulvi’ was the usual adjective. ‘Janab’ I have heard often in the South. Anyway I can say that in using ‘Shri’ for Muslim Indian names, I have had no idea except the friendliest. When anybody calls me ‘Mr.’ the use of the word jars on me. The happiest Hindu usage is ‘ji’ at the end of the name. ‘Saheb’ is synonymous
 
 with ‘ji’. I remember I always used to address the late Hakim Ajmal- khan as Hakimji. Some Muslim friend told me that Hakim ‘Saheb’ would be preferred by Muslims. I had not known before of any such preference. But since the correction, except for inadvertent use of ‘ji’,  I always addressed the deceased patriot as Hakim Saheb. I could not address him as ‘Mr.’ Ajmalkhan even if somebody deposited five salted canes on the naked back. It seems that we become ‘Misters’ and ‘Esquires’ after we receive English education!!! Will readers learned in this kind of lore help me and persons like me by giving the uncontaminated usages in vogue in India?

  	I have replied to your telegram. Even if you go to Travancore as a 	private citizen, you will succeed. Meet the prisoners. There is a 	good deal of falsehood in the air. I have received heaps of 	telegrams from the Congresslibtech_162_footnotelibtech_163_footnotetotally 	denying the charge of violence by it. But there are other telegrams, 	too, which say that there has undoubtedly been violence. The truth 	can be ascertained only if somebody goes there personally. You know 	the attitude I have adopted. The people should withdraw the 	allegations against C. P. or make them the main issue. If they adopt 	the latter course, then there is no need for satyagraha. It is for 	the local workers to make the choice. If C. P. Offers to invite a 	judge from outside to try the cases, the people should accept the 	challenge. If they refuse to do that, the fight will lose its moral 	basis. You must have seen my last advice. If violence is going on 	for what- ever reason, civil disobedience must be suspended 	unconditio-nally. Let those imprisoned remain in jails. Excepting 	civil disobedi-ence, the rest of the programme may continue. You 	may, however, decide what you think best after a personal visit. See 	Ramachandran first and then the prisoners.

 October 21, 1938
 CHI. BALWANTSINHA,
 It is 12.45 a. m. I do not have a pen. But since this is a good opportunity I am writing in pencil on mill-made paper. I am late in replying to you. I am helpless. The doctor won’t allow me to work at night. Today, for some reason, I am not able to sleep. That is how I can write to you. I hope you will not find my handwriting difficult to decipher. Or maybe I shall ask Kanu to copy it out in ink.
 Give me time till the end of this tour. Do not mind if this season is wasted. What do the poor do? There is nothing improper in what you say. I am certainly not angry but I am not amused either. I res- pect your language because you speak or write just what comes to your mind. Maybe I am in the dark. It is more probable because I know nothing of these matters. I have caught hold of one thing. Both of you love the cow. You are more industrious. You have greater love for the cow. Parnerkar has more scientific knowledge. In this situation, I thought I should do something which would allow scope for both. I shall then know who is right. This may entail some loss and I shall suffer it.
 However, I approve of your suggestion. I should not involve myself in these complications but should appoint an arbitrator who should listen to both sides and give a decision. His verdict should be accepted. Could Chimanlal, Nanavati or Mirabehn serve the purpose? I am inclined to suggest Kishorelal, but why should I put him to this strain? I do not mind troubling Radhakisan. If Parnerkar approves of these names, the matter can be decided soon. You need not wait till I return. You may mention this to Parnerkar. I think I have  now answered all your points. Be patient.
 Blessings from

193,"October 22, 1938",THE CONFISCATED LANDS,"
    
 It would be wrong on my part if I allowed it to be said that the Bill to provide for the restoration of lands forfeited during the Civil Disobedience Movement just passed by the Bombay Legislature, miscalled expropriatory law, would not have been passed if I had my will. I must make the confession that I had some hand in the Minis- ters’ bringing in the Bill. Indeed I felt that any other course would be less than correct. Any parley with those who had bought the lands would be either coercion on behalf of the Government or blackmail by the so-called owners. If it was right to restore the lands to the true owners, it should be done by law. If the Government had not the power under the Government of India Act even to pass such an innocent and necessary relief measure, it was worse than the critics had described it to be. I hold that the Bombay Bill is more than just. The clause providing for compensation to the so-called owners to  the  extent of their outlay plus interest makes it more than just. The provable facts about these lands are that they were bought in collusion with the authorities. Indeed it was difficult for them to find pur- chasers. The lands were sold to terrorize the people. It was part of the repressive policy, and they were sold in some cases for a song. When the Government that resorted to such terrorism gave place to those who were its victims, surely they must be credited with magnanimity when, instead of confiscating the lands purchased collusively and in the teeth of strong and overwhelming  popular  opposition,  they offered compensation.
 Had the fight between the Government and the people been violent instead of non-violent, the victorious party coming into power would certainly have restored without compensation all property to the legal possessors forcibly taken away from the rightful owners. Surely, the situation could not be altered because the fight was non-violent and there was a semblance of legal procedure about the transfers. The public should know that the lands were first confiscated by the then Government and when the confiscation did not seem to break the spirit of the fighters, the unworthy means of selling the lands was resorted to. But they seemed to be terrified of their own enormity and they desisted from selling further lands. I would far rather draw the curtain over the painful past. I have raised it just to let
 the reader know that the Bombay Government have not been guilty of injustice.

  	We arrived in Peshawar yesterday at 8.30 and started out again at 	four. Five days’ mail had accumulated in Peshawar. I got all your 	letters only yesterday.  	Why did you feel that your letters might be a burden to me? It is 	not at all so. The fact is that whenever there is no letter from 	you, I feel very uneasy. And if the letter is short, I get angry and 	wonder what could keep you so busy that you had to be content with 	only two lines.  	About Bablo, Rajkumari writes to say that he should be given full 	scope for mental development. I also believe that this should be 	done, either through the current method, i.e., through the high 	school, etc., or the other method, of coaching at home. The 	development through home coaching will be in one direction, and 	through the college, etc., it will be in another direction. Think 	over this with Raj- kumari. If you can think of anything different 	from what is being done at present, we may do it. Bablo also may 	suggest.  	I have already written to Lilavati. The only purpose behind asking 	you also to write to her was that she might hear the same opinion 	from all sides. She has given me no notice that she will not stay 	with you now. Nor do I feel so. All the same, we will not keep her 	there forcibly. But since at present your plans are uncertain why 	need we think about the matter?  	Pothan has been writing to me about Travancore. Generally a man’s 	obituary is written after his death. In your case, this is done 	before your death. So why should you concern yourself now what will 	be written after your death? Later on a new and revised edition of 	your biography will be brought out. If not Pothan, somebody else 	like him will write a revised obituary. I 	may not write more today.

 of the soul. Once its central meaning sinks into your being, all the rest by itself follows. Human nature in the Khudai Khidmatgars is not different from mine. And I am sure that if I can practise non-violence to some extent, they, and for the matter of that anyone else, can. I, therefore, invite you to pray with me to the Almighty that He may make real my dream about the Khudai Khidmatgars.

200,,TALK TO KHUDAI KHIDMATGARS,"
          KOHAT, 
  [October 22/23, 1938]libtech_168_footnote  In 	the course of his talk before the Khudai Khidmatgar officers at 	Kohat, he impressed upon them the tremendous nature of the step 	which they had taken. He had often said before that if the Pathan, 	famed in the world for the prowess of his arms, really took to 	non-violence, renouncing arms, it would be a red-letter day in the 	history of India and the world.  	For good or for ill, the Pathan today has come to be regarded as a 	bogey man by the average person in India. In Gujarat and Kathia- war 	children turn pale at the very mention of the Pathan. At Sabarmati 	Ashram, we try to inculcate fearlessness among the children. But I 	am ashamed to confess that in spite of all our efforts we have not 	succee- ded in making them eradicate the fear of the Pathan from 	their hearts. I have not been able to impress upon our ashram girls 	that they have no need to fear a Pathan. They try to make a show of 	bravery. But it is only a make-believe. During a communal 	disturbance they dare not stir out of their homes if there is a 	report of even a casual Pathan being about. They are afraid they 	would be kidnapped .  	I tell them that even if they are kidnapped they must not be 	frightened. They should appeal to the kidnapper’s sense of honour 	to behave chivalrously towards one who should be as a sister to him. 	If in spite of their entreaties he persists in his evil intentions 	(since all must die some day), they can put an end to their life by 	biting the tongue but not submit. They answer, ‘What you say is 	right. But it is all new to us. We have not the confidence that at 	the proper time we shall be able to do what you tell us.’ If such 	is the case with the Ashram girls, what must it be with others? 	When, therefore, I hear that a body of Khidmatgars has arisen among 	the Pathans, who have completely renounced violence, I do not know 	whether to believe it or not.  	What are the implications of renouncing violence and what is the 	mark of a person who has renounced violence?  One 	did not become a Khudai Khidmatgar by adopting that name or by 	putting on the Khudai Khidmatgar’s uniform, he told them. It 	needed systematic training in non-violence. In Europe where they had 	glorified killing into a noble profession,    
 they spent millions on perfecting the science of destruction. Their best scientists were pressed into its service. Even their educational system was centred on it. They spent stupendous sums too on luxuries and means of physical comforts, which formed a part of their ideal. By contrast, the mark of a man of God or a Khudai Khidmatgar should be purity, industry and unremitting hard labour in the service of  God’s creation.
 In the course of serving your fellow creatures you will get a measure of the progress you have made in non-violence and of the power that is in non-violence. Armed with this power, a single person can stand against the whole world. That is not possible with the sword.
 Hitherto, non-violence had been synonymous with civil breach of laws and taking the penalty for the same non-violently. But he wished to tell them that, although civil disobedience was included in the programme of non-violence, its essence as he had pointed out at Swabi, was the moral right or fitness which it presupposed in the civil resister and which accrued to one who trained himself in the practice of non-violence.libtech_169_footnoteIn the satyagraha fight ‘civil disobedience is the end, not the beginning. It is the last step, not the first.’ People used to have a craven fear of the Government. As a remedy, he had prescribed satyagraha or civil disobedience. It was a sharp medicine.
 Unless a physician, who administers powerful drugs, knows ex- actly when to stop, he loses his patient. That is why I promptly called off civil disobedience, confining it to myself alone when the situation demanded it.libtech_170_footnoteIt was just in time. So I would like you, for the time being, to forget civil disobedience.
 He next proceeded to explain that service of God could only be performed through service of His creatures. He had made it his habit to try to see always the hand   of God in everything even at the risk of being considered superstitious. Thus he saw the hand of God in the name that Badshah Khan had given them. Badshah Khan had not called them satyagrahis but servants of God.
 But how to serve God since He is incorporate and needs no personal service? We can serve Him by serving His creation. There is an Urdu verse which says: ‘Man can never be God but in essence he is not different from Divinity.’ Let us make our village our universe. We shall then serve God by serving our village. To relieve the distress of the unemployed by providing them work, to tend the sick, to wean people from their insanitary habits, to educate them in cleanliness and
 
 healthy living should be the job of a Khudai Khidmatgar. And since whatever he does is in God’s service, his service will be performed with far more diligence and care than that of paid workers.
 He ended by giving a few practical hints as to how to cultivate non-violent strength.
A Khudai Khidmatgar will keep a strict account of every minute
 of his time which he will regard as God’s trust. To waste a single moment of one’s time in idleness or frivolity is a sin against God. It is on a par with stealing. If there is even a tiny little bit of land available, he will occupy himself with growing something on it—food or vegetables for the destitute and needy. If he should feel inclined to sit idle and do nothing because his parents have enough money to enable him to purchase food and vegetables from the bazaar, he will argue to himself that by drawing upon the bazaar supplies, he deprives the poor of the same and steals what belongs to God. Before he purchases or uses anything, a Khudai Khidmatgar will ask himself whether there is not somebody else whose need may be greater than his. Supposing somebody places a sumptuous dish before him and a starving person appears on the scene, he will think of the latter’s need first, feed him and then alone partake of the dish.

          HUNGOO, 
  [October 23, 1938]libtech_171_footnote  Gandhiji 	 referred   to   an   address   of   welcome   that 	  had   been   presented 	to him 	at Nasarat 	Khel on the way, at the  	foundation  laying 	 ceremony  of  the 	Khudai Khidmatgars’ 	office. In it there 	was a 	reference to 	“our last struggle”. 	He remarked:  	Let me tell you that civil disobedience may come and go, but our 	non-violent struggle for freedom goes on and will continue till 	Independence is attained. Only the form has changed.  	I know that to 90 per cent Indians, non-violence means that and 	nothing else.libtech_172_footnotelibtech_173_footnoteIt is good so far. There is bravery in it. But you and 	particularly the Khudai Khidmatgar officers must clearly understand 	that this is not the whole of non-violence. If you have really 	understood the meaning of non-violence, it should be clear to you 	that non-violence is not a principle or a virtue to be brought into 	play on a particular occasion or to be practised with reference to a 	parti- cular party or section. It has to become a part and parcel of 	our being. Anger should disappear from our hearts altogether, 	otherwise what is the difference between ourselves and our 	oppressors? Anger may lead     Harijan, 	5-11-1938, Gandhiji 	visited Hungoo on October 23, 1938.  
 one person to issue an order to open fire, another to use abusive language, a third one to use the lathi. At root it is all the same. It is only when you have become incapable of feeling or harbouring anger in your hearts that you can claim to have shed violence or can expect to remain non-violent to the end.
 He then proceeded to explain the difference between civil disobedience and satyagraha.
 Our civil disobedience or non-co-operation, by its very nature, was not meant to be practised for all time. But the fight which we are today putting up through our constructive non-violence has a validity for all time; it is the real thing. Supposing the Government were to cease to arrest civil resisters, our jail-going would then stop but that would not mean that our fight is over. A civil resister does not go to jail to embarrass the jail authorities by indulging in the breach of jail rules. Of course, there can be civil disobedience in jail too. But there are definite rules for it. The point is that the civil resister’s fight does not end with his imprisonment. Once we are inside the prison we become civilly dead so far as the outside world is concerned. But inside the prison our fight to convert the hearts of the Government’s bond slaves, i. e., the jail officials, just begins. It gives us a chance of demonstrating to them that we are not like thieves or dacoits, that we wish them no ill, nor do we want to destroy the opponent but want only to make him our friend, not by servilely obeying all orders, just or unjust— that is not the way to win true friendship—but by showing them that there is no evil in us, that we sincerely wish them well and in our hearts pray that God’s goodness may be upon them. My fight continued even when I was lodged behind prison bars. I have been several times in prison and every time I have left only friends behind in the jail officials and others with whom I have come in contact.
 It is a speciality of non-violence that its action never stops. That cannot be said of the sword or the bullet. The bullet can destroy the enemy; non-violence converts the enemy into a friend and  thus  enables the civil resister to assimilate to himself the latter’s strength.
 By their civil disobedience struggle, he continued, they had demonstrated to the world their determination no longer to be ruled by the British. But they had now to give proof of valour of another and higher type. During the Khilafat days tall, hefty Pathan soldiers used to come and meet the Ali Brothers and himself secretly. They used to tremble at the thought of their visit being discovered by their superior officers and resulting in their dismissal from service. In spite of their tall stature and
 physical strength they used to cower and become servile when confronted by a person physically stronger than they.
I want strength which will enable me to submit to none but God,
 my sole Lord and Master. It is only when I can do that, that I can claim to have realized non-violence.
 He then proceeded to expatiate on another speciality of non-violence, viz., one need not go to a school or a pir or a guru to learn its use. Its virtue lay in its simplicity. If they realized that it was the most active principle that worked all the twenty-four hours without rest or remission, they would look for opportunities for its application in their homes, in the streets, in relation to their foes no less than friends. They could begin to practise it in their homes from that very day. He had disciplined himself sufficiently never to feel angry with the enemy, but he confessed that he sometimes lost temper with friends. Such discipline in non-violence as he had, he told them, he had at home from his wife. And with that he unfolded in poignant detail, a chapter of his domestic life. He used to be a tyrant at home, he said. His tyranny was the tyranny of love.
 I used to let loose my anger upon her. But she bore it all meekly and uncomplainingly. I had a notion that it was her duty to obey me, her lord and master, in everything. But her unresisting meekness opened my eyes and slowly it began to dawn upon me that I had no such prescriptive right over her. If I wanted her obedience, I had first to persuade her by patient argument. She thus became my teacher in non-violence. And I dare say, I have not had a more loyal and faithful comrade in life. I literally used to make life a hell for her. Every other day I would change my residence, prescribe what dress she was to wear. She had been brought up in an orthodox family where untou- chability was observed. Muslims and untouchables used to frequent our house. I made her serve them all regardless of her innate reluc- tance. But she never said ‘no’. She was not educated in the usual sense of the term and was simple and unsophisticated. Her guileless simplicity conquered me completely.
 You have all wives, mothers and sisters at home. You can take the lesson of non-violence from them. You must, besides, take the vow of truth, ask yourselves how dear truth is to you and how far you observe it in thought, word and deed. A person who is not truthful is far away from non-violence. Untruth itself is violence.
 Referring to the month of Ramzan that had just set in, he told them how it could be used to make a start in non-violence.
 We seem to think that the observance of Ramzan begins and ends with abstention from food and drink. We think nothing of losing
 temper over trifles or indulging in abuse during the sacred month of Ramzan. If there is the slightest delay in serving the repast at the time of the breaking of the fast, the poor wife is hauled over live coals. I do not call it observing the Ramzan, but its travesty. If you really want to cultivate non-violence, you should take a pledge that come what may, you will not give way to anger or order about members of your household or lord it over them. You can thus utilize trifling little occa- sions in everyday life to cultivate non-violence in your own person and teach it to your children.
 He took another instance. Suppose somebody hit their child with a stone. Usually the Pathan tells his child not to return home to whine but to answer back with   a bigger stone. But a votary of non-violence, said Gandhiji, would tell his child not  to meet a stone by a stone but by embracing the boy who threw the stone and making friends with him.
 The same formula, i. e., to banish anger completely from the heart and to make everybody into one’s friend, is indeed enough to win India her independence. It is the surest and the quickest way, too, and it is my claim that for winning Independence for the poor masses of India, it is the only way.

204,"October 24, 1938",THE NATIONAL FLAG,"
    
Here is a letter from a correspondent:
 It has become a far too common occurrence and therefore deserving of notice at your hands to set up the national tri-coloured flag in such a manner as to indicate rivalry with or predominance over the religious flags and other symbols exhibited on occasions of religious worship and festivities. While we all desire that the national flag should be a symbol of unity and determination to achieve uninterrupted progress in all directions, we should be undoing this very purpose by trying to make rivalry between the national flag and other flags and symbols connected with religion which should predominate on occasions of religious ceremony. The enthusiasm of some of our workers leads them to error in this respect and in fact to develop an opposition in some quarters to the national flag which did not exist before. Sometimes, again, private interests and factions seek to make use of the
 national feeling in respect of the flag and exploit it for their own purposes by mixing up a quarrel with the national flag and confusing the issues in regard to incidents.
 It seems as if ever so many of the movements for which you were
 responsible are liable to be misconstrued and misdirected, unless you are always ready to re-explain, re-interpret and prevent misdirection. I particularly fear the consequences of doing anything to create a rivalry between the national flag and the religious symbols of either Hindus or Mussalmans or of others. The tendency of setting up the national flag on temple cars and temple towers offends my sense of the universality of religion and the incongruity of trying to nationalize God.
 As the author of the idea of a national flag and its make up which in essence the present flag represents, I have felt grieved how the flag has been often abused and how it has even been used to cover violence. The flag has been designed to represent non-violence ex- pressed through real communal unity and non-violent labour which the lowliest and highest can easily undertake with the certain prospect of making substantial and yet imperceptible addition to the wealth of the country. But today it must be confessed that from that standpoint it is merely a piece of tricolour cloth not always khadi and is not proud of [sic] and a living emblem of communal unity and equalizing labour in which all participate. The spinning-wheel does hum in thousands of village huts. But compared to what should be, the result is poor.
 Moreover the national flag, if it is a symbol of non-violence must also mean humility. If I had my way I would not exhibit it at any meeting which is not a purely Congress meeting if a single person objects to it. The dignity of the flag cannot be lowered by yielding even to a single objector at a non-Congress meeting. Its dignity will be lowered when it is hauled down for fear of the power we want to oust. The dignity will be still more lowered when we exhibit it at meetings or on Congress offices though we have no living faith in communal unity and the spinning-wheel with all its implications. Since the flag is not a religious symbol and represents and reconciles all religions, in religious processions, or temples or religious gatherings it has no  place. Everything has its value when it is in its place. It has none when it is out of its place. Bullion and banknotes have no value whatsoever in the desert of Sahara. Indeed in the present state of tension, I would not hoist it on Government buildings or municipal offices unless it is accepted not merely by an overwhelming vote but unanimously. I have no hesitation in saying that even one vote cast against it, maybe mischievously, should have its weight, if the flag is a symbol of non-violence and humility.
 My correspondent has evidently more faith in the power of my pen than I have. I write not because I believe that my word would carry weight where it is intended to carry. But I may not reject the correspondent’s appeal. His argument and facts I accept. I may not restrain myself simply because of the fear that my word may mis- carry. Anyway, it does me good to redeclare my faith in the flag with all the implications I have mentioned.

     MY 	DEAR IDIOT,  October 	24, 1938 
  	You must do with the pencil hand and on mill-made paper—the pencil 	does not move well on the glazed hand-made.  	Your two letters were awaiting me when we reached Bannu. ‘A 	Woman’s Letter’libtech_174_footnoteI 	may use for  Harijan.  Your Kathiawar thinglibtech_175_footnotewill go in this week with the last paragraph or two 	cut out.  	It is not likely that my articles on the European situation will 	bear fruit immediately. But they will, if India develops 	non-violence. There are grave doubts about its possibility. My own 	impurity is probably the chief stumbling-block. My word has lost its 	power as it appears to me. It should, according to my views of 	purity. However, I push on in faith. I must detach myself from the 	results of my thought, word or deed. I am not going to judge myself 	and condemn me to inactivity because I cannot get rid of the 	impurity in spite of incessant effort. Now perhaps you will 	understand my disbelief in my power to reach the woman’s heart. 	But this is a long story. So much has come in spontaneously. You 	won’t worry because I do not worry at all. I do not brood over my 	impurity. I see the snake is there. I know his fangs worse than a 	krait’s. I am therefore on my guard. The best test of no worry is 	my uniformly steady b. p.  	I wish you would show this to Mahadev. When I began the letter  I 	did not know that it would be a serious business. It is good in a 	way.     
 I have simply given you a few lines for love’s sake.
Love.

  	At the moment I have no pen and so I am writing with a pencil. 	Rather than write nothing, is it not better to write with a pencil 	and use even mill-made paper?  	I got both your letters on arrival here today. What you write about 	Kanti’s letter is correct. If I can, I will make use of it. I 	shall see. Rajkumari was to be shown that portion only, that is, the 	substance, so that she might be pleased to know that Kanti’s ideas 	were developing well.  	What you say about her—Rajkumari’s—virtues is correct. Such 	contacts serve to make us humble and increase our spirit of service. 	From this point of view, such occasions arising without our seeking 	should be welcomed. When I have completed the tour, we shall think 	about what you should do. We shall be leaving here on November 10 at 	the latest. It may even be sooner. Even that Lilavati will consider 	too late. I do feel, therefore, that if you like the place there, 	and Rajkumari is ready to stay and have you as her guest, you should 	stay on. Simla is really at its best in November-December. I do not 	believe it possible that you can start working by November 10. This 	rest will not be wasted. You are paying a long-accumulated debt and 	so, if not to Simla, you must go somewhere else for rest. You may 	consult Rajku- mari about Jullundur.

Chokhawala         THE 	EDITOR, 	Harijan  Sir,  I 	have read your articles on the recent European crisis with great 	joy. It was only natural that you should speak to Europe now.  How 	could you restrain yourself when humanity was on the very verge of 	destruction?  Will 	the world listen? That is the question.  There 	is no doubt—judging 	from letters from friends in 	England—that people 	there went through absolute agony during that ghastly week. I 	am sure the 	same applies 	to the 	whole world. The mere 	thought of 	war—modern warfare—with 	its devilish 	ingenuity and consequent 	pitiless butchery 	and bestiality—definitely 	made people think as 	they had 	never thought before. 	“The sigh of relief 	that was breathed and the gratitude to God that went up from every 	heart when the news came through 	that war had been averted 	are something 	that I 	can never 	forget as long 	as I 	live,” writes an 	English friend. 	And yet is 	it just the fear of 	unspeakable suffering, 	the dread 	of losing 	one’s nearest 	and dearest, 	of seeing 	one’s country humiliated, 	that cause one 	to detest war? Are we 	glad war has been averted even at the humiliation of another nation? 	Would we have 	felt differently if 	the sacrifice 	of honour 	had been 	demanded of us? Do we 	hate war because we realize it is the wrong way to settle disputes or is our hatred of it part and parcel of our fear? These are questions    
 that must be answered in the right way if war is really to vanish from the earth.
 The crisis over, however, what do we see? A more strenuous race than before for armaments, a more comprehensive and intensive organization than ever of all the resources available—of men, women, money, skill and talent— in the event of war ! No avowed declaration that “War shall not be” from anywhere! Is this not a recognition that war —however averted today—is still hanging over our heads as the proverbial sword of Damocles?
 To me, as a woman, it is painful to realize that my sex has not contributed to world peace the quota that should be ours by instinct and prerogative to contribute. It pains me to read and hear of women’s auxiliary corps being organized, of women being commandeered and volunteering to take their full share in the actual field as well as behind the lines. And yet, when war comes, it is the women’s hearts that are wrung in agony—it is their souls that are scarred beyond repair. It is all so inexplicable. Why is it that we have not chosen the better part through all the ages? Why have we, without murmur, bowed the knee to hideous, soulless, brute force? It is a sad commentary on our spiritual development. We have failed to understand our high calling. I am quite convinced that if women could only have a heart understanding of the power and glory of non-violence all would be well with the world.
 Why cannot you inspire and organize us, women of India? Why will you not concentrate on having us as your “sword arm”? How often have I longed for you to undertake an all-India tour just for this purpose? I believe that you would have a wonderful response, for the heart of Indian womanhood is sound and no women, perhaps in the world, have finer traditions of sacrifice and self-effacement behind them as we. Perhaps if you would make something of us we may, in however humble a manner, beable to show the way of peace to   a sorrowing and stricken world. Who knows?
 22-10-1938	A WOMAN
 I publish this letter not without hesitation. The correspondent’s faith in my ability to stir the woman heart flatters me. But I am  humble enough to recognize my limitations. It seems to me that the days of my touring are over. Whatever I can do by writing I must con- tinue. But my faith is increasing in the efficacy of silent prayer. It is by itself an art—perhaps the highest art requiring the most refined diligence. I do believe that it is woman’s mission to exhibit ahimsa at its highest and best. But why should it be a man to move the woman heart? If the appeal is addressed exclusively to me not as man but as the (supposed to be) best exponent of ahimsa to be practised on a mass scale, I have no urge in me to go about preaching the doctrine to the women of India. I can assure my correspondent that there is no want of will in me that deters me from responding to her appeal. My
 feeling is that if men of the Congress can retain their faith in ahimsa and prosecute the non-violence programme faithfully and fully, the women would be automatically converted. And it may be that there shall arise one among them who will be able to go much farther than I can ever hope to do. For woman is more fitted than man to make explorations and take bolder action in ahimsa. For the courage of self-sacrifice woman is any day superior to man as I believe man is to woman for the courage of the brute.

  	I have a letter from you after a long time. I am glad. Whenever you 	want you can come to Mahila Ashram after taking Jamnalalji’s 	permission. The rules are a bit changed now. I will reach Wardha 	pro- bably on November 12. I had seen Anand’s letter to Mahadev. 	As far as possible I avoid writing letters.  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	a microfilm of the Hindi. Courtesy: National Archives of India and 	Anand T. Hingorani         October 	25, 1938  	Perhaps you know that for over two months I have been observing 	complete silence. I have benefited by it, and I believe it has 	benefited the country too. The silence was originally taken in 	answer to an acute mental distress, but subsequently I decided to 	prolong it    
 indefinitely on its own merits. It has served me as a wall of protection and enabled me to cope with my work better than before. When I came to this province, I had resolved to relax my silence only for the purpose of having talks with the Khudai Khidmatgars, but I had to yield to Khan Saheb’s pressure.
 Your addresses have eulogized me and thanked me for having come here. I do not think I deserve any praise or thanks. I know that I can do very little to satisfy your expectations. My visit to the Frontier Province is purely to meet the Khudai Khidmatgars and know for myself their understanding of non-violence. Visit to your town is a by-product.
 I gave many hours today seeing deputations and  studying  papers presented to me. The recent raid of Bannu and the happenings during the raid have touched me deeply. This province is peculiarly placed, and is different from the other provinces inasmuch as on one side it is surrounded by a number of border tribes containing men whose profession is raiding. So far as I have been able to know they are not actuated by communal considerations. The raiders’ motive seems to be satisfaction of primary needs. That the Hindus are more often their victims is probably due to the fact that they generally possess more money. The kidnappings too appear to have the same motive.
 Continuation of the raids is in my opinion a proof of British failure in this part of India. Their Frontier policy has cost the country crores of rupees and thousands of lives have been sacrificed. The brave tribesmen still remain unsubdued. If all the accounts I have heard today are substantially correct, and I believe they are, life and property are not secure in most parts of the province.
 A number of people whose relations or dear ones have either been killed or kidnapped and held to ransom by the raiders, saw me today. As I listened to the harrowing tales of distress my heart went out to them in sympathy. But I must confess to you that with all the will in the world, I possess no magic spell by which I could restore them to their families. Nor should you expect much from the Govern- ment or the Congress ministry. No Government can afford, and the present British Government lacks even the will, to mobilize its military resources every time one of its subjects is  kidnapped, unless  the person kidnapped happens to belong to the ruling race.
 After studying all the facts I have gained the impression that the situation in respect of border raids has grown worse since the
 inauguration of Congress Government. The Congress Ministers have no effective control over the police, none over the military. The Con- gress ministry in this province has less than the others. I therefore feel that unless Dr. Khan Saheb can cope with the question of the raids it might be better for him to tender his resignation. There is danger of the Congress losing all prestige in this province if the raids continue to increase. Apart from my opinion, you have to say for yourselves whether in spite of the handicaps I have mentioned, you would rather have the Congress ministry or some other. After all, the Prime Minister is your servant. He holds office under the triple sufferance of his electorate, the Provincial Congress Committee and the Working Committee.
 Some of those who met me today asked me if they could seek safety by migrating from the Frontier Province. I have told them that migration is a perfectly legitimate course to adopt when there is no other way of living with safety and honour. A complaint has further been brought to me that the Muslim populations in the affected places no longer give help against the raiders which they used to formerly, before certain sections of Frontier Crime Regulation Act were repea- led, and that has encouraged the raiders. While that may be true, let me warn you that if you depend for your protection on the armed assistance of others you must be prepared sooner or later to accept the domination of these defenders. Of course you are entitled to learn the art of defending yourselves with arms. You must develop a sense of co-operation. In no case should you be guilty of cowardice Self- defence is everybody’s birthright. I do not want to see a single coward in India.
 The fourth alternative is that of non-violent approach which I am here before you to suggest. It is the surest and infallible method of self-defence. If I had my way, I would go and mix with tribes, and argue it out with them and I am sure they would not be impervious to the argument of love and reason. But I know today that door is shut to me. The Government won’t permit me to enter the tribal territory.
 The tribesman cannot be the bogey man that he is represented to be. He is a human just like you and me and capable of responding to the human touch which has hitherto been conspicuous by its absence in dealing with him. A number of Waziris came and saw me today at noon. I did not find that their nature was essentially different from human nature elsewhere.
 Man’s nature is not essentially evil. Brute nature has been known to yield to the influence of love. You must never despair of human nature. You are a community of traders. Do not leave out of your traffic that noblest and most precious of merchandise, viz., love. Give to the tribesmen all the love that you are capable of, and you will have theirs in return.
 To seek safety by offering blackmail or ransom to the raiders would be a direct invitation to them to repeat their depredations and will be demoralizing alike to the giver and the tribesmen. Instead of offering them money, the rational course would be to  raise  them above penury by teaching them industry and thereby removing the principal motive that leads them into the raiding habit.
 I am having talks with Khudai Khidmatgars in this connection and evolving a plan in collaboration with Khan Saheb. If the plan bears fruit, and the Khudai Khidmatgars truly become  what  their name signifies, the influence of their example like the sweet fragrance of the rose will spread to the tribes and might provide a permanent solution of the Frontier question.

 "
213,"October 26, 1938",TALK TO KHUDAI KHIDMATGARS,"
          BANNU, 
  [On or before October 26, 1938]libtech_179_footnote  Gandhiji 	explained the difference 	between non-violence of 	the strong 	and non-violence 	of the weak 	and the difference 	between constructive work, taken up 	as a philanthropic 	activity or as a 	political expedient, and 	constructive work 	linked to non-violence, 	when it 	becomes an 	emancipative force with 	tremendous potency. He 	recalled how the movement 	of non-violence 	was launched 	in India. 	Millions at that 	time felt that they would 	not be 	able to 	fight the 	British Government with 	the sword as 	the latter 	was infinitely 	better armed. He told 	them that even if they 	went forth to 	fight, sword in 	hand, they had to 	be ready to 	face death. 	If the 	sword broke in their 	hand, death would be 	a certainty. 	Why should 	not they 	then learn the art of 	dying without 	killing and 	pit against the 	enemy the strength of 	their spirit? The Government 	might imprison them 	or confiscate 	their property or 	even kill them. 	What did 	it matter? 	The argument 	went home. But 	in their 	heart of hearts, 	said Gandhiji, 	many had the feeling 	that if 	only they had sufficient 	armed strength 	they would 	resort to fighting. 	They accepted non-violence because there was 	nothing else. 	In other 	words, there was violence 	in the 	heart. Only it 	was given 	up in action. 	It was 	non-violence of the weak, not of the brave. Even so it had made them stronger. He    
 was there to tell them that it was a big mistake to regard non-violence as a weapon of the weak or to adopt it as such. If the Khudai Khidmatgars fell into that mistake, it would be a tragedy.
 If you give up the sword at Badshah Khan’s word, but retain it in your hearts, your non-violence will be a short-lived thing—not even a nine days’ wonder. After a few years you will want to revert to it but, maybe, you will then find that you have got out of the habit and are lost to both the ideals. Nothing will, in that event, remain to you but vain regret. What I want of you is a unique thing, i. e., that you will disdain to use the sword although you have got the capacity and there is no doubt as to victory. Even if the opponent is armed with a broken sword, you will oppose your neck to it. And this, not with anger or retaliation in your hearts but only love. If you have really understood non-violence in this sense, you will never want to use the  sword because you will have got something infinitely superior in its place.
 You will ask, ‘How will all this have any effect on the British Government?’ My reply is that by uniting all the people of India in a common bond of love through our selfless service, we can transform the atmosphere in the country so that the Britisher will not be able to resist it. You will say that the Britisher is impervious to love. My thirty years’ unbroken experience is to the contrary. Today 17,000 English- men can rule over three hundred millions of Indians because we are under a spell of fear. If we learn to love one another, if the gulf between Hindu and Muslim, caste and outcaste, and rich and poor, is obliterated, a handful of English would not dare to continue their rule over us.
 Just as there are laws of armed warfare, there are laws of non-violent warfare too. They have not been fully discovered. Under violence you punish the evil-doer, in non-violence you pity him, and regard him as a patient to be cured by your love.
 What must you do then to drive out the British by the non-vio- lent method? If you want to adopt the method of violence, you have to learn to drill and to become adept in the use of arms. In Europe and America even women and children are given that training. Simi- larly those who have adopted the weapon of non-vio-lence have to put themselves through a vigorous discipline in non-violence.
 And with that he came to the constructive programme and its place in the scheme of non-violence as a dynamic force. He had placed the programme of non-violence before the country in 1920, he explained. It was divided into two parts, non-co-operation and constructive programme. The latter included establishment of
 communal unity, abolition of untouchability, prohibition, complete eradication of the drink and drug evil and propagation of khadi, hand-spin-ning, hand-weaving and other cottage industries. But all these things had to be taken up not as a political expediency but as an integral part of the programme of non-violence. This last made all the difference. For instance, Hindu-Muslim unity regarded as an expedient was one thing and quite another when adopted as an integral part of non-violence.
 The former, by its very nature, cannot be lasting. It will be discarded as soon as the political exigency that suggested it is over. It may even be a stratagem or a ruse. When it is taken up as a part of the programme of non-violence it will have nothing but love at its root and will be sealed with one’s heart’s blood.
 In the same way the charkha or the spinning-wheel had to be linked to non-violence.
 Today there are millions of unemployed destitute in India. One way to deal with them is to allow them to die off so that, as in South Africa, there might be more per capita land for the survivors. That would be the way of violence. The other way, the way of non-violence,  is based on the principle of ‘even unto this last’. It requires us to have equal regard for the least of God’s creation. A votary of this path will deny to himself what cannot be shared with the least. That applies even to those who labour with their hands—the relatively better off among the labouring class must seek to align themselves with the less fortunate.
 It was this line of thinking, said Gandhiji, which had led to the discovery of the charkha on his part.
 I had not even seen a charkha when I first advocated its use. In fact I called it a handloom in Hind Swaraj, not knowing a spin- ning-wheel from a handloom. I had before my mind’s eye the poor, landless labourer without employment or means of subsistence, crus- hed under the weight of poverty. How could I save him—that was my problem. Even now while I am sitting with you in these comfortable surroundings, my heart is with the poor and the oppressed in their humble cottages. I would feel more at home in their midst.  If  I allowed myself to succumb to the love of ease and comfort, it would be my undoing as a votary of ahimsa. What is it then that can provide a living link between me and the poor? The answer is the charkha. No matter what one’s occupation or rank in life is, the charkha, taken with all that it signifies, will provide the golden bridge to unite him to the poor. For instance, if I am a doctor, while I draw the sacrificial thread it will make me think how I can assuage the suffering of the destitute
 
 instead of the royalty in rich palaces with the prospect of fat fees. The charkha is not my invention. It was there before. My discovery con- sisted in linking it to the programme of non-violence and inde- pendence. God whispered into my ear: ‘If you want to work through non-violence, you have to proceed with small things, not big.’ If we had worked the fourfold constructive programme in its completeness during the last twenty years as I had envisaged it, we should have been our masters today. No foreign power would have dared to cast its evil eye upon us. No enemy from outside would have dared to come and do us harm if there had been none within. Even if one had come we would have assimilated him to ourselves and he would not have been able to exploit us.
 It is this type of non-violence that I want you to attain. I expect you to be twenty-four-carat gold, nothing less. Of course, you can deceive me. If you do that, I shall blame myself only. But if you are sincere, you have to prove by your action that nobody need be afraid of a Red Shirt or know fear while there is a Red Shirt alive.

 October 26, 1938
 I tender my congratulations to His Highness, Her Highness and the Dewan for the general amnesty granted to civil disobedience prisoners in Travancore on the Maharaja’s birthday. It is to be hoped that in order to make the amnesty fruitful and peace permanent it will be followed up by the appointment of a committee of inquiry into past events and another into the nature of responsible government to be granted under the aegis of the Maharaja.
 There remain still allegations against the Dewan. I would repeat my suggestion for withdrawal. Withdrawal need not mean disbelief in their truth by the authorities. They should withdraw in the higher interest. The case for responsible government must not be mixed up with the allegations which pale into insignificance compared to the question of the transference of power into the hands of the people.

 I am here to tell you, with fifty years’ experience of non-vio- lence at my back, that it is an infinitely superior power as compared to brute force. An armed soldier relies on his weapons for his strength. Take away from him his weapons—his gun or his sword, and he generally becomes helpless. But a person who has truly realized the principle of non-violence has the God-given strength for his weapon and the world has not known anything that can match it. Man may, in a moment of unawareness forget God, but He keeps watch over him and protects him always. If the Khudai Khidmatgars have understood this secret, if they have realized that non-violence is the greatest power on earth, well and good; otherwise it would be better for Khan Saheb to restore to them their weapons which they have discarded at his instance. They will then be at least brave after the manner of the world that has today made the worship of brute force its cult. But if they discard their old weapons and at the same time remain strangers to the power of non-violence, it would be a tragedy for which I for one am not and, so far as I know, Khan Saheb too is not prepared.

 In the issue of Harijan dated 15th October there is something which concerns me in your article headed ‘Seven Complaints’. The complaint is that  I was taken in procession with music past a mosque during Jumma Prayers.
 Such a complaint was made directly to me and I issued a statement on October 12, a copy of which I am herewith enclosing.
 The procession passed the mosque when the prayers were over. Kazi Saheb Saiyad Mohammad Ali who led the prayers agrees that theprayers were over and that he was in some shop while the procession passed.

In a non-violent army the 	general is just the chief servant—first among equals. He claims no 	privilege over or superiority  to  the   rank  and  file.   You  	have   fondly   given   the title       
 ‘Badshah Khan’ to Khan Saheb. But if in his heart of hearts he  actually began to believe that he could behave like  an  ordinary general, it would spell his downfall and bring his power to an end. He is Badshah in the sense only that he is the truest and foremost Khudai Khidmatgar and excels all other Khudai Khidmatgars in the quality and quantity of service.
 The second difference between a military organization and a peace organization is that in the former the rank and file have no part in the choice of their general and other officers. These are imposed upon them and enjoy unrestricted power over them. In a non-violent army, the general and the officers are elected or are as if elected when their authority is moral and rests solely on the willing obedience of the rank and file.
 So much for internal relations between the general of a non- violent army and his soldiers. Coming to their relations with  the  outside world, the same sort of difference is visible between these two kinds of organizations. Just now we had to deal with an enormous crowd that had gathered outside this room. You tried to disperse it by persuasion and loving argument, not by using force and, when in the end we failed in our attempt, we withdrew and sought relief from it by getting behind closed doors in this room. Military discipline knows nothing of moral pressure.
 Let me proceed a step further. The people who are crowding outside here are all our friends though they are not Khudai Khid- matgars. They are eager to listen to what we may tell them. Even their indiscipline is a manifestation of their love. But there may be others besides them elsewhere who may not be well disposed towards us, who may even be hostile to us. In armed organizations, the only recog- nized way of dealing with such persons is to drive them out. Here, to consider the opponent, or, for the matter of that, anybody, even in thought, as your enemy would, in the parlance of non-violence or love, be called a sin. Far from seeking revenge, a votary of non-vio- lence would pray to God that He might bring about a change of heart of his opponent, and if that does not happen he would be prepared to bear any injury that his opponent might inflict upon him, not in a spirit of cowardice or helplessness, but bravely with a smile upon his face. I believe implicitly in the ancient saying that “non-violence real and complete will melt the stoniest hearts.”
 He illustrated his remarks by describing how Mir Alam Khan, his Pathan
 assailant in South Africa, had ultimately repented and become friendly.libtech_186_footnote
 This could not have happened if I had retaliated. My action can be fitly described as a process of conversion. Unless you have felt within you this urge to convert your enemy by your love, you had better retrace your steps; this business of non-violence is not for you.
 ‘What about thieves, dacoits and spoilers of defenceless women
 ?’ you will ask. Must a Khudai Khidmatgar maintain his non-violence in regard to them too? My reply is, most decidedly ‘Yes’. Punishment is God’s, Who alone is the infallible Judge. It does not belong to man “with judgment weak”. Renunciation of violence must not mean apathy or helplessness in the face of wrongdoing. If our non-violence is genuine and rooted in love, it ought to provide a more effective remedy against wrongdoing than the use of brute force. I certainly expect you to trace out the dacoits, show them the error of their ways and, in so doing, brave even death.

  	I have all your letters I think. Sushila has discussed with me your 	proposal about avoiding typhoid. She says there is no difference 	between Nayakum’s well and ours. She says the only safety lies in 	using only boiled water not merely for drinking but also for washing 	pots from which we eat and drink and uncooked fruits which [we] 	handle and eat. She thinks we ought to be able to ensure a proper 	supply of fool-proof boiled water. But when we meet we shall discuss 	all the suggestions you have made. Williams did send all the plans. 	But   I came to the conclusion that it was beyond us. In my opinion 	we must revert to my original plan. We must use buckets and turn 	night-soil into manure in some distant spot. Even so where we have 	water rising to the surface there is no absolute safety. I am 	writing this in the midst of a meeting. So no more. Love.  BAPU  From 	the original: C.W. 6410.

Who can say 	whether you are separated from me only by the thickness of nine to 	twelve inches of a wall or by a distance of miles and miles? And are 	there not people who feel near enough even though they may be 	separated by a distance of miles? This much is certain, however, 	that you will be so well restored through rest that you will get 	energy for more work. A still greater benefit will be that your life 	will become regular in every particular. Observe the hours of food 	and rest with as religious a strictness as you do the hours of 	prayers. Is not eating also for the sake of yajna only? In 	any case, it should be so. If you forget one yajna, you 	forget. all. As long as you like being there, you must stay on. My 	returning to Wardha must not concern you in any way just now. The 	solitude and comfort and good company that you are enjoying there, 	you will not be able to enjoy elsewhere. So stay there or at 	Jullundur. If Rajkumari feels that you are overstaying or if she has 	to go away somewhere else and therefore you cannot stay there, it 	will be a different matter.

 October 27, 1938
 CHI. CHHAGANLAL,
 I have gone through your note on the murder, etc., in Gunda. It has produced no effect on me. It is not enough to assert that the murder was not the result of a private feud. Did Savji take part in politics? Had he attracted anybody’s attention? Has there been a regular practice in Rajkot of beating up people in this manner? You should get—there should be—some evidence showing that the State authorities had some connection direct or indirect with the murder. You cannot jump to a conclusion on the basis of mere suspicion. The people will believe anything you say, but you should try and get evidence which would compel even opponents to believe the charge. Mere inference will not help. It also does not seem right to say that none of the culprits can be traced. And even if that is true, it does not warrant the conclusion that the State authorities had a hand in the murder. If, despite all efforts, the culprits cannot be traced, an inquiry should be held into the circumstances of the murder and the results should be placed before the public. Your beginning is almost hair- raising, but as one proceeds further one feels that this must be one of those incidents which are all too frequent in the world. But all this is only for your benefit. As for the world, it will go on as it has always done.

  	You have been forced to write to me after many years. The letter is 	full of news indeed. Continue to write in the same way. Assuming the 	report about the Nasik Police School to be true, I have written a 	note on it. Also talk to Kherlibtech_196_footnoteor Munshilibtech_197_footnoteif you happen to meet them. If 	the officials there do not work sincerely for enforcing      
 prohibition, the Ministers should protest to the Governor in strong language. But they must be convinced that the officials do not have the heart in the work.
 About lands, I had written even before I received Vallabhbhai’s letter. Send me a report of the debate on the subject in the Assembly.
 I have not said that no steps can be taken against pornographic literature. I did give my opinion. Of course, I am afraid that people have come to like obscene literature and it cannot, therefore, be easily stopped. It will stop only when learned men themselves are disgusted with such literature. I do believe that pornographic writings should be stopped by law if it can be done. But please remember that there is a great difference between forcing students to read such things and the publication of obscene writing in newspapers.
 What is happening in Rajkot is wonderful. If the tempo is kept up, there is no doubt that the people will get what they want. Father has done the correct thing in regard to Travancore. There was no harm in his having called Ramachandran. Before Father’s letter arrived,  however, I had already issued my statementlibtech_198_footnote. I feel that it was necessary to issue one. Now there is no immediate need to go to Travancore.
 The constant flow of mucus from the nose into the throat is not at all good. It must be stopped.
 I understand about Baroda. Let me know what happens in Bhadaran.
 I hope to reach Wardha about the 15th. The tour here will be over by the 9th.
 What is happening regarding Subhas Babu is not out of my mind. That is why I discussed it in the Working Committee. But Father was of the view that we should wait till Jawaharlal’s arrival, so I kept silent. There is bound to be some difficulty this time in electing the President.

 I got your letter. You have my blessings, of course, for the New Year’s Day and for the whole year.
 I was certainly pained when I heard about your desire to give up public service. But I consoled myself with the thought that you would do nothing without thinking. What guidance can I give you? Don’t do anything through false shame or under pressure from anybody. Do only as much as the strength of your heart permits. There is no sin at all in giving up public service and working for money. Doing service is not something that everybody can digest. If we eat anything that causes indigestion, it cannot but result in disease. It would be much better instead, to eat only what one can digest.
 It is good indeed that for the present you are staying on. Maybe, by and by, your economic condition will cease to trouble you. Please remember that it is good to live in poverty. Poverty shapes a man’s character. In plenty one does not know at all where one is going. Moreover, most of the world lives in poverty. We see very few living in plenty. I have never envied such people. Sometimes I pity them.

It 	is a gentleman’s pledge, each member being put upon his or her 	honour as to the interpretation of the expression ‘the best part 	of my    
 energy and talents to the furtherance of its object which is the all- round welfare of the villagers of India’.
 Members are also pledged not only to work for the furtherance of the object but also ‘to strive to live up to the ideals’ and ‘prefer the use of village manufactures to any other’.
 Recommending members of the Board will therefore see to it that the candidate for membership has, in everything he does, the welfare of the villagers at heart. It follows that such a person will give to village work at least some time every day not necessarily in villages but may be for villages. Thus a member living in a city, who on a particular day sells to or induces a person to buy village manufactures, has done some village work for that day.
 The member recommending will also see to it that the candidate wherever possible uses articles of village manufacture, e.g., khadi in the place of mill-cloth, village earthen pots instead of factory-made china, reed-pen instead of steel-pen, handmade paper instead of ordinary paper, wholesome babul or neem or such other tooth-brush instead of the very insanitary and injurious tooth-brush, leather goods made in villages out of village-flayed cattle instead [of] tanned hide, the ordinary village gur instead of factory sugar, hand-pounded whole rice instead of mill-polished rice, etc.
 For Ku
 The Board would draw the attention of agents, workers and the public to the importance of dead cattle hide as an article of trade and village manufacture. Workers are advised to study in their own areas the method of disposal of the dead cattle and its preparation from flaying to tanning and report to the Board their observations. Public are invited to prefer the use of only such leather goods as are pre- pared in the villages.

 This 	is just when we are ready to start. What 	is the difference between radio news and the paper news? 
 Both are equally unreliable. My health has suffered no set-back. I am inclined to think that I can flourish even in midwinter. But I may be over-enthusiastic. The rest from Mahadev.

  	I have told Brijkrishna to write to you every day. He alone knows 	how much love and interest he pours in what he writes.  	I cannot give you quite definitely the date of our departure. We are 	trying to leave on the 9th from Kambalpur or Rawalpindi or Taxila. 	You should reach Delhi latest by the 10th. It will be better if you 	can reach on the 9th.  	I will not let you stay in Wardha just now. I like the idea of a sea 	voyage, with Durga and Babla accompanying you, unless Durga likes 	and wants to stay at Bulsar. I should like you to make a trip as far 	as Singapore. You may even spend a few days in Singapore. You should 	resume work on January 20 at the earliest. If you wish to write any- 	thing in the mean while, you may do so. I have no fear at all of 	your time being wasted anywhere. And you will return to work a 	fitter man.  	I am allowing your notes to go as they are. Ask back the article 	about Massingham. It is very fine indeed. It is poetry, but it is 	not for Harijan. Moreover, though there is poetry in it, it 	contains nothing of value to learn from our point of view. Is there 	anything common between their villages and our villages? Even at the 	time when those villages were formed, the people there were armed 	pirates and free booters. The villages were signs of this fact. Our 	villages are so many dung-hills. The king took interest in them only 	for the purpose of robbing them. The Vaishyas only gathered money. 	The Shudras and Atishudras slaved. Your article, therefore, can 	provide us no inspi- ration. Would it not be sheer ignorance for any 	superficial observer to see poetry in  our villages? And if  you  	take   out  extracts  from  the 
 Vedas and place them beside extracts from modern English, we would have to hang our heads in shame. Elaborate this criticism of mine further and understand my point. If there is any error in my view, let me know. I read the article today at three in the morning. But you may send it to Modern Review or the Hindustan Times if you wish.
 We have to march out immediately. I am writing  this  while eating. I am eating fruit with a fork.

 Theylibtech_207_footnotelibtech_208_footnotefeel that the existence of a microscopic Hindu minority in the midst of the predominantly Mussalman population in this area can be rendered possible only if the latter will be as true hamsayas— neighbours—to them and they have asked me to appeal to Khudai Khidmatgars to fulfil their natural role in respect of them. I entirely endorse their feeling and their appeal and I am convinced that it is within your power to set them at their ease if you will but fulfil the expectations you have raised in me. As I observed on a previous occasion, the Hindus, the Mussalmans and the Englishmen in this pro- vince are being weighed in the balance. History will record its verdict about the Englishmen’s deeds. But Hindus and Mussalmans can write their own history by being correct in their mutual dealings. For the Khudai Khidmatgars their course of action has  been determined. They have to become a living wall of protection to their neighbours.
 A small body of determined spirits fired by an unquenchable faith in their mission can alter the course of history. It has happened before and it may again happen if the non-violence of Khudai Khid- matgars is unalloyed gold, not mere glittering tinsel.

 TANK,
  October 	31, 1938  	If in your heart of hearts there is the slightest inclination to 	regard your non-violence as a mere cloak or a stepping-stone to 	greater  violence  as  suggested  by  this  friendlibtech_210_footnotelibtech_211_footnote,  nay,  unless  you   are prepared to carry your 	non-violence to its ultimate logical conclusion and to pray for 	forgiveness even for a baby-killer and a child-mur- derer, you 	cannot sign your Khudai Khidmatgar’s pledge of non- violence. To 	sign that pledge with mental reservations would only bring disgrace 	upon you, your organization and hurt him whom you delight to call 	the Pride of Afghans.  	But what about the classical instance of the defenceless sister or 	mother who is threatened with molestation by an evil-minded ruffian, 	you will ask. Is the ruffian in question to be allowed to work his 	will? Would not the use of violence be permissible even in such a 	case? My reply is ‘no’. You will entreat the ruffian. The odds 	are that in his intoxication he will not listen. But then you will 	interpose yourself between the intended victim and him. Very 	probably you will be  killed but you will have done your duty. Ten 	to one, killing you unarmed and unresisting will assuage the 	assailant’s passion and he will leave his victim unmolested. But 	it has been said to me that tyrants do not act as we want or expect 	them to. Finding you unresisting he may tie you to a post and make 	you watch his rape of the victim. If you have the will you will so 	exert yourself that you will break yourself in the attempt or break 	the bonds. In either case, you will open the eyes of the wrongdoer. 	Your armed resistance could do no more, while if you were worsted, 	the position would likely be much worse than if you died 	unresisting. There is also the chance of the intended victim copying 	your calm courage and immolating herself rather than allowing 	herself to be dishonoured.  Harijan, 	19-11-1938

 It has touched me deeply and also humbled me to find that at a time when, owing to the Ramzan fast, not a kitchen fire was lit in the whole of this village of Mussalman homes, food had to be cooked for us in this place. I am past the stage when I could fast with you as I did in South Africa to teach the Mussalman boys who were under my care to keep the Ramzan fast.

  	I hope you are bringing credit to me and yourself there. Give no 	thought to my experiment. I have started the experiment to be able 	to render greater service to womankind. That includes you. In a note 	written in jest and a little anger, I called you ‘Lila’. You 	liked it. Your father used to call you ‘Lili’, and so you 	demanded that I should also call you ‘Lili’. For, you had 	started showing me the same affection as you did for your father. 	That alone would make your love for me greater than that for your 	father. If you cannot understand this, ask Mahadev. Replying to one 	of his letters, I had told him that I would call you ‘Lili’ when 	I had qualified myself to do  that.  This experiment is also to gain 	that eligibility because you are also  a woman. While being there, 	think that you are with me not because you have gone there to do 	your work, but because I have sent you there to do my work. And my 	work means that you should relieve Mahadev’s burden as much as 	possible. Hence, do not waste Mahadev’s time talking about your 	happiness or unhappiness. Your duty is to go on     
 doing unquestioningly whatever work Mahadev or Durga may entrust to you or what you can carry out yourself. And you will do your work silently because I cannot give you here what you would be able to learn there. It is true that you cannot gain there what you can gain here. But since I have sent you there to do my work, you will easily get the benefit of having stayed with me.
 Eat well and build up your body. If you do that you can occasionally come here for a brief visit. But do not keep waiting for opportunities to come here. Devote yourself to putting things in per- fect order there. You have got to give time to Bablo. Do write to me whenever you wish. And whenever you write, try to make your handwriting beautiful. Do not write with a pencil. And do not follow Mahadev’s example of writing with a fountain-pen. I tolerate Maha- dev’s fountain-pen because Mahadev is a scribe. You are not a scribe and are not going to be one. So, I shall not, and I should not tolerate the fountain-pen in your case.

          PANIALA, 
  [November 1, 1938]libtech_215_footnote  	I have now had the assurance from your own lips of what I had from 	Khan Saheb already. You have adopted non-violence not merely as a 	temporary expedient but as a creed for good. Therefore, mere 	renunciation of the sword, if there is sword in your heart, will not 	carry you far. Your renunciation of the sword cannot be said to be 	genuine unless it generates in your hearts a power the opposite of 	that of the sword and superior to it. Hitherto revenge or 	retaliation has been held amongst you as a sacred obligation. If you 	have a feud with anybody, that man becomes your enemy for all time 	and the feud is handed down from father to son. In non-violence even 	if somebody regards you as his enemy you may not so regard him in 	return, and of course there can be no question of revenge. Who could 	be more cruel or blood-thirsty than the late Gen. Dyer? Yet the 	Jallianwala Bagh Congress Inquiry Committee, on my advice, had 	refused to ask for his prosecution. I had no trace of ill will 	against him in my heart. I would have also liked to meet him 	personally and reach his heart, but that was to remain a mere 	aspiration.  At 	the end 	of his talk 	he was presented a poser 	by one of the Khudai 	Khidmatgars who 	had followed his 	address closely: “You 	expect us to protect 	the Hindus 	against the 	raiders and yet you  tell us  that we  may  not 	 employ  our weapons 	even against 	thieves and dacoits. 	How can the two go 	together?” Gandhiji 	replied:  	The contradiction is only apparent. If you have  really assimilated 	the non-violent spirit, you won’t wait for the raiders to appear 	on the scene, but will seek them out in their own territory and 	prevent the raids from taking place. If even then a raid does take 	place, you will face the raiders and tell them that they can take 	away all your belongings but they shall touch the property of your 	Hindu neighbours only over your dead body. And if there are hundreds 	of Khudai Khidmatgars ready to protect the Hindu hamsayas with 	their lives, the raiders will certainly think better of butchering 	in cold blood     
 all the innocent and inoffensive Khudai Khidmatgars who are non-violently pitched against them. You know the story of Abdul Quadir Jilani and his forty gold mohurs with which his mother had sent him to Baghdad. On the way the caravan was waylaid by robbers who proceeded to strip Abdul Quadir’s companions of all their belon- gings. Thereupon Abdul Quadir, who so far happened to be untou- ched, shouted out to the raiders and offered them the forty gold mohurs which his mother had sewn into the lining of his tunic. The legend goes that the raiders were so struck by the simple naivete of the boy, as the saint then was, that they not only let him go untouched but returned to his companions all their belongings.

 PESHAWARlibtech_221_footnote

 Do not be misled by names. A piece of Japanese cloth cannot become swadeshi merely by being labelled ‘Swadeshi’. Only an arti- cle that is wholly manufactured in India by the hands of millions of villagers and out of raw materials grown in India deserves the name of swadeshi.
 Khadi alone, it will be seen, fully satisfies this test; all other cloth is a travesty of swadeshi. Just as there can be no dawn without the sun, so there can be no genuine swadeshi without khadi.
 Judged by this test, Peshawar is left far behind in the race for swadeshi. There is only one khadi bhandar here and that too is being run at a loss. I hope that one result of this Exhibition will be to put the khadi bhandar on a firm footing, and to preclude the possibility of its having to close down.

 Dr. Gopichand has thanked the Ministers for the help that they are giving to khadi work. But I find that neither all the Ministers nor all of the Congress M. L. A.s here use khadi as habitual wear. Some wear it only in the Assembly. Some do not do even that. This is contrary to both the spirit and the letter of the Congress constitution. Even the Red Shirts have yet to become khadi-clad.       If they all
 take to khadi, the one lakh of them will in less than no time make the whole province khadi-clad. This province is rich in the resources for the manufactures of khadi but it comes last in respect of khadi work
 
 actually done.
 I would like you all to visit the Exhibition in a spirit of inquiry and study. Khadi organization work, unlike textile mill industry, does not require lakhs of capital and highly specialized technical skill.  Even a layman can take it Up.

 The following noteslibtech_224_footnotelibtech_225_footnotewere prepared for me by Shri Rajkumari Amrit Kaur on finishing her recent tour in Kathiawar for Harijan and khadi work. The notes are valuable not only for the workers in Kathiawar, but contain reflections which are of all-India importance. I hope that workers will profit by the experiences recorded by the Raj- kumari. There is one suggestion she has made, which can be immediately given effect to, if what she says of the Princes is true, as I think it is. She has credited the Princes with the opinion that they have no belief in untouchability and that they will fling open all temples to Harijans, if their people desired it. Her suggestion, therefore, is that they need not wait for any expression of opinion on the part of their people but should build and open temples which are accessible to all. The Princes can make it a point of visiting only these temples to the exclusion of those whose gates are barred against Harijans. And if these temples are built and situated attractively and are well managed, they will be a powerful aid to the breaking down of untouchability. It is possible to extend the principle to all the institutions which, for fear of wounding orthodox susceptibility, they would not dare to open to Harijans. This is the line of least resistance. There is not much mean- ing in a pious declaration of disbelief in untouchability, if the princes cannot or will not take the cautious step suggested by the Rajkumari.

 AUNDH REFORMS
 I congratulate both the Rajasaheb and the people of Aundh on the grant of responsible government. This small State has always been progressive. The ruler of Aundh has but anticipated the wants of his people and has even been in advance of them in social matters. The declaration of full responsibility was the natural result of the past acts of the ruler. I hope that the rights conferred by the proclamation will not in any way be whittled down in drawing up the constitution. I would suggest that the privy purse should on no account exceed rupees thirty-six thousand. There should be a definition of funda- mental rights, i. e., equality of all in the eye of the law, abolition of untouchability and liberty of speech. The last para of the proclama- tion is appealing. It truly says that“self-government implies self- con- trol and self-sacrifice”, and adds: “in the new era that is coming to Aundh, and we hope to the whole of our country, the strong will serve the weak, the wealthy will serve the poor, the learned will serve the illiterate.”
 It is to be hoped that the noble example of Aundh will be  copied by the other States and that its people will by their conduct prove themselves in every way worthy of the responsibility that is to devolve on them. The fact that in the heir to the gadi they have one who, from all accounts I have received, is a true servant of the people,
 
 must be a great help at the time of the inauguration of responsible government. The Western education received by him has not spoiled him. He is reported to be a votary of truth and ahimsa. He himself takes part in village uplift, does road cleaning himself in common with other volunteers and handles the spade and the basket with as much ease as they. He wields the pen. He takes pride  in  doing  the scavenging work including the removal of night-soil.
 ARYA SAMAJ AND FILTHY LITERATURE
 Shri Dharma Dev Shastri of Kanya Gurukul, Dehra Dun, and then Acharya Dev Sharma Abhaya of Gurukul Kangri have written to me to say that my reference in my article “Filth in Literature”libtech_226_footnotelibtech_227_footnoteto my daughter-in-law, who is studying in the Kanya Gurukul and who wrote to me about the filth she found in certain text-books prescribed for her examination, has been interpreted in some quarters to mean that the Arya Samaj authorities countenance such literature. Both  the friends repudiate the suggestion in emphatic terms. Acharya Dev Sharma Abhaya tells me that the Gurukul authorities were so meti- culous about the matter that even for the works of classical poets like Kalidas they insisted on expurgated editions being printed before they would allow their students to study even a celebrated classic like Shakuntala. What has, however, happened is that, of late, they have allowed their students to prepare for Sahitya Sammelan examinations which tolerates books containing unclean literature. I understand that the Gurukul authorities have brought the matter to the notice of the Sammelan management and asked them to withdraw the text-books which contain objectionable references. I hope that they will not rest satisfied till they have succeeded in their battle against unclean literature forming part of students’ text-books.
 TO CORRESPONDENTS
 No matter what warnings I issued, my correspondence is daily growing. Even at the risk of a breakdown, I cannot cope with the whole of it. Nor can Pyarelal, even though he often burns midnight oil. Though Mahadev Desai is decidedly on the mend and is even being permitted to write what he feels impelled to and can  write without an effort, he cannot be given any correspondence to deal with. I must not put his health in jeopardy again. Even a well regulated life
 
 like his has limitations which must not be disregarded. It is therefore a question if he can ever again be burdened with correspondence which is not strictly connected with Harijan. Let the readers, please, recog- nize my difficulty. I have a file of papers unread. Some has been read and remains undisposed of. Thus there are long statements complain- ing against the Bihar Ministers, longer still from Malabar complaining against Rajagopalachari. I have cursorily glanced through them. I am wholly unable to deal with them. I may not even send them to the accused Ministers unless I am prepared to give the necessary time to them. I have neither the time nor the inclination. The Working Com- mittee is the proper tribunal for such matters. If I began to handle such complaints it would be an unwarranted interference with the Ministers concerned and with the functions of the Working Committee.
 But this solid reason for non-interference is irrelevant to this note. The decisive reason is my utter inability. Therefore, these and such correspondents will forgive me for not even sending them per- sonal acknowledgements. Then, there are letters complaining against the fancied or real misdeeds of Congress Committees in various pro- vinces. These correspondents attribute to me powers and influence I do not possess. But here again the physical inability is the pere- mptory cause for my silence. Then there is the unread correspon- dence. Heaven knows what is contained in it. There are, too, personal letters which I would gladly deal with if I could. I know I can give some help or comfort to these correspondents, if I can deal with their letters as I should like to. As it is, I must plead my inability to handle such correspondence. What energy I have left in me has to be reserved for the general causes which, I fancy, I can still serve. Therefore, correspondents who are awaiting answers will forgive me if they never receive any reply. These who are in the habit of writing to me will help me much if they will restrict their correspondence only to such questions as may lend themselves to discussion or advice through the columns of Harijan. In other words Harijan should, as far as possible, be my only letter or message to those who seek to know my views on matters which interest them and which are also of importance to the public.

260,"November 5, 1938",WHY NOT GREAT POWERS?,"
    
 In the criticisms on my recent writings on the plight of Czecho- slovakia,libtech_228_footnoteI have observed one thing which demands ananswer.
 Some critics argue that if the non-violent remedy I have sugge- sted for the Czechs is only for comparatively weak because small nations like them and not for the great powers like England or France or America, it cannot be of much value, if any.
 Now if the critics will reread my article, they will see that I have refrained from suggesting it to these big powers because of their bigness, in other words, because of my timidity. But there was a more potent reason for my not addressing them. They were not in distress and therefore in no need of any remedy. To use a medical-expression, they were not ailing as Czechoslovakia was. Their existence was not threatened as Czechoslovakia’s was. Any appeal from me therefore to the great powers would have amounted to an empty and unwanted sermon.
 By experience I have also found that people rarely become virtuous for virtue’s sake. They become virtuous from necessity. Nor is there anything wrong in a man becoming good under pressure of circumstances. It would be no doubt better if he becomes good for its own sake.
 The Czechs were given a choice either to surrender peacefully to Germany’s might or to fight single-handed and risk almost certain destruction. It was at this moment that it became necessary for one like me to present an alternative which had proved its effectiveness under somewhat similar circumstances. My appeal to the Czechs was in my opinion as appropriate as it would have been inappropriate in the case of the great powers.
 My critics might have, however, well asked why I had gone out of my self-prescribed orbit to speak to a Western nation when I could not show cent per cent success of non-violence on the Indian soil,— more especially now, when I had begun to entertain serious doubts as to whether Congressmen were really living up to their creed or policy of non-violence. Indeed I had in mind the limitation and the present state of uncertainty about the Congress position. But my own faith in
 
 the non-violent remedy was as bright as ever when I wrote that article. And I felt that in the supreme hour of its trial it would be cowardly on my part not to suggest to the Czechs the non-violent remedy for acceptance. What may ultimately prove impossible of acceptance by crores of people, undisciplined and unused till but recently to corpo- rate suffering, might be possible for a small, compact, disciplined nation inured to corporate suffering. I had no right to arrogate to myself any belief that India alone and no other nation was fit for non-violent action. I must confess that I have believed and still believe that India was the fittest nation to enforce non-violent action for regaining her freedom. In spite of signs to the contrary, I have the hope that the whole mass of people, who are more than the Congress, will respond only to non-violent action. They are the readiest of all the nations of the earth for such action. But when a case for imme- diate application of the remedy presented itself before me, I could not restrain myself from suggesting it to the Czechs for their acceptance.
 It is however open to the great powers to take it up any day and cover themselves with glory and earn the eternal gratitude of posterity. If they or any of them could shed the fear of destruction, if they disarmed themselves, they will automatically help the rest to regain their sanity. But then these great powers have to give up imperialistic ambitions and ex-ploitation of the so-called uncivilized or semi-civilized nations of the earth and revise their mode of life. It means a complete revolution. Great nations can hardly be expected in the ordinary course to move spon-taneously in a direction the reverse of the one they have followed, and according to their notion of value, from victory to victory. But miracles have happened before and may happen even in this very prosaic age. Who can dare limit God’s power of undoing wrong? One thing is certain. If the mad race for  armaments continues, it is bound to result in a slaughter such as has never occurred in history. If there is a victor left the very victory will be a living death for the nation that emerges victorious. There is no escape from the impending doom save through a bold and unconditional acceptance of the non-violent method with all its glorious implications. Democracy and violence can ill go together. The States that are today nominally democratic have either to become frankly totalit-arian or, if they are to become truly democratic, they must become courageously non-violent. It is a blasphemy to say that non-violence can only be practised by individuals and  never  by nations which are com-posed of individuals.

  	Evidently you had the call perhaps at the same hour that I felt you 	will have it. As far as my recollection goes, I wrote to you also 	that if you felt the urge I would let you go. Of course the idea 	origi- nated not with me, but with Rajkumari; and I wrote to her 	suggesting that she should write to you directly. But in view of 	your letter, all this becomes past history. We will discuss ways and 	means when I am there which I hope will be on the 11th. I hope I 	shall find Agatha there on my arrival. If the final decision is for 	you to go, what I feel is that the sooner you can go the better, if 	you can stand the continental winter. I do not want you to risk your 	health. It may be that if you reconcile yourself to sterile eggs you 	might be able to stand the cold better, but of course you shall be 	the sole judge.  	I am already moving with reference to the financial part of it. I 	have relaxed temporarily the silence rule. Hence I have been able to 	dictate this while munching grapes. Love.

  	Your decision to stay on is all right. I like it too and I certainly 	liked the idea about a sea voyage. I like Kallenbach’s suggestion 	very much indeed. You may go and see the field of my battles. I 	should like you very much to see Phoenix, Tolstoy Farm, the house in 	which  I used to stay in Durban, the Johannesburg office, etc. 	Manilal will dance with joy. But it might be difficult to take Durga 	and Bablo as far as that. I should like Bablo to remain with me. And 	moreover, a visit to South Africa would mean at least four months. 	South Africa is not less big than India. Go and see the four 	Colonies. And you must 
 not miss the Victoria Falls. When you go so far, you cannot return immediately. It is worth going there even if only for the sake of meeting Miss Schlesin. Kallenbach will perhaps have a time that he will remember for ever. The climate there is beyond praise. Think over it. If you feel inclined, I am certainly ready to send you.
 If Mirabehn wishes to go, I am ready to let her go. Her going can do no harm at all. While she has to suppress herself with me, in the West she can work independently. There is no limit to her courage.
 I completely forgot to write to you about Muirhead. If I had had some talk, I would certainly have written to you. But I think he did not have the courage to discuss anything with me. Or maybe his only aim was to see me. I gave him no encouragement at all. I had no desire to. What was there to talk about? If the corruption in the Congress can be got rid of, we can get swaraj today without any dis- cussion with anybody. If it is not got rid of, swaraj is an impossibility.  I will stop my pen now.

 CHI. MATHURADAS,
 I can find nothing wrong in your letter. I am convinced that the Congress is on the decline. Falsehood, violence, intrigue and selfish- ness are growing. The present seems to be the time when those who are devoted to the twin doctrines of truth and non-violence should serve the Congress from outside. I am writing frankly that if there is no improvement, the Congress will lose even my moral support and I will stop guiding it. But I will not use coercion. God Himself will make my way clear.
 You must express your views firmly and if you want to come out you should do so. You must continue in the municipality only if you can control it naturally. But do not ruin yourself. There are countless activities for a pure-hearted person like you. Rather than involve yourself in dirty things I would prefer that you lived a private life and
 earned a living by honest means. Whenever you feel convinced about your duty to leave, do so. The future is in the hands of God.

 Gandhiji, in  a  witty  little  speech,  while  thanking  them  for  the  honour that they had done him, observed that he was hardly entitled to that privilege, in the first place because, as they all knew, he had been disbarred by his own Inn, and, secondly, because he had long forgotten his law. Of late he had more often been engaged in breaking laws than in expounding or interpreting them in the courts of the land. Still another and, perhaps, his most vital  reason  was  his  peculiar views about lawyers and doctors which he had recorded in his booklet, The Indian Home Rule. A true lawyer, he told them, was one who placed truth and service in the first place and the emoluments of the profession in the next place only. He did not know whether they had all adopted that ideal but if they pledged themselves to render service through their legal acumen in an altruistic spirit, he would be the first to pay them his homage.

  	The Khudai Khidmatgars is an organization with its headqu- arters at 	Utmanzai. Anyone who signs their pledge and can speak Pushtu can 	enrol himself as a Khudai Khidmatgar.

You are, therefore, absolutely free to enrol as Khudai Khidmatgars 	if you like and no special permission is needed for it.  	The Khudai Khidmatgars have proved their undoubted capacity for 	organization. The presence of a picked body of Khudai Khidmat- gars 	at a public meeting makes all the difference between order and 	disorder. The principle of non-violence requires that they should 	make the people do, through their power of love, all those things 	that the police does through the power of the lathi and the 	bullet. When the seed of love sprouts forth in our hearts our petty 	quarrels and mutual bickerings will become things of the past.

 treatment of the injured animal. One of our  party  showed  what seemed to me as unseemly haste in naming the so-called opponents as the deliberate authors of the accident. In non-violence, we must not be in a hurry to ascribe motives to the opponent or regard him with suspicion unless we have proof positive for it. When love fills the hearts of the Khudai we shall have independence. But independence will not come to Khidmatgars us till our love shines out in our littlest acts.
 We must send someone to the place where the accident occurred, to offer compensation to the owner of the animal and to take the calf for treatment to a vet.

          MANSEHRA, 
  [November 8, 1938]libtech_241_footnote  	It has become the fashion these days to say that society cannot be 	organized or run on non-violent lines. I join issue on that point. 	In  a family, when a father slaps his delinquent child, the latter 	does not think of retaliating. He obeys his father not because of 	the deterrent     
 effect of the slap but because of the offended love which he senses behind it. That in my opinion is an epitome of the way in which society is or should be governed. What is true of family must be true of society which is but a larger family. It is man’s imagination that divides the world into warring groups of enemies and friends. In the ultimate resort it is the power of love that acts even in the midst of the clash and sustains the world.
 I am told that the Red Shirts here are Red Shirts only in name. I hope the allegation is baseless. I know that Khan Saheb is seriously disturbed at the infiltration of the Khudai Khidmatgar movement by undesirable and self-seeking elements. I share with him this feeling that mere accession of numbers, unless they are true exponents of the creed which they profess, will only weaken instead of adding strength to the movement.
 The Red Shirt movement today has drawn attention of the whole of India and even outside. And yet what it has achieved is only a small fraction of what has to be achieved. I implicitly accept the assurance given by the Khudai Khidmatgars that they are anxious to understand and practise the doctrine of non-violence in full. There are tremen- dous heights lying before them still to be scaled. The programme of constructive non-violence that I have placed before them is self-acting when it is once started well. Its enforcement will be a sure test too of the earnestness and sincerity of the Khudai Khidmatgars.

 Gandhiji replying assured them that he set great store by what they had already achieved in the field of non-violence. But believing as he did in the old adage that from him who gives much more is expected, he warned them that he would not rest satisfied till they had fulfilled their mission of achieving through their non-violence not only their own freedom but the freedom of India.

 Gandhiji in reply told them that whilst he could support their demand that licences for keeping fire-arms should be freely issued on application, it would be too much to expect the Government to distribute fire-arms free amongst the entire border population. They could raise a fund for free distribution of fire-arms if they wanted, but he had his doubts whether free distribution of and training in the use of fire-arms would solve the question of transborder insecurity. If the experience during the recent raid at Bannu was any guide, such a step would prove to be an expensive pedantry. During the Bannu raid, he was told, only one gun on the part of the citizens was in play although there was no lack of fire-arms in the city at the time of the raid and even that gun occasioned more casualties among the public than among the raiders. He, however, agreed with them with regard to what they had observed about the duty of the majority community.

 I thank you for the address that you have presented to me. You have in your address expressed your gratification at having in your midst ‘the greatest man on earth’. I wondered as I listened to your address as to who that gentleman could be. Certainly it could not be I.  I  know too well my shortcomings. There is a  celebrated story  told
 
 about Solon the great law-giver of Athens. He was asked by Croesus, who was reputed to be the wealthiest man of his age, to name the happiest man on earth. Croesus had fondly hoped that Solon would name him. But Solon replied that he could say nothing as no one could be adjudged happy before his end. If Solon found it difficult to pronounce on a man’s happiness during his lifetime, how much more difficult it must be to adjudge on a man’s greatness? True greatness in the world is not found set upon a hill, for the vulgar crowd to see. On the contrary, my seventy years’ experience has taught me that the truly great are often those of whom and of whose greatness the world knows nothing during their lifetime. God alone is judge of true greatness, because He knows men’s hearts. . . .
 Not only the inhabitants of Abbottabad but even the sun, the moon and the stars here were eager to have a glimpse of me! Am I to understand, my good friends, that your city has all to itself a set of sun, moon and stars which do not shine upon Wardha or Segaon? In Kathiawar we have a class of people known as Bhats or professional bards who make it their job to sing the praises of their chieftains for money. Well, I won’t call you Bhats. Banter apart, I want  you  to realize the mistake of indulging in hyperbolic praises of your leaders. It neither helps them nor their work. I would like you once for all to forget this practice of presenting laudatory addresses. At three score and ten I for one have no desire to let what little time God has still left me be frittered away in vain theatricalities. If an address must be pre- sented, I would like it to be descriptive of the defects and short- comings of the recipient of the address so that he might be helped to turn the searchlight inward and weed them out.
 Ever since my arrival in this province I have been trying to ex- pound to the Khudai Khidmatgars the doctrine of non-violence in all its uncompromising completeness, abating not a jot, holding back nothing. I do not claim to have understood the meaning of non-vio- lence in its entirety. What I have realized is only a small and an insignificant fraction of the great whole. It is not given to imperfect man to grasp the whole meaning of non-violence or to practise it in full. That is an attribute of God alone, the Supreme Ruler who suffers no second. But I have constantly and ceaselessly striven for over half a century to understand it and to translate it in my own life. The Khudai Khidmatgars have no doubt set a most brilliant example in the practise of non-violence, to the extent to which they have understood it. It has
 earned them universal admiration. But they have now to move a step further. Their conception of non-violence has to be broadened and their practice of it, especially in its positive aspects, to be made fuller and more intense, if they are to come out successful in the final heat. Non-violence is not mere disarmament. Nor is it the weapon of the weak and the important. A child who has not the strength to wield the lathi does not practise not-violence. More powerful than all the armaments, non-violence is a unique force that has come into the world. He who has not learnt to feel it to be a weapon infinitely more potent than brute force has not understood its true nature. This non-violence cannot be “taught” through word of mouth. But it can be kindled in our heart through the grace of God, in answer to earnest prayer. It is stated that today there are one lakh of Khudai Khidmat- gars who have adopted non-violence as their creed. But before them as early as 1920, Khan Saheb came to recognize in non-violence a weapon, the mightiest in the world, and his choice was made. Eighteen years of practice of non-violence have only strengthened his faith in it. He has seen how it has made his people fearless and strong. The prospect of losing a paltry job used to unnerve them. They feel different beings today. At three score and ten, my faith in non-vio- lence today burns brighter than ever. People say to me, “Your pro- gramme of non-violence has been before the country now nearly for two decades, but where is the promised independence?” My reply is that although the creed of non-violence was professed by millions, it was practised by but a few and that, too, merely as a policy. But with all that the result that has been achieved is sufficiently striking to encourage me to carry on the experiment with the Khudai Khidmat- gars and God willing it will succeed.

I have again written today that if she is not required to stay there for nursing Nanabhai, she should immediately return.libtech_250_footnoteI will do everything possi- ble to send her.
 If you find it necessary to sell any portion of Phoenix and if the trustees agree, you may sell it.
Schlesin’s suggestion is certainly worth thinking over.
 I am sending your letter to Chhaganlal but I do not think he will want to go. The person who would have benefited by going and staying there was Ramdas, but he does not feel so inclined. The best way is for you and Sushila to do the best you can and be content. It will certainly be good if Schlesin gives whatever help she can. I will have no objection if Pragji takes charge. You should be guided by your experience. Don’t do anything which your experience does not suggest as advisable.
 Ba has completely recovered now. So also has Mahadev. Today I am travelling in a train bound for Wardha. Ba will meet me in Delhi and join us there.

We oppose you, not necessarily because we always differ from you but 	because we do not know 	your mind and so 	regard your actions with 	vague fear and distrust. 	Faith would 	become easier if we 	understand you. So 	we have come to 	you. Possibly you 	too might 	 find  that some  of  your  opinions 	  about   us   needed   	revision,   if 	  you knew us.  And 	by way 	of illustration, 	they cited 	the resolution 	on civil 	libertylibtech_261_footnotethat 	had been 	adopted by the A. I. C. 	C. at Delhi and 	which had 	occasioned the 	much talked of 	walk-out on 	the part 	of a 	group of 	members.libtech_262_footnoteThey could not 	understand why 	the “High 	Command” should be so 	anxious to 	steamroll that resolution 	through the house 	in spite of 	strong protest.  G. I must confess that I 	did not like the walk-out. Did it mean that you wanted the Congress 	to condone incitement to violence?  C. 	No, we 	have again 	and again 	made it clear that 	we do not 	want any 	condonation of 	violence or 	incitement to 	violence. What distresses 	us is this. 	Where- as there 	was enlargement 	of civil liberty on 	Congress taking 	office, since 	the Haripura 	Congress civil liberty has 	actually suffered 	curtailment under the 	Congress ministries. 	We are 	driven to 	feel that this cry 	about abuse of 	civil liberty 	has been 	raised merely as 	a convenient 	pretext to shield 	the Ministers, 	some of 	whom have 	been behaving exactly 	like the old bureaucrats.       
 G. I am more than glad that you have come to me, because you have come to the real culprit. I must confess that I am the sole author of that resolution. It is based upon unimpeachable evidence in my possession. But you should have known from my writings that they were meant to help Ministers to avoid action against those who have incited to violence and even actually committed it. Instead of Minis- ters taking action against them my purpose was to create public  opinion against violent speeches, writings or acts. The resolution was a substitute for legal action. I want you to accept my assurance that I would not screen a single Minister who interferes with civil liberty or acts contrary to Congress resolutions. If you have Rajaji in mind, I am prepared to give you full satisfaction or ask him to resign.
 C. We feel puzzled. You have said that coercive measures should be used to put down incitement to violence. Is it right to use Government violence to check the so-called incitement to violence by Congressmen?
G. The question is badly put. But my answer is there. There
 should be no Government violence. But if a man kills a little child and robs it of its ornaments and if I deprive him of the liberty to repeat the performance, I would not call my act violence. It would be violence if my act was meant to be a punishment.
 I would like to make my position clearer still. You cannot have the cake and eat it. Assuming that there has been violence of speech, it has to be noticed by the Congress or the Congress Ministers. I have suggested the former course. The resolution was in pursuance of that course. Of course you may question the validity or sufficiency of proof in the possession of the Working Committee. In that case, you could have called for proofs and accepted the resolution subject to the production by the Working Committee of the proof in its possession. If you admit that violent speech or writing does not come under the protection of civil liberty, there should have been no walk-out. Surely he who runs may see that in the Congress provinces latitude of speech and writing is allowed such as has never before been enjoyed.
 C. All the same, we cannot reconcile ourselves to the bias which the High Command has persistently shown against us. We have put ourselves under Congress discipline. We have joined the Congress because it is the only body that can raise a popular movement. If we misbehave, we may be put out and should lose caste with the people. As a people’s party we must move with the people or go out. These Ministers, on the other hand, are seeking to set themselves above the people to make themselves immune to democratic influence. We are wedded to no dogma. Tell us what we can do together in immediate practice. Our motives may differ but practice will
 
 count.
 
G. You should also admit that neither the resolutionlibtech_263_footnotelibtech_264_footnotenor, I think,
  	my articlelibtech_265_footnotemakes 	mention of socialists or communists. Violence is no monopoly of any 	one party. I know Congressmen who are neither socialists nor 	communists but who are frankly devotees of the cult of violence. 	Contrariwise, I know socialists and communists who will not hurt a 	fly but who believe in the universal ownership of instruments of 	production. I rank myself as one among them. But here I am not 	thinking of myself but of others whom I have the good fortune to 	know.  	What you have said, however, makes it clear to me that you do not 	put the same stress as I do on the means. But I understand your 	argument. Our minds are working at cross purposes. I want to occupy 	a corner in your hearts, if I can. But some of you have told me 	frankly that it is impossible, for they look at things from opposite 	poles. The utmost they can do is to tolerate me because they credit 	me with some capacity for sacrifice and influence over the masses. 	Now I make a sporting offer. One of you or all of you can come to me 	at Segaon when I return there, study me, see all my papers, look at 	the correspondence, ask me questions, and decide upon the course you 	would adopt in your dealings with me. There is no secrecy with me. 	My mission is to convert every single Indian to my view of the means 	of liberation. If only that happens, complete independence is ours 	for the having.  They 	next questioned Gandhiji 	as to the 	possibility of 	the Communist 	Party being 	legalized. “We do not want 	violence,” they 	explained. “It 	is true 	that we have 	not made 	non-violence our creed. 	We are 	not pledged to 	non-violence at 	all cost 	and for all time 	to come, 	but for the time 	being and in 	the immediate 	future we 	see no 	necessity for 	violence. Our 	method is thus, 	just now, 	the same as that 	of the 	 Congress. We 	are forced at 	present to 	function as 	a secret organization 	because we are 	under ban. If the 	ban is removed, 	the necessity 	for secrecy 	should cease. For the 	rest we 	can only give the 	assurance that 	should we 	in the future 	find it 	necessary to 	drop non-violence, 	we shall 	make a clear 	and open 	declaration about it.  G. If you mean that you 	do not as a party believe in violence, then you should make that 	statement. All your literature that I have studied clearly says that 	there is no independence without resort to force. I know that there 	is a body of communists that is slowly veering     
 round to non-violence. I would like you to make your position absolutely plain and above board. I have it from some of the literature that passes under the name of communist literature that secrecy, camou-flage and the like are enjoined as necessary for the accom- plishment of the communist end, especially as communism has to en- gage in an unequal battle against capitalism which has organized violence at its beck and call. I would, therefore, like you, if you can, to make it plain that you do not believe in these things I have mentioned.
 The communist friends promised to send Gandhiji an authoritative statement setting forth the position of their party.
 You may think over what I have said, keep yourself in touch 
 with me, correct me when you think I go astray, and try to understand me. Do not distrust me. When you have doubts express them fear- lessly. And I suggest that we leave the discussion at that. But I should be glad to think that we part with the determination to understand one another and but to meet again.
 Harijan, 10-12-1938
 "
287,"November 11, 1938",KHUDAI KHIDMATGARS AND BADSHAH KHAN,"
    
 Whatever the Khudai Khidmatgars may be or may ultimately turn out to be, there can be no doubt about what their leader whom they delight to call Badshah Khan is. He is unquestionably a man of God. He believes in His living presence and knows that his movement will prosper only if God wills it. Having put his whole soul into his cause, he remains indifferent as to what happens. It is enough for him to realize that  there is  no  deliverance  for  the  Pathan  except through out and out acceptance of non-violence. He does not take pride in the fact that the Pathan is a fine fighter. He appreciates his bravery but he thinks that he has been spoilt by overpraise. He does not want to see his Pathan as a goonda of society. He believes that the Pathan has been exploited and kept in ignorance. He wants the Pathan to become braver than he is and wants him to add true knowledge to his bravery. This he thinks can only be achieved through non-vio- lence.
 And as Khan Saheb believes in my non-violence, he wanted me to be as long as I could among the Khudai Khidmatgars. For me I needed no temptation to go to them. I was myself anxious to make their acquaintance. I wanted to reach their hearts. I do not know that I
 have done so now. Anyway I made the attempt.
 But before I proceed to describe how I approached my task and what I did, I must say a word about Khan Saheb as my host. His one care throughout the tour was to make me as comfortable as the cir- cumstances permitted. He spared no pains to make me proof against privation or discomfort. All my wants were anticipated by him. And there was no fuss about what he did. It was all perfectly natural for him. It was all from the heart. There is no humbug about him. He is an utter stranger to affectation. His attention is therefore never embar- rassing, never obtrusive. And so when we parted at Taxila our eyes were wet. The parting was difficult. And we parted in the hope that we would meet again probably in March next. The Frontier Province must remain a place of frequent pilgrimage for me. For though the rest of India may fail to show true non-violence, there seems to be good ground for hoping that the Frontier Province will pass through the fiery ordeal. The reason is simple. Badshah Khan commands willing obedience from his adherents said to number more than one hundred thousand. They hang on his lips. He has but to say the word and it is carried out. Whether, in spite of all the veneration he commands, the Khudai Khidmatgars will pass the test in constructive non-violence remains to be seen.
 Though Pyarelal has been giving a faithful record of the tour in the Frontier Province I must even at the risk of repetition in places give in my own way a resume of what has been done.
 At the outset both Khan Saheb and I had come to the con- clusion that instead of addressing the whole of the Khudai Khid- matgars at the various centres I should confine myself to the leaders. This would save my energy and be its wisest use. And so it proved to be. During the five weeks, we visited all the centres, and the talks lasted for one hour or more at each centre. I found Khan Saheb to be a very competent and faithful interpreter. And as he believed in what I said, he put into the translation all the force he could command. He is a born orator and speaks with dignity and effect.
 At every meeting I repeated the warning that unless they felt that in non-violence they had come into possession of a force infinitely superior to the one they had and in the use of which they were adepts, they should have nothing to do with non-violence and resume the arms they possessed before. It must never be said of Khudai Khid- matgars that once so brave, they had become or been made cowards
 under Khan Saheb’s influence. Their bravery consisted not in being good marksmen but in defying death and being ever ready to bare their breasts to the bullets. This bravery they had to keep intact and be ready to show whenever occasion demanded. And for the truly brave such occasions occurred often enough without seeking.
 This non-violence was not a mere passive quality. It was the mightiest force God had endowed man with. Indeed, possession of non-violence distinguished man from the brute creation. It was inhe- rent in every human being, but in most it lay dormant. Perhaps the word ‘non-violence’ was an inadequate rendering of ahimsa which itself was an incomplete connotation of all it was used for conveying. A better rendering would be love or goodwill. Violence was to be met by goodwill. And goodwill came into play only when there was ill will matched against it. To be good to the good is an exchange at par. A rupee against a rupee gives no index to its quality. It does when it is matched against an anna. Similarly a man of good will is known only when he matches himself against one of ill will.
 This non-violence or goodwill was to be exercised not only against Englishmen but it must have full play even among ourselves. Non-violence against Englishmen may be a virtue of necessity, and may easily be a cover for cowardice or simple weakness. It may be, as it often is, a mere expedience. But it could not be an expedience when we have an equal choice between violence and non-violence. Such instances occur in domestic relations, social and political relations among ourselves, not only between rival sects of the same faith but persons belonging to different faiths. We cannot be truly tolerant towards Englishmen if we are intolerant towards our neighbours and equals. Hence our goodwill, if we had it in any degree, would be tested almost every day. And if we actively exercised it, we would become habituated to its use in wider fields till at last it became second nature with us.
 The very name Khan Saheb had adopted for them showed that they were to serve, not to injure, humanity. For God took and needed no personal service. He served His creatures without demanding any service for Himself in return. He was unique in this as in many other things. Therefore servants of God were to be known by the service they rendered to His creatures.
 Hence the non-violence of Khudai Khidmatgars had to show itself in their daily actions. It could be so exhibited only if they were
 non-violent in thought, word and deed.
 And even as a person who relied upon the use of force in his daily dealings would have to undergo a military training, so will a servant of God have to go through a definite training. This was provided for in the very foundation resolution of the special Congress of 1920. It was broadened from time to time. It was never toned down to my knowledge. The exercise of active goodwill was to be tested through communal unity, shedding of untouchability by Hindus, the home and hand-manufacture and use of khadi—a sure symbol of oneness with the millions—and prohibition of intoxicating drinks and drugs. This fourfold programme was called a process of purification and a sure method of gaining  organic  freedom  for  the  country.  This programme was followed but half-heartedly by  Congressmen and the country, thus betraying a lack of living faith in non-violence, or faith in the method devised for its daily practice, or both. But Khudai Khidmatgars were expected and believed to have a living faith in non-violence. Therefore they would be expected to follow out the whole of the constructive self-purification programme of the Con- gress. I have added to it village sanitation, hygiene and simple medical relief in the villages. A Khudai Khidmatgar will be known by his works. He cannot be in a village without his making it cleaner and affording help to the villagers in their simple ailments. Hospitals and the like are toys of the rich and are available for the most part only to the city-dwellers. Efforts are no doubt being made to cover the land with dispensaries. But the cost is prohibitive. Whereas the Khudai Khidmatgars could, with a little but substantial training, easily give relief in the majority of cases of illnesses that occurred in the villages.
 I told the leaders of the Khudai Khidmatgars that civil disobe- dience was the end of non-violence, by no means its beginning. Yet I started in this country at the wrong end in 1918. I was overwhelmed by necessity. The country had not come to harm only because I, claiming to be an expert in non-violent technique, knew when and how to retrace our steps. Suspension of civil disobedience at Patna was part of the technique. I have just as much faith in the constructive programme of 1920 as I had then. I could not lead a campaign of civil disobedience in terms of purna swaraj without due fulfilment of the programme. The right to civil disobedience accrues only to those who know and practise the duty of voluntary obedience to laws whether made by them or others. Obedience should come not from
 fear of the consequences of the breach but because it is the duty to obey with all our heart and not merely mechanically. Without the fulfilment of this preliminary condition, civil disobedience is civil only in name and never of the strong but of the weak. It is  not charged with goodwill, i. e., non-violence. Khudai Khidmatgars had shown in unmistakable terms their bravery in suffering during the civil disobedience days as did many thousands in the other provinces. But it was not proof positive of goodwill at heart. And it would be a deterioration in the Pathan if he was non-violent only in appearance. For he must not be guilty of weakness.
 The Khudai Khidmatgars listened to all I said with rapt atten- tion. Their faith in non-violence is not as yet independent of Khan Saheb. It is derived from him. But it is none the less living so long as they have unquestioning faith in their leader who enjoys un-disputed kingdom over their hearts. And Khan Saheb’s faith is no  lip profession. His whole heart is in it. Let the doubters live with him as I have all these precious five weeks and their doubt will be dissolved like mist before the morning sun.
 This is how the whole tour struck a very well-known Pathan who met me during the last days of the tour:
 I like what you are doing. You are very clever. (I do not know that cunning is not the right word.) You are making my people braver than they are. You are teaching them to husband their strength. Of course it is good to be non-violent up to a point. That they will be under your teaching. Hitler has perfected the technique of attaining violent ends without the actual use of violence. But you have bettered even Hitler. You are giving our men training in non-violence, in dying without killing; so if ever the occasion comes for the use of force, they will use it as never before and certainly more effectively than any other body of persons. I congratulate you.
 I was silent and I had no heart to write out a reply to disillusion him. I smiled and became pensive. I like the compliment that the Pathans would be braver than before under my teaching. I do not know an instance of a person becoming a coward under my influence. But the friend’s deduction was deadly. If in the last heat the Khudai Khidmatgars prove untrue to the creed they profess to believe, non-violence was certainly not in their hearts. The proof will soon come. If they zealously and faithfully follow the constructive pro- gramme, there is no danger of their fulfilling the prognostication of
 the critic. But they will be found among the bravest of men when the test comes.

299,"November 14, 1938",THE CONGRESS AND KHADI,"
    
 I have letters from Bombay, U. P., Bengal and Sind bitterly com- plaining that the khadi clause of the Congress constitution  is honoured more in the breach than in the performance. I have men- tioned the four provinces not to have it inferred that in the other provinces things are better. I have simply referred to these provinces because there are complaints from them. People in the other provinces have not perhaps thought it worth while to draw attention to the evil which is widespread. It may well be that correspondence on the matter from other provinces has not been brought to my notice.
 The correspondents’ chief complaint is that in selecting Con- gress candidates for municipalities or local boards, the Congress officials do not enforce the khadi clause for such candidates. One correspondent says that the obligation of wearing khadi is waived because the Congress officials do not find competent enough candi- dates among khadi wearers. This would be a sound reason, if the dearth of proper khadi-clad men can be proved, for  altering  the clause, surely not for committing a deliberate breach of the Congress constitution. A writer justifies the waiver by arguing that there is no connection between swaraj and khadi. This again may be a good reason for a change in the constitution but not for disregarding it.
 
 Every Congressman is a potential civil-resister. The right of civil- disobdience accrues only to those who perform the duty of volun- tarily obeying the laws of their State, more so the laws of their own making. Therefore, the Congressmen are taking grave risks when they commit wilful breaches of the constitution.
 And is there no connection between swaraj and khadi? Were the Congressmen who made themselves responsible for the khadi clause in the constitution so dense that they did not see the fallacy which is obvious to some critics? I have not hesitated to say, and I make bold to repeat now, that without khadi there is no swaraj for the millions, the hungry and the naked, and for the millions of illiterate women. Habitual use of khadi is a sign that the wearer identifies himself with the poorest in the land, that he  has  patriotism  and  self-sacrifice enough in him to wear khadi even though it may not be so soft and elegant in appearance as foreign fineries nor as cheap.
 But my argument has perhaps no force with many Congressmen when anarchy reigns supreme among them. There is another batch of letters in my file which continue to give me fresh evidence of corrup- tion among Congressmen so called. One correspondent says bogus members are increasing on a wholesale scale. The cry comes from Orissa that Congressmen do not hesitate to spread lies in order to enlist members. A Calcutta correspondent tells me that there are original members who have not paid their own subscriptions. When asked, they say they cannot spare four annas per year. The corres- pondent indignantly protests that these same men spend many four-anna pieces per year on cinemas. My point however is not that these men can afford to pay and do not. My point is that if they have not paid their subscriptions they are not Congressmen and that the register containing their names requires to be purged of them. A U. P. correspondent says bribery and corruption are spoiling the  good name of the Congress. He says that Congressmen do not hesitate to use their influence with Collectors and other officials to have all sorts of injustices perpetrated for the sake of themselves or their relatives. And he adds that the services are ill able to resist the pressure. And he says the growing evil may be worse than the evil that existed when the services did wrong under instructions from British officials.  This charge is most damaging if it is true. It requires careful investigations by the U. P. Government and the provincial Congress command. Indeed, the whole of the irregularities I have lumped together in this
 note require careful and immediate handling by the Working Committee and the Provincial Congress Committees. If the Congress is not purged of illegalities and irregularities, it will cease to be  the power it is today and will fail to fulfil expectations when the real struggle faces the country.

311,"November 15, 1938","TALK TO TRAVANCORE STATE CONGRESS
		DEPUTATIONlibtech_287_footnote","
    
 November 15, 1938
 I have received reports that there has been violence on a con- siderable scale in Travancore. On the other hand I have received wires from the State Congress dictators saying that there has been no vio- lence whatever for which they can be held responsible, that whatever violence there has been was instigated by the authorities. It has been alleged too that there has been secret endorsement of violence by the State Congress people though they are not directly responsible for it. What I say is that if there has been mob violence, by whomsoever wrought, it shows that the State Congress has not acquired sufficient control over the masses. In that case civil disobedience has to be suspended even as was done by me more than once. I admit you were behind the prison bars when most of the alleged cases of violence took place. I appreciate also the fact that you did not get a chance of educating the masses into discipline. 1 entirely endorse your view that the fight should not be merely to wrest a few concessions from the authorities but for establishing real responsible government. But all that, to my mind, makes out a case for doing more spade-work among the masses. You must build from below.
 You tell me that you regard the removal of the Dewan would help your movement as he is the chief obstacle in your way. If you persist in the charges, you must be prepared to prove them. But in my opinion it will have the inevitable result of pushing the question of responsible government into the background by bringing to the fore a purely personal issue. I call that playing  the  enemy’s  game.  And you  would  give  the  wrong  lead  to  the  people.  I   do   not   want you to withdraw the allegations because they are not true, if you believe in them. I want those allegations to be withdrawn because you have a far bigger issue at stake. The greater includes the less. Removal of the Dewan by itself would not give you responsible government. A clever dewan might choose to slip out and remain in the background till the storm has blown over and in the mean time use a substitute to crush the movement. Such things have happened before and will
 
 
 happen again. On the other hand responsible government includes the power to dismiss ministers according to the popular will. You can therefore say, without abating an iota from your charges, you do not want to dissipate your energy by pursuing these charges. There are the two alternatives before you, both of them perfectly legitimate. You have to make your choice. You should know best the psychology of your people. It may be such that the fight can be best conducted through agitation to remove the Dewan. Personally, when I weigh the pros and cons of the matter, I feel like saying you should swallow the bitter cup and concentrate on getting the reins of power into your hands.
 But whatever the decision about the allegations, I would advise you not to restart civil disobedience just now. You should put your own house in order. If you keep unadulterated non-violence at the back of your minds, you would not say, “Let us take time by the forelock, and now that there is all this energy bubbling forth, let us consolidate our gains.” You would not capture power by madly frittering away the energy generated. That way lies danger. You will, if you follow that, only pave the way for the political schemers who may exploit the situation for furthering their own designs.  I  would therefore ask you to go slow, steadily gathering all the threads into your hands. You should become a homogeneous and disciplined mass by undergoing training in constructive work and non-violence. You may not take another forward step without canvassing public opinion inside and outside Travancore first.
 Apparently there may be no connection between constructive work and non-violence; but there is an internal logic connecting the two when constructive work is taken up as a part of a non-violence programme. The National Flag, for instance, was conceived as a symbol of unity, purity and non-violence. It is the place that we have given it in our non-violence programme that gives it its significance and importance; by itself it has no virtue. In prosecuting your constructive programme, you must always keep the background of non-violence before your mind.
 Then I should ask students to remain apart from the civil dis- obedience part of the struggle and should not carry on any propa- ganda in their midst. It is not proper to ask students of school-going age to do such work. It is a sign of weakness. It is like asking children to undergo suffering for their parents.
But the students can and ought to take part in the struggle by
 becoming adepts in charkha and other items in the constructive programme, as the Chinese students are doing while the fight against Japan is going on. The Chinese students are working to preserve the essentials of Chinese culture through their programme of New Edu- cation. They are helping to create a national spirit which will remain unsubdued irrespective of the fortunes of the Chinese arms on the battle field.
 The satyagraha struggle in British India had two aspects, non-violent non-co-operation with the Government and co-operation among the people themselves. Both these aspects should constantly be kept before the mind’s eye. The constructive programme that I have set before you necessitates perfect co-operation among all the sec- tions. You will therefore go among the Pulayas and the Pariahs, frater- nize with them and appeal to them as fellow countrymen and equals to come out and take their due share in the sacred fight along with the Brahmins, Ezhawas, Christians and others. You must all become one. You dare not leave out or antagonize a single section or community without stultifying yourselves and damaging your fight.
 Then there is the prohibition work. You would not picket just now, but you would visit the drunkards in their homes and strive with them. Even if you do not succeed in producing immediate tangible results, it will put your struggle on a moral plane and add strength and momentum to it.
 Travancore people, both men and women, are so simple in their habits. They wear white and need very little cloth to protect them against the elements. They can easily produce all the khadi they need. Travancore need not import a single yard of cloth or even khadi from outside. This means that there should be a spinning-wheel in every home.
 And khadi should be linked with liberty. All the time you are spinning, you would not think in terms of your own requirements but in terms of the requirements of the nation. You will say, ‘I want to clothe the whole nation that is naked and I must do it non-violently.’ Each time you draw a thread, say to yourselves, ‘We are drawing the thread of swaraj.’ Multiply this picture millionfold and you have freedom knocking at your door.

319,"November 20, 1938",THE JEWS,"
        
 Several letters have been received by me asking me to declare my views about the Arab-Jew question in Palestine and the persecution of the Jews in Germany. It is not without hesitation that I venture to offer my views on this very difficult question.
 My sympathies are all with the Jews. I have known them intimately in South Africa. Some of them became life-long compani- ons. Through these friends I came to learn much of their age-long persecution. They have been the untouchables of Christianity. The parallel between their treatment by Christians and the treatment of untouchables by Hindus is very close. Religious sanction has been invoked in both cases for the justification of the inhuman treatment meted out to them. Apart from the friendships, therefore, there is the more common universal reason for my sympathy for the Jews.
 But my sympathy does not blind me to the requirements of justice. The cry for the national home for the Jews does not make much appeal to me. The sanction for it is sought in the Bible and the tenacity with which the Jews have hankered after return to Palestine. Why should they not, like other peoples of the earth, make that country their home where they are born and where they earn their livelihood?
 Palestine belongs to the Arabs in the same sense that England belongs to the English or France to the French. It is wrong and in- human to impose the Jews on the Arabs. What is going on in Palestine today cannot be justified by any moral code of conduct.  The  mandates have no sanction but that of the last war. Surely it would be a crime against humanity to reduce the proud Arabs so that Palestine can be restored to the Jews partly or wholly as their national home.
 The nobler course would be to insist on a just treatment of the Jews wherever they are born and bred. The Jews born in France are French in precisely the same sense that Christians born in France are French. If the Jews have no home but Palestine, will they relish the idea of being forced to leave the other parts of the world in which they are settled? Or do they want a double home where they can remain at will? This cry for the national home affords a colourable justification for the German expulsion of the Jews.
 But the German persecution of the Jews seems to have  no parallel in history. The tyrants of old never went so mad as Hitler
 seems to have gone. And he is doing it with religious zeal. For he is propounding a new religion of exclusive and militant nationalism in the name of which any inhumanity becomes an act of humanity to be rewarded here and hereafter. The crime of an obviously mad but intrepid youth is being visited upon his whole race with unbelievable ferocity. If there ever could be a justifiable war in the name of and for humanity, a war against Germany, to
 Can the Jews resist this organized and prevent the wanton perse- cution of a whole race, would be completely justified. But I do not believe in any war. A discussion of the pros and cons of such a war is therefore outside my horizon or province.
 But if there can be no war against Germany, even for such a crime as is being committed against the Jews, surely there can be no alliance with Germany. How can there be alliance between a nation which claims to stand for justice and democracy and one which is the declared enemy of both? Or is England drifting towards armed dictatorship and all it means?
 Germany is showing to the world how efficiently violence can be worked when it is not hampered by any hypocrisy or weakness masquerading as humanitarianism. It is also showing how hideous, terrible and terrifying it looks in its nakedness.shameless persecution? Is there a way to preserve their self-respect, and not to feel helpless, neglected and forlorn? I submit there is. No person who has faith in a living God need feel helpless or forlorn. Jehovah of the Jews is a God more personal than the God of the Christians, the Mussalmans or the Hindus, though, as a matter of fact in essence, He is common to all and one without a second and beyond description. But as the Jews attribute personality to God and believe that He rules every action of theirs, they ought not to feel helpless. If I were a Jew and were born in Germany and earned my livelihood there, I would claim Germany as my home even as the tallest gentile German may, and challenge him to shoot me or cast me in the dungeon; I would refuse to be expelled or to submit to discriminating treatment. And for doing this, I should not wait for the fellow Jews to join me in civil resistance but would have confidence that in the end the rest are bound to follow my example. If one Jew or all the Jews were to accept the prescription here offered, he or they cannot be worse off than now. And suffering voluntarily undergone will bring them an inner strength and  joy which no number of resolutions of sympathy passed in the world
 
 outside Germany can. Indeed, even if Britain, France and America were to declare hostilities against Germany, they can bring no inner joy, no inner strength. The calculated violence of Hitler may even result in a general massacre of the Jews by way of his first answer to the declaration of such hostilities. But if the Jewish mind could be prepared for voluntary suffering, even the massacre I have imagined could be turned into a day of thanksgiving and joy that Jehovah had wrought deliverance of the race even at the hands of the tyrant. For to the godfearing, death has no terror. It is a joyful sleep to be followed by a waking that would be all the more refreshing for the long sleep.
 It is hardly necessary for me to point out that it is easier for the Jews than for the Czechs to follow my prescription. And they have in the Indian satyagraha campaign in South Africa an exact parallel. There the Indians occupied precisely the same place that the Jews occupy in Germany. The persecution had also a religious tinge. Presi- dent Kruger used to say that the white Christians were the chosen of God and Indians were inferior beings created to serve the whites. A fundamental clause in the Transvaal constitution was that there should be no equality between the whites and coloured races including Asiatics. There too the Indians were consigned to ghettos described as locations. The other disabilities were almost of the same type as those of the Jews in Germany. The Indians, a mere handful, resorted to satyagraha without any backing from the world outside or the Indian Government. Indeed the British officials tried to dissuade the satya- grahis from their contemplated step. World opinion and the Indian Government came to their aid after eight years of fighting. And that too was by way of diplomatic pressure not of a threat of war.
 But the Jews of Germany can offer satyagraha under infinitely better auspices than the Indians of South Africa. The Jews are a compact, homogeneous community in Germany. They are far more gifted than the Indians of South Africa. And they have organized world opinion behind them. I am convinced that if someone with courage and vision can arise among them to lead them in non-violent action, the winter of their despair can in the twinkling of an eye be turned into the summer of hope. And what has today become a degrading man-hunt can be turned into a calm and determined stand offered by unarmed men and women possessing the strength of suffering given to them by Jehovah. It will be then a truly religious resistance offered against the godless fury of dehumanized man. The German Jews will score a lasting victory over the German gentiles in
 the sense that they will have converted the latter to an appreciation of human dignity. They will have rendered service to fellow-Germans and proved their title to be the real Germans as against those who are today dragging, however unknowingly, the German name into the mire.
 And now a word to the Jews in Palestine. I have no doubt that they are going about it the wrong way. The Palestine of the Biblical conception is not a geographical tract. It is in their hearts. But if they must look to the Palestine of geography as their national home, it is wrong to enter it under the shadow of the British gun. A religious act cannot be performed with the aid of the bayonet or the bomb. They can settle in Palestine only by the goodwill of the Arabs. They should seek to convert the Arab heart. The same God rules the Arab heart who rules the Jewish heart. They can offer satyagraha in front of the Arabs and offer themselves to be shot or thrown into the Dead Sea without raising a little finger against them. They will find the world opinion in their favour in their religious aspiration. There are hundr- eds of ways of reasoning with the Arabs, if they will only discard the help of the British bayonet. As it is, they are co-sharers with the British in despoiling a people who have done no wrong to them.
 I am not defending the Arab excesses. I wish they had chosen the way of non-violence in resisting what they rightly regarded as an unwarrantable encroachment upon their country. But according to the accepted canons of right and wrong, nothing can be said against the Arab resistance in the face of overwhelming odds.
 Let the Jews who claim to be the chosen race prove their title by choosing the way of non-violence for vindicating their position on earth. Every country is their home including Palestine not by aggre- ssion but by loving service. A Jewish friend has sent me a book called The Jewish Contribution to Civilization by Cecil Roth. It  gives  a  record of what the Jews have done to enrich the world’s literature, art, music, drama, science, medicine, agriculture, etc. Given the will, the Jew can refuse to be treated as the outcaste of the West, to be despised or patronized. He can command the attention and respect of the world by being man, the chosen creation of God, instead of being man who is fast sinking to the brute and forsaken by God. They can add to their many contributions the surpassing contribution of non-violent action.

 CHI. KANTI,
 I had got your letter. You must have got mine. After writing to you, I discussed the matter with R. I have not been able to convince him. He says that there must have been some mistake in what S. saw and that the same charge was levelled against you regarding your relations with P. Ultimately it was proved that there was nothing in it. All the same, says R., he will make a full inquiry. But he adds: “Suppose my sister has fallen, is it not S.’s duty to bring her mother to her senses? Was it right for her to run down to you? Have we, who have brought her up, who have given her love, and separation from whom has made her shed tears, ceased to be of any value? If you order, I will certainly bring S. before you even to tell her this.” In these circumstances, how could I insist any further? Now it is for S. to show courage. She should boldly prove P.’s misconduct, and having shown that she cannot reform P. She should try to come to me. P.
 may have gone astray but all the others cannot be like her. Don’t become impatient. It is not proper that you should give up hope of P. Her love for you has not diminished. If it has, cannot the betrothal be cancelled even after it has been made public? But he does not even dream of such a step. You have become a part of that family. You should believe that there is still room for further inquiry in this matter. However that be, I do not want you to let this affair trouble you or take your time. Whatever type of woman P. may be, S. is certainly not going to be affected. It will be enough if she remains engrossed in her duty. Write to her and ask her to write to me as frankly as she does to you. If she is afraid that someone might read her letters, I will tear them up after reading them, as I do R. K.’s. Her letters are given to me unopened, as also others which are marked “Private”“Personal”, or anything to that effect. I want that not you but I should worry about S. You are also not right in believing that it was wrong to have made your betrothal public.
I hope you are well.

All our mutual quarrels centre round non-essen- tials. Sophia Wadia’s labours will be amply rewarded if people belon- ging to different faiths will study faiths other than their own, with the same reverence that she has exhibited in her essays. An understanding knowledge of and respect for the great faiths of the world is the foundation of true Theosophy—Wisdom about God.

Courtesy: National Archives of India and 	Anand T. Hingorani             	Several letters have been lying on my file from Congressmen who 	non-co-operated during the non-co-operation  days. Among these were 	those also who resigned Government services. Some of these are now 	agitating for reinstatement. They quote in support my appeal to the 	public including Government servants tonon-co-operate. Among the 	sufferers who have, to my knowledge, not agitated for restoration 	are the resisters who were fined, the relatives who lost their 	bread-winners, the lawyers who gave up their practice and were  	reduced to penury, and the students who gave up their studies and 	consequent prospects. They think the suffering voluntarily undergone 	was its own reward and demands no further compensation.  	If all these were to claim restoration from the Congress Minis- 	ters, the latter’s lot would be truly unenviable and they would 	have little work to do save that of adjudging claims. They would 	also have to raise money for discharging claims that must amount to 	seve-ral crores. Moreover, it would be difficult for the discharged  	Govern- ment servants who gave up their jobs whether compulsorily or 	volunt- arily to show that the cases of other sufferers were less 	hard thantheirs.  	In my opinion these ex-Government-servants as a class were the least 	sufferers. And if they have been without work all these years, they 	can hardly become efficient servants of the State. Government 	service for Congressmen is not an avenue to material advancement; it 	should be an avenue to service. Therefore only those Congressmen may 	enter Government service whose market value is higher than that they 	can get from the Government. They can be employed only when 
 they are wanted. There should be no such thing as Congress patro- nage.
 A war, whether violent or non-violent, loses its thrill and its gran- deur if the warriors are insured against all loss. A satyagrahi to be worthy of the name stands to lose all without expectation of any compensation in the future. His merit lies in his undergoing the uttermost sacrifice. Indeed the Congress machinery will fall to pieces if men come to it to better their prospects in life. And if the Congress Ministers are expected to satisfy personal ambition they will be them- selves discredited and bring down the prestige of the Congress in the end.
 I hope the reader will not fail to note the difference between this and the restoration of lands which were vindictively sold for a song by the preceding Government administration. There the restoration was easily possible and was a duty. It was like restoring a bit of country taken away by the victor.
 If another civil disobedience campaign becomes necessary, the Government will think fifty times before selling people’s land and unpatriotic persons will not dare to profit at the expense of patriots.

 The almost simultaneous awakening in the various States is a very significant event in the national struggle for independence. It will be wrong to think that such awakening can be due to the instigation of one person or a body of persons or any organization. It is  just  possible that the Haripura resolution of the Congress put the people of the States on their mettle and they realized as never before that their salvation depended upon their own labours. But above all it is the time spirit that has brought about the awakening. It is to be hoped that the Princes and their advisers will recognize it and meet the legitimate aspirations of the people. There is no half-way house between total extinction of the States and the Princes making their people respon- sible for the administration of their States and themselves becoming trustees for the people, taking an earned commission for their labours.
 I hope, therefore, the rumour is not true that the British Govern- ment are likely, at the instance of some Princes or their Dewans, to announce a change in the policy recently enunciated by Earl Winter- ton, about the ability of the Princes to grant responsible government to their people. If any of them have asked the British Government to reverse the policy, they have undoubtedly done a disservice to themselves. And if the British Government respond to the unworthy wish, they will precipitate a first-class crisis whose magnitude it is difficult to foretell. I must refuse to believe that the British Govern- ment can commit such a blunder. Earl Winterton’s announcement was but an endorsement of past practice. They are not known to have ever interfered with the States giving powers to their people, however wide they might be.
 I go a step further. Even as the British Government, as the Para- mount Power, are bound to protect the Princes against harm from out- side or within, they are equally or a fortiori bound to ensure just rule on the part of the Princes. Hence it is their bounden duty, when they supply the police or the military to any State, to see that there is a pro- per emergency justifying the request and that the military  or  the police will be used with becoming restraint. From Dhenkanal have come to me stories of fiendish cruelty exercised by the State myr- midons under the shadow of the police supplied by the Paramount Power. I asked for evidence in support of some of the unnamable
 cruelties. And I have enough to inspire belief.
 Indeed, it is a question whether responsible Ministers in the pro- vinces have not a moral responsibility in respect of the people of the States in their respective provinces. Under the Constitution, the Minis- ters have no power over them. The Governor is the agent of the Vice- roy who is the representative of the Paramount Power. But the Minis- ters in autonomous provinces have surely a moral responsibility regar- ding what happens in the States. So long as the States and the people are satisfied, Ministers have no worry. But have they none if there is, say, a virulent epidemic in the States which, if neglected, may easily overtake the province in which they are situated? Have they none when there is a moral epidemic which seems to be raging in Dhen- kanal?
 I understand that the persecuted people are taking refuge in British Orissa. Can the Ministers refuse them shelter? How many can they take charge of? Whatever happens in these States affects for better or for worse the province as a whole. I do believe, therefore, that the Ministers by reason of the heavy responsibility resting on their shoulders have the moral right, within strict limits, to assert themselves for the sake of internal peace and decency. They cannot look on with unconcern while the people of the States—an arbitrary creation of the Paramount Power—are being ground to dust as they in Dhenkanal are reported to be.
 One reads in the papers that some concessions have been given to the people of Dhenkanal. I do not know whether the report is true and whether the relief answers the purpose for which the people of Dhenkanal are fighting and suffering. It is, however, irrelevant to the issue raised by me. I feel that the Ministers in the  provinces  are morally bound to take notice of gross misrule in the States within their borders and to tender advice to the Paramount Power as to what, in their opinion, should be done. The Paramount Power, if it is to enjoy friendly relations with the provincial Ministers, is bound to give sym- pathetic ear to their advice.
 There is one other matter which demands the urgent attention of the States and their advisers. They fight shy of the very name Con- gress. They regard Congressmen as outsiders, foreigners and what not. They may be all that in law. But man-made law, if it is in conflict with the natural law, becomes a dead letter when the latter operates in full force. The people of the States look up to the Congress in all matters
 affecting their interest. Many of them are members of the Congress. Some like Shri Jamnalalji hold high offices in the Congress organi- zation. In the eyes of the Congress there is no distinction between members from the States and from India called British. It is surely detrimental to the interests of the States to ignore the Congress or Congressmen, especially when it or they seek to render friendly assistance. They must recognize the fact that the people in the States are in many cases guided by the Congress. They know that I am responsible for the policy of non-interference hitherto followed by the Congress. But with the growing influence of the Congress it is impossible for me to defend it in the face of injustice perpetrated in the States. If the Congress feels that it has the power to offer effective interference, it will be bound to do so when the call comes. And if the Princes believe that the good of the people is also their good, they would gratefully seek and accept the Congress assistance. It is surely in their interest to cultivate friendly relations with an organization which bids fair in the future, not very distant, to replace the Paramount Power, let me hope, by friendly arrangement. Will they not read the handwriting on the wall?

Partici- 	pation by students in this manner seems to me altogether improper.  	It also does not seem proper that subjects of other States should 	send batches from places outside Rajkot. This is completely contrary 	to our policy. That batch does not want and will not get swaraj. Its 	going to Rajkot will increase ill will and cover up the weaknesses 	of the Rajkot people if there are any. What will we gain by their 	weaknesses being covered up? The mettle of the people of Rajkot will 	shine only as much as it is worth. We may help it to shine brighter, 	but that can be done only by promoting growth among the Rajkot 	people 
 themselves. If you agree with this, stop the batches from outside and stop all students from joining. I can write much more, but where is the time? It doesn’t matter, though.

 This 	is the first letter I take up at 3.30 a.m. I 	have your time-table. This is therefore being posted to Delhi.  	Mahadev is having better nights than in Simla showing that the 	improvement continues. Perhaps the intense cold of Simla might not 	have agreed with him. Here unlike as before, he is sleeping under 	the open sky. The weather is quite mild. For three or four days I 	slept on the verandah. S. has permitted me to come out. How long the 	per- mission will last, one does not know.  	Ever since Mira’s departure I have been silent between 7 p. m. to 	2 p.m. the day following. Hence there are only 5 speaking hours.  	It will be good if Shummy finally makes up his mind to go to Europe. 	The change is likely to do him good and you will be able without 	anxiety to be with me. But Mahadev will say, what about the dog? He 	has been describing with what care that precious member of the 	family is being looked after. I 	am just now engaged in hammering into shape the Aundh 
 Constitution. The Raja Saheb’s son is a delightful boy.

This   is   a   unique  Convention   where   14   councils   of the younger churches of Asia, Africa and  Latin  America,  and  14  of  the  older churches of Europe, America and Australia will  be  represented  by  over  400 delegates. We   want   this   to   be   a  help  and  not  a  hindrance  to  India.	Am
 I, I ask, right in thinking that the tide has turned a little bit on the great things you impressed on me?. . . Is there not a clearer recognition of these evils? . . .
 GANDHIJI: What I have noticed is that there is a drift in the right direction so far as thought is concerned, but I do feel that in action there is no advance. I was going to say “not much advance”, but I deliberately say “no advance”. You may be able to give solitary ins- tances of men here and there, but they do not count. Right conviction to be of use has to be translated into action.
 JOHN MOTT: Take the first question, viz., that of the Communal Award. Has there been no progress?
G. No progress at all.
 J.M. I have been studying the manuscript of the life of K. T. Paul, to which I have been asked to write a foreword. Don’t you think there has been an advance since his time? The attitude of the Roman Catholics is hostile, but what about Protestant Christians?
 
 
 G. If Protestant Christians are at one on this question, they can have the Award changed, so far as they are concerned. But there is no solid action in the matter.
 J. M. I did not know  that  they  could  have  an  exception  made  in  their behalf.
G. They can.
 J. M. Take the next question. Is not taking advantage of people’s disabilities being avoided now? I must say I was terribly pained to read of the McGavran incidentlibtech_324_footnote and greatly relieved to know that the misunderstanding has been cleared up.
 G. Even on this question, whilst some friends, I agree, are in earnest, so far as action goes, there has been no change.
 J. M. You mean to say there is not action enough?
 G. No, there is no action at all. I have plenty of evidence to prove what I say. I do  not  publish  all  the  correspondence  I  get.  Mr. A. A. Paul, whom you may know, convened a conference some time ago. The proceedings were revealing. Their resolutions were half-hearted. As far as I am aware, there was no unanimity about any definite action.
 J. M. I was encouraged by a resolution of the National Christian Council which insisted on pure motives and pure practice.
 G. You may cite the resolution but you will not be able to show corresponding action.
 J. M. I understand. Without action no decision is anything worth. This lesson was burnt on my mind even as a student when Foster’s great essay on the Decision of Character helped me more than anything I had read.
 G. I assure you you will find confirmation of what I say. I would say that there is not even concrete recognition of the danger of taking an undue advantage of people’s disabilities. They will never give up what they call the right of mass conversions.
 J. M. They are now talking of conversion of groups and families. I am not quite clear, though, as to what in certain cases the word ‘group’ implies.
 G. I am quite clear. It is mass conversions called by another name.
 J.  M.  That is strange. How can groups or  families be  converted en masse?
 Conversion in my family for instance came first with my father, then my oldest
 
 sister, then youngest sister, then I. It is an individual matter, a matter entirely between one and one’s God.
 G. So it is. On this matter of untouchability, I may tell you that for years I could not carry conviction to my own wife. She followed me willy-nilly. The conviction came to her after long experience and practice.
 J. M. In dealing with the holiest of things we should use the purest methods. But you will pardon me if I reiterate that I am hopeful of the tide having turned. Discerning Christian leaders to my knowledge are not only thinking of these things keenly but sincerely addressing themselves to fostering right practice. On the third question of the wise use of money I see signs of encouragement.
 G. But it is a virtue of necessity. The Indian Christians are thinking aloud and of doing things themselves. They are talking of their own responsibilities and saying, “Thank God, American money can’t come.”
 Then came a rather long digression on the wise and unwise use of money. The topic had engaged their attention on the occasion of the last visit too and Gandhiji had put the matter most forcefully when he said:
 “I think you cannot serve God and Mammon both, and my fear is that Mammon has been sent to serve India and God has re- mained behind, with the result that He will one day have His ven- geance.”
 He had made it also clear that there was all the difference in the world between money given and money earned
 J. M. But your own example proves that there are wise uses of money. What do all the organizations I saw this morning testify?
 G. You see a contradiction between my theory and practice? Well, you must see the background. With all my experience and ability to collect money I am utterly indifferent in the matter. I have always felt that when a religious organization has more money than it requires, it is in peril of losing its faith in God and pinning its faith on money. There is no such thing as ‘wise’ or ‘unwise’ use of money. You have simply to cease to depend on it. You don’t even depend on bread, and bargain with God saying you won’t pray until God gives your bread!
 J. M. I am arguing this at some length as I want to understand you and not to misquote you.
 G. Then I will illustrate what I say by two telling illustrations. In South Africa when I started the satyagraha march there was not a
 
 copper in my pocket, and I went with a light heart. I had a caravan of 3000 people to support. ‘No fear’, said I. ‘If God wills it He will carry it forward.’ Then money began to rain from India. I had to stop it, for when the money came my miseries began. Whereas they were content with a piece of bread and sugar, they now began asking for all sorts of things.
 Then take the illustration of the new educational experiment. The experiment I said must go on without asking for any monetary help. Otherwise, after my death the whole organizations would go to pieces. The fact is the moment financial stability is assured, spiritual bankruptcy is also assured.
 J. M. But you wisely used the money.
 G. Not metal, but bread; and even the dog, under God’s Providence, has not to go hungry.
 Then came the last question of untouchability. Dr. Mott wondered if there was no quickening of the conscience all the world over. There had been, he said, battles royal between groups in America, conventions refusing to go to hotels where the Negroes were not received? there were Christians in Germany who had gone to prison for protesting against the inhuman treatment of the Jews. There was gold coming out of dross. What about India?
 G. No advance in action, I say again. The British are a fair test. The racial feeling instead of declining is rising. In South Africa the tide of prejudice is rising high, declarations made by former Ministers are being disregarded. Similar stories come from East Africa. But I remain an optimist, not that there is any evidence that I can give that right is going to prosper, but because of my unflinching faith that right must prosper in the end.
 J. M. Well, in South Africa too are there not people like Hoffmeyr and Edgar Brookes? There is certainly a turn of the tide on the part of certain individuals.
 G. It would be wrong to draw conclusions from a handful of individual instances. Our inspiration can come only from our faith that right must ultimately prevail. But on this matter, as I have said, there is an advance in the thought world, but not in action.
 Dr. Mott began the next day with these prefatory remarks: “You put in your quite original way your views on the questions I asked. I value it more than I can say. I was impressed by your recognition that there was a certain amount of advance in thought but not in action.       I could show you, too, that there are certain things
 actually concretely on foot. But, today, I want to engage your attention on another matter. What to do with ‘gangster’ nations, if I may use the expression frequently used? There was individual gangsterism in America. It has been put down by strong
 police measures both local and national. Could not we do something similar for gangsterism between nations, as instanced in Manchuria—the nefarious use of the opium poison—in Abyssinia, in Spain, in the sudden seizure of Austria, and then the case of Czechoslovakia. Now, in this connection, let me say, I was deeply impressed by what you wrote on the Czechoslovakian crisislibtech_325_footnoteand on the Jewish questionlibtech_326_footnote. Can we bring something like international police into being?”
G. This question is not new to me.
 J. M. I judge not.
 G. I have to deal with identical questions with reference to con- ditions in India. We have had to quell riots, communal and labour. The Ministries have used military force in some cases and police in most. Now whilst I agree that the Ministers could not help doing so, I also said that the Congress Ministries had proved themselves bankrupt with their stock-in-trade, I mean their avowed weapon of non-vio- lence. Even so, I would say in reply to the question you have asked, viz., that if the best mind of the world has not imbibed the spirit of non-violence, they would have to meet gangsterism in the orthodox way. But that would only show that we have not got far beyond the Law of the Jungle, that we have not yet learnt to appreciate the heri- tage that God has given us, that in spite of the teaching of Christianity which is 1900 years old and of Hinduism and Buddhism which are older, and even of Islam (if I have read it aright), we have not made much headway as human beings. But whilst I would understand the use of force by those who have not the spirit of non-violence in them, I would have those who know non-violence to throw their  whole weight in demonstrating that even gangsterism has to be met by non- violence. For, ultimately, force, however justifiably used, will lead us into the same morass as the force of Hitler and Mussolini. There will be just a difference of degree. You and I who believe in non- violence must use it at the critical moment. We may not despair of touching the heart even of gangsters, even if, for the moment, we may seem to be striking our heads against a blind wall.
 J. M. How may the Missionaries and Christians in general help in constructive activities like the village industries movement, the new educational movement and so on?
G.  They should study the  movements  and  work   under  or  in
co-operation with these organizations. I am happy to be able to say
 
 that I have some valued Christian colleagues. But they can be counted on one’s fingers. I fear that the vast bulk of them remain uncon- vinced. Some have frankly said that they do not believe in the village movement or the education movement as they are conducted by the associations you have named. They evidently believe in industria- lization and the Western type of education. And the missionaries as a body perhaps fight shy of movements not conducted wholly or pre- dominantly by Christians.
 If I get in my activities the hearty and active co-operation of the 5000 Protestant missionaries in India, and if they really believed in the living power of non-violence as the only force that counts, they can help not only here but perhaps in affecting the West.
 J. M. Happily there are a goodly number amongst them who see eye to eye with
  you.   G. 	I know.  J. 	M. 	What have been the most creative experiences in your life? As you 	look 
  back 	on your past, what, do you think, led you to believe in God when 	everything seemed to point to the contrary, when life, so to say, 	sprang from the ground, although it all looked impossible?  G. Such experiences are a 	multitude. But as you put the question to me, I recalled 	particularly one experience that changed the course of my life. That 	fell to my lot seven days after I had arrived in South Africa. I had 	gone there on a purely mundane and selfish mission. I was just a boy 	returned from England wanting to make some money. Suddenly the 	client who had taken me there asked me to go  to  Pretoria from 	Durban. It was not an easy journey. There was the railway journey as 	far as Charlestown and the coach to Johannesburg. On the train I had 	a first-class ticket, but not a bed ticket. At Maritz- burg where 	the beddings were issued the guard came and turned me out and asked 	me to go to the van compartment. I would not go and the train 	steamed away leaving me shivering in the cold.libtech_327_footnotelibtech_328_footnoteNow 	 the creative experience comes there. I was afraid for my very life. 	 I entered the dark waiting-room. There was a white man in the room. 	I was afraid of him. What was my duty, I asked myself. Should I go 	back to India, or should I go forward, with God as my helper, and 	face whatever was in store for me? I decided to stay and suffer. My 	active non-violence began from that date. And God put me through the 	test during that very journey. I was severely assaulted by the 	coachman    
 for my moving from the seat he had given me.
 J.M. The miseries, the slaps after slaps you received burnt into your
  soul.   G. 	Yes, that was one of the richest experiences of my life.  J. 	M. I 	am grateful to you for sharing this experience with me.  J. 	M. 	What has brought deepest satisfaction to your soul in difficulties 	and 
  doubts 	and questionings? G. 	Living faith in God.  J.M. 	When have you had indubitable manifestation of God in your life and 	experiences?  G. I have seen and 	believe that God never appears to you in person, but in action which 	can only account for your deliverance in your darkest hour.  J. 	M. 	You mean things take place that cannot possibly happen apart from 	God?  G. Yes. They happen 	suddenly and unawares. One experience stands quite distinctly in my 	memory. It relates to my 21 days’ fast for the removal of 	untouchability.libtech_329_footnoteI 	 had  gone  to  sleep  the  night before without the slightest idea 	of having to declare a fast the next morning. At about 12 o’clock 	in the night something wakes me up suddenly, and some voice—within 	or without, I cannot say—whispers, ‘Thou must go on a fast.’ 	‘How many days?’ I ask. The voice again said, ‘Twenty-one 	days.’ ‘When does it begin?’ I ask. It says, ‘You begin 	tomorrow.’I went quietly off to sleep after making the deci- sion. 	I did not tell anything to my companions until after the morning 	prayer. I placed into their hands a slip of paper announcing my 	deci- sion and asking them not to argue with me, as the decision was 	irre- vocable.  	Well, the doctors thought I would not survive the fast. But some- 	thing within me said I would, and that I must go forward. That kind 	of experience has never in my life happened before or after that 	date.  J. 	M. 	Now, you surely can’t trace such a thing to an evil source?  G. Surely not. I never 	have thought it was an error. If ever there was in my life a 	spiritual fast it was this. There is something in deny- ing 	satisfaction of the flesh. It is not possible to see God face to 	face unless you crucify the flesh. It is one thing to do what 	belongs to it as a temple of God, and it is another to deny it what 	belongs to it as to    
 the body of flesh.
 Dr. Mott concluded his visit in 1936 with a question on silence. He had done so during a brief flying visit to Ahmedabad in 1928 and during this  visit too he asked if Gandhiji had continued to find it necessary in his spiritual quest.
 G. I can say that I am an everlastingly silent man now. Only a little while ago I have remained completely silent nearly two months and the spell of that silence has not yet broken. I broke it today when you came. Nowadays I go into silence at prayer time every evening and break it for visitors at 2 o’clock. I broke it today when you came. It has now become both a physical and spirtitual necessity for me. Originally it was taken to relieve the sense of pressure. Then I wanted time for writing. After, however, I had practised it for some time I saw the spiritual value of it. It suddenly flashed across my mind that that was the time when I could best hold communion with God. And now I feel as though I was naturally built for silence. Of course I may tell you that from my childhood I have been noted for my silence. I was silent at school, and in my London days I was taken for a silent drone by friends.
 J. M. In this connection you put me in mind of two texts from the
  Bible:    	“My 	soul, be 	thou silent unto God.” 	“Speak Lord, for 	Thy servant hearkeneth.”  I 	have often sought silence for communion even during my noisiest "

  time 	. . .  I 	am sorry to have overstayed my time. I lose all sense of time when I 	am with you. I am more grateful than I can say.  SEGAON, 	December 5, 1938  Harijan, 	10-12-1938             	A valued khadi worker writes a letter in Hindi which freely 	translated means:  	Compared to mill-cloth khadi is not an economic pro- position in 	terms of prices. To compete with mill-cloth you have to drop the 	cost of hand-ginning, carding and spinning. Even for self-spinners, 	therefore, it is not a paying proposition. No doubt you have evolved 	new economics of khadi. But till the people at large appreciate 	them, khadi cannot be universal. Even 
 the Congress Ministers do not understand or appreciate your new economics. In the circumstances, will you not guide khadi workers and even the Ministers and Congressmen in general? Your faith seems to be so strong that you would straightway give eight annas per day to spinners for eight hours’ honest and skilled work if we, your co-workers, will let you. Frankly we do not possess your faith.
 There is no doubt that khadi cannot compete with mill-cloth, it was never meant to. If the people will not understand or appreciate the law governing khadi, it will never be universal. It must then remain the fad of monied people and cranks. And if it is to be merely that, the labours of a huge organization like the A.I.S.A must mean a waste of effort, if not something much worse.
 But khadi has a big mission. Khadi provides dignified labour to the millions who are otherwise idle for nearly four months in the year. Even apart from the remuneration the work brings, it is its  own  reward. For if millions live in compulsory idleness, they must die spiritually, mentally and physically. The spinning-wheel autoatically raises the status of millions of poor women. Even though, therefore, mill-cloth were to be given gratis to the people, their true welfare demands that they should refuse to have it in preference to khadi, the product of their labours.
 Life is more than money. It is cheaper to kill our aged parents who can do no work and who are a drag on our slender resources. It is also cheaper to kill our children whom we do not need for our mate- rial comfort and whom we have to maintain without getting anything in return. But we kill neither our parents nor our children, but consi- der it a privilege to maintain them no matter what their mainte-nance costs us. Even so must we maintain khadi to the exclusion of all other cloth. It is the force of habit which makes us think of khadi in terms of prices. We must revise our notion of khadi economics. And when we have studied them from the point of view of the national wellbeing, we shall find that khadi is never dear. We must suffer dislocation of domestic economy during the transition stage. At present we are labouring under a heavy handicap. Cotton production has been cen- tralized for the sake of Lancashire and, if you will, for the sake of Indian mills. Prices of cotton are determined by the prices in foreign lands. When the production of cotton is distributed in accordance with the demands of khadi economics, cotton prices would not fluctuate
 and, in any case, will be, in effect, lower than today. When the people, either through State protection or through voluntary effort, have cultivated the habit of using only khadi, they will never think of it in terms of money, even as millions of vegetarians do not compare the prices of flesh foods with those of non-flesh foods. They will starve rather than take flesh foods even though they may be offered free.
 But I recognize that very few Congressmen have this living faith in khadi. The Ministers are Congressmen. They derive their inspi- ration from their surroundings. If they had a living faith in khadi, they could do a great deal to popularize it.
 Khadi was an integral part of the original swaraj programme of 1920. In 1921-22 thousands of Congressmen repeated from hundreds of platforms that swaraj for the millions depended upon the spin- ning-wheel humming in every village. The late Ali Brothers used to say, at the numerous meetings they addressed, that without the char- kha in every cottage and the loom in every village there was no freedom. Maulana Mahomed Ali used to say in his picturesque lan- guage that our charkhas were our instruments of war and the cones of yarn turned out by them were our ammunition. He said this with a conviction that went home to his audiences. But the faith of those early days was not sustained. Congressmen in general have ceased to connect khadi with swaraj. Shri Jawaharlal Nehru has called khadi the livery of our freedom. For how many does it bear that meaning? If Congressmen could have that belief, khadi itself would be current coin. Freedom is never dear at any price. It is the breath of life. What would a man not pay for living? The Congress flag was designed to represent not civil disobedience which is but a phase, but it was designed to represent the essentials of freedom. Its background is khadi. The spinning-wheel covers and sustains it. Its colours show how necessary communal unity is for the attainment of freedom. Given the fulfilment of these conditions, civil disobedi-ence and the suffering it implies may not be at all necessary. To wear khadi is for me to wear freedom.
 Given a full-hearted acceptance of this meaning of khadi, I am able to say what the Congress Ministers and, for that matter, all the Ministers, khadi workers and Congressmen can and should do.
 There may be a Minister whose sole business would be to look after khadi and village industries. There should, therefore, be a depart- ment for this purpose. The other departments will co-operate. Thus
 the Agricultural Department will frame a scheme of decentralization of cotton production, survey the land suitable for cotton production for village use and find out how much cotton will be required for its province. It will even stock cotton at suitable centres for distribution. The Stores Department will make purchases of khadi available in the province and give orders for its cloth requirements. The Technical Departments will tax themselves to devise better wheels and other instruments of hand production. All these departments will keep in constant touch with the A. I. S. A. and the A. I. V. I. A. using them as their experts.
 The Revenue Minister will devise means of protecting khadi against mill competition.
 Khadi workers will with unremitting zeal investigate the laws governing the science of khadi and seek to make it more durable, more attractive and believe themselves to be responsible for discover- ing means of making khadi universal. God helps only those who are ever watchful and who devote all their talents to their mission.
 Congressmen in general will spread the gospel of khadi among their neighbours by themselves wearing it not ceremonially but habi- tually, by spinning themselves, and by helping khadi workers when- ever they are called upon to do so.

 make arrangements for her in Banaras. I like your idea too, though I also like the plan about Dehra Dun. After she has passed the exami- nation for Ratna, she is bound to get more pay. I do not think it im- possible that she may get even Rs. 150. She will have to trust her luck, of course. She can get sixty rupees in any circumstances. How-ever, I would certainly like her to learn sitar.

 CHI. SHARMA,
 I have your very candid letter. A tabloid machine costing Rs. 30 may be purchased. I shall provide the money.
 As regards earning a living I do not believe that you can make a success of this venture. I fear that in one way or another your ex- penses will go up. The true purpose, which is that you should live simply, will be frustrated. Carrying on a business and doing good to others cannot go together. You should sit down with Draupadi and work out a limit to your expenses and you should make up your mind that you will not go beyond it. If you do that your monthly expenses can be drawn from some institution.
 What can I say about the debt of Rs. 850? The mistake was made at the outset in incurring the debt. I can only say that so long as you have not repaid the debt you should forget all about helping others and take up a job so that you can meet your expenses and repay the debt. If you have jewellery or other property in the family you can even dispose of it to clear the debt. This is a drastic cure but I am sure it is also the most effective cure. You should resolve also not
 to incur any debts again.
 The question then remains as to what should be done about the task you have undertaken. I am myself baffled. You can always come and join me of course but what we have to consider is whether you can face living in society.
 The little girl is all right, I hope.

TAKAOKAlibtech_350_footnote","
        
 [December 7, 1938]libtech_351_footnote
 It can be possible if Japan ceases to throw its greedy eyes on India. No doubt you do not bring your army to India, but you em- ploy your matchless skill, and your ability to hide the truth and your knowledge of the weaknesses of Indians, in order to flood India with your goods which are often flimsy. You have copied the rulers of India in their methods of exploitation and gone even one better. Now, from the Japanese standpoint you cannot afford to lose the millions of rupees that you get from India. And if you cannot get them volun- tarily, you will be quite capable of doing so by force of arms. But that would not be the way of bringing Japan and India together. What can bring them together is a moral bond based on mutual friendship.
 But there is no basis for that friendship today. Take your art. I like it. I read a fascinating account of Japan and Japanese life by Edwin Arnold many years ago. That picture has remained with me. I want to assimilate all your good points, but unfortunately no one comes here to give us the good things of Japan. You believe only in dumping your goods on us. How can I take a single yard of Japanese cloth, however fine and artistic it may be? It is as poison to us, for it means starvation for the poor people of India. You have left the West far behind in diplomacy, in skill, in cheap manufactures, in armed warfare, in exploitation. How then can there be friendship between you and us, so long as you see nothing wrong in exploitation?
 Mr. Takaoka wondered if Gandhiji could give a message to the new party in Japan which stands for Asia for the Asiatics. Gandhiji said:
 I do not subscribe to the doctrine of Asia for the Asiatics, if it is meant as an anti-European combination. How can we have Asia for the Asiatics unless we are content to let Asia remain a frog in the well? But Asia cannot afford to remain a frog in the well. It has a message for the whole world, if it will only live up to it. There is the imprint of Buddhistic influence on the whole of Asia, which includes  India, China, Japan, Burma, Ceylon and the Malay States. I said to the Bur-
 
 mese and the Ceylonese that they were Buddhist in name; India was Buddhist in reality. I would say the same thing to China and Japan. But, for Asia to be not for Asia but the whole world, it has to relearn the message of Buddha and deliver it to the world. Today it is being denied everywhere. In Burma every Buddhist monk is being dreaded by the Muslims. But why should anyone who is a true Buddhist be dreaded by anyone?
 You will therefore see that I have no message to give you but this, that you must be true to your ancient heritage. The message is 2,500 years old, but it has not yet been truly lived. But what are 2,500 years? They are but a speck in the cycle of time. The full flower of non-violence which seems to be withering away has yet to come to full bloom.

396,"December 8, 1938",REPLY TO GERMAN CRITICS,"
        
 I was not unprepared for the exhibition of wrath from Germany over my articlelibtech_352_footnoteabout the German treatment of the Jews. I have my- self admitted my ignorance of European politics. But in order to com- mend my prescription to the Jews for the removal of their many ills, I did not need to have an accurate knowledge of European politics. The main facts about the atrocities are beyond dispute. When the anger over my writing has subsided and comparative calmness has returned, the most wrathful German will find that underlying my writing there was friendliness towards Germany, never any ill will.
 Have I not repeatedly said that active non-violence is unadul- terated love—fellow-feeling? And if the Jews, instead of being help- lessly and of necessity non-violent, adopt active non-violence, i.e., fellow-feeling for the gentile Germans deliberately, they cannot do any harm to the Germans and I am as certain as I am dictating these lines that the stoniest German heart will melt. Great as have been the Jewish contributions to the world’s progress, this supreme act of theirs will be their greatest contribution and war will be a thing of the past.
 It passes comprehension why any German should be angry over my utterly innocuous writing. Of course, German critics, as others, might have ridiculed it by saying that it was a visionary’s effort
 
 doomed to fail. I therefore welcome this wrath, though wholly un- merited, against my writing. Has my writing gone home? Has the writer felt that my remedy was after all not so ludicrous as it may appear, but that it was eminently practical if only the beauty of suffer- ing without retaliation was realized?
 To say that my writing has rendered neither myself, my move- ment, nor German-Indian relations any service, is surely irrelevant, if not also unworthy, implying as it does a threat; and I should rank my- self a coward if, for fear of my country or myself or Indo-German relations being harmed, I hesitated to give what I felt in the innermost recesses of my heart to be cent per cent sound advice.
 The Berlin writer has surely enunciated a novel doctrine that people outside Germany may not criticize German action even from friendliest motives. For my part I would certainly welcome the inte- resting things that Germans or other outsiders may unearth about Indians. I do not need to speak for the British. But if I know the Bri- tish people at all, they, too, welcome outside criticism, when it is well-informed and free from malice. In this age, when distances have been obliterated, no nation can afford to imitate the fabled frog in the well. Sometimes it is refreshing to see ourselves as others see us. If, therefore, the German critics happen to see this reply, I hope that they will not only revise their opinion about my writing but will also realize the value of outside criticism.

399,"December 9, 1938",SOME QUESTIONS ANSWERED,"
        
 Friends have sent me two newspaper cuttings criticizing my appeal to the Jews. The two critics suggest that in presenting non-vio- lence to the Jews as a remedy against the wrong done to them I have suggested nothing new, and that they have been practising non-vio- lence for the past two thousand years. Obviously, so far as these critics are concerned, I did not make my meaning clear. The Jews, so far as I know, have never practised non-violence as an article of faith or even as a deliberate policy. Indeed, it is a stigma against them that their ancestors crucified Jesus. Are they not supposed to believe in eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth? Have they no violence in their hearts for their oppressors? Do they not want the so-called democratic powers to punish Germany for her persecution and to deliver them from
 
 oppression? If they do, there is no non-violence in their hearts. Their non-violence, if it may be so called, is of the helpless and the weak.
 What I have pleaded for is renunciation of violence of the heart and consequent active exercise of the force generated by the great renunciation. One of the critics says that favourable public opinion is necessary for the working of non-violence. The writer is evidently thinking of passive resistance conceived as a weapon of the weak. I have drawn a distinction between passive resistance of the weak and active non-violent resistance of the strong. The latter can and does work in the teeth of the fiercest opposition. But it ends in evoking the widest public sympathy. Sufferings of the non-violent have been known to melt the stoniest hearts. I make bold to say that if the Jews can summon to their aid the soul power that comes only from non- violence, Herr Hitler will bow before the courage which he has never yet experienced in any large measure in his dealings with men, and which, when it is exhibited, he will own is infinitely superior to that shown by his best storm troopers. The exhibition of such courage is only possible for those who have a living faith in the God of Truth and Non-violence, i. e., Love.
 Of course, the critics can reasonably argue that the nonviolence pictured by me is not possible for masses of mankind, it is possible only for the very few highly developed persons. I have combated that view and suggested that, given proper training and proper generalship, non-violence can be practised by masses of mankind.
 I see, however, that my remarks are being misunderstood to mean that because I advise non-violent resistance by the persecuted Jews, by inference I expect or would advise non-interference by the democratic powers on behalf of the Jews. I hardly need to answer this fear. Surely there is no danger of the great powers refraining from action because of anything I have said. They will, they are bound to, do all they can to free the Jews from the inhuman persecution. My appeal has force in the face of the fact that the great powers feel unable to help the Jews in an effective manner. Therefore it is that I have offered the prescription which I know to be infallible when taken in the right manner.
 The most relevant criticism, however, which I have received is this: How do I expect the Jews to accept my prescription when I know that India, where I am myself working, where I call myself the self- appointed general, has not accepted it in toto. My answer is: ‘Blessed
 are they that expect nothing.’ I belong to the category of the blessed, in this case at least. Having got the prescription and being sure of its efficacy, I felt that I would be wrong if I did not draw attention to it when I saw cases where it could be effectively applied.
 Hitherto I have refused to deal with European politics. My gen- eral position still remains the same. I presented my remedy almost in suppressed tones in the case of Abyssinia. The cases of the Czechs and the Jews became more vivid to me than the case of the Abyssinians. And I could not restrain myself from writing. Perhaps Dr. Mott was right when he said to me the other day that I must write more and more articles like those on the Czechs and the Jews, if only because they must aid me in the Indian struggle. He said that the West was never more prepared than now to listen to the message of non-vio- lence.

 "
400,"December 9, 1938",RED TAPE,"
        
 A distinguished Indian, who had been watching Ministers Kher and Munshi working at breakneck speed, told me the other day how they seemed to have aged, and warned me that the nation would lose them before their time if I did not prevent them from overworking themselves. I wish I had the influence over them which the friend credited me with. If I had, I would certainly prevent them from com- mitting suicide by inches. What applies to these two Ministers applies to the others. A few days after the visitor, came a high official who has been specially entrusted with responsible work by Shri Kher. He said, “I want to fulfil Shri (of course he used ‘Mr.’) Kher’s expectations. But I do not know how I am to give him satisfaction. I believe I have always been a conscientious worker and kept myself busy. But now since the advent of the Congress Ministry our work has increased. For they give themselves no rest and give us none. The result is an ever-increasing pile of files. It is almost impossible to clear the desk from day to day. And now I have been given work which demands thinking out and planning. I must study. And I do not know what to do with these files.” I promptly answered, “Burn them.” I meant it too.
The third visitor, who followed quickly after the second, was a
 socialist friend. He said: “We are much misunderstood. Your article on the walk-outlibtech_356_footnotehas added to the misunderstanding. I assure you we want to help, not to hinder, the Congress work and the Ministers, reserving to ourselves the right of constructive criticism. But look at our difficulty. There is the Karachi resolution and the Congress manifestolibtech_357_footnote. We honestly feel that the promises made in them about economic relief are not being fully carried out. I do not want to underrate the Congress Ministers’ difficulties. But mere tinkering with the problem won’t do. There are forces at work which no one can stop. Advantage is being taken of the situation to put up the masses against the Congress. The masses have the vote. They are becoming otherwise conscious of their power. And if we do not take care, the Congress may one fine morning discover that it has lost its hold (at least temporarily) on the masses.”
 I agreed in general with the friend and I said, “The reason for dissatisfaction is plain to me. You have a philosophy of your own. The Congress Ministries today are not of the socialist hue. They are supposed to be of the ‘Gandhian’ hue, whatever it may mean. Now, yours is a clear-cut programme. You have textbooks to go by. But I myself do not know what is the Gandhian hue. I am sailing on an uncharted sea. I have to take frequent soundings. If such is  my pitiable condition, the Ministers’ is much worse. They are so tied down to red tape that they have no time to think. They have no time to see me or discuss things with me and, what is more or worse, know- ing their condition, I have no heart to inflict even letters on them. And I must not speak at them through the columns of Harijan.”
 I have touched on many topics in the foregoing paragraph. But my main purpose in this article is to deal with red  tape.  If  the Ministers are to cope with their new responsibility, they must discover the art of burning red tape. The old order could only live by and on red tape. It will strangle the new order. The Ministers must see people on whose goodwill alone they can exist. They must listen to petty and serious complaints. But they need not keep a record of all these or the letters they receive nor even of all the decisions they give. They have only to keep sufficient record to refresh their memory and to preserve continuity of practice. Much of the departmental correspondence
 
 must cease. The Ministers are not responsible to the India Office several thousand miles away. They are responsible to the millions of their masters who do not know what red tape is and care little. Many of them can’t read and write. But they have primary wants to be ful- filled. They have been accustomed by Congressmen to think that immediately the Congress comes into power there won’t be a hungry mouth in all India nor a naked person who wants to cover himself. The Ministers have to give their time and thought to such problems, if they are to do justice to the trust they have undertaken. If they are of the so-called Gandhian hue, they must find out what it is, not from me but from within by searching inward. I may not always know what it is. But I do know that if it is properly investigated and followed, it is radical and revolutionary enough to satisfy all the real wants of India. The Congress is a revolutionary body. Only its revolution is to be distinguished from all the other political revolutions known to history. Whereas the previous ones have been based on violence, this one is deliberately non-violent. If it was violent, probably much of the old form and practice would have been retained. But, for the Congress most of the old forms and practices are taboo. The most potent is the police and the military. I have admitted that so long as Congressmen are in office and they cannot discover peaceful ways and means of preserving order they are bound to make use of both.  But  the question ever present before the Ministers must be: is such use indispensable, and if it is, why is it so? If, as a result of their inquiry— not after the old style, costly and more often than not useless, but an inquiry costless but thorough and effective—they find that they cannot run the State without the use of the police and the military, it is the clearest possible sign, in terms of non-violence, that the Congress should give up office and again wander in the wilderness in search of the Holy Grail.

KRISHNACHANDRA,  	It would be wonderful of course if one could completely lose oneself 	in meditation. This means that the person who is the object of one’s 	devotion, has transcended the body. Why watch the activities of one 	who has left the body? But have I attained to that state? Therefore 	even the ears cannot be shut. It is not an artificial process. You 	have to strive towards perfect meditation. My efforts are known to 	you; there is nothing in them. I am a very imperfect person, I have 	good deal of intolerance, also anger. I am able to master these but 	that is nothing so great.    
 While plying the takli fix your mind on the thought that it is God who is doing it, that He is hidden in every fibre of the yarn. See Him with the inner eyes.
 Then spinning, which now seems secondary to you, will become the primary thing. In the language of satyagraha the means become identified with the end.
 You ought to grasp it by now that observing outward activities is only self-indulgence.

407,,A.I.V.I.A. TRAINING SCHOOL,"
        
 From the report of the certificate-giving function  of this Training School I cull the following: libtech_361_footnote
 Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel presided at the sessional gathering of the A. I.
 V. I. A. Training School for village workers, which was held at Maganwadi, Wardha, on Thursday 17th November.	The Superintendent, Sjt. J. P.  Patel,
 . . . welcoming the President and the guests said among other things:
 “. . . The industries that are taught at present are paper-making, oil-pressing, bee-keeping, gur-making, paddy-husking and flour-grinding. The course of the Vidyalaya is for five months. . . .
 “Rural economics, book-keeping and health and hygiene are also taught. . . .
 
 “In admitting students our main object is to see that after finishing the course here they devote themselves to some form of village service. . . .
 “The instruction is given through the medium  of Rashtrabhasha.	”
 I would advise the management to keep a register  of all outgoing students, to keep a living contact with them, and carry on with them a kind of post-graduate correspondence class. So far as it is humanly possible not one of the students should lapse into the old rut or feel despondent because he can make no headway.

Allegations were made that the 	struggle was personal. The demand for responsible government made it 	impersonal and raised it to a higher level. I could not be a party 	to the conduct of a struggle which must engage and exhaust time and 	energy in pursuit of a personal matter to the ex- clusion of the 	most important one of swaraj. If they concentrated on the 	allegations, responsible government was bound to recede into the 	background.     
 Though my conviction about the correctness of my advice was unshaken, the members were to be guided by their own, if it conflicted with mine, for the burden of conducting the struggle rested on them. I also told them that if violence continued, no matter how it occurred, they were bound to suspend civil disobedience; for violence on the part of the public, even though instigated, showed that the State Con- gress influence was not adequate. This in no way meant suspension of the struggle. It meant merely a change of the emphasis on the instru- ments. An instrument of permanent value was a constructive pro- gramme. The employment of civil disobedience had well-defined limitations and required suspension as the occasion demanded.

412,"December 12, 1938","DISCUSSION WITH CHRISTIAN
MISSIONARIESlibtech_366_footnote","
        
 [Before December 12, 1938]libtech_367_footnote
 One of the questioners asked Gandhiji what his motive in life was, “the thing that leads us to do what we do”, whether it was religious, or social or political.
GANDHIJI: Purely religious. This was the question asked me by
 the late Mr. Montagu when I accompanied a deputation which was purely political. “How you, a social reformer,” he exclaimed, have “found your way into this crowd ?” My reply was that it was only an extension of my social activity. I could not be leading a religious life unless I identified myself with the whole of mankind, and that I could not do unless I took part in politics. The whole gamut of man’s activi- ties today constitutes an indivisible whole. You cannot divide social, economic, political and purely religious work into watertight compart- ments. I do not know any religion apart from human activity. It pro- vides a moral basis to all other activities which they would otherwise lack, reducing life to a maze of sound and fury signifying nothing!
 QUESTION: Seeing the influence you wield over the people, may we inquire whether it is the love of the cause or the love of the people that moves you?
 
 ANSWER: Love of the people. Cause without the people is a dead thing. Love of the people brought the problem of  untouchability early into my life. My mother said, ‘You must not touch this boy, he is an untouchable.’ ‘Why not?’ I questioned back, and from that day my revolt began.
 Q. You would expect us Christians to copy your example. Should we allow our religious motive to plunge us into politics?
A. Those who come from different parts of the world into this
 country cannot say: ‘We shall have nothing to do with the politics of the country.’ They would not be true to their faith if they bargained with the Government in order to supersede their fellow-feeling with the people. Supposing the Government does a grievous wrong to the people of the soil and the missionaries are told that they must not lift a finger to prevent it, surely, the least they can do is to leave the country by way of signifying their displeasure at the  perpetration of the wrong. If a missionary puts himself out for service, opportunities will come: today it may be in the economic sphere, tomorrow in the social, next time it may be in the political field. You cannot then say, ‘I shall confine myself to this or that work and do nothing else.’ When I went to South Africa I knew nothing about that country. I was bound to my client only. Yet, within seven days of my reaching there, I found that I had to deal with a situation too terrible for words.
 Gandhiji was next asked in what relation his non-violence stood to the  Pacifist attitude, “which we Westerners are trying to adopt without much success.”
GANDHIJI: In my opinion non-violence is not passivity in any
 shape or form. Non-violence, as I understand it, is the activest force in the world. Therefore, whether it is materialism or anything else, if non-violence does not provide an effective antidote it is not the active force of my conception. Or, to put it conversely, if you bring me some conundrums that I cannot answer I would say my non-violence is still defective. Non-violence is the supreme law. During my half a century of experience I have not yet come across a situation when I had to say that I was helpless, that I had no remedy in terms of non- violence.
 Take the question of the Jews on which I have written.libtech_368_footnoteNo Jew need feel helpless if he takes to the non-violent way. A friend has written me a letter objecting that in that article I have assumed that the
 
 Jews have been violent. It is true that the Jews have not been actively violent in their own persons. But they called down upon the Germans the curses of mankind, and they wanted America and England to fight Germany on their behalf. If I hit my adversary, that is of course violence, but to be truly non-violent, I must love him and pray for him even when he hits me. The Jews have not been actively non-violent or, in spite of the misdeeds of the dictators, they would say, ‘We shall suffer at their hands; they knew no better. But we shall suffer not in the manner in which they want us to suffer.’ If even one Jew acted thus, he would salve his self respect and leave an example which, if it became infectious, would save the whole of Jewry and leave a rich heritage to mankind besides.
 What about China, you will ask. The Chinese have no designs upon other people. They have no desire for territory. True, perhaps, China is not ready for such aggression; perhaps, what looks like her pacifism is only indolence. In any case China’s is not active non- violence. Her putting up a valiant defence against Japan is proof enough that China was never intentionally non-violent. That she is on the defensive is no answer in terms of non-violence. Therefore, when the time for testing her active non-violence came, she failed in the test. This is no criticism of China. I wish the Chinese success. According to the accepted standards her behaviour is strictly correct. But when the position is examined in terms of non-violence, I must say it is un- becoming for a nation of 400 millions, a nation as cultured as Japan [sic], to repel Japanese aggression by resorting to Japan’s own methods. If the Chinese had non-violence of my conception, there would be no use left for the latest machinery for destruction which Japan possesses. The Chinese would say to Japan, ‘Bring all your machinery, we present half of our population to you. But the remain- ing two hundred millions won’t bend their knee to you.’ If the Chi- nese did that, Japan would become China’s slave.
 And in support of this argument he referred to Shelley’s celebrated lines from
 The Mask of Anarchy, “Ye are many, they are few”: Stand ye calm and resolute,
 Like a forest close and mute,
 With folded arms and looks which are Weapons of unvanquished war.
 And if then the tyrants dare
 Let them ride among you there,
 Slash, and stab, and maim and hew— What they like, that let them do.
 With folded arms and steady eyes, And little fear, and less surprise, Look upon them as they slay
 Till their rage has died away. Then they will return with shame
 To the place from which they came, And the blood thus shed will speak In hot blushes on their cheek.
 Rise like Lions after slumber In unvanquishable number,
 Shake your chains to earth like dew Which in sleep had fallen on you— Ye are many—they are few.
It has been objected, however, that non-violence is all right in
 the case of the Jews because there is personal contact between the individual and his persecutors, but in China, Japan comes with its long-range guns and aeroplanes. The person who rains death from above has never any chance of even knowing who and how many he has killed. How can non-violence combat aerial warfare, seeing that there are no personal contacts? The reply to this is that behind the death-dealing bomb there is the human hand that releases it, and behind that still, is the human heart that sets the hand in motion. And at the back of the policy of terrorism is the assumption that terrorism if applied in a sufficient measure will produce the desired result, namely, bend the adversary to the tyrant’s will. But supposing  a  people make up their mind that they will never do the tyrant’s will, nor retaliate with the tyrant’s own methods, the tyrant will not find it worth his while to go on with his terrorism. If sufficient food is given to the tyrant, a time will come when he will have had more than surfeit. If all the mice in the world held conference together and resolved that they would no more fear the cat but all run into her mouth, the mice would live. I have actually seen a cat play with a mouse. She did not kill it outright but held it between her jaws, then released it, and again pouched upon it as soon as it made an effort to escape. In the end the mouse died out of sheer fright. The cat would have derived no sport if the mouse had not tried to run away. I learnt
 
 the lesson of non-violence from my wife, when I tried to bend her to my will. Her determined resistance to my will on the one hand, and her quiet submission to the suffering my stupidity involved on the other, ultimately made me ashamed of myself and cured me of my stupidity in thinking that I was born to rule over her, and in the end she became my teacher in non-violence. And what I did in South Africa was but an extension of the rule of satyagraha which she unwillingly practised in her own person.
 But one of the visitors objected: You do not know Hitler and Mussolini. They are incapable of any kind of moral response. They have no conscience and they have made themselves impervious to world opinion. Would it not be playing into the hands of these dictators if, for instance, the Czechs following your advice confronted them with non-violence? Seeing that dictatorships are unmoral by definition, would the law of moral conversion hold good in their case?
 GANDHIJI: Your argument presupposes that the dictators like Mussolini or Hitler are beyond redemption. But belief in non-violence is based on the assumption that human nature in its essence is one and therefore unfailingly responds to the advances of love. It should be remembered that they have up to now always found ready response to the violence that they have used. Within their experience, they have not come across organized non-violent resistance on an appreciable scale, if at all. Therefore, it is not only highly likely, but I hold it to be inevitable, that they would recognize the superiority of non-violent resistance over any display of violence that they may be capable of putting forth. Moreover the non-violent technique that I have pre- sented to the Czechs does not depend for its success on the goodwill of the dictators, for, a non-violent resister depends upon the unfailing assistance of God which sustains him throughout difficulties which would otherwise be considered insurmountable. His faith makes him indomitable.
 The visitor retorted that these dictators wisely refrain from using force, but simply take possession of what they want. In the circumstances what can non-violent resisters do?
 GANDHIJI: Suppose they come and occupy mines, factories and all sources of natural wealth belonging to the Czechs, then the follow- ing results can take place: (1) The Czechs may be annihilated for disobedience to orders. That would be a glorious victory for  the Czechs and the beginning of the fall of Germany. (2) The Czechs might become demoralized in the presence of overwhelming force. This is a result common in all struggles, but if demoralization does
 take place, it would not be on account of non-violence, but it would be due to absence or inadequacy of non-violence (3) The third thing that can take place is that Germany might use her new possessions for occupation by her surplus population. This, again, could not be avoided by offering violent resistance, for we have assumed  that violent resistance is out of the question. Thus non-violent resistance is the best method under all conceivable circumstances.
 I do not think that Hitler and Mussolini are after all so very indifferent to the appeal of world opinion. But today these dictators feel satisfaction in defying world opinion because none of  the so-called Great Powers can come to them with clean hands, and they have a rankling sense of injustice done to their people by the Great Powers in the past. Only the other day an esteemed English friend owned to me that Nazi Germany was England’s sin and that it was the Treaty of Versailles that made Hitler.
 QUESTION: What can I as a Christian do to contribute to international peace? How can international anarchy be broken down and non-violence made effective for establishing peace? Subject nations apart, how can nations at the top be made to disarm themselves?
 ANSWER: You as a Christian can make an effective contribution by non-violent action even though it may cost you your all. Peace will never come until the Great Powers courageously decide to disarm themselves. It seems to me that recent events must force that belief on the Great Powers. I have an implicit faith—-faith that today burns brighter than ever, after half a century’s experience of unbroken practice of non-violence—that mankind can only be saved through non-violence which is the central teaching of the Bible as I have understood the Bible.
 Q. You have said that so far as India is concerned you are hopeful that it will stick to non-violence. What are the omens of that hope?
 A. If you ask for outward proofs, I cannot give any. But I have an instinctive feeling that the country is not going to take to anything else. You must remember that just now I am filled with what I saw in the North-West Frontier Province. I was not prepared for what I saw. They are in dead earnest about the thing, and there is a deep-rooted sincerity in their hearts. They themselves see light and hope in non- violence. Khan Saheb told me that before that it was all darkness. There was not a family but had its blood feuds. They lived like tigers in a den. Though the Pathans used to be always armed with knives,
 
 daggers and rifles, they used to be terrified of their superior officers, lest they should lose their jobs. All that has changed now with thousands. Blood feuds are becoming a thing of the past among those Pathans who have come under the influence of Khan Saheb’s non- violence movement and, instead of depending for their livelihood on paltry jobs, they have turned to the soil for cultivation, and soon they will turn to industry if their promise is kept.
 Q. What is your method of worship?
 A. We have joint worship morning and evening at 4.20 a. m. and 7 p. m. This has gone on for years. We have a recitation of verses from the Gita and other accepted religious books, also  hymns  of saints with or without music. Individual worship cannot be described in words. It goes on continuously and even uncon-sciously. There is not a moment when I do not feel the presence of a witness whose eye misses nothing and with whom I strive to keep in tune. I do not pray as Christian friends do. Not because I think there is anything wrong in it, but because words won’t come to me. I suppose it is a matter of habit.
 Q. Is there any place for supplication in your prayer?
 A. There is and there is not. God knows and anticipates our wants. The Deity does not need my supplication, but I, a very im- perfect human being, do need His protection as a child that of its father. And yet I know that nothing that I do is going to change His plans. You may call me a fatalist, if you like.
 Q. Do you find any response to your prayer?
 A. I consider myself a happy man in that respect. I have never found Him lacking in response. I have found Him nearest at hand when the horizon seemed darkest—in my ordeals in jails when it was not all smooth sailing for me. I cannot recall a moment in my life when I had a sense of desertion by God.

 I read suggestions about a memorial to the late Maulana Shau- kat Ali.libtech_371_footnoteAs soon as I learnt about the wholly unexpected  death,  I wrote to some Muslim friends sharing with them my innermost thoughts. One of them writes thus:
 There can be no two opinions about the extreme urgency and essential necessity of a sincere and lasting Hindu-Muslim unity. And the sooner it is brought about the better it will be for all concerned. Delay in this matter can only be fraught with consequences which nobody can contemplate without serious concern. The present drift may lead to most tragic developments which must, if at all possible, be avoided. I know that Shaukat was in his own way genuinely anxious to bring about real Hindu-Muslim understanding, and nothing will please his spirit more than to know in its rest in heaven that one of the objects after which he strove in this world was at last achieved. There may be people who may doubt this, but knowing him and the working of his mind most intimately as I do, I can assert it with confidence.
 I entirely endorse the opinion that, in spite of his outbursts at times to the contrary, deep down in the Maulana was the same longing for peace for which he used to speak and work eloquently during the Khilafat days. I have no doubt whatsoever that the truest memorial to his memory will be a joint determination on the part of both the com- munities to bring about not a paper-unity but a heart-unity, based not on suspicion and distrust but on mutual trust. No other unity is worth having. And without that unity there is no real freedom for India.

 What I did cannot apply in the case of your brother. I took no medicine except soda and I lived entirely on fruit juice. Massage, hip- baths, etc., were continued. If I tried to eat anything in the mean while my condition became worse. In the end it was goat’s milk that saved my life.
 Carry on whatever treatment is possible there. See if Saraswati can do anything. If you are so inclined you may take him to Poona.
 The problem of Satyavati is a difficult one. She will not even take the full treatment.

 In my view, we should not interfere with whatever the Princes are doing. But why should not all the obnoxious portions of the Criminal Law Amendment Act be removed? Let only the absolute minimum be retained.

 Such a protest should be considered thoughtless. We want to do away with all that is bad in the [Criminal Law Amendment] Act. But why should we give up what is good in it? The Working Committee should have the courage to lend its support to this much. We must see the spirit [of the Law]. Why should we see only the letter of it? I have been purposely silent because I could not have written fully in favour of the Princes. I would be willing to write in their favour if they are agreeable to my suggestions. Even there the condition would be that after reading the Act, you approve of my suggestions. I do not know for certain that the [present] use of the sections is necessary. If it is necessary, I would certainly say so.

 I had never thought of a girl coming. To take the responsibility of a girl so far away from her home would perhaps be a bit too much. But as you can see I have plenty of girls around me here, and if a girl did come from America like that, I should not mind it a bit, i. e., if she could put up with the incredibly simple life here as it would appear to her. What she can learn from here and take back is the secret of simple living. However simple life may be in America, it cannot come anywhere near the simplicity of life here. I do not know if America can assimilate such simplicity, or wants it. The other thing that she could take back is the spirit of non-violence, to the extent that she can assimilate it without the help of any words or speeches, if there is non-violence in the atmosphere here. If there is no non-violence in the atmosphere, no written or spoken word can make her understand it or grasp it.

423,"December 13, 1938","DRAFT OF CONGRESS WORKING COMMITTEE
				RESOLUTION ON INDIAN STATESlibtech_377_footnote","
        
 December 13, 1938
 The Working Committee welcome the awakening of the people of Indian States in many parts of the country and consider this as a hopeful prelude to the larger freedom, comprising the whole of India, for which the Congress has laboured. The Committee support the demand for civil liberty and responsible government under the aegis
 
 of the Rulers in the States and express their solidarity with these move- ments for freedom and self-expression. While appreciating that some Rulers of the States have recognized this awakening as a healthy sign of growth and are seeking to adjust themselves to it in co-ope-ration with their people, the Committee regret that other Rulers have sought to suppress these movements by banning peaceful and legitimate organizations and all political activity and, in some cases, resorting to cruel and inhuman repression. In particular, the Committee deplore the attempt of some Rulers to seek the aid of the British Government in India to suppress their own people, and the Committee assert the right of the Congress to protect the people against an unwarranted use of military or police forces, lent by the British authorities, for the suppression of the legitimate movement of the people for responsible government within the States.
 The Committee desire to draw attention afresh to the resolution of the Haripura Congress which defines Congress policy in regard to the States. While it is the right and privilege of the Congress to work for the attainment of civil liberty and responsible government in the States, existing circumstances impose certain limitations on this work, and considerations of prudence prevent the Congress from interfering organizationally and directly in the internal struggles of the States. This policy was conceived in the best interests of the people, to enable them to develop self-reliance and strength. It was also intended as a measure of the goodwill of the Congress towards the States and of its hope that the Rulers, of their own accord, would recognize the spirit of the times and satisfy the just aspirations of their people. Experience has proved the wisdom of this policy. But this was never conceived as an obligation. The Congress has always reserved the right, as it is its duty, to guide the people of the States and lend them its influence. With the great awakening that is taking place among the people of the States, there must be an increasing identification of the Congress with States’ people.
 The policy laid down by the Haripura Congress, which has been so abundantly justified, must continue to be pursued. While, therefore, the Working Committee welcome the movements in the States for the attainment of responsible government, they advise the people not belonging to the States concerned against taking part in civil disobe- dience and the like. Participation by such people will bring no real strength to the movement, and may even embarrass the people of the
 
 States concerned and prevent them from developing a mass movement on which strength and success depend.
 The Committee trust that all movements in the States will adhere strictly to the fundamental Congress policy of non-violence.

 You understand now that I pleaded with Chimanlal on your behalf that cows need not be kept in two places. What I want to have is an estimate of the expenditure on and income from a herd of cows and calves numbering up to a hundred. You are a worker but a person who has to collect funds must have a plan. Therefore I said that if the workers here could together prepare a scheme I could think over it. It would have made my path easier if you and Parnerkar could get on well together. I want to expedite this matter.

 December 1938
 MY DEAR SUBHAS,
 I must dictate this as I am wilfully blind. Whilst I am dictating this Maulana Saheb, Nalini Babulibtech_383_footnotelibtech_384_footnote, and Ghanshyamdasji are listening. We had an exhaustive discussion over the Bengal Ministry. I am more than ever convinced that we should not aim at ousting the Ministry. We shall gain nothing by a reshuffle. And probably we shall lose much by including Congressmen in the Ministry. I feel, therefore, that the best way of securing comparative purity of administration and continuity of a settled programme and policy would be to aim at having all the reforms that we desire carried out by the present Ministry. Nalini Babu should come out, as he says he would, on a real issue being raised and the decision being taken  by  the  Ministry against the interests of the country. His retirement from the Ministry would then be dignified and wholly justified. I understand that so far as the amendment of the municipal law is concerned, separate electo- rate for the scheduled class is given up. There is still insistence on separate electorate for Mussalmans. I do not know whether opposition should be taken to the breaking point. If the Mussalman opinion is solid in favour of separation, I think it would be wisdom to satisfy them. I would not like them to carry the point in the teeth of the Con- gress opposition. It would be then a point against the Con-gress.
 If my opinion is acceptable to you, the release of the Prisoners becomes a much simpler matter than it is today. And if this opinion
 
 commends itself to you there should be an open declaration about the new policy. This ought to result in easing the tension that prevails in Bengal, and Bengal will be automatically free from the state of suspended animation. Maulana Saheb is in entire agreement with this opinion and so are Nalini Babu and Ghanshyamdas.
Love.

 COMPLAINT AGAINST CONGRESSMEN
 I have a letter from the Rangoon Khadi Bhandar and another from Karnatak complaining that Congress committees have certified khadi which was decertified by the A. I. S. A. There is no doubt what- soever as to the truth of the complaint. I have copies of the certificates issued by two Congress bodies. Congress committees should know that these certificates are illegal. The only authority that can issue certificates about khadi is the A.I.S.A. No Congress committee has been, or can be, given the right unless the Congress resolution cons- tituting the A. I. S. A. is changed.
 There is no such thing as certified khadi. It is impossible to certify every piece and every article made of khadi; only shops and persons can be authorized to sell khadi approved by the A. I. S. A. The original definition of khadi has been broadened to ensure an adequate wage for the manufacturers of khadi. Those who sell any other khadi, deprive khadi workers of the wage that the A. I. S. A. has, of its own accord, ensured for them. Let it not be said of any Congressman and Congress committee that they are interfering with the vast experiment in nation-building that the A. I. S. A. is con- ducting and which bids fair to put life and lustre in the dying bodies of millions of sisters whom no agency ensures even two pice per day.  I hope, therefore, that the Congress committees and Con-gressmen will not only not interfere with the work of the A.I.S.A., but will give their full-hearted co-operation to numerous organiza-tions of the A. I. S. A., especially in the sale of khadi. If there was a steadily increasing demand, it would be possible to provide remune-rative work in every famine area.
 HINDUSTANI ONLY
 A Muslim friend who calls himself an old Congress worker says:
 The Times of India, in its issue of the 12th September last, published an abstract of your article from the Harijan under the caption ‘Congressmen Beware!’libtech_387_footnote. The cogent explanation you have given of the position caused by the anti-Hindi agitation in Madras and the use of the Criminal Law Amendment Act is remarkably convincing. I have no doubt that the sound advice you have
 
 offered to the agitators will go a long way in satisfying them and that they will be brought round to the right way of thinking. But in this connection I should like to draw your attention to an anomaly which seems to have crept in inadvertently regarding the ‘Rashtrabhasha’ for India. To the best of my knowledge the Congress resolution on the subject contains the word ‘Hindustani’ and not ‘Hindi’. You yourself, in all your speeches and writings, have always used the word ‘Hindustani’. It is therefore to be regretted that a majority of Congressmen have, in contravention of the Congress resolution, been using the word ‘Hindi’.
 This use of the wrong word has given rise to considerable misund- erstanding and contention among the members of the differentcamps of the Congress. To my mind it should be neither ‘Hindi’ nor ‘Urdu’, and all Congressmen when referring to the Rashtrabhasha should use the word ‘Hindustani’.
 I endorse the suggestion whole-heartedly. Rashtrabhasha  has only one name, i.e., Hindustani.

435,"December 19, 1938",PROHIBITION,"
        
 Prohibition in the Congress provinces is not going on in the spirit in which it was conceived. It is perhaps no fault of the Ministers. Public opinion is not insistent. Congress opinion is equally dormant. Congressmen do not seem to see that prohibition means new life for many millions. It means new and substantial accession of moral and material strength. They do not realize that honest prohibition gives a dignity and prestige to the Congress which perhaps no other single step can give. They do not see that prosecution of prohibition means identification with the masses and a resolute determination to refuse to have anything to do with the drink revenue. Even such a confirmed prohibitionist like Rajaji has not had the daring to set apart the drink revenue purely for the purpose of fighting the drink evil. He has proved in this matter too cautious for me. Congressmen have learnt to count no cost too dear for winning freedom. Our freedom will be the freedom of slaves if we continue to be victims of the drink and drug habit. Is any cost too much to establish complete prohibition in all the provinces?
 And yet one finds Ministers drawing up prohibition progra- mmes in a proper bania spirit. They think of their deficits. I wonder
 what they will do if all the winebibbers and opiumeaters suddenly give up their drinks and drugs ! They will manage somehow, it may be answered. Why will they not do so voluntarily? Surely, merit lies in doing the right thing voluntarily, not compulsorily ! The Bihar Government did not come to a standstill, when the earthquake swallowed more than their annual income. What do the Governments all over India do, when famines and floods ruin people and materially reduce the State revenue? I maintain that the Congress Governments break the spirit, if not the letter, of their pledge, when they delay prohibition for the sake of revenue.
 They can and must make an honest attempt to raise money by fresh taxation. The drink curse is most prevalent in urban areas. It is in these areas that they can resort to fresh taxation. Prohibition gives direct help to the employers of labour. They can surely afford to bear the loss of revenue caused by prohibition. The few months of prohibition in Ahmedabad have put money into the pockets both of the employers and the labourers. There is no reason whatsoever why the employers should not pay for this inestimable service.  Many similar sources of revenue can easily be thought of.
 I have not hesitated to suggest a grant or at least a loan without interest from the Government of India where it can be proved that the raising of additional revenue is not a practical proposition.
 The only valid reason for not having immediate prohibition is want of previous experience and hence the need for caution. I viewed the Salem experiment in that light. The Madras Government wanted to take the first step with great deliberation and did not want to take any risk of failure. The success of the Salem experiment should be suffi- cient encouragement to go on with the whole scheme. But it is not im- possible to understand the desire of each Government to go in for prohibition in stages so as to have local experience. It was for that reason that the Working Committee fixed three years as the period to bring about complete prohibition. The time is running fast. And if India is to be free of the curse within the period fixed, there should be no delay for want of money or for fear of deficit in revenue. And if the programme is prosecuted with single-minded zeal, there is no doubt that the other provinces and the States will follow.

436,"December 19, 1938",DISTRICT BOARDS,"
        
 It has often been borne in upon me that District Boards and Municipal Councils are excrescences involving a useless tax upon the people’s purses. This became patent to me during the non- co-operation days in Mehmadabad. I had then advised the people that, if they boycotted their council or whatever it was called, they could do their own sweeping and lighting and conduct their schools without fuss and without much expense and avoid wrangling into the bargain.
 The truth of my remark became clear to me a few days ago when a member of the Surat District Board came to me, showed me a circular issued by the Board, and asked me for my blessing on their scheme. The scheme was extra-official. There are about forty mem- bers of the Board. I write from memory. They have really no work except to meet at stated intervals and hold debates on certain items of expenditure. As the Board has a sweeping Congress majority and as some of the members are conscientious, they do not know how to use their time for the service of the people. The Board has an income altogether inadequate for the expenditure required to keep all its departments in good order and condition, especially the roads. The circular, therefore, contained a pompous advertisement that the mem- bers and the officials would work during the National Week in April at road repairs, etc. On the strength of the proverb that something is better than nothing, certainly the National Week idea was commen- dable. But it was not good enough for me. I said, “If you want my blessing, you must begin work now and not merely for one week as a holiday, but for the whole term of your office and regularly as if you were members of the paid staff—no doubt consistently with your domestic and other obligations. In other words, you should constitute yourselves into a national service. You will meet officially only to vote items you must, but never to hold long debates or wrangle over petty appointments and the like. But your real and solid work would be extra-official. You would take pride in having first-class roads which you will have built yourselves. You will run your schools efficiently. You will see that your district has its proper supply of water, and your fields are well manured and grow crops that are useful from the national standpoint. You will teach the people proper methods of sanitation and ensure voluntary prohibition by weaning the people from the drink habit. You will run night-schools for adults. If you are
 
 in earnest about your duty, you will be too few for the task. You will set an example to the other boards and you will justify the choice of the electors. The result will be that the electors themselves and the others will become a voluntary brigade of workers who will revolutionize the life of the people around you. If you take to heart what I am telling you, you will find at once that you cannot  do without hand-ginning, hand-carding, hand-spinning and hand- weaving This will give full occupation during leisure hours to every boy, girl, man and woman who is not disabled for light labour, and you will immediately add a good few lacs of rupees to your income as a district. When you have achieved this programme you will have my blessings. I shall become your advertising agent. If you cannot do this, do not play with your work by having a spectacular demon- stration of your holiday patriotism.
 I fear, however, that the District Boards in India will not quite approve of the programme of voluntary service I have sketched above. I, therefore, suggest that at least the Congress provinces have a model and novel legislation constituting municipal, local and district boards on the basis of efficiency. I would have them elected, but there would be very few men and women capable of doing administrative, plodding work. Each one of the members will have his work cut out for him. I should impress the services of the paid officials side by side with the elected members who will be at once their masters and co-workers. This is but the barest outline of Boards of my notion. The Congress is a revolutionary body in the widest and the wisest sense. It must be original. All its activities must be derived from its creed of non-violence. There must be a perfect chain linking the smallest to the biggest unit after the same pattern, so that he who runs may see that it is an artistic whole designed to answer the main purpose. This presupposes one united mind and will in the Congress—not the mind and will of one man but the minds and wills of many men and women acting as one mind and one will.

      MY 	DEAR JOSHI,  December 	21, 1938 
  	I am very grateful to you for your two letters containing an 	exhaustive reply to my letter. I am glad too that Parulekar took the 	trouble of writing out his speech. Though the sentences marked do 	not appear in the speech, there is hot stuff enough in it, 	perilously going near to the sentiments ascribed to Parulekar in the 	report I sent to you. Mark the following:    
 They often described British bureaucracy as Satanic. I must find out a stronger term than the word “Satanic”, as this act is more devilish.	They
 know that the Bill is not in your interest and, therefore, they are afraid of you. They feel nervous. They think that you will throw away their Gandhi caps. This “Gandhi Cap Government” has shown by its acts that they are not the friends of the poor. They are there to work in the interests of the rich.       If
 they postpone the discussion they will have to discuss the Bill in Bombay who are politically conscious. The workers in Bombay will take out monster demonstrations and will create such a row that those who are responsible for the Bill will not be able to enjoy sound and comfortable sleep. The workers can be compared to a sleeping lion. I warn Government not to wake him up. Let them not tease him. Let them not attack him. They must realize that if they provoke him the working class has enough strength to retaliate on the strongest Government.      This Bill is  a  deadly poisonous pill coated with
 sugar. We must scratch the sugar and leave the poison to be swallowed by the framers of the Bill.
 I should not like such language in the mouth of a member of the Society.
 As to your remark about the danger to civil liberty, I would like you to give me some concrete suggestion for a Provincial Government to be at least able to know what public men are saying and doing. Or, do you suggest that they ought not to concern themselves with the sayings and doings of public men? I am not now thinking of the possible punishment that might be inflicted upon those who make speeches inciting to violence or whatever is considered contrary to law. I am thinking of peaceful action such as warning to reckless spea- kers and establishing contact with organizations to which they belong. So far as Paruleker is concerned, I am making further inquiry. In any case I am quite clear in my mind that there should be no prosecution against him and I am writing to Kher accordingly.
 Yours sincerely,

  	I have your two letters. I have been too busy to write to you 	earlier, but Pyarelal has been attending to every one of your 	require- ments. The wool is being taken up and I shall have it woven 	and of course make use of it myself, unless I make better use of it 	by using it for exhibition purposes. I have not decided.

               SEGAON, 
  [December 22, 1938]libtech_396_footnote  	I congratulate you on the demonstration of the drill that you have 	given. It is a necessary part of your training. But while you have 	made a fine beginning, you have still much ground to traverse.  	The object of mass drill is to enable large bodies of people to 	perform any movement rhythmically and swiftly and with absolute 	precision. What a saving in national time and energy it would mean 	if we could do that in our public meetings and functions ! There is 	a silent music in disciplined movement of masses of men and women. 	Just now I asked you to move a little towards me so that my low 	voice may reach you. Had you advanced far enough in your drill, you 	would have been able to perform that movement with ease without any 	noise or confusion. There is a rhythm and music in drill that makes 	action effortless and eliminates fatigue. If the whole nation of 300 	millions could be drilled so as to move together and act together 	and if necessary to die together as one man, we should attain 	indepen- dence without striking a blow and set an example of a 	peaceful revo- lution for the whole world to emulate.  	I was particularly glad to note that the Khoja Boarding House at 	Wardha had sent its quota of scouts to participate in your rally. 	This is as it should be. Boy scouts’ training has been 	incorporated in the Wardha Scheme of Education. It would be nothing 	worth if it did not serve to remove all mutual distrust and 	suspicion and foster among the various sections and communities a 	perfect spirit  of camaraderie which is an integral part of that 	scheme, although it is not set down in so many words in the Zakir 	Husain Committee’s report. The Wardha Scheme of Education does not 	aim merely at imparting literary train- ing to the students; its 	object is to give an education for life that would answer the need 	of our millions. It is calculated to be a living and life-giving 	experiment. Teachers, who have in their turn to become torch-bearers 	of this education, have need, therefore, of a broader and     
 wider training. And scoutcraft is an important and useful part of that training.
 I know something of the work of the old Seva Samiti founded by Revered Malaviyaji. I know also Pandit Hridayanath  Kunzru’s work on it; and I have come in contact with Shri Bajpai, the organizer of the Samiti. If, therefore, I offer a few remarks by way of sugges- tions, they must be taken as those of a friend. As I watched the flag salutation ceremony, there seemed to be an air of unreality about it. Your song is composed in highflown language. You have in that song expressed your readiness to lay down your lives for that flag which you have envisioned as one day floating over the whole world. Could you seriously mean it, I asked myself, as you sang that song. I venture to suggest that such sentiments as are expressed in that song may not be associated with any other than the national flag—if they are not to remain a mere pious wish calculated to begin and end with the singing of that song. People cannot die for many flags. If you must have a separate flag and a hoisting ceremony, your song should be pitched in a lower key. Then, again, I see you have your inscription on the flag in English. That seems to me an anomaly. You should have on your flag Hindustani inscription. Scouting must aim not merely at the training of the body but that of the brain and heart too. It would be a poor performance if it confines itself to mere externals and ignores the internal.
 A word to the pupil teachers who are assembled here. As the first batch, on them rests a heavy responsibility. It is not merely they but the scheme of education which they are out to work that is going to be put on its trial. It therefore behoves them to be punctilious and exact in every little thing that they say or do. They must weigh every word that they utter and take care never to utter a word in vain. It is a new and untried experiment that they are going to launch upon, i.e., to give the whole education through a craft. Success will be the reward of unremitting exercise of intelligence in all their acts. Nothing will be more detrimental to it than insincerity in speech, thought or action.

 December 23, 1938
 DEAR LORD LINLITHGOW,
 I find that Residents in certain States are discouraging Ruling Chiefs from having any dealings with Congressmen such as Sardar Patel. I have unimpeachable evidence in two cases. Of these I am free to mention one. That is in connection with Rajkot. I do not wish to tax you with details. I hope it is not the intention at the headquarters to discourage ruling Chiefs from cultivating friendly relations with Congressmen.The States people have always looked to the Congress for guidance and advice. With increasing awakening among the States people, there should be no wonder if Chiefs seek Congress advice and assistance in settling their differences with their people. Discourage- ment by Residents amounts to orders to them. Recent declarations in London seem to show that there is no intention, on the part of the superior authority, to interfere with the Chiefs in such matters. If my impression is correct and if on enquiry you find that the statement I have made about Rajkot is borne out, may I expect that you will instruct Residents in general not to interfere with the Ruling Chiefs who may choose to seek the assistance of Congressmen in solving the difficulties that face them?

  	I have gone through your letter carefully. It is good. But I notice 	that you cannot bear to be separated from  the  cows.  You should 	take it that the separation is in the interest of greater service to 	the cow. I shall gain some experience and so will you. You have 	doubts as to the propriety of what is being done. It is not right. 	For if you have doubts it denotes a lack of knowledge behind your 	renun- ciation. From what you told me yesterday I thought your heart 	was cleansed and you had realized that what was being done was all 	to the good. I never attributed to you any baseness of spirit. I did 	mention your pride and that too by way of praise. I even said that 	in your devotion to the cow you have no equal, not even Parnerkar, 	and the same applied to your capacity for hard labour. Your 	experience too is considerable, for you have been familiar with 	agriculture and cattle- keeping from childhood. But I also said that 	notwithstanding all this your knowledge was not systematic or 	scientific and consequently you would not be able to make further 	progress in animal husbandry and that your anger would consume you 	as well as the cow. At the same time I asked Parnerkar to examine 	his heart and to take posse-ssion of the dairy only if he was 	confident of himself. He has been given charge only under this 	stipulation and these conditions. I have had a talk with Nayakumji. 	He will discuss the matter with you. Do not commit yourself 	definitely to any work for the present. Have a little rest; give 	some quiet thought to what has been and is being done; read and 	ponder a little and do whatever Ashram tasks naturally come your 	way. Consult Chimanlal and take up any job for which he is hard- 	pressed. There can never be any want of work in our institution for 	a worker like you.

 A beginning has been made in forming girl volunteer brigades. Naturally they require lessons in drilling, salutation to the flag, national songs, etc. If there was a book of instructions covering these important matters, we should have uniformity of practice throughout India. At present there is anarchy. Every gymnasium teaches what it likes, uses or coins its own technical words, and in many cases orders are given in English. Imagine village girls being given orders in English which they do not understand. This is essentially for the central office to handle, and that too with the quickest despatch. If the book suggested by me is published immediately, it will be useful for the instruction of the corps that are being formed in view of the coming Congress session in Mahakoshal.
 I commend this letter to the central office. It ought not to be difficult to bring out the required book inside a week. The material is there in a scattered form. Dr. Hardikar has, I think, published some literature on the subject. Pandit Malaviyaji’s organization must have also issued some instruction book. I know that Prof. Manikrao of Baroda has taken great pains to produce simple technical terms in Hindustani answering most of the requirements. It ought to  be  a simple matter to bring out an authoritative book out of this material.
 In this connection I would remind the Mahakoshal Reception Committee of the suggestion I had made at Haripura that there should be a guide book for Congressmen and visitors in simple Hindustani, written in Devanagari and Urdu scripts, about sanitation, etc. Generally the visitors are left to their own resources. They do not even know where to find the places they want to go to or the things they need. A guide book with a map of the Congress Nagar for the help of those thousands of people who attend the Congress session from year to year is a necessity.

 SEGAON, WARDHA,
 December 24, 1938
 MY DEAR C. R.,
 Sir Radhakrishnan was here yesterday. He said that anti-Hindi agitation was on the increase. He had suggested to you  that  you should accept a conscience clause, exempting those children from learning Hindi whose parents stated in writing that they had a cons- cientious objection to their children learning Hindi. I suppose you remember that such a suggestion was made in Harijan in the initial stages of the agitation. I think that it is not too late to give effect to it.  It should not matter to you even though the concession may be interpreted as concession to unreasonable agitation. You will do what appears to you to be best.
 What about separation of Andhra as a separate province? You had made some statement that you were moving in the matter. Are you? How are you keeping otherwise?
Love.
 Yours,
 BAPU

V. HODSONlibtech_400_footnote","
        
 [Before December 25, 1938]libtech_401_footnote
 Mr. Hodson expressed the opinion that the solution of the Hindu-Muslim question was made difficult by the fact that, owing to its very nature, the Congress tended to take on the nature of a “totalitarian party” and acted as if it were the one and the only party in the country that mattered, instead of regarding itself simply as one of the principal parties.
 GANDHIJI: It is a very wrong view to take of the Congress. The Con-gress does claim to be the one and the only party that can deliver the goods. It is a perfectly valid claim to make. One day or the other some party has to assert itself to that extent. That does not make it a totalitarian party. It is the ambition of the Congress to become all-re-
 
 presentative of the entire nation, not merely of any particular section. And it is a worthy ambition in keeping with its best tradition. If you have studied Congress history, you will find that since its  very inception the Congress has sought to serve and represent all sections in the country equally without any distinction or discrimination. Thus it used to have Rajas and Maharajas on the Reception Committee, and has defended the cause of the States against the Paramount Power as in the case of Kashmir and Mysore. It would love to be absorbed by the Muslim League if the Muslim League would care to absorb it, or to absorb the Muslim League in its turn, so far as the political programme is concerned. For religious and social activity, of course, every community can have its separate organization.
 HODSON: But if the Congress has the ambition of absorbing other political organizations, it cannot help being a totalitarian party.
 GANDHIJI: You may try to damn it by calling it totalitarian. Absorption is inevitable when a country is engaged in a struggle to wrest power from foreign hands; it cannot afford to have separate, rival political organizations. The entire strength of the country must be used for ousting the third and usurping party. That is what is happening in India today. Where there is no common danger to oppose, there must be separate parties representing different schools of thought. You should bear in mind that the Congress does not im- pose its will on others. Its sanctions are non-violent.
 HODSON: Would not the march to full responsible government be more rapid if the Muslims were taken along?
 GANDHIJI: Of course it would be. Personally I do not want any- thing which the Muslims oppose. But I have faith that the solution of the Hindu-Muslim tangle will come much sooner than most people expect. I claim to be able to look at the whole position with a detached mind. There is no substance in our quarrels. Points of difference are superficial, those of contact are deep and permanent. Political and economic subjection is common to us. The same climate, the same rivers, the same fields supply both with air, water and food. Whatever, therefore, leaders, Mahatmas and Maulanas may say or do, the masses, when they are fully awakened, will assert themselves and combine for the sake of combating common evils.
 The effect of the Socialist and Communist propaganda too is to bring the masses of both the communities together by emphasizing identity of interests. I have my differences with them, but I cannot
 withhold my admiration for their endeavour to demolish the supers- tition that keeps the different communities apart.

 Manibehn is a mani libtech_403_footnote. I know of only one Mani in India who has sacrificed her all in order to serve her father and who has readily accepted spinsterhood for his sake. She left for Rajkot at one single word from her father and the strength that she had derived from her incomparable devotion is amazing.

But I cannot help quoting the last sentence of her latest letter from jail. It is in praise of the spinning-wheel. It runs as follows:
 It is after a long time that I have found such leisure to work on the spinning-wheel. And when I can spin so peacefully, I do not need anything else. I find incomparable joy in this. I feel that I should spin enough to make up for the many days when I could not spin.
 We do not come across many persons who combine so well in themselves love of the spinning-wheel, sacrifice, devotion to one’s father and courage of the highest order. But, when I do come across one, my heart dances with joy.

				STATE CONGRESSlibtech_405_footnote","
        
 [Before December 26, 1938]libtech_406_footnote
 The Working Committee of the Hyderabad State Congress after great deliberation has decided upon a temporary suspension of satya- graha, which was launched recently and which has already resulted in the imprisonment of more than 400 satyagrahis. Sentences range from one month to 3_ years.
 The public would like to know the reasons that have prompted this decision.
 The State Congress has come in for a great deal of misreprese- ntation. It has been called a communal body. Its activities have been mixed up with those of the Aryan Defence League and the Hindu Civil Liberties Union. Unfortunately the movements of the A. S.libtech_407_footnoteand the Hindu M. S.libtech_408_footnotesynchronized with the civil disobedience of the State Congress. The decisive cause has been the advice given by Gandhiji, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and other Congress leaders that in order to make our position absolutely clear it was essential that we should suspend C. D. They say suspension would give the Government of H.
 E. H. the Nizam an opportunity to review the situation. We could not disregard the advice of the leaders whose sympathy and support are always a valuable asset in the conduct of the struggle for swaraj within the State.
 We suspend C. D. in the hope that it will not need to be revived. But whether it will have to be revived, and if so when, will depend wholly upon the attitude of the State authorities. It is not without a wrench that we are suspending the struggle when more than 400 of our comrades are undergoing imprisonment ranging from 4_ years to two months [sic]. We have more than 2000 persons on our list as volunteers for C. D. The list is daily increasing. Every fresh arrest brings an addition to the list. We have had embarrassing offers of volunteers from outside the State. We have been obliged to decline the offers as we realize that the movement in order to remain strictly non-
 
 violent must depend upon internal strength and support.
 But we have no desire to use our strength and undergo suffer- ing, if we can achieve our end through negotiation and entreaty. We hope therefore that the Government of H. E. H. will recognize the wholly peaceful and loyal motive underlying the suspension. We hope that they will release the C. D. prisoners and lift the ban on the S. C. and its activities and pave the way to the inauguration of a scheme of responsible government consistently with reasonable safeguards for the rights of minorities.
 Here we would  draw  the  attention  of the  members  of the State Congress that there are two arms to a non-violent swaraj move- ment, the remedial and constructive. C. D. is remedial and therefore in its nature temporary. The other is constructive and permanent. We hope that the people will never lose sight of the permanent arm. Indeed our fitness for C. D. increases in the same measure as the intensity of the constructive programme. The constructive activities include hand-spinning, hand-weaving and like productive pursuits, activities promoting heart unity between the different communities composing the subjects of H. E. H. the Nizam, removal of untou- chability, total abstinence from intoxicating drinks and drugs and kindred reforms. For a non-violent movement for gaining free-dom must necessarily be a process of purification and social and economic reform. No one should run away with the idea that sus-pension of C.
 D. is suspension of movement for responsible govern-ment. Indeed its constructive nature should be doubly strengthened because suspen- sion of C. D. frees the mind for constructive work.
 In conclusion we wish to thank all those friends who  have  helped us by their advice and even material assistance.

468,"December 26, 1938",STUDENTS’ SHAME,"
        
 There is a most pathetic letter from a college girl in the Punjab lying on my file for nearly two months. Want of time was but an excuse for shirking the answer to the girl’s question. Somehow or other I was avoiding the task, though I knew the answer. Meanwhile I received another letter from a sister of great experience, and I felt that I could no longer evade the duty of dealing with the college girl’s very real difficulty. Her letter is written in chaste Hindustani. I must
 
 try to do as much justice as I can to the letter, which gives me a perfect picture of her deep feeling. Here is my rendering of a portion of the letter:
 To girls and grown-up women there come times, in spite of their wish to the contrary, when they have to venture out alone, whether they are going from one place to another in the same city or from one town to another. And when they are thus found alone, evil-minded people pester them. They use im- proper or even indecent language whilst they are passing by. And if fear does not check them, they do not hesitate to take further liberty. I should like to know what part non-violence can play on such occasions. The use of violence is of course there. If the girl or the woman has sufficient courage, she will use what resources she has and teach miscreants a lesson. They can at least kick up a row that would draw the attention of the people around, resulting in the miscreants being horse-whipped. But I know that the result of such treatment would be merely to postpone the agony, not a permanent cure. Where you know the people who misbehave, I feel sure that they will listen to reason, to the gesture of love and humility. But what about a fellow cycling by, using foul language on seeing a girl or a woman unaccompanied by a male companion? You have no oppor- tunity of reasoning with him. There is no likelihood of your meeting him again. You may not even recognize him. You do not know his address. What is a poor girl or a woman to do in such cases? By way of example I want to give you my own experience of last night (26th October). I was going with a girl companion of mine on a very special errand at about 7.30 p. m. It was impossible to secure a male companion at the time and the errand could not be put off. On the way a Sikh young man passed by on his cycle and continued to murmur something till we were within hearing distance. We knew that it was aimed at us. We felt hurt and uneasy. There was no crowd on the road. Before we had gone a few paces the cyclist returned. We recog- nized him at once whilst he was still at a respectful distance. He wheeled towards us, heaven knows whether he had intended to get down or merely pass by us. We felt that we were in danger. We had no faith in our physical prowess. I myself am weaker than the average girl. But in my hands I had a big book. Somehow or other courage came to me all of a sudden. I hurled
 the heavy book at the cycle and roared out, “Dare you repeat your pranks?” He could with difficulty keep his balance, put on speed and fled from us. Now, if I had not flung the book at his cycle, he might have harassed us by his filthy language to the end of our journey. This was an ordinary, perhaps insignificant, occurrence; but I wish you could come to Lahore and listen to the difficulties of us unfortunate girls. You  would  surely discover a proper solution. First of all, tell me how, in the circumstances mentioned above, can girls apply the principle of ahimsa and save themselves. Secondly, what is the remedy for curing youth of the abominable habit of insulting womenfolk? You would not suggest that we should wait and suffer till a new generation, taught from childhood to be polite to their women- folk, comes into being. The Government is either unwilling or unable to deal with this social evil. The big leaders have no time for such questions. Some, when they hear of a girl bravely castigating ill-behaved youth, say, ‘Well done. That is the way all girls should behave.’ Sometimes a leader is found eloquently lecturing against such misbehaviour of students. But no one applies himself continuously to the solution of this serious problem. You will be painfully surprised to know that during Diwali and such other holidays newspapers come out with notices warning women from venturing outdoors even to see the illuminations. This one fact should enable you to know to what straits we are reduced in this part of the world! Neither  the writers nor the readers of such warnings have any  sense  of shame that they should have to be issued.
 Another Punjabi girl to whom I gave the letter to read supports the narrative from her own experiences of her college days and tells me that what my correspondent has related is the common experience of most girls.
 The other letter from an experienced woman relates the ex- periences of her girl friends in Lucknow. They  are  molested  in cinema theatres by boys sitting in the row behind them using all kinds of language which I can only call indecent. They are stated to resort even to practical jokes which have been described by my corres- pondent but which I must not reproduce here.
 If the immediate personal relief was all that was needed, no doubt the remedy that the girl who describes herself to be physically weak adopted, i. e., of flinging her book at the cyclist, was quite
 correct. It is an age-long remedy. And I have said in these columns that when a person wants to become violent, physical weakness does not come in the way of its effective use, even against a physically powerful opponent. And we know that in the present age there have been invented so many methods of using physical force that even a little girl with sufficient intelligence can deal death and destruction. The fashion nowadays is growing of training girls to defend themselves in situations such as the one described by my corres- pondent. But she is wise enough to know that even though she was able to make effective use for the moment of the book she had in her hand as a weapon of defence, it was no remedy for the growing evil. In the cases of rude remarks, there need be no perturbation but there should be no indifference. All such cases should be published in the papers. Names of the offenders should be published when they are traced. There should be no false modesty about exposing the evil. There is nothing like public opinion for castigating public mis- conduct. There is no doubt that, as the correspondent says, there is great public apathy about such matters. But it is not the public alone that are to blame. They must have before them examples of rudeness. Even as stealing cannot be dealt with unless cases of thieving are published and followed up, so also is it impossible to deal with cases of rude behaviour if they are suppressed. Crime and vice generally require darkness for prowling. They disappear when light plays upon them.
 But I have a fear that the modern girl loves to be Juliet to half a dozen Romeos. She loves adventure. My correspondent seems to represent the unusual type. The modern girl dresses not to protect herself from wind, rain and sun but to attract attention. She improves upon nature by painting herself and looking extraordinary. The non-violent way is not for such girls. I have often remarked in these columns that definite rules govern the development of the non-violent spirit in us. It is a strenuous effort. It marks a revolution in the way of thinking and living. If my correspondent and the girls of her way of thinking will revolutionize their life in the prescribed manner, they will soon find that young men, who at all come in contact with them, will learn to respect them and to put on their best behaviour in their presence. But if perchance they find, as they may, that their very chastity is in danger of being violated, they must develop courage enough to die rather than yield to the brute in man. It has been suggested that a girl who is gagged or bound so as to make her powerless even for struggling cannot die as easily as I seem to think. I
 venture to assert that a girl who has the will to resist can burst all the bonds that may have been used to render her powerless. The resolute will gives her the strength to die.
 But this heroism is possible only for those who have trained themselves for it. Those who have not a living faith in non-violence will learn the art of ordinary self-defence and protect themselves from indecent behaviour of unchivalrous youth.
 The great question, however, is why should young men be  devoid of elementary good manners so as to make decent girls be in perpetual fear of molestation from them? I should be sorry to dis- cover that the majority of young men have lost all sense of chivalry. But they should, as a class, be jealous of their reputation and deal with every case of impropriety occurring among their mates. They must learn to hold the honour of every woman as dear as that of their own sisters and mothers. All the education they receive will be in vain if they do not learn good manners.
 And is it not as much the concern of professors and school masters to ensure gentlemanliness among their pupils as to prepare them for the subjects?

 Unrevised	SEGAON,
 December 26, 1938
 CHI. JAMNALAL,
 Recently there was a thought for the day in English. It means: Man should not think about his shortcomings but should think about his virtues, for man becomes as he thinks. This does not mean that one should not see one’s faults. One must see them, but one should not brood over them and lose one’s balance of mind. We find the same advice in our Shastras. You should, therefore, have confidence in yourself and be sure in your mind that you will be an instrument of good. You have already been so.
 You should overcome excessive greed. You should give up private business even if it is intended to help you in public service. If you cannot do that, you must lay down strict limits. You should try to retire from politics. If you think that you must remain in it, and if you can do so on your own terms, you should devote yourself exclusively to the advancement of the C. P. But your real field is altruistic business. Hence you should again use all your ability for the Charkha Sangh. That activity can make full use of your intellect, your moral qualities and your business acumen. In politics lots of dirty things go on. You are not likely to get much satisfaction from it. If the Charkha Sangh succeeds fully in its object, we shall easily get purna swaraj. If
 
 you take up that work, you can also do some work for village indus- try, eradication of untouchability, etc. But that depends on your incli- nation. I have said this only to dissuade you from excessive greed and to suggest to you work which would give you heart-felt satisfaction.
 The other thing is impure thoughts. This is a rather difficult problem. If I understand you rightly, I feel that you should stop the practice of being nursed by women. All cannot digest it. In our circle, it can be said that I am practically the only one who follows such a practice. The measure of my success or failure will be judged after my death. For me the thing is still an experiment. I cannot confidently claim that I have succeeded. I yearn to reach the condition of Shuka- devjilibtech_412_footnotelibtech_413_footnote. I am miles away from such a condition. If you have confidence in yourself I have nothing to say. But if you don’t have it, and if I understand you rightly, you should examine yourself deeply and  make the necessary change. I am not suggesting here stopping of women’s service.
 If none of these things find an echo in your heart, you need not do them. Continue to consult me on the matter. There is no cause at all for despair. You are not a fallen person, you are a votary of truth. There is no possibility of a fall for such a person.
 Blessings from

 Your daily post is an eagerly awaited event for me. My heart and spirit are with you. The spirit is hovering round you. You must not accept defeat. You should learn the art of saying everything to K.
 S.libtech_415_footnotelibtech_416_footnotein the gentlest manner possible. You must keep your health and keep it there. There means the Frontier Province. I am prepared to
 
 risk your death there rather than that you should return to Segaon to live. You will be all right in Peshawar. You may pass the week-end in Peshawar, if you cannot keep well in Utmanzai. You should have the three things. You must be able to go out, you must have a boy or a girl exclusively to yourself. Tell K. S. you do not expect him to spend money after you. I hope to send you some tomorrow.
 I told Agatha to ask Jardine to invite you. Of course you could go to Hindu homes. But I do not want you to do that just yet, unless
K. S. himself suggests.
 Anyway see if my suggestion commends itself to you that you are going to do or die there. Of course I shall be there in March. It may not be before the middle because the Congress does not meet before 10th March.
 Mahadev returned yesterday. He broke down the last day of his stay in Calcutta. He is looking quite well but has something wrong in his head. He needs rest and proper dieting. He overdid it in Gosaba.

474,"December 29, 1938",INTERVIEW TO AMERICAN TEACHERS libtech_421_footnote,"
             [Before December 29, 1938]libtech_422_footnote  TEACHER: 	How would you, an old and experienced leader, advise young men to 	throw away their lives in the service of humanity?  GANDHIJI: The question is 	not rightly put. You don’t throw away your lives when you take up 	the weapon of satyagraha. But you prepare yourself to face without 	retaliation the gravest danger and provo-cation. It gives you a 	chance to surrender your life for the cause when the time comes. To 	be able to do so non-violently requires previous training. If you 	are a believer in the orthodox method, you      
 go and train yourselves as soldiers. It is the same with non-violence. You have to alter your whole mode of life and work for it in peace time just as much as in the time of war. It is no doubt a difficult job. You have to put your whole soul into it; and if you are sincere, your example will affect the lives of other people around you. America is today ex-ploiting the so-called weaker nations of the world along with other powers. It has become the richest country in the world, not a thing to be proud of when we come to think of the means by which she has become rich. Again, to protect these riches you need the assistance of violence. You must be prepared to give up these riches. Therefore, if you really mean to give up violence, you will say, “We shall have nothing to do with the spoils of violence, and if as a result America ceases to be rich, we do not mind.” You will then be qualified to offer a spotless sacrifice. That is the meaning of preparation. The occasion for making the extreme sacrifice may not come if you as a nation have fully learnt to live for peace. It is much more difficult to live for non-violence than to die for it.
 T. The friends wanted to know if non-violence as enunciated by Gandhiji had a positive quality.
If I had used the word ‘love’, which non-violence is in essence,
 you would not have asked this question. But perhaps ‘love.’ does not express my meaning fully. The nearest word is ‘charity’. We love our friends and our equals. But the reaction that a ruthless dictator sets up in us is either that of awe or pity according respectively as we react to him violently or non-violently. Non-violence knows no fear. If I am truly non-violent, I would pity the dictator and say to myself, ‘He does not know what a human being should be. One day he will know better when he is confronted by a people who do not stand in awe of him, who will neither submit nor cringe to him, nor bear any grudge against him for whatever he may do.’ Germans are today doing what they are doing because all the other nations stand in awe of them. None of them can go to Hitler with clean hands.
 T. What is the place of Christian missions in the new India that is being built up today? What can they do to help in this great task?
G. To show appreciation of what India is and is doing. Up till
 now they have come as teachers and preachers with queer notions about India and India’s great religions. We have been described as a nation of superstitious heathens, knowing nothing, denying God. We are a brood of Satan as Murdoch would say. Did not Bishop Heber in
 his well-known hymn “From Greenland’s Icy Mountains” describe India as a country where “every prospect pleases, and only man is vile”? To me this is a negation of the spirit of Christ. My personal view, therefore, is that if you feel that India has a message to give to the world, that India’s religions too are true, though like all religions imperfect for having percolated through imperfect human agency, and you come as fellow-helpers and fellow-seekers, there is a place for you here. But if you come as preachers of the ‘true Gospel’ to a people who are wandering in darkness, so far as I am concerned you can have no place. You may impose yourselves upon us.
 T. What is India’s real message to the world?
 G. Non-violence. India is saturated with that spirit. It has not demonstrated it to the extent that you can go to America as living witnesses of that spirit. But you can truthfully say that India is making a desperate effort to live up to that great ideal. If there is not this message, there is no other message that India can give. Say what you may, the fact stands out that here you have a whole subcontinent that has decided for itself that there is no freedom for it except through non-violence. No other country has made that attempt even. I have not been able to influence other people even to the extent of believing that non-violence is worth trying. There is of course a growing body of European opinion that has begun to appreciate the possibilities of the weapon of non-violence. But I want the sympathy of the whole world for India if she can get it while she is making this unique experiment. You can, however, be witnesses to that attempt only if you really feel that we are making an honest effort to come up to the ideal of non-violence and that all we are doing is not fraud. If your conviction is enlightened and deep enough, it will set up a ferment working in the minds of your people.
 T. This is an admirable charge.
G. Take that charge with you then.

Kalelkar               WARDHA,  December 	30, 1938  	Maganlal Gandhi was one of those few spirits who chose to face a 	precarious future by casting their lot with me in South Africa when 	I decided to give up my legal practice in order to embrace the ideal 	of      
 voluntary poverty and service. He became a foundation member of the Phoenix Settlement, and took charge of the printing press when Indian Opinion was shifted there from Durban. Although he  had gone there primarily with the intention of earning money, he sacri- ficed his ambition and decided to sink or swim with me and he never turned back.
 He was, in my opinion, a genius. He had a versatile mind. His life was well ordered and disciplined. This enabled him to pick up anything new with ease and facility. Although not a mechanician by training, he soon made himself master of the printing machinery that was set up at Phoenix. On returning to India he made the service of the masses the passion of his life. He laid the foundation of  the  science of khadi by writing his Vanat Shastra. This book still holds its place as a classic although the science of khadi has made great progress since Maganlal’s death. Although he had not specialized in all the various crafts that are at present being tackled by the A. I. V. I. A., his khadi activity, by providing the nucleus round which the village industries movement has since grown up, became its precursor.
 A word about the buildings. Although, as Shri Kumarappa has observed, they follow the rural style, they are still far above the rural standards of living as they obtain in our country today. They stand there as a futurist symbol of what artisans’ dwellings should be and would be in the rural India of the A. I. V. I. A.’s dreams. This much assurance, however, I can give you in this connection, that no pains have been spared to enforce the stingiest economy and simplicity commensurate with the purpose that they are intended to serve. The worst that can be said about the organizers of the Association is that they did not know their job as well as they might have. The Asso- ciation is always ready to admit mistakes and to regard them as stepp- ing-stones to knowledge. The one thing that it dreads is ignorance that masquerades as perfection.
 So much for the externals. Proceeding to the exhibits inside the Museum, a critic may object, ‘How can reversion to these primitive appliances and methods of production lead to swaraj? These village crafts have been with us always. Can they win the race against the industrial competition of the West and achieve anything like what the Western countries with their latest inventions of science and enginee- ring skill have been able to achieve?’ My reply is that although village crafts have been with us always, our forefathers were not aware of the
 tremendous possibilities that lie hidden in them and, they were never plied by awakened masses as a means for attaining freedom. I admit that in terms of orthodox and stereotyped standards of economics, as that science is understood and taught in our colleges today, and in a society governed by these standards, village industries including spin- ning have perhaps no chance, and to revive them might appear like reversion to Middle Ages. But I would like you to enter the Udyog Bhavan with a fresh and unsophisticated mind that has shed its preju- dices. Envisage this spinning-wheel as a spinning mill in minia-ture, that enables a person to earn two annas daily in his home in this land of chronic and nationwide unemployment and starvation when other- wise he would not be earning two pice even. Picture this mill planted in lakhs of homes, as it is capable of being planted, and I see nothing in the world which can compete with it.
 And yet two annas a day by no means exhausts its income- yielding capacity. If only I get the co-operation of our intelligentsia, I hope, before I close my eyes, to see it bring a wage of eight annas a day to the spinner. Show me another industry or industrial corpo- ration in the world that has in the course of eighteen years of its activi- ties put four crores of rupees into the pockets of lakhs of the neediest and most deserving of men and women, with the same capital expen- diture that the A. I. S. A. has done. And this money has been evenly distributed among Hindus and Mussalmans, caste and the outcaste, without any distinction, uniting them in a common economic bond. Imagine what this would mean in terms of swaraj if many helped to cover the entire seven lakhs of our villages with this life-giving and unifying activity. You need not be highly specialized engi-neers or technicians to take part in this work of industrial revolu-tion. Even a layman, a woman or a child can join in it.
 I would like you to regard the Magan Museum and the Udyog Bhavan not as the ‘old curiosity shop’ but as a living book for self- education and study.

ECONOMISTSlibtech_430_footnote","
               WARDHA, 
  December 	30, 1938  	I want you to criticize what you have seen, and tell me the de- 	fects you may have discovered. Praise won’t help me. I know where 	I deserve praise. Do not tell me ex cathedra that the 	whole thing is doomed to failure, as some economists have done 	before. Such con- demnation would not impress me. But if after a 	close and sympa- thetic study you discover flaws and point them out 	to me, I shall feel thankful.  Q. 	Are you against large-scale production?  	A. I never said that. This belief is one of the many superstitions 	about me. Half of my time goes in answering such things. But from 	scientists I expect better knowledge. Your question is based on 	loose newspaper reports and the like. What I am against is 	large-scale pro- duction of things villagers can produce without 	difficulty.  Q. 	What do you think of the Planning Commission ?  A. I cannot say anything. 	I have not studied it. It was not dis- cussed in my presence in the 	Working Committee. Because I still con- tinue to tender advice to 	the Working Committee whenever my advice is sought, it does not mean 	that everything that emerges from the Working Committee bears my 	imprimatur or is even discussed with me. I have purposely 	divested myself of responsibility, so far as the general body of 	decisions are concerned.  Q. 	It has your blessings?  A. What can be the use of 	my blessings in a thing I do not know, or in which I am not 	interested.  Q. 	Do you think that cottage industries  and 	 big  industries 	 can  be harmonized ?  A. Yes, if they are 	planned so as to help the villages. Key industries, industries which 	the nation needs, may be centralized. But then I would not choose 	anything as a ‘key industry’ that can be taken up by the 	villages with a little organizing. For instance, I did not    
 know the possibilities of hand-made paper. Now I am so hopeful that  I believe that every village can produce its own paper, though not for newspapers, etc. Supposing the State controlled paper-making and centralized it, I would expect it to protect all the paper that villages can make.
 Q. What is meant by protecting the villages?
 A. Protecting them against the inroads of the cities. At one time cities were dependent on the villages. Now it is the reverse. There is no interdependence. Villages are being exploited and drained by the cities.
 Q. Don’t the villages need a lot of things that the cities produce ?
 A. I wonder. In any case, under my scheme, nothing will be allowed to be produced by cities which can be equally well produced by the villages. The proper function of cities is to serve as clearing houses for village products.
 Q. Can we harmonize cloth-mill activity with handloom production?
 A. So far as I know, my answer is an emphatic ‘no’. All the cloth we need can easily be produced in the villages.
 Q. But the number of mills is increasing.
A. That is a misfortune.
 Q. But that is one of the things that the Planning Commission has set itself to
  do.   A. 	It is news to me. In that case the Congress will have to scrap "

483,"December 31, 1938","INTERVIEW TO TIMOTHY
TINGFANG LEWlibtech_438_footnote","
        
 December 31, 1938
 Rev. Lew, . . . in conveying thanks for the Indian medical mission to help the Chinese, remarked:
 “We appreciate it as an expression of India’s sympathy and goodwill towards China. China’s struggle is not merely for China but for the whole of Asia. . . .
 “We are not afraid of material destruction,	but of cultural destruction. The
 first bomb in Shanghai hit a library. Colleges have been wiped out. Professors have been killed. . . .
 “Even worse is the moral injury. . . .
 “We want your message.	We look to you for spiritual guidance.”
 GANDHIJI: I was once asked by a Chinese friend from Santini- ketan to give a message to the Chinese people. I had to ask him to excuse me. I gave him my reasons. If I merely said I sympathized with the Chinese in their struggle, it would be not of much value as coming from me. I should love to be able to say to the Chinese definitely that their salvation lay only through non-violent technique. But then it is not for a person like me, who is outside the fight, to say to a people who are engaged in a life-and death struggle, “Not this way, but that”. They would not be ready to take up the new method, and they would be unsettled in the old. My interference would only shake them and confuse their minds.
 But whilst I have no ‘message’ to send to the Chinese people who are engaged in fighting, I have no hesitation in presenting my viewpoint to you. I was almost going to ask you as to what you meant by being culturally ruined. I should be sorry to learn that Chinese culture resided in brick and mortar or in huge tomes which the moths can eat. A nation’s culture resides in the hearts and in the soul of its people. Chinese culture is Chinese only to the extent that  it  has become part and parcel of Chinese life. Your saying, therefore, that your culture and your morals are in danger of being destroyed, leads
 
 one to think that the reform movement in your country was only skindeep. Gambling had not disappeared from the people’s hearts. It was kept down not by the tone set by society, but by the penalty of the law. The heart continued to gamble. Japan is of course to blame and must be blamed for what it has done or is doing. But then Japan is just now like the wolf whose business it is to make short work of the sheep. Blaming the wolf would not help the sheep much. The sheep must learn not to fall into the clutches of the wolf.
 If even a few of you took to non-violence, they would stand forth as living monuments of Chinese culture and morals. And then, even if China were overwhelmed on the battlefield, it would be well with China in the end, because it would at the same time be receiving a message which contains a promise of hope and deliverance. Japan cannot force drugs down unwilling throats at the point of the bayonet. It can only set up temptations. You cannot teach people to resist these temptations by replying to Japanese force by force. Whatever else force may or may not be able to achieve, it cannot safeguard Chinese morals or save Chinese culture.
 If you feel the truth of my remarks, you will become a living message to China. You will then tell the Chinese people: “No matter what material destruction Japan inflicts, it cannot bring about China’s cultural destruction. Our people must be sufficiently educated and warned to resist all the temptations that Japan may devise. Monuments and cities may be razed to the ground. They are but a passing show that is going one day to be claimed by time as its own. If they are destroyed by the Japanese, it will only be a morsel taken out of time’s mouth. The Japanese cannot currupt our soul. If the soul of China is injured, it will not be by Japan.”
 The Chinese friend was of opinion that only the economic collapse of Japan could save China. He wanted to know what the prospects of a boycott of Japanese goods by India were.
 GANDHIJI: I wish I could say that there was any great hope. Our sympathies are with you but they have not stirred us to our very depths, or else we should have boycotted all Japanese goods, espe- cially Japanese cloth. Japan is not only conquering you but it is trying to conquer us too by its cheap, flimsy machine-made goods. The sending of the Medical Mission was good as a gesture of friend-ship and goodwill which there are in abundance. But that does not give me much satisfaction when I know we could do much more. We too are a
 
 big nation like you. If we told the Japanese: ‘We are not going to import a single yard of your calico nor export any of our cotton to you,’ Japan would think twice before proceeding with its aggression.

Every- thing will go on well once the people get used to it. Hence fix your time either in the evening or morning. Then we shall see. Of course, one point to consider while deciding about the village is that we are not permanent residents here. Being temporary, it does not seem proper to go for 15 days and then stop.

 Where did you get wet? Even the blessing of someone with a disordered mind is terrible. When will your disorderliness go? To leave one’s meal and go away is an insult to Annadevata. You could have asked me if it was to be fetched immediately or after the meal. I shall have to be more strict now. I shall eat only when you are ready. And once you sit down to eat you shall get up only after finishing the meal. I eat early for the convenience of both of us. You can get ready to eat with me. You must plan your life with some thought. If you do that, you can have more time at your disposal; you can perform your duty better and you can acquire more experience and knowledge.

502,,ENLIGHTENED ANARCHY—A POLITICAL IDEAL,"
        
 Political power, in my opinion, cannot be our ultimate aim. It is one of the means used by men for their all-round advancement. The power to control national life through national representatives is called political power. Representatives will become unnecessary if the natio- nal life becomes so perfect as to be self-controlled. It will then be a state of enlightened anarchy in which each person will become his own ruler. He will conduct himself in such a way that his behaviour will not hamper the well-being of his neighbours. In an ideal State there will be no political institution and therefore no political power. That is why Thoreau has said in his classic statement that that govern- ment is the best which governs the least.

 [On or before January 1, 1939]libtech_456_footnote
 FRYDMAN: What attitude should I, as a realist, adopt with regard to the tide of industrialization that is sweeping over the world?. . . Is it not waste of energy merely to oppose it? Would it not be better to try to change its direction ?
GANDHIJI:  You are an engineer. You will therefore appreciate an
 illustration from mechanics. You know the parallelogram of forces. There the forces do not neutralize each other. Each force acts freely along its own line and we get the resultant which indicates the final direction of motion. It is the same with the problem you have men- tioned. As I look at Russia where the apotheosis of industriazation has been reached, the life there does not appeal to me. To use the language of the Bible, “What shall it avail a man if he gain the whole world and lose his soul?” In modern terms, it is beneath human dignity to lose one’s individuality and become a mere cog in the machine.  I   want  every   individual  to   become  a  full-blooded, fully
 
 
 developed member of society. The villages must become self-suffi- cient. I see no other solution if one has to work in terms of ahimsa. Now I have that conviction.I know there are others who believe in industrialization.I work with all my being for my conviction. The process of adjustment goes on all the time. I do not know what the outcome of it will be. But whatever it is, it will be to the good.
  But, 	is no compromise 	with industrialization 	possible without imperilling 	the ideal 	of self-sufficient villages?  Oh 	yes, Railways are there, I do 	not avoid 	them. I 	hate motor-cars, but 	I make 	use of them 	willy-nilly all 	the same. Again, I 	dislike fountain-pens, 	but just 	now I 	am making 	use of 	one though 	I carry 	a reed 	pen about 	in my box. 	Every time I  use 	the fountain-pen it 	hurts me 	and I 	think of 	the neglected 	reed pen 	in my box. 	Com- promise 	comes in 	at every step, but one 	must realize that 	it is a 	com- promise and keep the final goal constantly in front of the mind’s eye. 
  When 	I turn 	from the busy West to 	masses in 	the Indian 	villages, I seem 	to be moving in a different world altogether in which stagnation reigns.  Yes, 	so long 	as you 	look on the 	surface. But 	the moment you 	talk to 	them and they begin 	to speak, 	you will find that 	wisdom drops 	from their lips. 	Behind the 	crude exterior 	you will 	find a 	deep reservoir of 	spirituality. I 	call this culture. 	You will 	not find 	such a thing 	in the 	West. You 	try to engage 	a European 	peasant in 	conver- sation, 	and you will find that 	he is uninterested 	in things 	spiritual. In the 	case of 	the Indian 	villager an 	age-old culture is 	hidden under an 	encrustment of 	crudeness. Take 	away the encrustation, 	remove his 	chronic poverty and 	his illiteracy and 	you have the finest 	specimen of what 	a cultured, cultivated, free citizen should be.

				WU AND","
        
  C. HSUlibtech_459_footnote  
 [January 1, 1939]libtech_460_footnote
 The Chinese delegates put searching questions.   One of them asked: “Is it  not necessary that individuals should practise non-violence first in their own person, in their relations with other individuals?”
 GANDHIJI: It would be a delusion to think otherwise. If one does not practise non-violence in one’s personal relations with others and hopes to use it in bigger affairs, one is vastly mistaken. Non-violence like charity must begin at home. But if it is necessary for  the  individual to be trained in non-violence, it is even more necessary for the nation to be trained likewise. One cannot be non-violent in one’s own circle and violent outside it. Or else, one is not truly non-violent even in one’s own circle; often the non-violence is only in appea- rance. It is only when you meet with resistance, as for instance when a thief or murderer appears, that your non-violence is put on its trial. You either try or should try to oppose the thief with his own weapons, or you try to disarm’ him by love. Living among decent people, your conduct may not be described as non-violent. Mutual forbearance is not non-violence. Immediately, therefore, you get the conviction that non-violence is the law of life, you have to practise it towards those who act violently towards you, and the law must apply to nations as to individuals. Training is no doubt necessary. And beginnings are  always small. But if the conviction is there, the rest will follow.
   In 		the practice 		of non-violence, is 		there not danger 		of developing a 		‘martyrdom complex’ or pride creeping in?  
A. If one has that pride and egoism, there is no non-violence.
 Non-violence is impossible without humility. My own experience is that whenever I have acted non-violently I have been led to it and sustained in it by the higher promptings of an unseen Power. Through my own will I should have miserably failed. When I first went to jail, I quailed at the prospect. I had heard terrible things about jail life. But I
 
 had faith in God’s protection. Our experience was that those who went to jail in a prayerful spirit came out victorious, those who had gone in their own strength failed. There is no room for self-pitying in it either, when you say God is giving you the strength. Self-pity comes when you do a thing for which you expect recognition from others. But here there is no question of recognition.
 Another friend thus placed his dilemma: “I am a firm believer in non-violence. Eight years ago, I read your Experiments with Truth and . . . translated the book into Chinese. And then came the Japanese invasion. My faith in non-violence was put to a severe test.       On the one hand, I felt I could not preach non-violence to my people
 who . . . believed that resistance with force was the only way out.       But on the other
 hand, when I try to take a sympathetic attitude and try to do something helpful in such a situation, I find I am giving moral and material support directly and indirectly to something which is against the highest that I know. ”
 G. Yours is a difficult situation.  Such  difficulties  have confronted me more than once. I took part on the British side in the Boer War by forming an ambulance corps. I did likewise at the time of what has been described as the Zulu revolt. The third time was during the great war. I believed in non-violence then. My motive was wholly non-violent. That seemingly inconsistent conduct gave me strength. My example cannot be used as a precedent for others to follow. Looking back upon my conduct on those three occasions, I have no sense of remorse. I know this too  that  my non-violent strength did not suffer diminution because of those experiences. The actual work I was called upon to do was purely humanitarian,  especially during the Zulu revolt. I and my companions  were privileged to nurse the wounded Zulus back to life. It is reasonable to suggest that but for our services some of them would have died. I cite this experience not to justify my participation however indirect it was. I cite it to show that I came through that experience with greater non-violence and with richer love for the great Zulu race. And I had an insight into what war by white men against coloured races meant.
 The lesson to be learnt from it by you is that, placed as you are in a position of hopeless minority, you may not ask your people to lay down their arms unless their hearts are changed and by laying down their arms they feel the more courageous and brave. But whilst you may not try to wean people from war, you will in your person live non-violence in all its completeness and refuse all participation in war. You will develop love for the Japanese in your hearts. You will exa- mine yourself whether you can really love them, whether you have not
 some ill will towards them for all the harm they are doing. It is not enough to love them by remembering their virtues. You must be able to love them in spite of all their misdeeds. If you have that love for the Japanese in your hearts, you will proceed to exhibit in your conduct that higher form of courage which is the hall mark of true non-violence and which your Chinese friends will not fail to detect and recognize as such. You will not wish success to Japanese arms because you ‘love’ the Japanese. At the same time you will not pray for the success of Chinese arms. It is very difficult to judge, when both sides are employing weapons of violence, which side ‘deserves’ to succeed. You will therefore pray only that the right should prevail. Whilst you will keep yourself aloof from all violence you will not shirk danger. You will serve friend and foe alike with a reckless disre- gard for your life. You will rush forth if there is an outbreak of an epidemic or a fire to be combated and distinguish yourself by your surpassing courage and non-violent heroism. But you will refuse to call the curses of heaven upon the Japanese. If by chance some Japanese soldiers or airmen fall into the hands of the Chinese and are in danger of being lynched by an infuriated Chinese  mob  or otherwise ill-treated, you will plead for them with your own people and if necessary even protect them with your life. You know the story of Emily Hobhouse. Though an Englishwoman, she courageously went to the Boer concentration camps. She exhorted the Boers never to lose heart, and it is said that if she had not steeled the hearts of the Boer women as she did, the war might have taken a different turn. She was full of wrath against her own people for whom she had not a good word to say. You would not copy her unmeasured wrath which somewhat vitiated her non-violence, but you will copy her love for the ‘enemy’ that made her denounce the misdeeds of her own country- men. Your example will affect the Chinese and might even shame some Japanese who will become bearers of your message among the Japanese.
 A very slow process, you will perhaps say. Yes, possibly, under the existing adverse circumstances to begin with. But it will gather momentum and speed in an incalculable manner as you proceed. I am an irrepressible optimist. My optimism rests on my belief  in  the infinite possibilities of the individual to develop non-violence. The more you develop it in your own being, the more infectious  it  becomes till it overwhelms your surroundings and by and by might over-sweep the world.
 Q. I, a believer in non-violence, often find that I am actuated by mixed motives. So does a war general have mixed motives. Is it not possible to fight with love for the enemy in one’s heart ? May we not shoot out of love ?
 A. We do often have mixed motives. But that would not be non-violence. There can be degrees in violence, not in non-violence. The constant effort of the votary of non-violence is to purge himself of hatred towards the so-called enemy. There is no such thing as shooting out of love in the way you suggest.
 The last to place before Gandhiji his problem was Mr. P. C. Hsu.
 P. C. HSU: I can say honestly, I have no feeling of hatred towards the Japanese people but I feel their military system is an evil.       I had hoped that at Tambaram, at
 any rate, an international link between the two countries on the basis of mutual goodwill and peace would be forged. But I was disillusioned.	Our difficulty is  this:
 While sincerely believing in non-violence, we have not found a way of making it effective.
 G. Should that present a difficulty? A person who realizes a particular evil of his time and finds it overwhelms him, dives deep in his own heart for inspiration, and when he gets it, he presents it to others. Meetings and group organizations are all right. They are of some help, but very little. They are like the scaffolding that an archi- tect erects—a temporary and makeshift expedient. The thing  that really matters is an invincible faith that cannot be quenched.
 Faith can be developed. Only, the way it can be developed and in which it works differs from that in the case of violence. You cannot develop violence through prayer. Faith, on the other hand, cannot be developed except through prayer.
 Non-violence succeeds only when we have a living faith in God. Buddha, Jesus, Mahomed—they were all warriors of peace in their own style. We have to enrich the heritage left by these world teachers. God has His own wonderful way of executing His plans and choosing His instruments. The Prophet and Abu Bakr trapped in a cave were saved from their persecutors by a spider which had woven its web across the mouth of that cave. All the world teachers, you should know began with a zero!!
 Q. Whilst we have isolated individuals who have the mind of Jesus, because they are not united, not organized, theirs remains a mere cry in the wilderness. The question that arises in my mind is: Can love be organized, and if so, how ?
 A. Organization in the orthodox sense may not be possible. But there is no bar to united non-violent action. I am trying to show by a series of experiments that it is possible. It has its own technique.
 Q. If China wins  the  war,  will  she  be  worse  off  or  better  off  for  her victory ?
 A. If China wins and copies Japanese methods, she will beat Japan hollow at her own game. But the victory of China will not mean a new hope for the world. For China will then be a multiple edition of Japan. But whether Chine wins or goes down, your line of action is clear. If Chine is defeated on the battlefield, your non-violence will remain undaunted and will have done its work. If China wins, you will go to the gallows in the attempt to wean China from copying Japan’s methods.

 [January 1, 1939]libtech_462_footnote
 TEMA: How can my people make their Congress as successful as the Indian National Congress?
 GANDHIJI: The Congress became successful for the simple reason that it was inaugurated by the most selfless and cultured people that could be found in that age. They made themselves the representatives of the people and captured their imagination by reason of service and self-sacrifice. They were from the people and of the people. You have not, as far as I am aware, a band of Africans who would be content to work and live in impecuniosity. Among those who are educated there is not that absolute selflessness. Again, while most of your leaders are Christians, the vast mass of the Bantus and Zulus are not Christians. You have adopted European dress and manners, and have as a result become strangers in the midst of your own people. Politically, that is a disadvantage. It makes it difficult for you to reach the heart of the masses. You must not be afraid of being ‘Bantuized’ or feel ashamed of carrying an assagai or of going about with only a tiny clout round your loins. A Zulu or a Bantu is a well-built man and need not be ashamed of showing his body. He need not dress like you. You must become Africans once more.
 
 D. R. Mission, Johannesburg, was a Negro and a member of the African Congress. He was one of the delegates to the Tambaram Conference who had come to see Gandhiji after the Conference was over.
 T. Of late there has been some talk of forming an  Indo-African  united  non-white Front in South Africa. What do you think about it?
 G. It will be a mistake. You will be pooling together not strength but weakness. You will best help one another by each standing on his own legs. The two cases, are different. The Indians are a microscopic minority. They can never be a ‘menace’ to the white population. You, on the other hand, are the sons of the soil who are being robbed of your inheritance. You are bound to resist that. Yours is a far bigger issue. It ought not to be mixed up with that of the Indian. This does not preclude the establishment of the friendliest relations between the two races. The Indians can co-operate with you in a number of ways. They can help you by always acting on the square towards you. They may not put themselves in opposition to your legitimate aspirations, or run you down as ‘savages’ while exalting themselves as ‘cultured’ people in order to secure concessions for themselves at your expense.
 T. What sort of relations would you favour between these two races?
 G. The closest possible. But while I have abolished all distinction between an African and an Indian, that does not mean that I do not recognize the difference between them. The different races  of mankind are like different branches of a tree—once we recognize the common parent stock from which we are sprung, we realize the basic unity of the human family, and there is no room left for enmities and unhealthy competition.
 T. Should we  adopt  violence  or  non-violence  as  a  means  for  our deliverance ?
 G. Certainly, non-violence under all circumstances. But  you  must have a living faith in it. Even when there is impenetrable dark- ness surrounding you, you must not abandon hope. A person who believes in non-violence believes in a living God. He cannot accept defeat. Therefore, my advice is non-violence all the time, but non- violence of the brave, not of the coward.
 T. Your example has shed so much influence upon us that we are thinking whether it would not be possible for one or two of our young men, who we are hoping will become leaders, to come to you for training.
G. It is quite a good and sound idea.
 T. Do you think Christianity can bring salvation to Africa?
 G. Christianity, as it is known and practised today, cannot bring salvation to your people. It is my conviction that those who today call themselves Christians do not know the true message of Jesus. I wit-
 nessed some of the horrors that were perpetrated on the Zulus during the Zulu Rebellion. Because one man, Bambatta, their chief, had re- fused to pay his tax, the whole race was made to suffer. I was in charge of an ambulance corps. I shall never forget the lacerated backs of Zulus who had received stripes and were brought to us for nursing because no white nurse was prepared to look after them. And yet those who perpetrated all those cruelties called themselves Christians. They were ‘educated’, better dressed than the Zulus, but not their moral superiors.
 T. Whenever a leader comes up in our midst, he flops down after a while. He either becomes ambitious after money or succumbs to the drink habit or some other vice and is lost to us. How shall we remedy this?
 G. The problem is not peculiar to you. Your leadership has proved ineffectual because it was not sprung from the common people. If you belong to the common people, live like them and think like them, they will make common cause with you. If I were in your place, I would not ask a single African to alter his costume and make himself peculiar. It does not add a single inch to his moral stature.

508,"January 2, 1939",RAJKOT,"
        
 Hitherto I have said hardly anything about the Rajkot struggle which has just endedlibtech_463_footnoteas brilliantly as it began. My silence was not due to lack of interest. That was impossible owing to my intimate connections with the place. Apart from my father having been the Dewan of the State, the late Thakore Saheb looked up to me as to a father. My silence was due to the fact that Sardar Vallabhbhai was the soul of the movement. To praise him or his work would be like self-praise.
 The struggle showed what non-violent non-co-operation could do, if there was adequate response from the people. I was wholly un- prepared for the unity, grit and capacity for sacrifice that the people showed. They showed that they were greater than their ruler, and that
 
 even an English Dewan was powerless before a people united in non-violent action.
 The Thakore Saheb deserves congratulations for taking the reins in his own hands and overruling the English Dewan’s advice and the known wishes of the Resident.
 From documents in my possession I know that  Sir  Patrick Cadell, supported by the Resident, cut a sorry figure as servant of the Thakore Saheb. He acted as if he was the master. He traded upon the fact that he belonged to the ruling race and his appointment was subject to the sanction of the central authority, and thought that he could do what he liked. At the time of writing I do not know whether he has wisely retired or what has happened. The correspondence in my possession shows that the ruling chiefs have seriously asked them- selves whether it is wisdom to have Europeans as their Dewans. The central authority has to keep watch over Residents if its declarations are to be carried out as well in the letter as in the spirit.
 It is to be hoped that the ruling chiefs who stand in awe of Residents will know from the Rajkot example that if they are straight and if they have their people really at their back, they have nothing to fear from the Residents. Indeed they should realize that the Para- mount Power resides not in Simla, not in Whitehall, but in their people. An awakened people who rely upon non-violent strength are independent in the face of any conceivable combination of armed powers. What Rajkot could do in three months every State can do if the people show the qualities that the people of Rajkot showed.
 But I do not claim that the people of Rajkot had developed the rare type of non-violence that would stand true in the face of all odds. But Rajkot did show what even ordinary non-violence by a whole people in an organization could do for it.
 But great as was the work done by the people of Rajkot, as civil resisters their real test is yet to come. Their victory, if it is not followed up by a sustained exhibition of the same qualities that secured it, may prove also their undoing. By a long course of training Congressmen all over India have shown their capacity for offering civil resistance, but they have yet to show capacity for constructive non-violence. Civil disobedience may well be adulterated with much incivility, i. e., vio- lence, and yet pass current. But construction is very difficult. In it detection of violence is easy. And existence of violence may even turn victory into a trap and prove it to have been a delusion. Will the
 
 people exhibit the requisite selflessness and self-denial? Will  they resist the temptation to serve themselves and their dependants? Any scramble for power will rob the people at large of what they should really get if there was wise and resolute leadership that would command ready and willing obedience. Kathiawar is noted for its intrigues. It contains a race of politicals whose one aim in life is self-advancement, if it is also known to contain stuff of which heroes are made. If the politicals gain the upper hand, there will be  no  Ramraj in Rajkot. Ramraj means renunciation all along the line. It means discipline imposed by the people on themselves. If constructive non-violence is displayed by the people, it is possible for Rajkot to radiate an influence that can easily make Rajkot an example to follow.
 Let the victory, therefore, be a time for humility, heart-search and prayer instead of self-satisfaction and vain rejoicings. I  shall  watch, wait and pray.

509,"January 2, 1939",IS NON-VIOLENCE INEFFECTIVE?,"
        
 In dealing with my answerlibtech_464_footnoteto the criticism that the Jews had been non-violent for 2,000 years, The Statesman says in the course of an editorial:
 The whole world has heard of Pastor Niemoellerlibtech_465_footnoteand the sufferings of the Lutheran Church; here many Pastors and individual Christians bore themselves bravely before People’s Courts, violence and threats; without retaliation they bore noble witness to the truth. And what change of heart is there in Germany? Buried in prisons and concentration camps are today, and have been for five years, members of the Bible Searchers’ Leagues who rejected Nazi militarism as conflicting with Christ’s Gospel of peace. And how many Germans know of them or, if they know, do anything about it?
 Non-violence, whether of the weak or of the strong, seems, except in very special conditions, rather a personal than a social gospel. A man’s salvation may be left to himself; politicians are concerned with causes, creeds and minorities. It is suggested by Mr. Gandhi that Herr Hitler would bow before a courage “infinitely superior to that shown by his own Storm
 
 Troopers”. If that were so, one would have supposed that he would have paid tribute to such men as Herr von Ossietzkylibtech_466_footnote. Courage to a Nazi, however, seems a virtue only when displayed by his own supporters: elsewhere it becomes the impudent provocation of Jewish-Marxist canaille. Mr. Gandhi has produced his prescription in view of the inability of the Great Powers effectively to move in the matter, an inability we all deplore and would see remedied. His sympathy may do much for the comfort of the Jews, but seems likely to do less for their enlargement. Christ is the supreme example of non-violence and the indignities heaped upon Him at His tortured death proved once and for all that in a worldly and temporal sense it can fail hopelessly.
 I do not think that the sufferings of Pastor Niemoeller  and  others have been in vain. They have preserved their self-respect intact. They have proved that their faith was equal to any suffering. That they have not proved sufficient for melting Herr Hitler’s heart merely shows that it is made of a harder material than stone. But the hardest metal yields to sufficient heat. Even so must the hardest heart melt before sufficiency of the heat of non-violence. And there is no limit to the capacity of non-violence to generate heat.
 Every action is a resultant of a multitude of forces even of a contrary nature. There is no waste of energy. So we learn in the books on mechanics. This is equally true of human actions. The difference is that in the one case we generally know the forces at work, and when we do, we can mathematically foretell the resultant. In the case of human actions, they result from a concurrence of forces of most of which we have no knowledge. But our ignorance must not be made to serve the cause of disbelief in the power of these forces. Rather is our ignorance a cause for greater faith. And non-violence being the mightiest force in the world and also the most elusive in its working, it demands the greatest exercise of faith. Even as we believe in God in faith, so have we to believe in non-violence in faith.
 Herr Hitler is but one man enjoying no more than the average span of life. He would be a spent force if he had not the backing of his people. I do not despair of his responding to human suffering even though caused by him. But I must refuse to believe that the Germans as a nation have no heart or markedly less than the other nations of the earth. They will some day or other rebel against their
 
 
 own adored hero, if he does not wake up betimes. And when he or they do, we shall find that the sufferings of the Pastor and his fellow-workers had not a little to do with the awakening.
 An armed conflict may bring disaster to German arms; it cannot change the German heart even as the last defeat did not. It produced a Hitler vowed to wreak vengeance on the victors. And what a ven- geance it is! My answer, therefore, must be the answer that Step- henson gave to his fellow-workers who had despaired of ever filling the deep pit that made the first railway possible. He asked his co-workers of little faith to have more faith and go on filling the pit. It was not bottomless, it must be filled. Even so I do not despair because Herr Hitler’s or the German heart has not yet melted. On the contrary  I plead for more suffering and still more till the melting has become visible to the naked eye. And even as the Pastor has covered himself with glory, a single Jew bravely standing up and refusing to bow to Hitler’s decrees will cover himself with glory and lead the way to the deliverance of the fellow Jews.
 I hold that non-violence is not merely a personal virtue. It is also a social virtue to be cultivated like the other virtues. Surely society is largely regulated by the expression of non-violence in its mutual dealings. What I ask for is an extension of it on a larger, national and international scale.
 I was unprepared to find the view expressed by The Statesman writer that the example of Christ proved once and for all that in a worldly and temporal sense it can fail hopelessly!! Though I cannot claim to be Christian in the sectarian sense, the example of Jesus’ suffering is a factor in the composition of my undying faith in non-violence which rules all my actions, worldly and temporal. And I know that there are hundreds of Christians who believe likewise. Jesus lived and died in vain if he did not teach us to regulate the whole of life by the eternal Law of Love.

 BARDOLI,
 January 7, 1939
 Rumours have been going the round as to what I am going to do about the ban on my entry into Jaipur State—my birth-place and ancestral home. The ban is as much a surprise to me as to my friends. My whole life has been passed in the interests of peace in all walks of life. Whatever else non-violence may be with Congressmen it is my creed and I try as much as it is in my power to live up to it. I am no enemy of States. I have always maintained a friendly attitude towards them. I have always believed the States to be capable of responding to the new awakening that has taken place in India. I am now carrying on correspondence with a view to find out the secret lying behind the ban. The wording of the order in no sense applies to me. I do not wish to act in haste. I have no desire to embarrass the Jaipur State  authorities. But if every honourable effort to have the ban removed fails the public may depend upon my doing my duty.
 My present and immediate object is to afford through the Mandallibtech_474_footnotelibtech_475_footnotelibtech_476_footnoterelief to the famine-stricken in Jaipur State. I hope that the ban will not be allowed to disturb the would-be donors. I am making arrangements for all eventualities. Indeed my main reason for going to Jaipur was to devise measures for famine relief.
 My second immediate concern is to try to secure the release of the nine prisoners during the recent crisis in Sikar. One of them is convicted and eight are still awaiting trial. I had good grounds for hoping that they would come in for general amnesty. I can only assure them that I shall leave no stone unturned to secure their release while I am still free.

FOR JAMNALAL BAJAJlibtech_477_footnote","
        
 CAMP BARDOLI,
 January 7, 1939
 TO
 THE PRESIDENT
 COUNCIL OF STATE, JAIPUR SIR,
The attached order dated 16th December last was served on me
 on the 28th of the same month at Sawai Madhopur whilst I was on my way to Jaipur.
 The order came as a painful surprise to me. At the station I had over an hour’s chat with Mr.F.S.Young,I.G.P.,who was persuading me not to commit a breach of the order. I did not need much persuasion as in a discussion with Gandhiji, of the possibility of such an order being served on me, he had advised me not to break the order immediately but to consider the whole situation in consultation with him before taking any final step.
 Accordingly I suspended my journey and proceeded to Delhi. After having conferred with friends and fellow-workers and finally Gandhiji, I have come to the conclusion that on the 1st of February next I should commit a breach of the order unless, before then, it is unconditionally revoked.
 The authorities know that a public appeal was issued by me on 1st November last on behalf of the Jaipur Rajya Praja Mandal, of which I am President, that as famine had overtaken Shekhawati and other areas, relief work was to be undertaken by the Mandal to the ex- clusion of all other activity. They were also aware that on a news- paper report having appeared to the effect that civil disobedience was to be started in Jaipur I had issued a flat contradiction.
 I do not know what had happened on or before the 16th December to warrant the passing of the order in anticipation of my seeking to enter Jaipur State. I note that on the same date a notifi- cation was published in the State Gazette to the effect that “an emer- gency has arisen which makes it necessary to provide against insti-
 
 gation to illegal refusal to the payment of certain liabilities”. Seeing that the order against my entry was passed the same day, it is reason- able to assume that in the opinion of the authorities I would be conn- ected with the feared movement of illegal refusal of taxes. Surely if the authorities had any fear of my leading such a movement, they might have at least ascertained from me as to the truth or otherwise of the information in their possession. They knew me sufficiently to feel sure that I would not conceal the truth from them.
 Indeed the authorities know I rendered help to them also during the recent crisis in Sikar consistently with my obligations  to  the people. They know that my offices were used entirely on behalf of peace.
 My surprise may therefore be better imagined than I  can describe it when I learnt from the order that “your (my) presence and activities are likely to lead to a breach of the peace”, and that, therefore, “it is considered necessary in the public interest and for the maintenance of public tranquillity to prohibit your (my) entry within the Jaipur State.” I have no hesitation in saying that the notice belies the whole of my public career.
 I observe that I have been described as of Wardha. I hope this is a slip. For the Jaipur State, surely I am of Jaipur. I do not cease to be of Jaipur because I have interests in Wardha and elsewhere.
 It has become a serious question for my co-workers and me to consider our position in the State.
 The Praja Mandal was started in July of 1931 and reorganized in November 1936. It has a constitution. It has many distinguished men of Jaipur State as its members. It has hitherto carried on its acti- vities within the four corners of the Jaipur law and submitted even to irksome and illiberal restrictions regarding meetings and processions.
 But the order served on me has opened the eyes of the Mandal. It has come to the conclusion that it must resort to civil disobedience if civil liberty is not guaranteed and meetings and processions and forming of associations are not allowed without let or hindrance so long as they observe strict non-violence.
 I should define the scope of our activity. There is no mistake as to our goal. We want responsible government under the aegis of the Maharaja. We must therefore tell the people what it is and what they should do to deserve it. But we do not propose to offer civil disobe- dience for it. We must, however, seek the redress of the grievances of
 all classes of the people; we must carry on constructive and educative activities. The Mandal has no desire whatsoever to preach non-pay- ment of taxes at this stage. If we secure the co-ope-ration of the State in our essentially peaceful and life-building activi-ties and in  the redress of admitted grievances there never need be any resort to non-payment of taxes. But should it unfortunately become  a necessity, the Mandal will give the State authorities ample notice of its intention to do so. For the Mandal stands for open, honourable and strictly non-violent methods. Therefore, what I am pleading for is full liberty to the Mandal to carry on its perfectly legitimate and non-vio- lent activities without let or hindrance. If, however, this reasonable request is not granted before the 31st day of this month, I shall reluctantly be compelled to attempt to enter the State in spite of the order, and the Mandal will hold itself free to take such steps as it may deem necessary for self-expression consistent with human dignity.
 I hold that to do less will be to commit civil suicide. I trust that the Council of State will not put an unbearable strain upon my loyalty and that of the members of the Mandal."

 The Secretary of the Tamil Nad Spinners’ Association has sent us a complaint which he has received from the Kerala Branch of the Spinners’ Association. The complaint gives conclusive proof that some merchants of Tiruppur are dumping cloth under description ‘shuddha khadi’ and even making use of the name of the Spinners’ Association. Two labels have been sent by the Secretary which were affixed to the cloth thus sold, and the labels show the names of ‘S. Mariasusai Chettiar, Khaddar Store, Tiruppur’ and ‘M. K. Chidamba- ram Chettiar and Brother A. Palaniappa Mudaliar, Khaddar Store, Ti- ruppur’, and the description is ‘shuddha khadi, certified by A.I.S. A’.
 S. Mariasusai Chettiar has never been certified by the A. I. S. A. for dealing in khadi, and A. Palaniappa Mudaliar was decertified some four years ago. Such deception can certainly be punished under the ordinary Indian Penal Code. It would, however, be much better for the merchants as well as for the public if the public demand for khadi were not thus exploited, and if merchants who have not been certified abstain from such business, or at least abstain from fraudulently using the name of the Spinners’ Association.

 Sardar Prithvi Singh writes to me to say that he is keeping well and that his requirements are being supplied by the authorities and friends as the case may be. I am in constant correspondence with him. He tells me that many friends are desirous of meeting him. He wishes me to thank them all but also to tell them that they need not take the trouble to go all the way to Rawalpindi to meet him. And when they do wish to do so, they should not feel disappointed if they are not
 
 immediately given a date. The visiting days generally remain full. He would like all friends desiring to visit him to correspond with me so that I might guide them. Whilst I convey this wish to the would be visitors, and whilst Pyarelal, or Mahadev as soon as he is permitted to take up full work, will gladly make arrangements, this will be possible only in a few cases. For nothing will be possible without corres- pondence with the authorities. This means taxing work to which those who are helping me are hardly equal in the present state of my health.

 "
526,"January 9, 1939",TRAVANCORE,"
        
A Travancore Christian friend writes:
 There is a great misunderstanding about you among the  Christian circles of Travancore that you are absolutely against the interests  of Christians, and this has originated since you have begun to insist on the withdrawal of the memorial to the Maharaja. The trend of public opinion as has been expressed to me by many friends is something like this:
 By the influence of the Travancore Maharani and Sir C. P. Ramaswami Iyer you are wrongly made to understand that the present movement in Travancore is only a rising of the Christians for absolute supremacy over the Hindus of Travancore. It is with this impression in the background of your mind that you are today working against the Travancore movement. Besides, due to the famous temple-entry proclamation, Sir C. P. Ramaswami Iyer has done agreat service to the Hindu community as a whole, and therefore you want  to save him from any blemish and personal charges, whatever be his shortcomings. It is with this end in view that you are so strongly pressing the State Congress to withdraw the memorial. Otherwise there is no reason why you should adopt one policy for Rajkot and another for Travancore. For in the case of Rajkot Vallabhbhai Patel and many others have made so  many  personal charges against the Dewan, and recently Vallabhbhai even threatened to start another fight for the removal of the present Dewan. You simply approve of all this. While in the case of Travancore, even though it is absolutely impossible for you to understand the situation on the spot being so far off, you simply dictate terms on the memorial question and keep mum over all the unjust actions of the Government. Even after the memorial has been withdrawn the leaders are kept in prison and arrests are being continued in large numbers, and peopleare terrorized all over the State even though the movement is almost dead. All this you view in silence without uttering a word. This is a further evidence of your partiality in siding with the Travancore
 Government.
 Similar communications, more strongly worded, have also been received by me. It might clear the atmosphere a little if I answer the charges. My conscience is quite clear. I claim that in no other State movements have I taken so much interest as in the Travancore movement, for the simple reason that I was pressed to do so by Shri G. Ramachandran who belongs to the Sabarmati Ashram and in whose wisdom, courage, sincerity and non-violence I have very great faith. He threw himself into the struggle after receiving my consent. He had told me that there were all sections interested in the struggle. It was at his instance that I requested Shrimati Rajkumari Amrit Kaur to go to Travancore and do what was possible by way of negotiation.
 I have been against the mixing up of the  struggle for responsible government with the charges against the Dewan. But I have been equally insistent that the leaders need not withdraw them unless they realized the soundness of my advice, for they had to bear the brunt of public opposition, if there was any. They could not do so, unless they could speak with conviction. I told them too that they would be justified in prosecuting the charges, if they made the  dismissal the only issue, as they well might. But if they insisted on responsible government, there was no meaning in proceeding with the charges. It would divide the country’s attention, and in the event of prosecution their time and resources would be employed in proving the charges. Whereas, if they got responsible government, which they were bound to if they were united and strong in their faith in non-vio- lence and truth, they would have control over all the Dewans, present and future. The charges have been withdrawn, therefore, only because the leaders, as I see from the acting President’s statement just received by me, were fully convinced of the advisability of with-drawing the charges.
 The comparison with Rajkot is ignorant. I never guided the movement there. There was no occasion for my guidance. The Sardar was in no need of it. If he needed it, it was always at his disposal. There was no question there of dismissal of the Dewan. The Sardar resolutely refused to have anything to do with the charges, if the fight was to be for responsible government. Of course all sorts of people who opposed the struggle came under his lash, but that was wholly different from making dismissal of an official a plank in the struggle.
And my guidance in the Travancore struggle has never been
 lacking. But the critics should understand that I am not conducting the struggle. I advise when I am referred to. Nor need or can all my advice and all my work be before the public gaze. Much of my work is behind the curtain. It is not therefore secret. I have nothing to hide. But many things need to be done silently, even secretly (in the right sense of the word), in the interest of the cause.
 Lastly, let my critics understand that I am not interested in the present Dewan retaining his office. If I have been in correspondence with the Dewan, it has been only for the sake of the cause, pleading for justice. And as for the Maharani, I have never been in correspondence with Her Highness throughout the struggle. I claim to be and have always been above partisanship. I know no distinction between Christians and non-Christians in terms of politics. I do in terms of religion, and then, too, I hold the Christian religion and the other religions in the same respect as my own.

527,"January 9, 1939",THE BAN ON JAMNALALJI,"
        
 The ban on Jamnalalji makes curious reading. Here it is:
 TO
 SETH JAMNALAL BAJAJ OF WARDHA (C. P.)
 Whereas it has been made to appear to the Jaipur Government that your
 presence and activities within the Jaipur State are likely to lead to a breach of the peace, it is considered necessary in the public interest and for the maintenance of public tranquillity to prohibit your entry within the Jaipur State.
   orders.  You 	are, therefore, required not to enter Jaipur territory until further    By 	order of the Council of State (Sd.) M. ALTAF A. KHERIE  Secretary, 	Council of State, Jaipur 
  	He is the last person whose presence anywhere can be a danger. He 	has ever been known as a peacemaker. He has enjoyed  the  happiest 	relations with the official world. His worth was so much recognized 	that he was awarded the title of Rai Bahadur in 1916 or thereabouts. 	This he returned during the non-co-operation days. He is 
 one of the best known merchants in the commercial world. He is a banker besides being a commercial magnate. Though an ardent Congressman he has never been known as “an agitator”. He is foremost in constructive work and social reform. True he has the courage of his convictions and has more than once staked his all for these. He is never afraid of prison. Obviously the description given in the order served upon Jamnalalji is false and wholly inapplicable to him. It will be probably urged that the wording is a mere formality, and that without it the order could not be legally served upon him. If that be so, it proves conclusively that persons like Jamnalalji were never meant by the law to be affected by it. It is an abuse, pure and simple, of the law to keep a person like Jamnalalji out of Jaipur or any other part of the country.
 And the humorous part of it all is that Jamnalalji had to be described in the order as “of Wardha”. As a matter of fact he belongs to the Jaipur State, has property there, and has many relations residing there.
 It is to such an order that Jamnalalji has submitted wholly on my advice. There was a rumour that he might be arrested if he attempted to enter Jaipur. He had therefore consulted me as to his duty if an order was served on him. His co-workers of Jaipur had held that he should defy any such order there and then. I held a contrary opinion. And I have no cause to regret my opinion. The order, I reasoned, would be a mad act. Mad people should not be taken at their word. They should be given time to cool down. I understand that great preparations were made in anticipation of the arrest. There must have even been a kind of disappointment when the arresting party discovered that they were not to have their prey.
 Jamnalalji has lost nothing by waiting and reasoning with the authoritieslibtech_482_footnotelibtech_483_footnoteand telling them that they have acted wrongly and hastily. As a responsible man and Jaipur subject, it was perhaps his duty to give them time to reconsider their decision. If they do not, and Jamnalalji decides, as he must, to defy the order, he will do so with added moral strength and prestige. And it is moral  strength  that counts in non-violent action.
 Let it be known that the Maharaja is merely a tool in the hands of his Ministers who are all outsiders and some of them English. They know nothing of the people or the country. They are, as it were, imposed upon them. Jaipur talent is at a discount, though before the
 
 foreigners came, Jaipur was somehow or other able to hold its own as a State. I had reason to remark last week on the sorry figure the English Dewan cut in Rajkot during his very brief term of office. At least the act of the Jaipur Council consisting of outsiders is a sorry exhibition of irresponsibility and ineptitude. The externment of one man, however great, may appear to be insignificant. But events may prove that it was a foolish and costly affair, if not much more. For the reader may not know that there is a Praja Mandal in Jaipur which has been working under Jamnalalji's inspiration for the past six years. Jamnalalji is its present President. The Mandal is a strong organization containing responsible men as its members and has a good record of constructive work to its credit. The Mandal will have to do its duty if the ban is not removed. For the ban is, it is said, a precursor of stopping even the constructive and constitutional activities of the Mandal. The authorities cannot brook the growing influence of a body which aims at responsible government in Jaipur under the aegis of the Maharaja, no matter by means howsoever honourable. It seems to be the precursor also of a ruthless policy of stopping all activities of bodies having political ambition in any shape or form. And rumour has it that it is a concerted policy on the part of the Rajputana States. Whether it is true only of Jaipur or all the other States, it is sufficiently ominous, and Jamnalalji and the people of Jaipur  are  in  honour bound to resist it with all the strength at their command, no doubt consistently with the Congress creed of non-violence and truth.

The letter has been sent by registered mail.libtech_488_footnote  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	a photostat of the Gujarati: G.N. 2999             	There are several startling things in the Aundh constitution. For 	the moment I am concerned with only two things—the qualifications 	for the vote and the courts of justice.  	I have myself hitherto sworn by simple adult franchise as well for 	the illiterate as the literate. My observation of the working of the 	Congress constitution has altered my opinion. I have come round to 	the view that a literacy test is necessary for two reasons. The vote 	should be regarded as a privilege and therefore carry some qualifi- 	cation. The simplest qualification is a literacy test. And if the 	ministry appointed under the literacy franchise is sincere and 	solicitous about the disqualified illiterates, the much desired 	literacy would come in no time. The Aundh constitution has made 	primary education free and compulsory. I have been assured by 	Appasaheb that he will see that illiteracy is driven out from Aundh 	State inside of six months. I hope, therefore, that there will be no 	opposition in Aundh to the literacy test.  	The second important departure from the ordinary practice is the 	making of justice in the lower court free and incredibly simple. 	What would, however, displease critics is not the freeness or the 	simpli- city as such but the abolition of intermediate courts and 	the fate of litigants and persons charged with offences being made 	to depend on       
 a High Court presided over by one person. In a population of 75,000 a multiplicity of judges would be both unnecessary and impossible. And if the right type of person is chosen as the Chief Judge, he is as likely to deal out unadulterated justice as a bench of highly paid judges. This simplification contemplates abolition of the cumbrous procedure and the use of tomes of law books including hundreds of law reports used in British law-courts.

  January 	11, 1939  	It has always been my firm view (and it still holds complete sway 	over me) that in every province, except for one or two selected 	leaders, all the others should observe silence. When this is not 	possible, they    
 should read out at meetings carefully considered, short, simple written speeches. Everybody should remember that the people are getting increasing power in their hands now. In such circumstances no thoughtless word should escape the lips of the people’s leaders.

The most powerful aid to brahmacharya is purification of the 	heart. In this external measures are to a certain extent helpful.  	Prayer can go on even unconsciously, which means that when a person 	is engrossed in prayer he is not conscious of praying. It is like    
 a man in deep slumber not being aware that he is asleep. Ramanama in its scope includes Krishnanama also. Even the plying of charkha can be regarded as Ramanama. Only so much for today."

Your 	reputation has preceded you, Dr. Kagawa.  With 	these words Gandhiji stood up 	to greet  Dr. Kagawa.	The preliminary  questions 	were about the drought in South India and famines and the 	co-operative movement. Was the movement flourishing in India? GANDHIJI: 	I can’t say that it is flourishing. It is going on     
 somehow. It was initiated by the British Government. It did not come from within, but was superimposed upon the people. It is managed after a certain stereotyped pattern and has therefore no room for growth according to the exigencies of time. Whereas I know you have a big co-operative movement.
 KAGAWA: Yes, it is growing every day. There are 3,50,000 producers’ co-operatives organized by themselves. There are national health insurance co-operatives, harvest insurance co-operatives and storage co-operatives.
G. What is the feeling of people in Japan about the war?
 K. I am rather a heretic in Japan. Rather than I express my views, I would like to learn from you what you would do if you were in my position.
G. It would be presumptuous for me to express my views.
 K. No, I would like very much to know what you would do.
 G. I would declare my heresies and be shot. I would put the co-operatives and all your work in one scale, and put the honour of your nation in the other, and if you found that the honour was being sold, I should ask you to declare your views against Japan and in so doing make Japan live through your death. But, for this, inner conviction is necessary. I do not know that I should be able to do all that I have said if I were in your position, but I must give you my opinion since you have asked for it.
 K. The conviction is there. But friends have been asking me to desist.
 G. Well, don’t listen to friends when the Friend inside you says, ‘Do this.’ And friends, however good, can sometimes well deceive us. They cannot argue otherwise. They would ask you to live and do your work. The same appeal was made to me when I took the decision to go to jail. But I did not listen to friends with the result that I found the glow of freedom when I was confined within the four solid walls of prison. I was inside a dark cell, but I felt that I could see everything from within those walls, and nothing from outside.
 K. Have you some irrigation co-operatives in India?
 G. I do not think so. Of course you have all these things. You have done marvellous things, and we have many things to learn from you. But how can we understand this swallowing alive of China, drugging her with poison and so many other horrid things that I read about in a book called What War Means which Pandit Jawaharlal has given me. How could you have committed all these atrocities? And then your great poet calls it a war of humanity and a blessing to China!
 Dr. Kagawa is a student of religions. He wanted to know how Gandhiji’s
 
 ahimsa teaching could be reconciled with the Bhagavad Gita. Gandhiji said it could not be discussed in a brief interview, but he would ask him to read his introduction to the Gita where he had answered the question. The answer had just come to him as part of his experience, and the interpretation was, as he thought, not laboured in any way.
 K. I am told you recite the Bhagavad Gita daily?
G. Yes, we finish the entire Gita reading once every week.
 K. But at the end of the Gita Krishna recommends violence.
 G. I do not think so. I am also fighting. I should not be fighting effectively if I were fighting violently. The message of the Gita is to be found in the second chapter of the Gita where Krishna speaks of the balanced state of mind, of mental equipoise. In 19 verses at the close of the 2nd chapter of the Gita Krishna explains how this state can be achieved. It can be achieved, he tells us, after killing all your passions. It is not possible to kill your brother after having killed all your passions. I should like to see that man dealing death—who has no passions, who is indifferent to pleasure and pain, who is undis- turbed by the storms that trouble mortal man. The whole thing is des- cribed in language of beauty that is unsurpassed. These verses show that the fight Krishna speaks of is a spiritual fight.
 K. But there was actual fighting then, and your interpretation is your own peculiar interpretation.
G. It may be mine, but as mine it has no value.
 K. To the common mind it sounds as though it was actual fighting.
 G. You must read the whole thing dispassionately in its true con- text. After the first mention of fighting, there is no mention of fight- ing at all. The rest is a spiritual discourse.
 K. Has anybody interpreted it like you?
 G. Yes. The fight is there, but the fight as it is going on within. The Pandavas and Kauravas are the forces of good and evil within. The war is the war between Jekyll and Hyde, God and Satan, going on in the human breast. The internal evidence in support of this inter- pretation is there in the work itself and in the Mahabharata of which the Gita is a minute part. It is not a history of war between two fami- lies, but the history of man— the history of the spiritual struggle of man. I have sound reasons for my interpretation.
 K. That is why I say it is your interpretation.
 G. But that is nothing. The question is whether it is a reasonable interpretation, whether it carries conviction. If it does, it does not matter whether it is mine or XYZ’s. If it does not, it has no value even
 if it is mine.
 K. To my mind Arjuna’s ideas are wonderful. Krishna has found some excuse for him, and it was natural and necessary before Christianity.
 G. This interpretation is even historically wrong. For Buddha existed long before the Christian era, and he preached the doctrine of non-violence.
 K. But Arjuna’s views seem to me to be superior to Krishna’s.
 G. Then according to you the disciple was greater than  the  master !
 K. But I agree with what you say, with your teaching of non-violence. I shall read the Gita again, bearing your interpretation in mind. . . .
 Dr. Kagawa again turned to his great theme—agriculture and cooperation which he has studied carefully. “You get famine once in every ten years,” he said.
G. We get it every year, famine is our constant friend.
 K. Then you should have more tree culture, more trees for fuel and for cattle fodder. Rice and barley are not enough, you need more protein trees. . . .
G. No. We need a change in the method of government!
 It was a great pity that Dr. Kagawa had to go away to Bombay the same evening.	Even for a detailed discussion of his co-operative programme he might
 have stayed longer with the leading men in India. But Gandhiji appealed to him on a different ground.
How can you leave India without seeing Santiniketan?
 K. But I have read the Poet’s poems, and I love them.
G. But you have to love the Poet.
 K. If I can repeat the Gitanjali every day, I can see the Poet every day and do I not love him? Maybe he is greater than his poems.
 G. Sometimes the reverse is the truth, but in the case of the Poet he is infinitely greater than his great poems. Now, another question. Have you included Pondicherry in your programme ? If you want to study modern India, you must see both Santiniketan and Aurobindo Ghose’s Ashram. I wonder who your tour advisers are. I wish you had appointed me your adviser in this matter!
 K. No. You are a good guide for life.
 Dr. Kagawa asked what other books Gandhiji read every day. Gandhiji mentioned the Ramayana in which he said there was supposed to be enough blood and thunder, “but not for me”. Dr. Kagawa said he too loved it for the story of Sita—the ideal of chastity.
 G. But there are other fine things also in that unique poem. I have not read the original which is great. But the Hindi rendering
 done by a great devotee is the scripture for the masses of India. In the North India Tulsi Ramayana has been the inspiration of many a home for four centuries.
 Dr. Kagawa discussed Shankaracharya and Ramanuja, and Gandhiji expressed his predilection for the former, and for his direct and marvellously logical way. But Gandhiji reverted again to his itinerary and expressed his great regret that Rev. Hodge who had been in charge of it had, out of his partiality for him (Gandhiji), included Bardoli, but not Santiniketan! [He said:]
 You are going to Calcutta and not Santiniketan! It is a great pity. You say you are going to Gosaba. Well Gosaba is Gosaba, but Santiniketan is India.

 Jaipur authorities will not be happy until they have brought the Jaipur patriots to their senses. For they have now banned the Jaipur Rajya Praja Mandal of which Jamnalalji is the President. Jamnalalji has released  for  publication  his  letterlibtech_495_footnoteto   the   President   of   the   Jaipur Council of State. The readers will find it elsewhere in these columns. That letter should induce withdrawal of the order. But evidently the Jaipur Council, which I erroneously described as entirely composed of outsiders  in  my  last  week’s  articlelibtech_496_footnote,  but  which  I  understand   does contain four members from the State, is intent upon wiping out of existence every activity whether social, humanitarian or other with which Jamnalalji or his co-workers are connected.
 This is the newest method of dealing with people whom the authorities do not like. I can only hope against hope that the Jaipur authorities will shrink from precipitating an all-India crisis. For there are three reasons which might well give the Jaipur question that character. Jamnalalji is himself an institution. He is, moreover, a member of the Working Committee of the Congress and its Treasurer. The method being adopted in Jaipur is too drastic to be suffered without a desperate struggle. If it goes unchallenged, it may mean a death-blow to every activity in the States when it is even remotely connected with the legitimate political aspirations of their people.
The curious thing about Jaipur is that the real ruler is a
 
 high-placed Englishmanlibtech_497_footnotelibtech_498_footnoteand  not  the   Maharaja.  Can  it  be  that  he represents the wishes of the central authority? If he does, what becomes of the recent declarations? If he does not, may an English Dewan initiate policies that may in the end spell disaster to the State itself? I understand that the Jaipur treasure chest is over-full. If the worst happened, it could stand a prolonged boycott by the people, that is, assuming that the modern weapons of destruction do not tame the people into submission. It is time for the Princes and the Central Government to evolve a common policy of action. Or is the Jaipur method the common policy of action, as some tell me it is? I can only hope that it is not.

539,"January 16, 1939","VIOLENCE V.
NON-VIOLENCE","
        
 Everywhere in India there is a duel going on between  the  method of non-violence and that of violence. Violence like water, when it has an outlet, rushes forward furiously with an overwhelming force. Non-violence cannot act madly. It is the essence of discipline. But when it is set going, no amount of violence can crush it. For full play, it requires unsullied purity and an unquenchable faith among the leaders. Therefore, if non-violence seems to fail in the duel, it will do so because the leaders lack the purity or the faith or both. There seems, however, to be reason to believe that non-violence will triumph
 
 over violence. Things seem to be shaping so that the workers will see for themselves the futility of violence.
But a well-known public worker writes:libtech_501_footnote
 “The States’ method of dealing with satyagraha seems to be different from the British method. The methods adopted in some States are too inhuman and brutal. Will non-violence succeed against such brutal methods ?. . .
 I   have   carefully   read   and   re-read   your   viewslibtech_502_footnotelibtech_503_footnoteon  the  murder of the Political Agent of  Orissa  States.  I  was  rather  pained  to  find  that you made no reference to the terrible atrocities committed on the poor State subjects of Orissa. If the mob was wrong in using violence against the
 Political Agent, was the latter justified in firing on the  mob  and  thus provoking them to violence?. . .
 . . . I fail to understand why you as the greatest apostle of truth and non-violence should not have also conveyed a warning to the Political Department of the Government of India, and especially the Eastern States Agency, that they should not adopt brutal methods in dealing with the States subjects’ fights? I feel that the Eastern States Agency has been most brutal in dealing with the States subjects’ fights, and murder of the Political Agent is the climax of the brutal repression carried on by the Eastern States Agency. . .
 . And if we are to show sympathy for the loss of life of the Political Agent, what about the two persons who died on the spot as a result, possibly of the police violence?. . .
 Of course the right of self-defence is there and so is the right of armed rebellion. But after deep deliberation the Congress has abjured both and that for valid reasons. Non-violence is not worth much if it is worsted in the face of the greatest provocation. Its true test consists in its capacity for standing any amount of provocation. If there were eye-witnesses of the rapes and if the witnesses were non-violent, why are they alive? If the rapes became known after the event, of what use is violence ? The non-violent method is still open. The men may be tried or they may be brought up before the bar of public opinion, if there was any. To expose the criminals to mob fury would be bar- barity.
 The argument about the murder of the late Political Agent of the Orissa States is irrelevant to the issue. I was not called upon to
 adjudge the merits of the action of the ruler and the Political Agent on the one hand and the people’s action on the other. It was  enough  for
 
 me at the time to condemn in unqualified terms the murder of the Political Agent not merely as a mark of sympathy, though that was deserved, but as an act of gross indiscipline and breach of the funda- mental Congress policy. The misdeeds of the rulers have been ex- posed often enough in these columns. But they have not been men- tioned for the purpose of drawing the wrath of the people upon the doers, but for the sole purpose of showing the people the way of dealing with them non-violently. Things were shaping themselves well in Orissa. I can quote chapter and verse in support of this assertion. This murder has disturbed the even course of the movement. Ranpur is a howling wilderness. The people, both innocent and guilty, are in hiding. They have deserted their homes in order to escape repression. For it will not be merely the actually guilty persons who will suffer. The technique of frightfulness in some shape or other is no doubt being applied and the whole of India has to be helpless witness of it. The authorities know no other way of dealing with murders of their officials, especially when they are Europeans. The non-violent method has been slowly educating them to know the new way. But I need not prolong the argument. The proof of the pudding is in the eating. Both methods are being tried out in India. The workers have to make their choice. I know that India’s freedom is possible only through non- violence. Those workers in the Congress who think or act otherwise are wronging themselves and the Congress.

Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	a photostat of the Hindi: G.N. 1917            An 	Indian Christian writes:libtech_508_footnote  Your 	article “The Jews” libtech_509_footnotehas evoked 	considerable comment of varying nature. I propose to confine myself 	to the criticism that the love that Jesus taught was a personal, not 	a social or collective, virtue.  To 	deny that Jesus’ way of life was meant for all—collectively no 	less than individually—is surely to deny the basic truth of the 	religion of Christ.     
 He was utterly dissatisfied with the existing order; the hypocrisy and pride of the Scribes and Pharisees riled him sufficiently for him to call them a ‘generation of vipers’ and ‘whited sepulchres’; he openly protested against bribery and corruption when he ‘upset the tables of the money-changers’ and accused them of having made his house ‘a den of thieves’; he denounced the sin of untouchability by dining with outcastes and speaking words of comfort to prostitutes.
 His preaching roused the anger of the people because it was revolutionary and universal; otherwise why should those in authority have cared to arrest and condemn to the extreme penalty of the law a man in whom even the judge who tried him could find no ‘sin’?
 They sensed in his teachings a power which, if exercised by those who believed in them, would surely cause to fall the whole framework of their society. To ‘turn the other cheek’ to him who smites you on one, to love the enemy, to rejoice in suffering, to love your neighbour as yourself, to remove the beam from your own eye before pointing to the mote in another’s, to pray for those who persecute you, to forgive the offender until seventy times seven, to serve the poor, to leave all and follow Jesus, are of the essence of a universal gospel for which he lived and died. That he asked his disciples to let the world see this message by virtue of their own example, that the disciples themselves felt the call to recreate a new order, bears ample evidence in the very formation, through their martyrdom, of the early Church which is termed to be the body of Christ. One of the most beautiful passages in the New Testament, the 13th Chapter of I Corinthians, was written by St. Paul at a time when the Church of Corinth was torn by internal dissensions. The message of love therein was the message for collective action. The ‘Church Militant’, as  it is called, is surely the emblem of Christian society trying to war against the powers of evil by means of love which ‘conquers all things’.
 But while it may be convenient, because of the lack of courage and faith within us, to set aside the central teaching of the religion of Christ as a mere rule for personal conduct, it is a dangerous doctrine which has brought the so-called Christian nations to a sorry pass today.
 No doubt the result of non-violence is not always visible to the naked eye. That the way of love—for what is non-violence except boundless love— is not easy to pursue is only too true. But to rule love out as a social virtue is to deny the existence of not only the religion of Jesus but of all the great religions of the world and to give way to fear which is the ruling passion in the world today.
 Non-violence on a national or international scale has not yet been sufficiently tried; where it has been tried by Gandhiji it has met with success. Is not Europe, by subordinating her mind to the doctrine that ‘Might is Right’, giving a direct lie to the teaching of Jesus ? This is the question before
 Christendom today. Does the greatest measure of freedom consist in being able to resist force with the weapons of force, or may it not be that its highest and eternal form will be born out of the blood willingly shed by one nation or many nations?
 Oh cross that liftest up my head, I may not ask to flee from thee,  I lay in dust, life’s glory dead.
 And from the ground there blossoms red Life that shall endless be.
This letter should convince honest doubters that the love that
 Jesus taught and practised was not a mere personal virtue, but that it was essentially a social and collective virtue. Buddha taught and prac- tised the same thing six hundred years before Jesus.

549,"January 	20, 1939",LETTER TO AKBAR HYDARI,"
               BARDOLI, 
     DEAR 	SIR AKBAR,  January 	20, 1939 
  	I have your wires and your letter of the 5th instant, with  	enclosure which came later. The two documents were redirected from 	Wardha and then I had to see the State Congress friends before I 	could reply. Hence the delay which please forgive.  	At the outset I must thank you for the friendly tone of your letter. 	Nothing else and nothing less was expected of you.  	Nevertheless the letter has not given me satisfaction. The only 	thing relevant to my request was the statement issued by the State 	Congress manifestolibtech_510_footnotecalling off civil disobedience and its language. If it 	left nothing more to be desired, the immediate result should have 	been the discharge of the prisoners who had offered civil disobe- 	dience from within and as members of the State Congress.  	Even Shri Kashinathrao Vaidya’s statement was irrelevant. The 	State Congress manifesto was not before him. Had he known the 	implications of the manifesto, he should not have courted imprison-    
 ment at all. But his case needs to be condoned by the State Congress manifesto. Perusal of Shri Kashinathrao Vaidya’s statement did not confirm the impression created by your letter. His statement I regard as mild and subdued. There is no threat in it. He has endeavoured calmly to argue the position of the State Congress and brought out the facts to the date of his conviction. It is noteworthy  that  he  has  accepted the fact of suspension and exhorted the State Congress members to desist from civil disobedience.
 The Aryan League and the Hindu Mahasabha activities should not be confused with that of the State Congress. There never was any intention of amalgamation on the part of the State Congress.
 Do you want me to find out what Sardar Patel, Shri Deo or Shri Bhulabhai said or did? As a matter of fact I have not even showed your letter to the Sardar though I am living with him at present. Not that I would not share your letter with him, only he has his work cut out for him as I have mine. But I could find out what they said if their opinion was relevant to my purpose or to the argument. If, however, you want me to, I shall gladly do so.
 You were quite right in dismissing from your mind the sugges- tion that I had secretly advised anyone against the attempt to reach a settlement between Hindus and Muslims. Baba it was who brought Shri Narasingh Rao with him. Maulvi Bahadur Yar Jung was also to be of the party. But he could not come. They had come to a standstill. I, therefore, advised them to proceed no further but await Maulana Abul Kalam Azad’s advice and be guided by him. Maulana Saheb is now in correspondence with you.
 Now about “Bande Mataram”. Some students did come to me.  I told them that “Bande Mataram” was no religious prayer but that they had a perfect right to say it in their rooms or their prayer room. I told them too that by proper representation they would get redress and that till they had the redress they should remain without their studies unless they could go elsewhere. I have seen the explanation issued by the Osmania University authorities. It has not given me satis- faction. I do think that this is a matter you should set right without delay. If I have erred, not having all the facts before me, you will please correct me. But, of course, this question stands on its own foot- ing.
 I have not interested myself in it. The students are not under my guidance. And I told those who came to me that I had no time to
 study their question, important though I admitted it to be.
 You say that drunkards and the like have sought imprisonment. My informants say that if such people have courted imprisonment they were unauthorized and had nothing to do with the State Con- gress.
I believe I have now covered all the points in your letter.
 If my argument has any substance in it, I repeat the request for the discharge of all the State Congress prisoners and for permission for the State Congress to pursue such activities, political or otherwise, that are constitutional.
I hope this finds you in the possession of the best of health.
 Yours sincerely,
 M. K. GANDHI

  January 	20, 1939  CHI. 	AMRITLAL,  	Kakasaheb’s letter was sent to you yesterday. Everyone here has 	been distressed to hear that you will have to go. Music that was 	consi- dered a permanent feature will now be discontinued. No one 	likes this idea. It also makes me unhappy. If your health permits, 	this is my suggestion. You should walk down at 6 in the morning 	every day after partaking of milk and fruit. You can easily be with 	Kakasaheb at 7.15. You can start work at 7.30 and go on till 5 or 	4.30 and reach Segaon at 6 or 6.30 every evening. If you can do 	this, both the purposes will be served. The exertion is not too much 	for a healthy man. In South Africa I lived at a distance of 7 miles 	from my office and used to go there and come back either on foot or 	on bicycle. But I do not wish to overburden you. Think it over. Show 	this letter to Kakasaheb and do 
 what is right. Think about other things having in mind that your decision to go to Kakasaheb is a firm one. I do not think that Kaka- saheb wants you with him all the 24 hours. But if it is so, the question does not arise. Or even if he desires you to tour with him, then also there is no question of doing any work in Segaon. I have written in the dim light.
Everything else must be going well."

  	I have just now received  your  letter.  Since  I  am  continuing my 	silence I can answer it. If the reason for stopping you is merely 	sentimental, then it is certainly better for you to go to South 	Africa. By your going there, Manilal will certainly be helped. You 	are worried about Sita. I am not. She will certainly learn at least 	something there also. Hence my opinion is this: if your services are 	not essential at Akola you may gladly go to South Africa. It is your 	duty. Since you have stayed on, write to Manilal and know his views. 	This is the right course. Does 	Sita read the book she has received?

568,"January 23, 1939",THE STATES,"
        
 The movement for liberty within the States is entering a new stage. History is going to repeat itself. Talcher and Dhenkanal have led the way in repression. It is no small matter that 26,000 out of 75,000 all told have migrated from Talcher to British Orissa. Prof. Ranga has published harrowing details of the sufferings of these refugees. His narrative is supported by Thakkar Bapa, the great social reformer and philanthropist, who responds to the call of distress no matter from what quarter it comes. They have been in exile for two months. I had hoped that they would have returned to their homes. But there seems to be no peace for these people as yet.
 It is not possible for Orissa alone to tackle the relief work. The Government of Orissa has not much money to spare. I hope that the Marwadi Relief Society will take up the relief work bearing in mind that labour should be found for the refugees.
Ranpur has murdered a  political  agent.libtech_519_footnotelibtech_520_footnoteAnd  the  police  and
 
 military are having a merry time at the expense of innocent men and women. I hope the Government of Orissa will firmly handle the situation and not let the Imperial Power deal with the situation as it chooses. The Imperial Power loses its head when it loses one of its own class in the circumstances attending the unfortunate murder of Major Bazalgette. This murder should show us that there is nothing to be gained by the people by such acts.
 Jaipur will not tolerate even the education of the Jaipurians to ask and fit themselves for responsible government and would prese- ntly bury alive one of its foremost sons.
 The advisers of the Thakore Saheb of Rajkot think nothing of making him eat his own words and commit a breach of his promise solemnly made to his people. The Resident of the Western States is party to this breach, if evidence in my possession is to be relied upon. To him the Congress and Sardar are anathema. Ground is being prepared in Rajkot for fomenting quarrels between Hindus and Mus- lims and the people in general and the Bhayats. None of these have hitherto quarrelled. It is to be hoped that the Muslims and the Bhayats will not prove enemies of their own deliverance. The reformers’ course is clear. They must avoid all clash. They must be prepared to die at the hands of their own people if the occasion arose. They have tried with marvellous success the weapon of non-violent non-co-ope- ration. They can enforce it fully and simply sit still. The people are the paymasters, and the Prince and the officials are their servants who have to do the will of their masters. This is literally true of an awakened and enlightened people who know the art of thinking and acting as of one mind.
 I would urge the people in the other States to hasten slowly. Liberty is theirs if they will have patience and self-restraint. Let them everywhere knit themselves together and have a consciousness of their strength. They should not have internal dissensions. They must know how to combat the maxim of irresponsibility—divide and rule. It is easy enough if the reformers master the technique of non-violence.
 Travancoreans had better be on their guard. I have sufficient evidence in my possession to show that attempts are being made to create divisions between Hindus and Christians and Ezhawas. If they are to have responsible government, they must forget that they are of these different communities. They must learn that they are one and indivisible political unit, and they must attain control over all forces of
 violence. They must take full responsibility for peace throughout Travancore without the aid of the police, if they are to win freedom through non-violent means. Meetings and processions are necessary for propaganda among ignorant masses. They are not necessary for a people awakened to a sense of their duty as citizens. Swaraj is for the awakened, not for the sleepy and the ignorant.

 My time and that of co-workers is largely taken up in wading through complaints about corruption among Congressmen. The latest typical letter received is from a Bombay Congressman:libtech_521_footnote
 Tripuri Congress delegates’ elections took place last Sunday in Bombay. The voting was to start at 8 a. m. in the morning. I reached Congress House at nearly 8.45 a. m., but to my consternation I found that I had already been impersonated in the short span of forty-five minutes. Scores of others had the same experience. I tried to trace the source, and though (as expected) I could not trace the miscreant I found that this impersonation business was regularly organized and practised on a mass scale as soon as the polling had started. Naturally those who came even half an hour late were disappointed, they having been impersonated meanwhile.
 Many suggestions have been made to you to abate this nuisance, but in my humble opinion unless we introduce the system of asking the prospective voters to produce their membership cards to be duly stamped by the issuing officers before slips are issued to them, nothing will do the trick . . . .
 The correspondent’s suggestion is quite sound. I should have thought that every voter had to produce an identification card before being allowed to register his vote.
 My purpose, however, in reproducing the correspondent’s letter is not merely to draw attention to the impersonation in Bombay and the method of dealing with it. The letter is a pointer. Besides imper- sonation there is the wholesale tampering with the Congress registers which contain bogus names. These registers have as much value as a box containing counterfeit coins though it is claimed to contain rupees. Strife at Congress elections is becoming a common occur- rence. The indiscipline of Congressmen is on the increase everywhere.
 
 Many of them make irresponsible, even violent, speeches. Many fail to carry out instructions. Bihar is a notable example. Kisans of Bihar are supposed to be Congressmen. Their leaders are Congress-men. Bihar Ministers live in perpetual dread of kisan risings and kisan marches. Only two days ago I had a wire from Khandesh of a contem-plated march to the Collector’s bungalow by kisans headed by a well known Congress worker. Such instances can be multiplied.
 Rome’s decline began long before it fell. The Congress, which has been nursed for over fifty years by the best brains of the country, will not fall the moment it has begun to decay. It need not fall at all, if the corruption is handled in time.
 In my opinion the greatest work before the Congress will be to deal with this fourfold process of decay. We are yet far from our goal. We shall be no nearer it if we are not sure of our means and their meaning and implications. When the real time comes we shall  be found wanting. If I was called upon to lead, say, an army of civil resisters, I should be unable to shoulder the burden. This is a big admission to make. But I should be guilty of cowardice and worse if I did not make it. Though there is non-violence enough among the masses, there is not enough among those who have to organize the masses. Even as a banker cannot run a bank if he has nothing in his chest, so can a general not lead a battle if he has no soldiers on whom he can rely implicitly.
 Let no Congressman blame me for thinking aloud. Though I am not in the Congress, I have not ceased to be of it. Congressmen still expect me to give the call when in my opinion the time for action has come. What is more, if God so wills it, I feel I have enough strength and energy in me to lead a battle much more strenuous than any I have fought. But there are Saharas in the way. I have mentioned one which Congressmen can see, touch and handle. The Congress would not be harmed by my having lifted the curtain and exposing our uglinesses to the public gaze. It would be harmed if knowing the truth I hid it from the public.
 Out of the present condition of the Congress I see nothing but anarchy and red ruin in front of the country. Shall we face the harsh truth at Tripuri?

 The much-travelled Miss Muriel Lester, my East End hostess during the Round Table days, who is in the Frontier Province at the time of writing this, having met Badshah Khan, thus writes of him:
 Now I have got to know Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, I feel there is not likely to be another such honour in my life so far as meeting wonderful people goes. He is an Old Testament prince with the New Testament gentleness. What a man of God ! Thank you for making it possible for us to know him.
 He is taking us tomorrow to Utmanzai. It will be a pleasure to see Mira again.
 I would not have published this private testimony if I  had thought it to be the exaggeration of an unbalanced mind. It is true that Muriel Lester readily sees the bright side of those whom she meets. It is not a fault but a virtue. There is no one without faults, not even men of God. They are men of God not because they are faultless but because they know their own faults, they strive against them, they do not hide them and are ever ready to correct themselves. Such is Khan Saheb who prides himself in calling himself a servant of God. He is a devout Muslim who never misses his prayers and fasts. His interpretation of the Koran is the most liberal I have known. He had to make a choice of one from among the workers whose services I had offered him for introducing spinning, etc., among Khudai Khidmat- gars. He deliberately chose Mirabai, Madeleine Slade. She was until recently living under the same roof as Khan Saheb and is now living in rooms adjoining Khan Saheb’s residence where she conducts her class. She writes to me almost daily. I am glad to be able to say that her letters, though she does not spare those whom she loves, bear out Muriel Lester’s first impression of this noble fakir. And yet  the English officials have no use for him. They fear him and distrust him.  I would not mind this distrust so much if it did not hamper progress, did not harm India and England and therefore the world.

571,"January 23, 1939",ISLAMIC CULTURE,"
        
 A great Muslim asked me what appeared to me strange ques- tions the other day. Strange, because I should have thought that every Muslim who knows me, and this great Muslim knew me, could answer them for me. Here is the dialogue:
 Q. Are you the same to Muslims now that you used to be in South Africa—their friend, father and guide?
 A. I never claimed the privilege of being father to them  or anyone in South Africa. But I certainly was their guide and friend. (I may state in passing that I was addressed as Bhai— brother—by them and others.) I am absolutely the same as I was in South Africa, twenty-four years ago. I regard Muslims like other Indians as blood brothers entitled to the same rights and privileges as any other Indian.
 Q. Then do you cherish their culture as you would cherish your own Hindu culture?
 A. Of course I do. I cannot do otherwise, as I believe Islam and other great religions to be as true as my own. India is the richer for the cultures that Islam and Christianity brought with them. I regard the present antagonisms as a passing phase.
 Q. Let me be plain. I do not believe in Akbar’s dream. He aimed at fusing all religions into one and producing a new faith. Do you have some such aim?
 A. I do not know what Akbar dreamt. I do not aim at any fusion. Each religion has its own contribution to make to human evolution. I regard the great faiths of the world as so many branches of a tree, each distinct from the other though having the same source.
 Q. I would like you to tell me what you mean by Hindustani. Do you favour a common dictionary ?
 A. I have anticipated you. I understand that Maulvi Abdul Haq Saheb has produced a dictionary which has taken all the Urdu words that are to be found in the Benares Hindi Lexicon and Hindi words from the Osmania Lexicon. I have recommended to the Congress the adoption of the Maulvi Saheb’s dictionary. And for new words have suggested a board composed of Maulana Abul Kalam Azad and Rajendra Babu.
 Q. What about the Border Tribes? You know they are being crushed under the British heel. Will you favour their relations with India being regulated by the Frontier Province?
 
 A. I would most decidedly. I have been moving in that direction. I have publicly stated more than once that India has to trust and befriend them and not regard them as her natural enemies. I have been trying to go in their midst myself and secure  the  same  permission for Badshah Khan.
 There were other questions also asked, but they are not of such public interest as the ones I have dealt with. And they are not matters of controversy so far as I know. I should like to add here that I have not lost my faith in communal unity. My life is still dedicated to it. Though a political pact has to come, it will never satisfy me without a heart unity. And a heart unity is inconceivable without non-violence as the basis of permanent friendship or brotherhood.

575,"January 	24, 1939",INTERVIEW TO “THE TIMES OF INDIA”,"
              BARDOLI, 
  January 	24, 1939  In 	reply to the correspondent’s question as to what Gandhiji meant by 	saying in the last week’s Harijan 	that an all-India 	crisis would occur if the Jaipur authorities persisted in 	prohibiting the entry of Seth Jamnalal Bajaj into the State,libtech_524_footnoteGandhiji replied:  	Seth Jamnalal is an all-India man, though a subject of Jaipur. He is 	also a member of the Congress Working Committee, and essentially and 	admittedly a man of peace. He is the president of an organization 	which has been working and has been allowed to work in Jaipur for 	some years. Its activities have always been open. It contains well- 	known workers who are sober by disposition and who have done much 	constructive work, both among men and women. There is at the head of 	affairs in Jaipur a distinguished politico-military officer. He is 	shaping the policy of the State in connection with the ban 	pronounced against Jamnalalji and his association, the Jaipur Rajya 	Praja Mandal. I     29-4-1939, 	6-5-1939 and 20-5-1939.  
 take it that Sir Beauchamp St. John, Prime Minister of Jaipur, would not be acting without at least the tacit approval of the Central autho- rity, without whose consent he could not become the Prime Minister of an important State like Jaipur.
 If the action of the Jaipur authorities precipitates a first class crisis, it is impossible for the Indian National Congress, and therefore all India, to stand by and look on with indifference whilst Jamnalalji, for no offence whatsoever, is imprisoned and members of the Praja Mandal are dealt with likewise. The Congress will be neglecting its duty if, having power, it shrank from using it and allowed the spirit of the people of Jaipur to be crushed for want of support from the Congress. This is the sense in which I have said that the example of Jaipur, or say Rajkot, might easily lead to an all-India crisis.
 The policy of non-intervention by the Congress was, in my opinion, a perfect piece of statesmanship when the people of the States were not awakened. That policy would be cowardice when there is all- round awakening among the people of the States and a determination to go through a long course of suffering for the vindication of their just rights. If once this is recognized, the struggle for liberty, wherever it takes place, is the struggle for all India. Whenever the Congress thinks it can usefully intervene, it must intervene.
 In answer to a further question how the Congress as an institution and the Congress Ministries in the various provinces were justified in precipitating a crisis on an issue which exclusively concerned a State, Gandhiji said:
 Supposing in a particular district in British India the Collector butchered the people of that district, is or is not the Congress justified in intervening and precipitating an all-India crisis? If the answer is ‘yes’, then it applies to Jaipur also for examining the conduct of the Congress in terms of intervention. If there had been no non-inter- vention resolution by the Congress, this question really would not have arisen. Therefore, unthinking people very often blame me for having said that constitutionally Indian States were foreign States. I do not accept that blame at all. I was wandering about in the States and I knew as a matter of fact that the people of the States were not ready.
 The moment they became ready, the legal, constitutional and artificial boundary was destroyed. This is a tremendous moral ques- tion. Constitutionalism, legality and such other things  are  good enough within their respective spheres, but they become a drag upon human progress immediately the human mind has broken these
 artificial bonds and flies higher. That is precisely what is happening before my eyes. Without any spur from any outside agency I saw at once that there must be intervention by the Congress of the type you see today. And it will go on from stage to stage, if the Congress remains the moral force that it has become—in other words, if the Congress lives up to its policy of non-violence.
 People say that I have changed my view, that I say today some- thing different from what I said years ago. The fact of the matter is that conditions have changed. I am the same. My words and deeds are dictated by prevailing conditions. There has been a gradual evolu-tion in my environment and I react to it as a satyagrahi.
 The correspondent next drew Gandhiji’s attention to recent developments in Rajkot and in Baroda, where the minorities were protesting against the Congress dictation. Gandhiji said in reply that he was unperturbed by those developments. He said:
 The movement for liberty cannot possibly be withdrawn or arrested because there are at the moment so-called communal splits. I see that history is repeating itself and the power that is losing ground is becoming desperate and fomenting trouble and dissension within, hoping to drag on its existence by means of these dissensions. If the people know how to work the non-violent technique, the powers that are acting in this manner will be confounded and the people will rise victorious.
 The Muslims in Rajkot, for instance, have everything to gain by the people of Rajkot securing liberty. They are today depending upon the sweet will, not of the Rulers, but of the advisers of the Rulers; tomorrow they will share power with the people because they are of the people. But I really do not believe that there is real Muslim opposition in Rajkot. They have enjoyed the best relations with the Hindus. I know this from personal experience myself. During the three months’ brief but brilliant struggle there was no dissension bet- ween the Hindus and the Muslims in Rajkot. Though many Mus-lims did not court imprisonment, the Muslims as a community remained at the back of the agitation.
 I really do not understand this unfortunate squabble in Baroda.  I am as yet too paralysed to get a full grasp of the situation. There again, what can Maharashtrians lose if there is self-rule in Baroda? They are powerful enough to assert themselves. It is not as if they will be crushed by the so-called Gujarati majority, and if the majority gets
 its share of the crumbs of office, that should not be a matter for non-participation by the Maharashtrians in the struggle for liberty. Hence, though I have not been able to fathom the bottom of this quarrel, I have no misgivings so long as the reformers remain non-violent and do not harbour any ill will against the Maharashtrians for their action. The question dwindles into insignificance so far as Baroda is concerned when it is remembered that against its population of 2,500,000 there are only a few thousands of Maharashtrians, mostly to be found in Baroda city itself.

 January 26, 1939
 DEAR LORD LINLITHGOW,
 Your clear reply of the 4th inst. in reply to mine of the 23rd ultimo emboldens me to bring to your notice certain happenings as I see them.
 In Orissa things seem to be worst.libtech_525_footnotePublic opinion there is not so strong as elsewhere and the most unfortunate murder of Major Bazal- gette in Ranpur has complicated the situation. The Orissa Government, as has been officially admitted, has rendered every assistance it could have. This unfortunate event apart, out of a total population of 75,000 souls in Talcher, 26,000 have been compelled by sufferings said to be indescribable to migrate to British Orissa.
 I feel that it is the clear duty of the Resident to see that the cause of this migration is investigated and redress given to the people.
 The Resident in Kathiawad, as far as I can see, has made the Thakore Saheb of Rajkot break his solemn pact with his people published in the form of an official Notification.libtech_526_footnote
The struggle has, therefore, been resumed in Rajkot.
 The British Prime Minister of Jaipur is said to have vowed to crush Seth Jamnalalji, a well-known banker, philanthropist and social reformer, and socio-political organization of which he is the Presidentlibtech_527_footnote. Their crime consists in aiming at responsible government
 
 in Jaipur under the aegis of the Maharaja.
 I take it that the Central Government cannot escape responsi- bility, if the information given herein is trustworthy.
 This means that the people of the States have to fight not only their rulers who by themselves cannot resist their people but they have also to combat the unseen and all too powerful hand of the Central authority.
 I venture to present this awful problem to you. I call it awful because I do not know how far it will commit both the Central autho- rity and the Congress which has a moral duty by the people of the States. I can understand the treaty obligations of the Paramount Power to protect States against danger from without and anarchy within. Is not the corollary equally true, that if the States suppress their people, the latter have also to be protected by the Paramount Power? Can a State suppress free speech, meetings and the like, and expect the Para- mount Power to help it in doing so, if the afflicted people carry on a non-violent agitation for the natural freedom to which every human being in decent society is entitled ?
 I do not expect any reply to my letter unless there is anything to tell me. I know how every moment of your time is occupied. It is enough for me to know, as I do know, that my letters receive your personal attention.
 I remain, Yours sincerely,
 M. K. GANDHI

Do not forget the 	purport of your first letter. You wanted that H. should give  up 	women’s education. That has been done. To do anything more is 	cruelty. Your purpose is served. I do not hold you guilty. You 	wanted such justice from me, did you not ? If I hand over the papers 	to Jamnalalji and others and if they hold you guilty, will you 	accept the verdict? Are you so foolish? But that is the meaning of 	your letter. You write that you will accept the verdict if they hold 	you guilty. This statement lacks wisdom. When I have acquitted you, 	what more is there for you to do? But I have done more for you. I 	pronounced you not guilty and made H. give up Dakshinamurti and 	women’s edu- cation. What more would you gain by making him accept 	his guilt? A prisoner is punished but he is never forced to confess 	the guilt. You are really exhibiting your foolishness. Have you or 	have you not given me the right to call you foolish? Write your 	reply with an easy mind. If you insist, I shall certainly give 	trouble to Jamnalalji and others. I 	advise you to forget about H. and absorb yourself in your 
 work. If you do not find the food suitable, cook yourself. It will take 15 minutes in a cooker.

 You will have received my letter. Your question is pertinent. But the solution is not to be found in what happened. We must find out why it happened. There is plenty of violence in the Aryan League. Who will counteract it? The substance of what you say is that the Muslims are more given to the gospel of violence. What is the non- violent person to do when two violent parties fight? When he is power- less to do anything he should pray, keep away from the conflict and seek for an opportunity to sacrifice himself.
 About The Hindustan Times you should speak to Devdas.
 The newspapers here do not contain any news of the riot. Was there anything in The Statesman?
 I have not read the letter to Kripalani. I gave it to Pyarelal to forward to him.

582,"January 	26, 1939","SPEECH AT MEETING
OF PEASANTSlibtech_528_footnote","
               BARDOLI, 
  January 	26, 1939  	I went through the resolutions you have passed before coming here. 	Let me congratulate both the parties on it. Sardar has said that you 	have passed these resolutions with God as your witness. You have 	already had some experience of what happens when a man breaks his 	vow. I do hope that you will fully adhere to these resolutions. 	Quite often, when people do not make such resolutions of their own 	accord, law compels them to do so, which carries with it some kind 	of punish- ment. It is a good thing that you have passed these 	resolutions of your own free will. It is not an ordinary thing that 	the Dublas have ceased to be serfs and have become free. Of course, 	these resolutions gave me an impression that the peasants in this 	part are big businessmen for, through these resolutions they have 	indeed struck a big bargain. What is so great about paying fair 	daily wages to the Dublas for the full quota of work whereas 	formerly they were made to work as much as the owners desired? I am 	not greatly impressed by it. According to me, any man or woman must 	get the minimum wage of 8 annas for 8 hours of work. God willing, 	such conditions will be created in my lifetime. You may find 8 annas 	a big thing; but it really is not so big. But you have fixed 3 annas 	as the wages for a woman labourer, where- as  you will take the same 	amount of  work from her. Do  you think     (1) 	Every Hali to 	be emancipated, the 	wages from 26th January 	1939 to be as. 	4/6 (for males) 	and as. 3/- (for 	females); (2) 	every Hali 	who has worked on 	his master’s farm for twelve years or more is automatically free from all his debts to him;  (3) 	such Halis as 	may have worked for 	less than twelve years to 	have credited to 	their account 	a twelfth of the debt for every year that they have worked; (4) an 	anna per day   to 	be deducted from the wage, in the case of men, until the debt is 	repaid; (5) everyone   to be declared free from debt on expiry of 12 years, whether the debt be paid or not;  (6) 	every debt to expire with the debtor’s life; (7) a Dubla may 	engage himself on an annual wage of Rs. 80, and Rs. 15 may be 	deducted from his wage for repayment of a debt due if any; (8) a 	village committee to be appointed to settle all questions pertaining 	to debts. 
 those people will run away from you? Hence, even while congratu- lating you, I tell you that you have struck a bargain.
 I would like to insist that you should not take the resolution too literally. Do not think that you can never pay more than 4_ annas and 3 annas. The very fact that you have made them free implies that they are free to work wherever they choose and earn the wages they can. The great significance of this resolution is that they will remain where they are and your relations will be pure. The fact that a Dubla ceases to be a serf and becomes a ploughman does not mean that the farmer will not plough the land. The plough will belong to the farmer and the Dubla will use it for him. But the real ploughman, in fact, is the tiller of the land and the ideal condition will be that in which both the farmer and the serf become ploughmen. Further, the resolution does not mean that even when it has been a good year and there are  bumper crops you will pay only 4_ annas as wages. If you do so, I would say that you have not carried out your resolution.
 You had taken the great vow of independence in 1921. You have not yet fulfilled the major part of it. What you have done now should have been done in 1921. This means that you delayed what should have been done many years ago. Nevertheless, I congratulate you as this is a meritorious act.
 Agriculture is our basic occupation. But we are not very good agriculturists, because our farming does not keep us busy throughout the year. Nor does it give us enough to eat. That is why I have described the charkha as Annapurna and praise it even today as much as I did formerly. Hence, if the farmers want to make progress, they will have to supplement their income by taking to the charkha. Thus you should devote all your free time to the charkha.
 I hope the resolutions will be implemented by both the parties. [From Gujarati]

 I am puzzled. I did not say no. I only  explained  my predicament. You made the suggestion and I accepted it. You are so unpredictable. If you are not worried over the lack of my contact but only about the refusal from Maulana, why is the letter so full of that topic? But I do not wish to get into an argument with you. There is no need for you to go to Mridula.
 Blessings from

FOR JAMNALAL BAJAJlibtech_530_footnote","
             BARDOLI,  January 	28, 1939  	The Prime Minister of Jaipur is reported to have vowed to crush the 	Jaipur Rajya Praja Mandal and me. In pursuance of that policy I have 	been put out of harm’s way as they may think. Presently the same 	fate will overtake the members of the Mandal. But if we are true to 	ourselves and our self-imposed trust, though our bodies may be 	imprisoned or otherwise injured, our spirits shall be free.  	As I go into enforced silence let me reiterate what we are figh- 	ting for. Our goal is responsible government under the Maharaja but 	our civil disobedience has not been taken up so as to influence the 	Durbar to grant us responsible government. Civil disobedience is 	aimed at asserting the elementary right that belongs to all 	societies, to speak and write freely, to assemble in meetings, to 	take out proces- sions, to form associations, etc., so long as these 	activities remain non- violent. We have been forced to resort to 	civil disobedience because this elementary right has been denied to 	us. The moment this right is restored civil disobedience should be 	withdrawn.  	Hence there is no question as yet of mass civil disobedience or a 	no-tax campaign. Seeing 	that the Mandal has been virtually declared an illegal    
 body, let us regard our existing register to be abrogated. A  new register should be opened if possible within the State and without if necessary. Those only will become members who know that there is risk today even in becoming members of the Mandal. It is to be hoped, however, that there will be a large number of Jaipurians living within the State or without who will become members of the Mandal and thus at least show their disapproval of the ban.
 The names, addresses and occupations of these members will be registered and published from time to time.
 The affairs of the Mandal will in my absence be managed by  .  .  .libtech_531_footnotelibtech_532_footnoteand they will exercise all the powers of the Mandal and the President as if the constitution was in operation. This council of five will have the right to substitute others in their respective places. In all matters of civil disobedience the council will whenever necessary seek and be guided by the advice of Gandhiji.

588,"January 28, 1939","DISCUSSION WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF MUNICIPALITIES
				AND LOCAL BOARDSlibtech_533_footnote","
        
 BARDOLI,
 January 28, 1939
 The first question they asked related to the question of taxation:
 The Congress is pledged to the policy of reducing the burden of taxation. Yet when Congressmen enter the local boards and municipalities, they required more money for carrying out their programme of beneficent municipal activity. How can this be done without fresh taxation which the people naturally dislike? How is the dilemma to be solved?
 A. If I were a tax-payer within the jurisdiction of a local board or a municipality, I would refuse to pay a single pie by way of addi- tional taxation and advise others to do likewise unless the money we pay is returned fourfold. Those who enter local boards and munici- palities as people’s representatives go there not to seek honour or to indulge in mutual rivalries, but to render a service of love, and that does not depend upon money. Ours is a pauper country. If our
 
 municipal councillors are imbued with a real spirit of service, they will convert themselves into unpaid sweepers, Bhangis and road-makers, and take pride in doing so. They will invite their fellow-councillors, who may not have come on the Congress ticket, to join them, and if they have faith in themselves and their mission, their example will not fail to evoke response. This means that a municipal councillor has to be a whole-timer. He should have no axe of his own to grind. The next step would be to map out the entire adult population within the jurisdiction of the municipality or the local board. All should  be asked to make their contribution to municipal activity. A regular register should be maintained. Those who are too poor to make any money contribution but are able-bodied and physically fit, can be asked to give their free labour. Real India consists not of a few big cities and our Presidency towns, but of seven lakhs of villages. It is there that the real problems of India have to be faced and solved. We require better roads, better sanitation, better drinking water supply for our villages.
 We shall never be able to get through even a fraction of this stupendous work if we proceed on a money basis. But India has an inexhaustible reserve of manpower. If we can mobilize that, we can transform the entire look of the country in an incredibly short time.
 And the charkha is a means par excellence for effecting this mobilization of our labour resources. It is a natural symbol of non-violence too, which is the soul of all voluntary life-giving corpo- rate activity. The popularization of the charkha thus has a definite place in any scheme of municipal work, whether it relates to the liqui- dation of rural unemployment and the consequent penury and appa- lling conditions of existence under which vast sections of our rural population live, or whether it refers to the amelioration of slum life that is the shame of our big cities.
 But this presupposes a living faith in the charkha, a faith that should lead to an intelligent study and mastering of the science of spinning and its allied processes. As it is, we today love to kill our time by going to cinemas and picture houses or even in idle talk. Pursuits of making money without work interest us, but not the charkha. Yet it is my faith that we shall advance towards our goal of non-violence to the extent we succeed in universalizing the charkha.
 By following the plan of work outlined above, we shall be able to return to the ratepayers whatever taxes they may have paid,
 multiplied manifold, in the form of vastly improved services and municipal amenities, and they will not grudge the levying of addi- tional taxes, too, should that become necessary.
 A member of the Jambusar Municipality asked: “In our municipality there are 17 members, out of whom eight have been returned on the Congress ticket, the remaining nine are non-Congress. They can always outvote us and thwart our plans. What should we do?”
 G. That should present no problem. If they want to proceed in the orthodox style and fill up their time with speechifying and so on and so forth, you need not imitate them, or waste your time like them; you may just put in your appearance at these meetings, but need not waste your time by taking part in idle controversy.  Instead,  you should occupy all your time with useful service of the ratepayers, by yourself wielding the bucket and the broom, by working with the spade and the basket, by nursing and rendering medical aid to the sick and ailing, and by teaching the ratepayers who are illiterate, and their children, to read and write. As a result, two things may happen. Either your opponents will be infected by your example and will align themselves with you and there will be an end to all controversy. Or the ratepayers will learn to know the sheep from the goats, and at the next election all the seventeen seats will be filled by Congressmen. That is the non-violent way of liquidating opposition. It eliminates all conflict and clash and makes our way clear irrespective of what the other party may or may not do.
 Q. Since in many places in Gujarat the National Week is being observed by inviting the people to take part in rural uplift or municipal service work, would it not be desirable to alter the dates of the celebration so that the week should fall within the bright phase of the moon? This will enable mass operations to continue even after nightfall and economize lighting.
 A. A multitude of calendars are at present in vogue in different parts of the country. But for a national celebration it is desirable to follow a calendar which is universal. If your civic zeal is not a vain show, beginning and ending with the National Week, you will have a series of municipal service weeks in addition to the National Week. The dates for these weeks in each place can be fixed according to the requirement of the activity suited to that particular place.
 “Which form of taxation is better for municipal purposes, direct or indirect?” asked a city father from Surat.
 G. Indirect taxation is found to be more popular with the ratepayers, because its incidence is not directly felt. But the direct
 taxation has more educative value and will be found more handy when the object is to make the ratepayers municipal-minded.
 A friend from Kheda District complained: “We would like to introduce the Wardha scheme of basic education in the primary schools run by local boards. The local bodies are willing, but the Inspectorate and the higher officials of the Education Department are still old-fashioned in their outlook. They have not developed faith in the Wardha principles. How shall we circumvent this handicap ?”
G. That does not surprise me. I should be surprised if the higher
 educational authorities developed faith in the Wardha scheme of education all at once. Faith will follow experience. In the mean time all I can say is that where there is a will there is a way. I do not think there is any legal difficulty in the way of the Education Minister instructing his Director of Public Instruction to help, in every possible way, those who might wish to give effect to the Wardha scheme of education. The C. P. Ministry has not found any difficulty in making the Education Department to fall into line with them. But if a legal or technical difficulty is discovered, it can be removed in a legal way.
 Q. In our schemes for adult education, should the aim be to promote the spread of literacy or to impart ‘useful knowledge’? What about the education of women?
A. The primary need of those who are come of age and are
 following an avocation, is to know how to read and write. Mass illiteracy is India’s sin and shame and must be liquidated. Of course, the literacy campaign must not begin and end with a knowledge of the alphabet. It must go hand in hand with the spread of useful know- ledge. But municipal bodies should beware of trying to ride  two  horses at a time, or else they are sure to come a cropper.
 As for illiteracy among the women, its cause is not mere laziness and inertia as in the case of men. A more potent cause is the status of inferiority with which an immemorial tradition has unjustly branded her. Man has converted her into a domestic drudge and an instrument of his pleasure, instead of regarding her as his helpmate and better half ! The result is a semi-paralysis of our society. Woman has rightly been called the mother of the race. We owe it to her and to ourselves to undo the great wrong that we have done her.
 “You have expressed varying opinions on certain subjects at different times,” asked a friend from Kapadwanj, Kheda Dist. “These are sometimes exploited by our opponents to oppose our current policies. What should we do under these circums- tances?”
G. The contradiction in these cases is only in appearance and
 easily capable of being reconciled. A safe rule to follow would be that the latest utterance, in order of time, should be given precedence over all the previous ones. But no utterance of mine, whether late or early, need bind you if it does not appeal to your heart and head. That would not mean that my standpoint was wrong. But it would be wrong to accept a standpoint which you cannot appreciate or assimilate.
 Q. How to deal with people who commit nuisance by using any and every place for evacuations? They defend the practice on the ground that it is enjoined by their religion. Again, how to cope with the nuisance of flies, mosquitoes, rabid dogs and monkeys, etc.? Their extermination is objected to by some on the ground of ahimsa.
 A. With regard to the first, there are two ways of dealing with the problem—the apparently violent, and the non-violent. You can enforce the penalty of law against those who may infringe the laws of sanitation. I have used the word ‘apparent’ advisedly. Religious free- dom, like liberty, becomes licence when it is indulged in at  the  expense of the health and safety of others, or in contravention of the principles of decency or morality. If you want to claim unrestricted and absolute liberty for yourselves, you must choose to retire from society and take to solitude. I call the practice of making evacuations anywhere and everywhere, regardless of the health and convenience of others, a travesty of ahimsa. Where there is filth, whether physical or moral, there is no ahimsa.
 The other way is to seek out the religious heads of the sects that indulge in these insanitary practices and to try to touch their heart and reason by patient argument.
 As for the nuisance of flies, mosquitoes, street dogs and monkeys, etc., I in my individual capacity may choose to put up with it, but society as a whole cannot afford to do so if it at all wants to exist. These pests are a result of our misdeeds. If I feed the monkeys in a public place and thereby make life impossible for others, it is I who commit himsa, and society will have no choice but to exterminate the pest that my himsa has created. The criterion of ahimsa is the mental attitude behind an act, not the mechanical act by itself. A citizen who lets loose pests on others by indulging in a mistaken humanitarian sentiment is guilty of himsa.
 Shrimati Mridulabehn Sarabhai, who is a keen social worker and founder of the Jyoti Sangh, an institution for the uplift and emancipation of women at Ahmedabad, put Gandhiji a few leading questions on the position of women in society: “The awakening of civil and political consciousness among Indian women has created a
 conflict between their traditional domestic duties and their duty towards society. If a woman engages in public work, she may have to neglect her children  or  her  household. How is the dilemma to be solved?”
 Basing his reply on a celebrated text of the Gita, Gandhiji remarked that it was
 always wrong to run after the ‘distant scene’ to the neglect of the more immediate duties that might have accrued to one naturally. Neglect of present duty was the way to destruction. The question was whether it is a woman’s duty to devote all her time to domestic work. More often than not a woman’s time is taken up not by the performance of essential domestic duties but in catering for the egoistic pleasure of her lord and master and for her own vanities.
 G. To me this domestic slavery of women is a symbol of our barbarism. In my opinion the slavery of the kitchen is a remnant of barbarism mainly. It is high time that our womankind was freed from this incubus. Domestic work ought not to take the  whole  of a woman’s time.
 MRIDULABEHN: At the elections your Congressmen expect all manner of help from us, but when we ask them to send out their wives and daughters to join us in public work, they bring forth all sorts of excuses and want to keep them close prisoners within the four domestic walls. What remedy do you suggest?
 G. Send the names of all such antediluvian fossils to me for publication in Harijan.

 VARAD,
  	[January 29, 1939]libtech_536_footnoteThere can be no two opinions that this is an auspicious 	occasion. There was a time when we were faced with confiscation of 	our lands  	and when they were actually confiscated we declared times without 	number in our speeches that the Government would not be able to 	retain them, that they would be returned to the owners. And now 	these lands have been returned. Do not think that we have been able 	to get them back by our ceaseless efforts. You would be making a 	great mistake if you thought so. We have succeeded to the extent we 	adh- ered to truth and non-violence. Chitta Patellibtech_537_footnoteremained firm and never came to Varad. He therefore 	completely fulfilled his pledge. It is not that Chittabhai alone had 	taken such a pledge. India abounds in such men and it is owing to 	their merit alone that we have got back our lands.  	But we must know how to lose them again should an occasion arise. To 	believe that restoration of lands means that we have won swaraj or 	that we have become fit for it is to commit a sin. It suggests that 	for winning swaraj we have to tread the path which we have trodden 	so far. Let us not delude ourselves that nothing remains for us to 	do now. If we play the game guided by self-interest and pecuniary 	motives, we are bound to lose. I wish to warn you that a greater 	ordeal is yet to come.libtech_538_footnote  	Let us in all humility pray to God that He may bless us with 	strength a hundredfold of that which He has bestowed on us up to 	now, so that we may be able to stand more fiery ordeals. We have had 	the courage to go to jail, to lose our homes and lands. Let us now 	pray for the courage to go to the scaffold cheerfully or to become 	ashes in a consuming fire. When we have exhibited that courage, 	swaraj will be ours, and no one dare rob us of it. But if we forget 	the lesson today, we shall lose the battle and be bankrupt. I hope 	and pray that none of us may be found wanting when the supreme test 	comes.  Harijanbandhu, 	26-2-1939, and Harijan, 	18-2-1939
